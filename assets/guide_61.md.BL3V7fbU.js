It fosters research in computational complexity theory, and is typically held annually between mid-May and mid-July in North America or Europe. As of 2015, CCC is organized independently by the Computational Complexity Foundation (CCF).  History  CCC was first organized in 1986 under the name \\"Structure in Complexity Theory Conference\\" (Structures) with support from the US National Science Foundation. The conference was sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing from 1987-2014. In 1996, the conference was renamed the \\"Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity\\", hence establishing the current acronym \\"CCC\\". In 2014, a movement towards independence and open access proceedings led to the establishment of the Computational Complexity Foundation (CCF).Computational Complexity Foundation (CCF) Since 2015, CCF organizes the conference independently under the name Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), and publishes open access proceedings via LIPIcs.Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) Future and past conference websites, as well as past programs and call for papers, are archived online.  Scope  CCC broadly targets research in computational complexity theory. This currently includes (but is not limited to) the study of models of computation ranging from deterministic to quantum to algebraic, as well as resource constraints such as time, randomness, input queries, etc.  Logistics  CCC is annually held between mid-May and mid-July, with a scientific program running approximately three days. The conference is composed of a single-track. Activities in addition to the scientific program typically include an opening reception, a rump session, and a business meeting.  Awards  CCC annually confers up to two awards: A \\"Best Student Paper Award\\", aimed at papers authored solely by students, and (since 2001) a \\"Best Paper Award\\", given to the most outstanding paper at the respective year's conference.

Joining Doctors Without Borders, she later helped found Doctors of the World, participating in medical missions in Africa and the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Simultaneously, she worked as a physician, practicing at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital and the Maternal-Infant Protection Service in Seine-Saint-Denis. In 1990, she returned to Poland and began an association \\"Nobody's Children\\" to fight against child abuse in Poland. She was the recipient of numerous awards and honors. Early life Alina Margolis was born on 18 April 1922 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland to the Jewish physician and her husband, , who was also a physician. Anna was the director of the radiology department and chief of the tubercular service division of Anna Maria Hospital. Aleksander, also known by the pseudonym Pawe≈Ç Gart, was an internist and head of the Municipal General Hospital of Radogoszcz and a member of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ City Council, until he was executed by the Gestapo in 1939. After his death, the family was relocated to the Warsaw Ghetto, to await transport to Treblinka. Anna managed to enroll Alina in the Jewish School of Nursing founded by Lama Blum-Bielica and she worked in one of the hospitals in the ghetto. When transport became imminent, Anna left the ghetto with the children, all of them posing as Aryan. Anna placed her son in a Christian orphanage and she went into hiding. Margolis hid with a Polish family who were anti-Semitic and who believed that she was the daughter of a Polish officer who was a prisoner of war. She worked as a courier for the Resistance and continued nursing in ghetto, becoming an integral part of the rescue efforts following the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The insurgency lasted three weeks and consisted mostly of Jewish youth, led by a five-person command. One of the commanders, Marek Edelman, was the sole survivor of the leadership. When German troops burned the ghetto, Edelman attempted escape by way of the sewer system. Underground members, disguising themselves as Polish Red Cross workers, carried him out of the ghetto on a stretcher. One of the stretcher- bearers was Margolis. To ensure that no one would investigate too closely, the underground posted a sign on Edelman's body declaring him to have typhus, easily passing armed checkpoints. Before the war ended, Margolis and Edelman returned to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and were joined when the war ended, by her mother and brother, John. In mid-1945, Margolis and Edelman married, moved to the house which her family had occupied before the war and she began her medical studies. Career Completing her education, Margolis-Edelman became a pediatrician, working in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Pediatric Clinic. She specialized in diseases of the kidney and juvenile diabetes, establishing a clinic in RƒÖbka. She conducted research into these diseases and published her findings. In 1951, Margolis-Edelman had her son Alexander and five years later, gave birth to the couples' daughter, Anna. In the midst of preparing for her habilitation, the 1968 Polish political crisis unleashed a new wave of antisemitism and Margolis-Edelman was not allowed to defend her thesis. She and her children fled to France, but her husband remained in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, providing humanitarian services to anyone in need. Unable to convince the French university to accept her Polish degree, she began her studies all over again and worked in a laboratory analyzing the blood of rats to earn a living. After five years of study, Margolis-Edelman re-earned her ability to practice medicine and became head of the chemistry department where she worked and practicing pediatrics at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. She also worked in the Maternal-Infant Protection Service in Seine-Saint-Denis, as well as serving the communes of Aubervilliers and La Courneuve. In 1978, she began working with Doctors Without Borders, on hospital ships with Vietnamese boat people, work that was later officially recognized by the Vietnamese government. When Bernard Kouchner left the organization, he and Margolis- Edelman co-founded Doctors of the World. She participated in medical missions to such places as Afghanistan, Chad, El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon, and Nicaragua. During the 1981-1983 period of martial law in Poland, Margolis- Edelman supported the pro-democracy opposition. She organized internships abroad for Polish doctors, helped those who could not obtain treatment in Poland, and sent drugs and supplies to Polish hospitals, which were unable to obtain them at the time. She helped found the Franco-Polish association \\"SOS Aide aux Malades Polonais\\", to assist Poles in obtaining treatment in France. Around the same time, she served as president of the Literary Notebook Association () and established the quarterly magazine Zeszyty Literackie in Paris. In 1990, she returned to Poland and established an organization called Nobody's Children to care for victims of child abuse and lobby for their protection. During the Bosnian War, she co-founded a rape victim support center and a center in Saint Petersburg to care for street children. In 1994, Margolis-Edelman wrote a memoir about her pre-war and World War II experiences, Ala z Elementarza (later translated to English in 1998, as Ala from the Primer). The title was a reference of an earlier work by Marian Falski. As children, Margolis and her brother inspired Falski to write a widely-read early reading primer about two children, Ala and Olek. The title of Margolis-Edelman's memoir, referred to the earlier work‚Äôs characters. In 1997, Margolis-Edelman published another memoir, entitled Je ne le r√©p√©terai pas, je ne veux pas le r√©p√©ter (I will not repeat it, I do not want to repeat it). She was awarded the Cross of Valor for her humanitarian work and a knighthood by the Order of the Smile. Death and legacy Margolis-Edelman died on 23 March 2008 in Paris and was buried in the Cimeti√®re parisien de Bagneux. A symbolic gravesite was placed as a memorial to her at the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw. In 2010, a documentary, The Girl From A Reading Primer, directed by Edyta Wr√≥blewska and produced by Studio Filmowe Kalejdoskop, detailing Margolis-Edelman's life was released. In 2011, an award named in her honor was established to recognize those who work to protect children.

The firm of Ustonson went on to become Royal Warrant holders to three successive British monarchs. Early life Onesimus Ustonson was born in April 1736 in Aldenham, Hertfordshire, the son of Thomas Ustonson, a tailor, of St Giles in the Fields, London. Career In 1749, Ustonson was apprenticed for seven years to John Herro, a fishing tackle maker and owner of the Fish and Crown at 48 Bell Yard, Temple Bar, a narrow street between Carey Street and Fleet Street. He took over the business in 1760 and opened his shop in 1761. The firm remained a market leader for the next century. In 1770, Ustonson invented the first multiplying reel, and supplied fishing tackle to the naturalist Joseph Banks for the second voyage of James Cook, 1772‚Äì1775.

The HIBG is a popular tourist destination in the Annapolis Valley, and provides a space where nature and science meet to enhance education, and conservation of the environment. The garden consists of nine native habitats of the Acadian Forest Region, a Medicinal and Food Garden, Conservatory, Formal Walled Garden, and Experimental Garden. The HIBG is also the trail head for 1.5 km of woodland trails. The Harriet Irving Botanical Garden is connected to the K.C Irving Environmental Centre (KCIC) which provides the public and Acadian students with state-of-the-art laboratories, greenhouses, and controlled environmental facilities. The HIBG and K.C Irving centre play host to many educational and recreational programs for the public, hold seminars on various topics and facilitate conferences and meetings. The staff of the HIBG act as coordinators for PlantWatch, a national program which encourages youth and members of the community to report blooming times of selected plants to help track global warming and other ecological activities.  History  The HIBG and KCIC were gifted to Acadia University by the Irving family on September 14, 2002. The Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens are named after Kenneth Colin Irving 's wife, Harriet Irving. The gardens were designed by architect Alex Novell and construction began in the fall of 1999. It was the intention of the Irving family to create a space that would be conducive to the interaction of ideas from students, faculty, and the community. The emblem of the gardens features a mayflower; the official flower of Nova Scotia, as well as Harriet Irving's favorite flower, a honey bee representing hard work, and the scotch thistle symbolizing Scotland from where the Irving family originated, as well as the country Nova Scotia is named after. The gates of the HIBG opened on September 14, 2002, and is open to the public free of admission due to the K.C Irving Environmental Trust. The funding of the HIBG is provided by the K.C. Irving Environmental Trust as well as donors ranging from individual students to some of Canada's largest corporations.  Attractions  The Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens consists of six acres divided into nine unique habitats of the Acadian Forest Region. The native plants are labelled with their botanical name and common name. Like all botanical gardens, the HIBG maintains a collection consisting of native plants to the Acadian Forest for conservational, educational, and scientific reasons. The HIBG have three living specimens of endangered species that are protected under the Nova Scotia Endangered Species Act. The Pink coreopsis (Coreopsis rosea), Water- pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata), and Thread-leaved Sundew (Drosera filiformis) are all on display at the gardens to help educate future generations on the importance of environmental conservation and facilitate further research into the conservation of these species. As visitors travel through the gardens they pass through a walled garden, experimental garden, medicinal garden, deciduous woodland, freshwater inland marsh, bog, coastal headlands, mixed woodlands, calcareous woodlands, wet woodlands, sand barrens, coniferous woodland, and finish in the conservatory which leads to the KCIC. The arrangement of the habitats allows for explorers of the garden to experience the natural habitats of the Acadian Forest without the lengthy travel to different locations around the province. An article in the local paper, The Grapevine gives descriptions of interesting events and updates to the gardens regularly. Each spring the volunteers of the HIBG hold a native plant sale to encourage the integration of native plants into gardens. Seeds are collected from the plant materials in the garden, propagated and sold each year to support the volunteer group and conservations efforts. = Walled Garden = The tall iron gates lead into this garden which is designed as a typical English garden with the exception of utilizing all native plants to the Acadian forest. The plants are pruned to conform to the symmetrical aspects of the traditional English garden style. Ten foot brick walls surround the garden on the West and South side creating a microclimate that provides an early spring to visitors. This garden complements the formal Georgian-style architecture of the K.C. Irving Environmental Science Centre with the picturesque landscape of the Acadian Forest Region. Visitors can sit around a sandstone fountain pool in the centre of the garden while enjoying the encompassing native high-bush blueberry plants. In the spring the serviceberry shrubs bloom when the shad fish run. Harriet Irving's favorite flower can be seen in bloom in late April in the bordering flower beds. = Experimental Garden = After passing through the walled garden, visitors can view the experimental gardens from the west pavilion. There are several sunken plant beds with eight different representative soil types which host many research projects. This garden allows for plants to be kept on a long term basis and be exposed to the seasonal changes of the Maritime climate. Plants are stored here before being planted into the gardens, or utilized is research and conservation projects. Access is restricted to the public, however they are welcome to peak in at the ongoing research conducted in this area. = Medicinal Garden = In this area a collection of plants used by indigenous peoples and early European settlers can be viewed. This is the only area of the garden which displays non-indigenous species to the Acadian Forest Region. However, many of these plants escaped early homesteads and have become naturalized in the region. A white cedar hedge surrounds the garden, and two rows of linden trees create a pleached hedge along the pathway. Interpretive signs are displayed throughout the garden explaining the early uses of the medicinal and food plants displayed. = Deciduous Woodlands = The deciduous woodlands are characterized by broad-leaved hardwood trees and associated shade-tolerant plants. The soil is rich in organic matter and neutral in pH. Ferns are predominant in the understory and the ostrich fern can be found providing fiddle heads in the spring. Deciduous woodlands are home to a variety of insects and fauna. = Bog = An artificial bog has been created to demonstrate a mossy, peat-covered wetland. Plants such as the Pitcher plant, can be witnessed growing in this area of the HIBG. Plants that thrive in bogs are adapted to nutrient poor, acidic soil. \\"Other plants include bog laurel, leatherleaf, white-fringed orchid, rose pogonia, grass-pink, bog huckleberry, dragon‚Äôs-mouth, as well as bunchberry, goldthread, starflowers, reindeer moss, beak-rush, liverwort, bulrush, lichens, chokecherry, sedges and cottongrass\\". = Freshwater Inland Marsh = In this area of the garden, visitors can admire a man-made pond which is host to many of the native species of plants including cattails, water-lilies, and arrowheads. Freshwater Inland Marshes are important ecosystems for water fowl. If lucky, visitors may see a pair of migratory mallard ducks who come to the pond each spring. = Coastal Headlands = Across from the freshwater inland marsh, are the coastal headlands which represent one of the most unique habitats of the Acadian Forest Region, and are in danger of disappearing due to the development of coastal areas. Plants growing in this area have little to no soil, and are exposed to salt spray from the Atlantic Ocean. From the oval lawn which divides the coastal headlands and freshwater inland marsh, an herbaceous bank can be admired which is decorated with native plants that provide colorful blossoms through the spring, summer and fall seasons. These plants are a great representation of plants that can be integrated into home gardens to provide native pollinators a good source of nectar and habitat. Examples of such plants include Turtlehead (Chelone glabra), Joe-Pye Weed (Eupatorium maculatum), and Brown Eyed-Susans (Rudbeckia hirta). = Mixed Woodlands = This habitat consists of both coniferous and deciduous trees, and defines the Acadian Forest Region. = Calcareous Woodlands = An alkaline, gypsum-based soil characterizes this habitat and are often lush in growth with many native orchids to the Acadian Forest Region. = Wet Woodlands = A wide variety of plants and animals call areas with high water tables home. This forest is associated with the later succession stages of marshes and have been drastically reduced in the Acadian Forest Region due to development and urbanization of forested areas. = Sand Barrens = This habitat was created by receding glaciers during the last Ice Age and includes stretches of windblown sand and silt deposits. It is dominated by low shrub species, and a few stunted tree species. = Coniferous Woodlands = The final habitat demonstrated at the HIBG is composed of needle-bearing trees. Coniferous woodlands are dark due to the dense canopy. This habitat is home to many mushrooms and other important decomposers in the food chain.  K.C Irving Environmental Centre  After a tour through the HIBG guests can observe the centre which features a cafe and large sitting area. The centre provides an innovative space for students, researchers, and faculty to conduct important studies in ecology and conservation. In the basement of the centre the E.C Smith Herbarium can be found. The herbarium contributes to research and conservation of native plants by providing information relating to geographic distribution, flowering and fruiting dates, habitat preferences and other information related to botanical research. A seed and tissue bank for native plants of the Acadian Forest Region is also being developed in the centre for the preservation of biodiversity and propagation of threatened species.

The IMF has been involved in Tanzania's economy since the 1970s. Over the years, there have been roughly three stages of the IMF's involvement in Tanzania: the first round of reform lasted from 1986 to 1995, the second round of reform lasted from 1996 to 2006, and the third round focused mainly on consolidating the reforms made from previous stages. The agricultural economy depended on by Tanzania was constantly declining since the 1970s.Nord, Sobolev, Dunn, Hajdenberg, Hobdari, Maziad, and Roudet, Roger, Yuri, David, Alejandro, Niko, Samar, and St√©phane (2009). Tanzania: The Story of an African Transition. United States: International Monetary Fund. p. 1. In 1979, the IMF interfered and proposed a series of major changes to Tanzania in response to its worsening economy; currency devaluation was the main focus of the proposed changes.Edward, Sebastian. IS TANZANIA A SUCCESS STORY? A LONG TERM ANALYSIS. University of California, Los Angeles & National Bureau of Economic Research, P. 22-23 However, Tanzania refused to devaluate its currency and requested the IMF to leave the country in November 1979. What was more surprising was that when Tanzania expelled the IMF from the country, its economy was already at the edge of bankruptcy. The IMF created the Tanzania Advisory Group (TAG) to improve the relationship between the IMF and Tanzania‚Äîthe main goal of the TAG was to achieve the devaluation of the Shilling. The TAG‚Äôs efforts had virtually no return until 1986 when Ali Hassan Mwinyi, the new president of Tanzania replaced Julius Nyerere, the former president of Tanzania; however, the country's economy was already close to complete collapse.Edward, Sebastian. IS TANZANIA A SUCCESS STORY? A LONG TERM ANALYSIS. University of California, Los Angeles & National Bureau of Economic Research, P. 26. First round of reform, 1986‚Äì1996 In 1986, Tanzania finally entered into a stand-by agreement with the IMF; under this agreement, a program was enacted to liberalize interest rate, eliminate price control, unify exchange rate etc.Nord, Sobolev, Dunn, Hajdenberg, Hobdari, Maziad, and Roudet, Roger, Yuri, David, Alejandro, Niko, Samar, and St√©phane (2009). Tanzania: The Story of an African Transition. United States: International Monetary Fund. p. 70. One important factor to understand was that, at that time, the relationship between the IMF and Tanzania was still not in good shape; with that being said, the amount of aid provided by the stand-by agreement was not a lot as it accounted only 60% of Tanzania‚Äôs quota at that time.Edward, Sebastian. IS TANZANIA A SUCCESS STORY? A LONG TERM ANALYSIS. University of California, Los Angeles & National Bureau of Economic Research, P. 28. The main purpose behind this agreement was mainly to reconstruct investors‚Äô confidence in Tanzania by providing the country with an IMF‚Äôs approval. Successfully, this agreement achieved its goal as many developed countries were willing to provide aids to Tanzania if the country followed the proposed reforms listed under the agreement. From the US$78.5 million (64.2 million SDR) approved by the agreement, only 55.6 million (45.47 million SDR) was withdrawn. The first round of reform came to an end in 1996, and Tanzania achieved most of the reforms during this duration of time. Second round of reform, 1996‚Äì2006 From 1996 to 2006, the second round of reform started. The second reform focused on areas like improving government financial services as well as strengthening the goals achieved from the previous reform.Nord, Sobolev, Dunn, Hajdenberg, Hobdari, Maziad, and Roudet, Roger, Yuri, David, Alejandro, Niko, Samar, and St√©phane (2009). Tanzania: The Story of an African Transition. United States: International Monetary Fund. p. 71. One of the most difficult policy goal was the restructuring of the parastatals;Edward, Sebastian. IS TANZANIA A SUCCESS STORY? A LONG TERM ANALYSIS. University of California, Los Angeles & National Bureau of Economic Research, P. 40-41. under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs implemented by the IMF, Tanzania successfully privatized most of the parastatals in manufacturing and agricultural sectors in 2005 (see Table A3).Nord, Sobolev, Dunn, Hajdenberg, Hobdari, Maziad, and Roudet, Roger, Yuri, David, Alejandro, Niko, Samar, and St√©phane (2009). Tanzania: The Story of an African Transition. United States: International Monetary Fund. p. 72. As for the financial sector, a joint IMF‚ÄìWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program was approved to provide Tanzania with comprehensive and analytical support for better financial development. Under this program, Tanzania received great support from donor countries and eventually unlocked the HIPC and MDRI debt relief to eliminate its existing debt. PSI ERA 2006 onwards The third round of reform focused mainly on creating fit policies to accommodate the economic reforms brought forth by the previous two reforms. From 2006 and on, the IMF‚Äôs interference switched to providing the country with policy advice. Under the operation of the Policy Support Instrument (PSI), the IMF continues to provide the country with economic advice fostering better economic growth rate and improving the situation of poverty. As we can see from the IMF record, starting since 2003, the amount of loan to Tanzania approved by the IMF was only US$29.1 million, and in 2007, only the PSI was in operation and no loan was included. This greatly signals that the IMF has assumed a more passive role as a policy advisor in the case of Tanzania. From the 2017 policy report of Tanzania, the IMF stated that the economy of Tanzania, with the implementation of the PSI- supported program, is looking strong with a moderate level of inflation.

Cipriano began his prank calling career in 1989, when he telephoned local Philadelphia television shows and sent tapes of his calls to The Howard Stern Show. Howard Stern is the person referenced in all of Cipriano's last comments in each of the prank calls, and the Captain Janks alter ego has become a recurring character on Stern's show. Cipriano's national live television airing prank call career began with talk shows; his first call was in 1989, when he telephoned to Larry King's talk show Larry King Live. He then pranked call other interview television shows such as those of Phil Donahue and CNN's Sonya Freedman in the early 1990s. In 1992, his prank calling expanded to live news series; he faked as a witness of an earthquake that took place in Landers, California when calling to CNN. Cipriano also telephoned shows that wouldn't take calls while on air. The first time he did this was in 1991; he lied to producers of the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon that he was a representative for King in order to make a call on the show, saying that King wanted to make a \\"pledge\\" to Lewis. Cipriano then compiled samples of King's voice and ordered them in a way that would trick the producers into believing it was really King talking on the phone. When Cipriano called with his real voice asking Lewis about Howard Stern when the show aired, Lewis called him a \\"schmuck.\\" On June 25, 1996, a collection album of recordings of Janks' phone-call pranks, titled King of the Cranks, was released on compact disc and cassette tape via the labels Atlantic Records and Ozone Music.\\"King of the Cranks ‚Äì Captain Janks\\".

Television stations Cipriano has successfully prank-called range from national and local news networks like NBC News, Fox News, C-SPAN, ESPN to home-shopping channels and religious networks. In 2014, Cipriano suggested he has made around 10,000 fake phone calls. The popularity of The Howard Stern Show has also led to numerous imitators of Captain Janks. A 1996 Philadelphia magazine article reported that there was \\"at least one Janks imitator in every major city.\\" One of these imitators called The Today Show in the summer of 1992 asking Ross Perot if he had \\"mind-melded with Howard Stern's penis.\\" According to the article, \\"Reaching them by phone or through the Howard Stern Newsletter‚Äîwritten and disseminated by Kevin Renzulli of West Orange, New Jersey, another of Stern's true believers‚ÄîJanks coordinates group operations, such as Larry King being hit by three consecutive callers shouting \\"Howard Stern\\" and \\"Baba Booey\\"‚ÄîStern's nickname for producer Gary Dell'Abate‚Äîwhile interviewing Donny Osmond.\\" =Method= Cipriano has reasoned in an interview that, in addition to making people laugh, he does prank calls of live television shows and news stations to make fun of the lack of fact-checking that he felt was a problem in news organizations, especially CNN. He explained, \\"They are so willing to get the \\"scoop\\" before anyone else that they can be very sloppy about getting the story on the air.\\" The Washington Post journalist Paul Farhi has also marked the crank calls a critique of the lack of accuracy review in news stations: \\"That Cipriano, a self-described \\"not-too-bright guy,\\" can beat professional call screeners so often suggests they don't do it often enough in the race for color, drama and \\"breaking news.\\" In a 1996 interview, Cipriano explained he had a 16-setting voice changer for use in tricking producers into letting him call onto their shows. =List of examples= * In 1996, Cipriano faked as a spokesperson for the Bell Telephone Company when calling reporter Bruce Hamilton on a KYW-TV report of a blizzard in Philadelphia. He said to the reporter that phone lines were down due to too many people calling the number 1-800-52-STERN. The line was for ordering the comedy VHS tape Butt Bongo Fiesta (1992) by Stern. * On July 20, 1999, Cipriano faked as a representative for Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod when calling to ABC News during their live report of the plane crash death of John F. Kennedy Jr. hosted by Peter Jennings. When asked about his locations, Cipriano responded, \\"Howard Stern thinks you're a [certain part of the male anatomy].\\" Jennings ended the call with him assuming the caller was a fan of Stern. * On October 15, 2003, during a report of the Steve Bartman incident by the ESPN program SportsCenter, Cipriano prank-called the show faking as Bartman. A spokesperson for ESPN, Josh Krulewitz, released the following statement: \\"We made a mistake. We have a process in place to prevent this type of situation.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter contains the oracles against four nations: Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia. The prophecies of God's vengeance against these and other foreign nations are recorded in other books of the prophets such as Isaiah (cf. Isaiah 13-23), Jeremiah (cf. Jeremiah 46-51) and Amos (cf. Amos 1-2). Text The original text of this chapter was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 17 verses. Judah, showing Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia (\\"Philistine states\\"). =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Against Ammon (25:1-7) The Ammonites were punished for gloating \\"maliciously\\" when Judah fell (), and the land would be occupied by nomadic Arab tribes (\\"sons of the east\\" or \\"people of the east\\" in ; cf. ). This is the longest oracle and the only one spoken in the second person form among the other prophecies in this chapter (cf. or 21:33-34 in Hebrew texts. =Verse 2= : \\"Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, :: and prophesy against them.\\" (NKJV) NKJV Cross reference: ; ; * \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ü÷æ◊ê◊ì◊ù, ben adam): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. There are two parts to the oracle against Ammon: verses 3-5 and 6-7, both for the malicious glee when the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed and when the people of Judah went into exile. Against Moab (25:8-11) Moab is punished for gloating and stating that Judah is \\"like all other nations\\" (), which is considered an insult to Yahweh (cf. ). Therefore, similar to Ammon, the land of Moab would be given to the \\"people of the east\\" (cf. Jeremiah 48). Against Edom (25:12-14) Edom's punishment is harsh and may be singled out for betraying the agreement with Judah to fight against Babylon (; committing \\"grievous offense\\" in ), but instead became a Babylonian ally, taking Judean lands in the Negeb (cf. , ). Against Philistia (25:15-17) The Philistines (in the land of Philistia) are said to have come originally from the islands of the Aegean Sea, including Crete (cf. ; ; ; ), so they are called Cherethites (interpreted as Cretans). They are punished because of their vicious treatment against Judah (cf. Jeremiah 47). =Verse 17= : I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes. And they shall know that I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon them.

Pulp Fiction behind-the-scenes lore revealed. CNN.con wire service. Mercury News. May 22, 2019. The passage is heard three times in the whole film. The final two sentences of Jules' speech are similar to the actual cited passage, which is based on the King James Version, but the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.Reinhartz (2003), p. 108. The primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese martial arts star Sonny Chiba, particularly in the film Karate Kiba (The Bodyguard; 1976).Thomas (2003) notes that instead of \\"the Lord\\", this version reads \\"... and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard ...\\" (pp. 61‚Äì62). Conard (2006) claims that the text originates from the film Bodigaado Kiba (Bodyguard Kiba or The Bodyguard; 1973) and that the end phrase there is \\"And you will know my name is Chiba the Bodyguard ...\\" (p. 135, n. 4). In the 1980s television series Kage no Gundan (Shadow Warriors), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 4, Pulp Fiction DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).

Her work, both literary and theatrical, shaped the women's rights and women's suffrage movement in Japan. Early life Komako Kimura was born in Tokyo in on July 29, 1887 as the youngest of three sisters. She was educated in the arts from a young age, and started to learn Nihon buy≈ç at three years old and kabuki at five. Her father, who was the chief clerk of a fire-fighting pump dealer, lost all of his money to an extortionate moneylender, forcing him to move to Taiwan to find work and leave the family behind when she was eight years old. Komako used her training in dance and theater to support her family by joining a touring theater in Kumamoto. In her early life, she went to a school founded by Junko Takezaki, where girls were not only encouraged to learn and become good, traditional Japanese wives and mothers, but also how to \\"be personalities.\\" She was inspired by male thinkers like Goethe, Byron, Maeterlinck, Wilde, and Emerson, after studying them in school. She was also greatly influenced by the ideas of Ellen Key, a Swedish feminist. Komako Kimura in Shadowland, 1923 Career Komako Kimura was controversial in her time for her defiant actions both in her theatrical life and in her work to advance the women‚Äôs suffrage movement. = Early Career = Komako Kimura and Kimura Hideo had a child out of wedlock 1908. Komako was ostracized because of this, making it difficult for her to hold down a job. Although she was not a socialist herself, she wanted more openness of thought and art in Japan, so she had been writing for the socialist journal Kumamoto hy√≥ron. However, they did not deign to print her name on articles after January of 1908, when her unmarried motherhood became known. Similarly, she was accepted into the Imperial Actresses Training School, but was kicked out once it was made known that she was unmarried and had a child. Komako Kimura in Japanese clothing = Theater = She was the manager of two theaters in Tokyo, the Kimura Komako theater, and the Tokiwaza. She herself performed in 500 plays throughout her lifetime, as Shakespearean heroines and more, like ‚ÄúLa Tosca, Monna Vanna, [and] Camille‚Äù. She loved the stage because it was one of the only ways women could flourish in a male- dominated society, as ‚Äúonly the women of the stage have an opportunity to talk to men of affairs,‚Äù a designation not even granted to their wives. She was not seen as inferior onstage and after performances. She could speak to and associate to powerful men, who would in turn listen to and be influenced by her opinions. = The True New Women's Association = Komako Kimura created the movement entitled ‚ÄúThe True New Women‚Äôs Association‚Äù (in Japanese Shin- shinfujinkai) in 1912 with two other women, Nishikawa Fumiko (1882-1960) and Miyazaki Mitsuko, despite their apparently disparate personalities. Together, they created a lecture series and magazine, both entitled ‚ÄúThe New True Women‚Äù (in Japanese, Shinshinfujin). The first speech that Komako gave occurred in 1913, and was entitled ‚ÄúLove and Self-Realization for Women‚Äù. She aimed to circulate ‚ÄúThe New True Woman‚Äù magazine in America, Japan, and Europe. In her first publication of the magazine, Komako described how she did not just want to change the law and give men and women equal rights on paper. Her goal was to educate women to be strong willed and thoughtful feminists who are provided with an education equal to that of men, and no longer have to refer to the men in their lives to make decisions for themselves. By the time she visited America in 1917, she had been working toward achieving suffrage in Japan for about five years, to no avail. There were issues about funding, government opposition, and a lack of Japanese precedent concerning the women‚Äôs rights movement that prevented Komako from making more progress. Komako Kimura practicing acupuncture She was in America to gain inspiration from American women, whom she admired due to the fact that they could use their clothing and makeup to express themselves as individuals. She criticized Japanese society for forcing conformity onto women by making them take an hour to do their hair and clothes, then be unable to move unencumbered throughout the day, due to the restrictive nature of traditional Japanese clothing. During her visit, she met with the first female member of Congress, Jeanette Rankin, as well as President Woodrow Wilson. Also, she famously marched in the October 27, 1917 suffrage march in New York. = Controversy and Trial = ‚ÄúThe New True Woman‚Äù magazine lasted until January of 1918, before it was suppressed by the Japanese government. The magazine was well known for its radical topics for the time, as it criticized marriage and was the first Japanese publication to frankly talk about the use of birth control. This suppression also extended to her public lectures, and she was no longer permitted to hold meetings in public areas. In response to the Japanese government‚Äôs actions, Komako wrote and acted as the lead in a play entitled ‚ÄúIgnorance.‚Äù As expected, the Japanese government was not happy with this action, and advised her to return to playing meek women, else be censured by the closing of her theaters. Instead of doing as the government willed, she defied its cease and desist and made all of the performances at her theater free. In response, the government arrested her. When she was put on trial, she acted as her own defense, and did so so well that instead of hindering her cause, the government unwittingly promoted it, as her message was spread via the trial, making her fight for women‚Äôs rights and suffrage known throughout the country. = America and Beyond = The Kimuras moved to America some time after the trial, and spent eight years living there. During this time, Komako continued to advance her career in acting, as well as advocate for women's suffrage. Most notably, she performed at Carnegie Hall and on Broadway. They returned to America in 1925, and she wrote several books about meditation and breathing techniques including A Textbook on the Art of Dancing and The Art of Kannon. Personal life Komako and Hideo Kimura Komako was nearly married off to a man who offered her parents money to make her his concubine, but she ran away before the marriage occurred. Some sources state that she ran away on her wedding day, but it is unclear if that was sensationalized conjecture for the newspapers. She went on to hold a variety of jobs, from being the first telephone operator in Kumamoto to being a teacher while she was supported by her friend Kimura Bansaku, who became wealthy by making soy sauce. She may have also apprenticed as a geisha in Nagoya for three years during this time. However, she still wanted the exciting and high-profile life of an actress. She fell in love with Bansaku's nephew, a divorc√© by the name of Kimura Hideo, who had majored in Religious Studies at UC Berkeley, and then worked in medicine, utilizing strategies such as hypnosis to heal. They had an illegitimate son together in February of 1908, who they named Shouji. According to Komako, his name meant \\"life and death,\\" because \\"that sums up the story of a human being\\". The family moved to Tokyo in May of 1909, where they were legally married and had another child by the fall of 1911. Komako took acting classes there, but stopped when her one year old daughter died in 1912. The Kimuras moved to New York some time after the 1917 suffrage march, and demonstrated Japanese physical disciplines and conducted religious ceremonies.\\"She's Somewhat Small, but Her Resistive Power, That's Different\\" Galveston Daily News (January 10, 1921): 3. via Newspapers.com\\"Madame Hideo Kimura\\" Evening Public Ledger (August 1, 1919): 22. via Newspapers.com  Legacy  Komako Kimura's writing, speeches, and performances were integral to the Japanese suffrage movement, which culminated in the 1945 change of election law that allowed Japanese women to vote. Additionally, her wishes for women to be equal to men being tempered by the gender roles of her era are still discussed in feminist texts and ideas to this day.

With over 270,000 South Sudanese refugees fleeing the ongoing civil war, as of early 2017 it was the largest refugee settlement in the world. As of 2018, that distinction was claimed by Kutapalong refugee camp for displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh. Bidi Bidi Geography The Bidibidi area covers 250 square kilometres of the eastern half of Yumbe District, stretching southward from the South Sudanese border and spilling over into Moyo District along the western bank of the Kochi River. History The Bidibidi area was a small village before becoming a refugee settlement which was opened in August 2016. Since then, the Uganda Government and other NGOs have worked to create a settlement rather than a camp to host and contain the influx of the growing number of the asylum seekers from South Sudan.  Social services  Many women in Bidi Bidi refugee settlement have access to psycho-social support and empowerment resources that have been set up within the camp. The U.N. has created a system of revolving funds, meaning that funds are replenished when used, which allows women to learn vocational skills such as hairdressing and helping women build their own businesses. This leads to empowerment and creates a sense of stability in an unstable world of the displaced and worrisome state of the camp. Caritas International is an organization aimed at promoting justice and helping the poor and they have mobilized efforts to give aid to the people of Bidi Bidi refugee settlement. Depending on which zone of the camp refugees live in, some receive a plot of land, agricultural tools and seeds to begin to sustain themselves and create opportunities for businesses. ARC - American Red Cross team is responsible for Zone 5 of the camp, providing protection and other support to residents of Bidi Bidi refugee settlement, (it takes 1 hour to drive across Zone 5, alone!). We‚Äôre providing post-trauma counseling, working to prevent violence in the camp and helping run the reception center ‚Äì the place where every refugee first arrives at Bidi Bidi refugee settlement. The Bidi Bidi refugee camp materialized so quickly and many people have come and continued coming, humanitarian groups are still working towards making available all the critical services that are needed by the settlers at this second largest refugee settlement in the world.  Health care  There have been growing concerns about health conditions and access to health services as the number of South Sudan refugees entering Uganda continues to increase, particularly, Bidi Bidi refugee camp, with Reuters reporting that 180 refugees (nearly half of them young children) died in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in the first six months of 2017. This is compounded by how there is often limited accuracy of health measurements in camp settings, with under-reporting of deaths by humanitarian organizations typically occurring more frequently than over-reporting of deaths. From a human rights and ethics perspective, there are also questions about whether people with different physical abilities or the elderly are not being prioritized in these settlements, receiving less resources compared to younger, able-bodied residents in good health. In settlements located in the Ayilo District of Northern Uganda, for example, the organization Caritas reports that programs have been designed to provide more assistance for building latrines to groups identified as vulnerable, such as older residents, disabled residents, and child-headed households. Furthermore, a 2016 U.S. State Department report on trafficking warns that South Sudanese children in Northern Ugandan refugee settlements may be vulnerable to trafficking, with the UNHCR suspecting that instances of trafficking are already occurring among young South Sudanese refugees. Unfortunately, reliably quantifying the number of trafficked children can be a challenge due to lack of effective monitoring, corruption, insufficient protection of victims to come forward, differences in definitions of terms, and other contextual aspects.

It develops brain-machine interface and neuroscience technology. The company was founded in 2016 by Bryan Johnson who backed it with a personal investment of $54 million.  History  Johnson founded Kernel in 2016 and began researching neuroprosthetics, devices implanted into the brain that mimic, substitute, or assist brain functions. In May 2020, Kernel unveiled two brain-activity monitoring devices. The devices resemble a helmet covered with sensors and have the ability to see and record brain activity, allowing scientists to more easily and quickly analyze neurons. One device, Flux, measures electromagnetic activity. Another, Flow, pulses the brain with light to measure changes in blood metabolism. Kernel's hardware prevents environmental interference; custom microchips process signals, and algorithms analyze brain activity. The company shrunk large, room-sized machines down to the size of a wearable bicycle helmet, which allows people to be more mobile as they are monitored. The devices are expected to become available for purchase in late 2021. Potential applications of the technology include assisting paralyzed individuals with communication and tracking mental functions, such as creativity or anxiety. At the same time, Kernel introduced \\"Sound ID,\\" software that can tell what speech or song a person is listening to just from brain data. Bloomberg called the software ‚Äúa sort of Shazam for the mind‚Äù, referring to the popular music-recognition app, Shazam. In a demonstration, music producer and DJ Steve Aoki tried one of Kernel's helmets with Sound ID technology. As Aoki listened to his own compositions, Kernel software analyzed Aoki's brain activity and identified the song being played. Kernel was featured in the 2020 documentary, I Am Human, about brain-machine interfaces. Kernel raised $53 million in 2020 to accelerate development of a new generation of brain tech.  Operations  Johnson, who has said the future of humanity will be a combination of human and artificial intelligence, says Kernel's objective is \\"to read and write the underlying functions of the brain.\\" As of 2019, the company is researching neurological diseases and dysfunctions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression and anxiety.

While CPA has multiple locations in the United States, each branch tailors its work to serve the community needs specific to its location. In San Francisco, CPA advocates for tenants' and workers' rights, youth and student political engagement, and civic engagement. From its founding, the Chinese Progressive Association has been a notable political influence in the local Chinese American community. The increase of Chinese American political involvement in the late 20th century is attributed in large part to the efforts of organizations like the CPA to engage working-class Chinese Americans in local activism. The CPA was also one of the main Asian American organizations to support the campaign to save the International Hotel in 1972, an issue that notably united the local Asian American community in the West Coast of the United States. More recently, the CPA has successfully advocated for the passage of city ordinances protecting low-wage workers, like the Minimum Wage Ordinance (2003), the Minimum Wage Implementation and Enforcement Ordinance (2006), and the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance (2011).

It was published in English by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, with the translation from French by Linda Loverdale. The author reports testimonies of convicted killers of the Rwandan genocide. Hatzfeld first spoke with survivors, whose story he wrote in Le nu de la vie, and then looked at how the killers experienced the same event, partly as a result of requests from readers. A friend and Rwandan interpreter gave him the idea of meeting prisoners sentenced to long sentences who would speak more readily than people who were free, and put him in contact with a group of men he knew before the genocide. Hatzfeld met them in prison in 2001 and 2002. Witnesses It comprises a group of ten people, most of them farmers, who lived in the hills around the town of Nyamata and were already close friends before the killing started. They were all imprisoned in the penitentiary of Rilima. In the spring of 1994, they became the relentless executioners of their neighbours, including friends, members of their soccer team and people with whom they sang at Sunday mass. They worked hard and loved partying, but were not particularly racist. One had even married a Tutsi. They were keen to do the \\"work\\" that was set for them. They did not make any effort to spare any Tutsi they may have befriended before. Approach and reflections of the author Jean Hatzfeld had not considered interviewing them; it was the demand of readers of his previous book that made him change his mind. While he was gathering their testimony, he wondered why and how it was possible for these men to kill this way. During the testimonies, the reader gathers answers: *it is easy to obey when the instruction is simple: \\"Rule No. 1 is to kill, Rule No. 2, there was none.\\" *defending the Tutsi cause or simply asking questions could immediately lead to death (although no case was recorded by Hatzfeld); *the plunder rewarded those who had killed; *the flight of the \\"whites\\" as soon as killings started conveyed to them the message that they would not then be accused or punished; *they no longer saw the human being behind the Tutsi, but the \\"cockroach\\" as the anti-Tutsi propaganda had persuaded them. The genocidal process had been prepared for several months, and weapons, mainly machetes, had been piled up. These killings appeared as inevitable in the aftermath of the assassination of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana. The killers who speak did show zeal during the killings, but little regret when they tell the stories. They didn‚Äôt seem to know whether the killing was right or wrong. They hope to return home and resume their place in the family and their lives \\"as before\\". The author groups their testimonies by theme and includes also precise comments triggered by their words plus other general considerations and historical summaries. He does not offer an overall conclusion, simply allows readers to form their own opinion. The interviews that collected these testimonies were individual and confidential. None knew what others had said. The title A season that lasted from April to May. The killings were carried out during the day and the looting on the evenings, replacing the usual work in the fields. The killings were accompanied by plunder: they harvested money, beer, bananas to make alcohol, equipment, corrugated metal (to cover their houses and enclosures) and cows (usually bred by the Tutsi). On returning to the village, they eat and drank abundantly. The machetes are the tools they use for cutting in maize and banana plantations. Rwandans grow up with a machete. These tools proved adequate to \\"cut\\" the Tutsi. Author's considerations Through the answers of the killers, Hatzfeld reveals what genocide is and how it differs from war. Genocide is a state institution, a concerted project of extermination. A genocide is distinguished from war by the absence of fighting. The killings take place only in one direction. The anti-Tutsi sentiment that had dominated Rwanda for 30 years now compounded with radio propaganda and Interahamwe activism prepared the Hutu to accept the idea of extermination. The killers of a genocide do not feel responsible. They speak without fatigue, without nervousness, without showing much emotion. When they approach the issue of forgiveness, they see it as a due and do not imagine that it cannot be granted. Reception Writing in the Peace and Conflict Monitor, Sam Wolf points out how this book is perhaps the only one on the literature on genocide who asks ‚Äúthose responsible to explain it for us‚Äù; the book, he adds, will be of particular interest to ‚Äúthose with an interest in the psychology of violence a grand scale‚Äù. In the Washington Post, Alison Des Forges considered the book ‚Äúlimited in scope and marred by numerous errors‚Äù but, added, ‚Äúits grassroots view of the genocide enriches and completes other, more formal, accounts.‚Äù Publishers Weekly wrote that \\"Steering clear of politics, this important book succeeds in offering the reader some grasp of how such unspeakable acts unfolded.\\" Lee Ann Fujii of Georgetown University described the book as \\"a valuable window‚Äîalbeit one that has been keenly shaped by the author‚Äîon the transformation of one group of men, from one region of the country, from ordinary peasants into genocidaires.\\"Fujii, p. 156. She stated that the book had some \\"awkwardly translated passages from the original French\\". Fujii stated that while \\"Having the killers speak directly to the reader is a powerful tactic\\", the book does not specify what Hatzfield asked the genocide participants, and therefore it is not known whether ideas in their responses originated from the interviewer or the interviewees;Fujii, p. 155-156. according to Fujii, \\"This sense of streaming monologue, in turn, helps to render these men as cold-blooded monsters.\\" References * =Reference notes= 2005 books √âditions du Seuil books Works by Jean Hatzfeld ","title":"Machete Season"},{"id":"53692426","text":"Henry S.

In 1918 he joined the Red Army, and ended his service in the Civil War as the chief of staff of a shock (cavalry) brigade in Belorussia. During the interwar years, apart from having command of a rifle regiment in 1934, he served exclusively in staff and instruction roles, making him an unlikely choice for high-level field command in wartime. During these years he served in the Western and Belorussian Military Districts, and in 1933 he graduated from the Frunze Academy. Following this, his regimental command, and his service as chief of staff of a rifle division later in 1934, he went on to instructional assignments, as assistant commandant of the Tambov Military School, then at the Military Economics Academy, moving to the head of the tactics department of that institution in 1939.

However, after his army helped halt the German advance in November, in the following month the STAVKA appointed him to command of Southern Front's 56th Army, which participated in that Front's successful winter counteroffensives. After assisting in driving 1st Panzer Army out of Rostov-on-Don in early December and back to the Mius River, 56th Army spent the rest of the winter and spring of 1942 on the southernmost sector of Southern Front, right down to the coast of the Sea of Azov. At the start of the German summer offensive the Army consisted of two rifle brigades and three rifle divisions in the first echelon, backed by two more rifle brigades and a tank brigade with 55 tanks, plus two fortified regions manning fixed defenses in and around Rostov.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 61-62, 177 1st Panzer and 17th Armies began their attack on July 7 and by the 16th the Front commander, Lt. Gen. Rodion Malinovsky, was authorized by the STAVKA to order his armies to begin an orderly withdrawal to the Don River south of Rostov over five nights, protected by strong rearguards. Late on the 20th, LVII Panzer Corps had crossed the Mius and was driving the rearguards of 56th Army back towards the city. In the following days Tsyganov ordered his forces to defend Rostov by manning the outer and inner defensive belts on the northern and eastern sectors. These plans were undone by the rapid advance of the German tank forces and the premature withdrawal of 18th Army south of the Don. 56th Army was forced to withdraw as well, and after a bitter defense mainly by NKVD security troops Rostov-on-Don fell to the Germans for the second time on July 27. Deemed by Stalin to be unfit for field command, Tsyganov was relieved a few days later.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 56, 202-03, 518 Tsyganov was immediately reassigned to become deputy commander in chief for military schools in the Moscow Military District. On October 16, 1943, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. He was still serving in the training establishment when he died of illness on June 25, 1944, at the age of 47.http://www.generals.dk/general/Tsyganov/Viktor_Viktorovich/Soviet_Union.html Retrieved March 4, 2017 References External links *Lt.

Ecatepec-Pir√°mides The highway from Ecatepec de Morelos to Pir√°mides, the only segment in the State of Mexico, is the first segment out of Mexico City on Highway 132D. It begins at Mexican Federal Highway 85D (Pachuca‚ÄîMexico City) in Ecatepec and immediately features its first toll plaza, turning northeast. At Acolm√°n, a junction is built to serve as the northern terminus of the Autopista Pir√°mides-Texcoco, which when fully built will provide access to the New International Airport for Mexico City.

Thomas (March 19, 1938 ‚Äì April 3, 2017) was a Marin County, California prosecutor and Superior Court judge. Thomas was primarily known for his role in the Marin County Civic Center shootout in which he was taken hostage in a courtroom, along with Judge Harold Haley and three female jurors, by Jonathan Jackson and three inmates from San Quentin State Prison in what is widely speculated to be a failed attempt to free his brother, George Jackson, and the other two Soledad Brothers. Haley, Jonathan Jackson, and two of the inmates were killed during the escape attempt, and Thomas was paralyzed from the waist down. Background Thomas was a native of Great Falls, Montana.http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20%20Files/San%20Quentin/San%20Quentin%20734.pdf His father was James Walter Thomas, and his step-mother was Vera T. Thomas. Thomas and his family moved to San Francisco, California when he was nine years old, but he frequently returned to Montana during the summers to work on his uncle's cattle ranch. Thomas graduated from San Francisco's Riordan High School. After earning an academic scholarship to the University of San Francisco in 1955, he received a bachelor's degree in political science. Thomas received another scholarship and graduated from the University of San Francisco School of Law in 1961. He joined the State Bar of California in 1962, then worked in private practice and as a deputy county prosecutor until 1969 when he was promoted to assistant district attorney. Thomas was also a member of the United States Air Force Reserve from 1962 to 1968. Thomas married Haley's niece, Maureen, around 1960 and the couple had two sons. He was an avid fisherman. Marin County Civic Center shootout On the morning of August 7, 1970, Thomas was an assistant district attorney for Marin County prosecuting the case of James McClain, an inmate at San Quentin prison who had been charged with assaulting a prison guard. Thomas was questioning Ruchell Magee, another inmate at San Quentin whom McClain had arranged to be a witness, when Jonathan Jackson interrupted the court proceedings. In the barrage of gunfire that followed during the escape attempt, Thomas was shot in the spine and paralyzed from the waist down. A ballistics expert would later testify that Thomas's spine was severed from a bullet fired from a San Quentin guard's .30 caliber carbine. The following day, photographs of the perpetrators with their hostages, including Thomas, appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the nation. An initial report indicated that he was seriously wounded in the back. A UPI report released the day after the shooting indicated that Thomas was in grave condition with two bullet wounds in the chest. Another UPI report from the same day indicated that Thomas was wounded in the chest and spine and quoted him as telling District Attorney Bruce B. Bales that he grabbed a gun from the driver and shot three of the kidnappers. According to Bales, Thomas murmured to his wife: \\"Judge Haley was a saint. I got three of them.\\" Two days after the shootout, Thomas remained in critical condition at Marin General Hospital following surgery for bullet wounds in his back and was described as a \\"key witness in the question of who fired first in [the] gun battle\\". Thomas was reportedly shot three times. In addition to the bullet that entered through his back and severed his spine, another nicked his heart and a third pierced his lungs. Thomas was reportedly told by doctors that he would need 6 to 12 months to recuperate, however, he returned to work on September 14, 1970 - five weeks after the shooting. He claimed that his recovery was hastened by \\"vigorous exercise and the fear of boredom\\". The wheelchair-bound district attorney was reported to avoid photographers and refuse interviews. In December 1970, Thomas was credited as saving the lives of the three women jurors and named \\"peace officer of the year\\" by the Marin County Peace Officers Association. In July 1971, Thomas' grand jury testimony from the previous fall was released. Questioned by Marin County District Attorney Bruce Bales, he indicated that it was Magee who shot Judge Haley. =Angela Davis trial= During the 1972 Angela Davis trial, Maria Elena Graham, one of the three women hostages, testified that Thomas told the gunmen \\"not to do anything foolish\\" but was forced to the floor with the others in the courtroom. Graham told of how Haley, Thomas, and the three jurors were wired together and forced out of the courthouse and into the escape van. She said that there, just prior to shots being fired, she heard Thomas shout: \\"For God's sake - don't shoot!\\" Graham reported that while she was sprawled on the floor of the van, Thomas reached over her head and grabbed a revolver from Jackson. A few days later, the recently promoted Judge Thomas recounted his version of what happened that morning. According to Thomas, someone in the back of the courtroom (Jackson) stated \\"Hold it right there. That's enough.\\" He described Jackson appearance and commented that he was holding a handgun. Thomas said: \\"The people in the courtroom, including myself and the guards, were instructed to get down on the floor. I got down on the floor where I was seated, stretched out.\\" He reported that he kept his eyes on the bench and watched McClain approach Haley. Thomas said that McClain asked Jackson if he had brought the tape, then Jackson produced a carbine from under his raincoat while moving forward to hand the pistol to McClain. He went on to state that a shotgun was pulled from Jackson's bag, then taped around Haley's neck with the barrel under his chin. Thomas explained that McClain ordered Haley to call the sheriff and that McClain eventually told the sheriff: \\"We have the judge. If you don't do as we say, we'll kill him and the people on the jury.\\" According to Thomas, the gunmen spent several minutes discussing which hostages they should take with them. Thomas told the court that Magee said: \\"Let's not take any of them. Let's kill them all here.\\" He quoted McClain has replying: \\"Cool it. Don't lose your cool.\\" Thomas testified that while laying on the courtroom floor, he heard McClain say to the other gunmen: \\"We're not taking any kids.\\" McClain then came over to him and said: \\"You're a good man. We're taking you along.\\" According to Thomas, McClain smiled at him in the corridor outside the courtroom and said: \\"We're revolutionaries, but you knew that all along, didn't you?\\" In response to the prosecutor's questioning, Thomas said that he twice heard Jackson allude to a time element in their schedule. (Thomas described being tied to the three women hostages. - another reference states all five were tied together) As the gunmen and hostages gathered outside the getaway van, Thomas said he asked McClain to free the three women hostages but the inmate refused. In describing the attempted getaway, Thomas outlined the position of the occupants in the van. Jackson was in the driver's seat, McClain was crouched on the floor beside him, Thomas was behind McClain, Haley was behind Thomas, and Christmas was in the back of the van. According to Thomas, the van came to a sudden stop and Jackson stuck his revolver outside the window. He reported that he heard either one shot or two shots in quick succession, then Jackson pulled his bloodied hand back into the van. Thomas testified that he immediately turned to Haley, under whose chin Magee held a sawed-off shotgun, and described how the right side of the judge's face appeared to slowly pull away from his skull. Thomas explained that he turned back towards Jackson, grabbed his gun from his hand, then fired a shot or two in his direction. He said he then shot McClain (who was also in the front of the van) in his back, turned and fired in the direction of William Christmas near the rear of the van, then finally shot Magee in the chest. Thomas reported that he attempted to shoot Magee again when the gun ran out of bullets. Under cross-examination, Davis' attorney Leo Branton Jr. immediately drew from Thomas that he was not shot by Jackson or any of the three inmates. Branton also pointed out some minor inconsistencies in Thomas' story, and got him to admit that he could not tell which of the two identical .357 magnums on the table he had used. As Haley had also been hit by a .357 slug in the heart, Branton attempted to reconstruct the events within the van to show that Thomas accidentally shot the judge - and that his death throes caused the shotgun held by Magee to discharge. The ballistics expert would later demonstrate that Thomas shot who he said he shot and the .357 held by Christmas shot Haley. Thomas would also testify that he did not hear any demand for the release of the Soledad Brothers. Joseph J. Murphy, a San Quentin Prison sergeant, would testify that he removed a carbine that was \\"sticking up\\" and blocking access to Thomas. =Ruchell Magee trial= On January 22, 1973, Thomas would recount his story again in the trial of Ruchell Magee. Magee, who had been thrown out of every previous session of the trial, was reported to have sat quietly through Thomas' testimony while never taking his eyes off of him. According to Thomas, Magee shouted prior to the shooting, \\"Let's kill 'em all now\\", and that McClain had replied, \\"Let's cool it, keep your cool, everything's cool.\\" He would again confirm that Magee was holding the sawed-off shotgun when it discharged and killed Haley. On April 3, 1973 [verify date], Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin declared a mistrial after the jury announced for the fifth time that it was deadlocked on reaching a verdict on charges of murder and kidnapping. One member of the jury, Hugh Chalmers, stated that the panel did not accept Thomas' testimony. Chalmers remarked: \\"We think that what happened in that van was not as the pain-ridden Mr. Thomas thought they happened. We feel that the judge was already dead when the shotgun went off. I think Mr. Thomas was honest, but I think his story was twisted.\\" Magee eventually pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Professional career and judicial office In 1971, Thomas successfully prosecuted a homeowner who rigged a .22 caliber pistol as a booby-trap that wounded a teenager burglar. The California Supreme Court later upheld the conviction of assault with a deadly weapon and ruled that a spring gun may not be used to defend a home against burglary. This ruling is frequently cited as an example of case law pertaining to self-defense. During the course of the Davis and Magee trials, Thomas became a municipal court judge and later a California Superior Court judge who presided over a number of cases involving high-profile individuals. =Municipal court= Two years after the Marin County Civic Center shootout, California Governor Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas a municipal court judge. His role in municipal court was to handle misdemeanors, some civil suits, and the initial proceedings of felony cases. In 1973, Thomas ordered Glenn Yarbrough to pay $350 per month after the singer pleaded no contest to charges of failing to provide child support. Thomas received brief national publicity in 1975 for sentencing petty offenders to writing out thousands of times their promises not to violate various misdemeanor laws. He claimed that this type of punishment fit the crime and served as a good deterrent as the offenders would be jailed for hours at a time while completing their sentences. Grace Slick, the lead singer of Jefferson Starship, appeared before Thomas in municipal court on multiple occasions in 1978. In March, Thomas imposed probation on Slick who had earlier been convicted of drunk driving. When arrested for public drunkenness three months later, she pleaded \\"no contest\\" to violating the terms of the probation. Thomas then sentenced Slick to two-years probation with the caveat that she would be jailed if she drank alcohol during that period. He also ordered her not to leave the state and to attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for six months. In 1982, Thomas accepted an innocent plea in municipal court from Phil Crane, a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives and a former U.S. presidential candidate, who had been charged with driving while intoxicated. =Superior court= Thomas was elected a superior court judge in 1986. As a Marin County Superior Court judge, Thomas presided over a 1987 jury trial in which Matthew Kelly, the founder of the rock band Kingfish, filed a $10 million lawsuit against Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. In 1991, Thomas set bail at $500,000 for pornography pioneer Jim Mitchell until he could stand trial for the shooting death of his brother, Artie Mitchell; Mitchell was also ordered to surrender his passport and remain in the Bay Area. In 1994, famed forensic psychiatrist Martin Blinder was sued by a former lover for \\"professional negligence, assault and battery, sexual abuse, and inflicting emotional distress.\\" Later, when the woman repeatedly failed to appear in court, Thomas dismissed the suit and ordered her to pay $13,000 in costs. As part of Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong, Thomas presided over a legal dispute in 1995 between the Church of Scientology and Gerald Armstrong, a former member and employee of that organization. Armstrong had previously settled a civil suit against the COS for $800,000 with the stipulation that he would not divulge information he gained as a church insider. Finding that Armstrong had violated the terms of the settlement, Thomas later ordered Armstrong to pay the COS $100,000 and issued an injunction ordering him to stop speaking about Scientology. Armstrong's refusal to comply with previous court rulings prompted Thomas in 1997 to issue a warrant for Armstrong's arrest that is still outstanding. In 2004, Armstrong would file a document in Marin County Superior Court asserting that Thomas conspired with the Church of Scientology against him to violate various Constitution Rights and that his orders were illegal.Church of Scientology International vs. Gerry Armstrong, Declaration Of Defendant Gerry Armstrong In Support Of Opposition To Motion For Summary Judgment. (Superior Court of California: County of Marin. March 16, 2004.) Retrieved July 8, 2010. As of 1995, Thomas was one of three judges who had been appointed by the Marin County Superior Court to specialize in California Environmental Quality Act cases. Retirement and death Thomas retired from the bench in 1998. He died on April 3, 2017 due to \\"natural causes\\". According to his wife, he suffered from kidney problems, pneumonia, and other complications from his paralysis. Notes References External links ;Thomas involvement with Church of Scientology v.

She was born in what was then part of Poland. During World War II, she fled with her mother and siblings; her father served in the army. After the war, the family was reunited and moved to the German island of Borkum. After she completed high school, she attended an art school in Wiesbaden. Kyle was subsequently employed as a commercial artist in Frankfurt. When she turned 21, she spent a year painting in Greece. She moved to the United States to live with a man she had met; they married and settled in San Francisco. The couple later separated and, during the 1970s, Kyle studied with bookbinder and conservator Laura Young in New York City. She began teaching after Richard Minsky offered her a job teaching at the Center for Book Arts in New York City. She also taught at Cooper Union. Kyle next moved to Philadelphia where she worked as a conservator for the American Philosophical Society. In 1987, she was invited to teach at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. In 1983, along with Timothy Barrett and Gary Frost, Kyle co-founded the Paper & Book Intensive, an annual series of bookbinding, papermaking, and conservation workshops. Over the years, Kyle has come up with new and innovative ways of assembling books which are often based on traditional bookbinding techniques.

The heavenly banquet or Messianic banquet is a concept in Christian theology. It refers to a place in heaven where the Christian faithful, in particular the martyrs, go following heaven. Though frequently depicted in early Christian art, the imagery is now used sparingly except for references in the Eucharist. Textual basis The Gospel of Matthew repeatedly describes banquets and feasts as being present in the kingdom of heaven. Elsewhere, Jesus mentions eating and drinking in the heavenly kingdom. Some references to the heavenly banquet conceive it as being thrown by Abraham (cf. sqq.). The heavenly banquet is mentioned in several third-century martyrdom narratives, including the Martyrdom of Marian and James and the Testament of the Forty Martyrs. Eucharist The heavenly banquet is referenced in the communion liturgy in a number of Christian sects. For example, the close of the standard communion liturgy of the United Methodist Church reads: In Christian art The heavenly banquet was a common motif in early catacomb art. Typically, these would depict a table of seven men feasting on bread, wine and fish. Some scholars allege that the heavenly banquet imagery is linked to that of the pagan refrigerium. Catacomb art depicting the heavenly banquet may alternately be interpreted as depicting the Eucharist or the agape feast.

Language The Yadhaykenu language was a dialect of Uradhi, a group of languages marked by their use of urra for 'this'. Country The Yadhaykenu had, in Norman Tindale's estimation, some of territory southwards from the Escape River to the vicinity of Orford Ness. This covers the area extending from Escape River to Pudding Pan Hill in the Cape York Peninsula. Their numbers at the time of contact with colonial pastoralists who took over their land in the 1860s has been estimated to range between 1,500 and 1,600. History The Yadhaigana were traditional enemies of the Gudang but, Alfred Cort Haddon found in the 1880s that the two had forged an alliance with each other. Together with the neighbouring Unduyamo and Gudang aboriginal tribes, they were regarded as warlike by the colonial authorities and settlers who moved into their lands and encountered their resistance. Writing in 1864, the Scottish immigrant John Jardine (1807‚Äì1874), from 1863 to 1865 the police magistrate at the newly established Somerset settlement. thought of these natives in his area of administration 'to be in a lower state of degradation, mentally and physically, than any of the Australian aboriginal tribes which I have seen'. British marines stationed at Somerset were withdrawn in 1868, and native troopers under Henry Chester set about dispersing the local tribes with terror tactics, punitive forays, and by adopting methods such as inciting one tribe against another. The young men and women were subject to Blackbirding in order to obtain slave labour on pearling boats. Two Anglican missionaries present Rev F Jagg and William Kennett wrote on protest at the shocking conditions the tribes were subject to, only to be speedily removed. Internecine hostilities, already frequent, flared between the Yadhaigana and their Gumakudin neighbours as settlement expanded, and eventually the latter were absorbed by the former. Within three decades of settlement, of the estimated 3,000 Aborigines belonging to the three tribes, only a 100 remained. After the shattering of the traditional east-coast tribal groupings and their dispersal, many remnants of each group intermarried and a new more collective identity was formed at Red Island Point, from descendants or survivors of the Wuthgathi, Yadhaigana, Gudong and Unduyamo, who came to be known as the Red Island Point tribes. By virtue of this amalgamation, the Yadhaigana, as part of their native title claim, consider themselves heir to the old Gumakudin lands extending from Pudding Pan Hill, across Utingu, Red Island Point, Injinoo to Muttee Head on the southwest of the York Peninsula. Native title In 2008 the Gudang Yadhaykenu together with the Atampaya and Seven Rivers Angkamuth communities, made an application for Native Title, which was successful in 2014, when their right to 680,000ha of land was recognized. In 2017 the Gudang Yadhaykenu leaders representing some 2000 people signed a development deal with former Macquarie banker Bill Moss to lease areas in 360,000ha and set up tourism and agribusinesses, with trust funds set aside for improvements in Gudang Yadhaykenu health care, education and employment opportunities.

Eloquentia Perfecta is a Latin phrase which means perfect eloquence. The meaning behind the phrase includes values of eloquent expression and action for the common good. For Jesuits, the term Eloquentia Perfecta was understood as the joining of knowledge and wisdom with virtue and morality. Eloquentia was born, as a concept, in the rhetorical studies of ancient Greece. However, the term Eloquentia Perfecta was coined in 1599 with the Ratio Studiorum, which laid out the groundwork for Jesuit educational curriculum. Steven Mailloux, a Professor of Rhetoric at LMU, concluded that \\"an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence.\\" This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding Spiritual Exercises to courses in American Colleges such as Loyola Marymount University, University of San Francisco, and Fordham University. According to the dean of Fordham in New York, Robert Grimes, Eloquentia Perfecta is composed of three characteristics--‚Äùthe right use of reason‚Ä¶ to be able to express your thoughts into words‚Ä¶ [and] to [communicate] gracefully, that is, do it in a way so that people are willing to listen to what you say‚Äù. LMU's core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that \\"It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening.\\" The second aspect is, \\"The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements.\\"  History  = Origins in Greek rhetorical thought = In classical Greek rhetorical thought the idea of a perfectly eloquent speaker was one who understood the subject matter they were speaking about in intimate detail, yet was able to communicate those same ideas in straightforward language that would be clearly understood by the listener they were addressing at the time. In Plato‚Äôs dialogue of Phaedrus, Socrates states this idea that a speaker must craft their discourse dependent on the intended listener in order to most effectively communicate, instruct, or persuade that listener. > [277b] Socrates A man must know the truth about all the particular things of > which he speaks or writes, and must be able to define everything separately; > then when he has defined them, he must know how to divide them by classes > until further division is impossible; and in the same way he must understand > the nature of the soul, [277c] must find out the class of speech adapted to > each nature, and must arrange and adorn his discourse accordingly, offering > to the complex soul elaborate and harmonious discourses, and simple talks to > the simple soul. Until he has attained to all this, he will not be able to > speak by the method of art, so far as speech can be controlled by method, > either for purposes of instruction or of persuasion. This has been taught by > our whole preceding discussion. = 1534 - 1599 The Early Jesuit Order and the first Jesuit School = The Jesuit order, or Society of Jesus, was founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius de Loyola (1491-1556) who was a Basque nobleman and soldier. After having his leg broken by a cannon ball in battle, Ignatius spent time recovering and studying scripture. During his convalescence he underwent a spiritual awakening and decided to dedicate his life to serving God. He also decided that the best way to do this was to continue his education and join the clergy. In 1534, while attending the University of Paris, Ignatius along with several of his classmates decided to commit themselves to the service of the Lord and took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Pope. They imagined themselves as soldiers of the Lord and named their order Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s or Company of Jesus. It was not until 1540 that the order was recognized by the Pope and officially formed as the Society of Jesus or Jesuit Order. Education was not the original goal of the Jesuits. They had intended to work as missionaries to the Holy land, converting people to Christianity and saving souls. However in an effort to compete with Christian protestants and reformers in Europe a need was recognized by the Roman Catholic church for better educated clergy. Through the Council of Trent (1546‚Äì63) the Jesuits were called on by the Pope to help improve the education of clergy. In 1548 the first Jesuit school was opened in Sicily, in the town of Messina. The town of Messina offered to support the school for young clergy and provide a building as well as board for the Jesuits as long as the Jesuits would also educate the young men of the town. By 1556, the year of St. Ignatius de Loyola‚Äôs death, there were 35 Jesuit colleges operating in Europe. = 1599 - 1773 Ratio Studiorum and expansion of Jesuit schools through Europe = Through the work in the school in Messina and other Jesuit colleges, the Jesuits began to formulate an approach to education that was formalized in a document titled the Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu (The Official Plan for Jesuit Education), or often shortened to Ratio Studiorum (Latin: Plan of Studies). The Ratio Studiorum provided the primary and static conventions for Jesuit teaching for 400 years. It was sufficient in outlining what should be strived for and the core values of Jesuit education. This plan contained such revolutionary ideas as segregating students into smaller groups by their level or ability in a subject. The curriculum consisted heavily of study of classical subjects such as theology, philosophy, Latin and Greek. The goal of the Ratio Studiorum was not only to educated better clergy but to also do Gods work by also improving the world by creating better educated and compassionate civic leaders. Over the next two hundred years Jesuit schools spread through Europe and beyond. By 1599 there were 245 Jesuit colleges in operation. The growth continued until 1773, when it is estimated that the Jesuits operated over eight hundred separate schools, colleges, seminaries and universities across the globe. = 1773 - 1814 Suppression of the Jesuit Order by Pope Clement XIV = In July of 1773, the Jesuit order was suppressed by an order from Pope Clement XIV and all Jesuit colleges under Papal rule were closed indefinitely. Only schools located in Prussia remained open as Jesuits in Europe, the Americas, India, and Asia obeyed the orders of the Pope and closed the institutions. = 1814 - 1900 Restoration of the Jesuit order and Founding of new colleges = In August 1814, the suppression of the Jesuit order was reversed. Following the restoration the Jesuit order founded several new universities and expanded into the United States of America. The Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU) began in 1789 when Georgetown University was founded in Washington, D.C. Saint Louis University, founded in 1818 in St. Louis, Missouri, is the second oldest Jesuit university in the United States. = 1900s - Translation of traditions into the modern perspective = The goal of education, being strengthening the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence, remained. However, by the mid-20th century, the modern world called for adjustments to the curriculum. Vatican II, or the Second Vatican Council, took place from 1962-1965. After the Council, members of the Jesuit academic world began taking into account the characteristics of a contemporary world that was evolving at a quick pace. The Society‚Äôs new goal at this time was to consolidate the identity of Jesuit education, and to achieve this they sought out particular ways of teaching. 1975 saw a modern adaptation of the Society of Jesus‚Äô goals. For example, the traditional goals of the Society, which were set forth in 1540, were translated after the 32nd General Congregation of Jesuits held in Rome from 1974-1975. ‚ÄúDefense and propagation of the faith‚Äù turned into ‚Äúservice of faith and promotion of justice which it includes,‚Äù and ‚Äúsalvation and protection of souls‚Äù became ‚Äútotal integration and liberation of man leading to participation in the life of God.\\" In 1986, the Jesuit Society released The Characteristics of Jesuit Education. This document set forth a concept for modern Jesuit education, which was reiterated in greater detail with the 1993 document Ignatian Pedagogy: A Practical Approach. These two documents, detailing the values of education and how to approach them in a classroom setting, set the stage for contemporary Jesuit education.  Education  = Jesuit Rhetoric = The phrase Eloquentia Perfecta was aimed to produce a Christian version of a classical ideal speaker, one who is good in writing and presenting for the common good. This has remained the Jesuit goal over the last three and a half centuries. Rhetoric can be described as the way one arranges and expresses a thought in a way to adapt and influence someone else's mind. Jesuit rhetoric is often presented with strong emotions. It is important to know what the perfect orator is also considering of the safety and welfare of the whole community and not only their own dignity. Jesuit schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal orators by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum in colleges. Jesuit rhetoric has evolved from teaching, preaching, running missions, as well as hearing confessions. While their teachings have stayed fairly similar, Jesuits changed their phrasing which changed the most in order to be better heard by their followers. In 1599, the Society of Jesus was presented with Ratio Studiorum, which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric. Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. Gert Beista, the author of The Beautiful Risk of Education, explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, \\"reconnecting with the question of purpose in education.\\" The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‚Äò‚Äòdo something‚Äô‚Äô within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is socialization where Beista states that, \\"Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders.\\" The last objective is what Beista likes to call, subjectification. This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions. American schools are trying to revitalize traditions for rhetoric in relation to core curriculum. There is a new focus on combining written and oral rhetoric, speaking and listening with writing and reading. Media is becoming the biggest way to receive messages across the world, but it is also one of the greatest mediators. Jesuit schools are also engaging literacy with other forms of expression such as the new digital revolution and new media technologies which are visual, aural, kinesthetic, and verbal. = Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit Colleges = After the American Civil War, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature. This however did not stick and there was a decline in the teachings of Latin especially. In 1814, there was an official restoration of the society which the phrase Eloquentia Perfecta lived through. A type of eloquence not often talked about is the heroic. This term combines human skill and divine inspiration which has come from informed thinking, moral discernment, and civic responsibility. The core curriculum at Fordham University now incorporates four Eloquentia Perfecta seminars, differing from other classes in their direct focus on written and oral skills of communication. Fordham is not the only Jesuit institution to begin experimenting ways to incorporate this concept into modern academics. Clarke notes that such institutions are doing so since \\"every 10 years or so most institutions take a hard look at the structure and emphasis of their core curriculum to see whether adjustments or even major restructuring is in order.\\" Thus, eloquentia perfecta has been researched and incorporated much more recently, not that has been absent in Jesuit education completely, but the key term and attention to it has. In a sense, Jesuit institutions are beginning to explicitly teach Eloquentia Perfecta rather than implicitly. However, this concept will only continue to progress and change with the digital age, as students and the population as a whole have so many means of communication. It is the responsibility of the Jesuit institutions to uphold the concept and teachings of Eloquentia Perfecta, one that may even affirm the Jesuit identity among these institutions. Although Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by 20th midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. With the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included Ars Dicendi by German Jesuit Joseph Kleutgen, A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric, and The Art of Oratorical Composition both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, Charles Coppens. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary St. Stanislaus in Florissant, Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, ‚Äúthe art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.‚Äù He defines oratory as, ‚Äúthe branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.‚Äù Lastly, he defines eloquence as, ‚Äúthe expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.‚Äù = Ignation Pedagogy = The Eloquentia- based Ignation Pedagogy is aimed at educating the whole person. They integrate eloquence and critical thinking with moral discernment. Teaching methods and content that is being put out should be modeled on the institutional embeddedness of the first Jesuit ministries which were created post Vatican II with their emphasis on verbal dialogue and written conversation. Schools should strive to encompass what makes Jesuit education distinctive and incorporate rhetoric tradition in all historically rich aspects. True eloquence was thought to only exist when one was the perfect orator as the good person speaking well.  Eloquentia Perfecta in Modern Times  = Adaptation to Rhetorical Changes in Eloquentia Perfecta = Many scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive. Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, \\"News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media.\\" = Eloquentia Perfecta in the Digital Age = As many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people who use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, justice-based messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.  People  = People of the Past = Cicero (106 BC-43 BC) was a prominent rhetorician, philosopher, lawyer, and is considered the most notable of the Roman orators. When Cicero was twenty years old, he wrote De Inventione, a document that encapsulates the characteristics of first-century BC rhetoric. He believed that the perfect orator should speak eloquently and with dignity, and his ideals molded the values of Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit education. Marcus Fabius Quintilianus, also known as Quintilian, was an ancient Roman philosopher, orator, rhetorician who lived from 35 A.D. - 95 A.D. Quintilian embodied Eloquentia Perfecta with his philosophical work on rhetoric titled Insititutio Oratoria. The Institutio Oratoria was a piece advocating for a return to simpler language after a trend of highly embellished rhetoric spread across the Roman Empire. Quintilian laid the groundwork for the core value of Eloquentia Perfecta that states that the perfect speaker should be able to communicate in ways that are easy to understand. Cyprian Soarez synthesized the rhetorical theories of Cicero, Aristotle, and Quintilian in his rhetorical textbook titled De arte rhetorica. In this work, Soarez called for combining Christian morality with non-religious learning. Nicolas Caussin was a French Jesuit who theorized that there were three types of eloquence: human, divine, and heroic. These three distinguished types of eloquence each carry unique qualities. Caussin said that human eloquence is natural and admirable. Divine eloquence could be carried out by divine figures such as St. Paul and Isaiah. Caussin stated, ‚ÄúIn this incident appears how weak and meager is human eloquence, compared with the divine... Paul demolished the machinations of that rhetorician with a crushing blow of the spirit.‚Äù Heroic eloquence is a combination of ‚Äúhuman skill and divine inspiration.\\" = People of Modern Times = Father Pedro Arrupe made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings. He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals. Jeannie Gaffigan is a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian who exemplifies values of Eloquentia Perfecta in her work and life. Gaffigan was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham‚Äôs Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016. The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity. As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed. She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty. As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, ‚ÄúLove ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,‚Äù and spreads this faith through her many social platforms. Dr. Cinthia Gannett is a prominent educator who has taught and written about Eloquentia Perfecta throughout her career. Through her works and teaching, she intertwines traditional values of Eloquentia Perfecta with 21st century perspective.

It is perhaps the first book to define and explain the field of public relations.Danie du Plessis (ed), Introduction to Public Relations and Advertising; Lansdowne: Juta Education, 2000; ; p. 12. Bernays defines the counsel on public relations, as, more than a press agent, someone who can create a useful symbolic linkage among the masses. Appropriate messages should be crafted based on careful study of group psychology, and disseminated by not merely purveying but actually creating news. He gives examples from his early career and cites ideas from theorists including Walter Lippmann and Wilfred Trotter.  Synopsis  =Part I‚ÄîScope and Functions= Bernays describes how he solved various problems as a public relations counsel. These include: * Helping a hotel to defeat a rumor it was closing, by publicly renewing the contract of the famous and well-paid ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel. (pp. 14‚Äì16) * Selling bacon by asking a physician to conduct a survey confirming the dietary soundness of eating bacon for breakfast. (pp. 16‚Äì17) * Resolving a labor shortage in the Kansas wheat harvest by promoting the job, through the War Department and the Associated Press, to soldiers returning from World War I. Appealing to business men to hire soldiers in general. (pp. 21‚Äì24) * Promoting Lithuanian national identity by forming a Lithuanian National Council, disseminating information of interest respectively to intellectuals, politicians, sports fans, and other demographically profiled groups. Thus: \\"He reflected to those communities whose crystallized opinion would be helpful in guiding other opinions, facts which gave them the basis for conclusions favorable to Lithuania.\\" (pp. 24‚Äì27) * Bolstering the League of Nations by forming a diverse committee to advocate for it. \\"The public relations consultant, having assisted in the formation of this committee, called a meeting of women representing Democratic, Republican, radical, reactionary, club, society, professional and industrial groups, and suggested that they make a united appeal for national support of the League of Nations.\\" (pp. 31‚Äì32) Public opinion, he writes, is becoming more and more a matter of interest, as people seek out information about the world, and as various organizations attempt to create favorable impressions. Especially interested in public opinion are those companies‚Äîthe public utilities‚Äîwhich especially are supposed to serve the public. (pp. 41‚Äì46) The public relations counsel is a student of psychology, but also \\"a practitioner with a wide range of instruments\\": the circumstances he creates, followed by advertising, movies, letters, booklets, parades, articles, etc. (pp. 52‚Äì54) =Part II‚ÄîThe Group and Herd= \\"Public opinion\\", according to Bernays, is an amorphous group of judgments which are not well elaborated even in the head of a single average individual. He extracts a quotation from by Wilfred Trotter, which states that this average man has many strong convictions whose origin he can't explain (Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War, p. 36). People's minds have \\"logic- proof compartments\\" which must be approached by means beyond the rational. (pp. 61‚Äì68) After discussing the mutual influence between the press and the public, suggesting that the public relations counsel should understand the established public opinion in its complexity. He invokes the concept of \\"stereotype\\" described by Walter Lippmann, noting that the stereotypes people already hold govern what new facts they will absorb. He cites Everett Dean Martin's 1920 book The Behavior of Crowds, discussing how herd mentality can exaggerate people's unconscious urges, lower inhibitions, and heighten antagonism to other groups. Educated people can display this mentality just as the ignorant can. Bernays quotes Trotter stating that herd mentality affects people all the time, not only when they are part of an actual mob in the street. (pp. 98‚Äì110) The public relations practitioner, therefore, must tap into the current of group energy. (pp. 118‚Äì122) =Part III‚ÄîTechnique and Method= Modern America's size and heterogeneity \\"make it necessary to-day for the proponent of a point of view to engage an expert to represent him before society, an expert who must know how to reach groups totally dissimilar as to ideals, customs, and even language. It is this necessity which has resulted in the development of the counsel on public relations.\\" The skilled public relations man provides a valuable service in overcoming heterogeneity to influence millions of people in the same way. This is done by using established communication media to communicate the right facts at the right time. (pp. 125‚Äì138) People should be targeted as members of \\"interlapping groups\\" which involve different aspects of their identity. (139‚Äì146) For example, in promoting silk: silk was represented as fashionable to women's clubs, artistic to art-lovers, and historically interesting to schools. These different angles could appeal to different aspects of people's identity: > The school teacher was appealed to in the schoolroom as an educator, and > after school hours as a member of a women's club. She read the > advertisements about silk as a woman reader of the newspapers, and as a > member of the women's group which visited the museums, she saw the silk > there. The woman who stayed at home was brought into contact with the silk > through her child. (p. 146) Highlighting the correct group identity for the purpose at hand is much more effective than trying to change the stance of an individual group. Emphasizing changing external conditions, such as new technology, is also effective. Universal instincts such as self-preservation and sex can also be usefully invoked. Or, instinct-emotion pairs like flight-fear, revulsion-disgust, pugnacity-anger, and others. (pp. 146‚Äì153) \\"The public relations counsel sometimes uses the current stereotypes, sometimes combats them, and sometimes creates new ones.\\" (p. 162) As the methods of psychological influence are many and various, Bernays proposes to focus on fundamentals. He encourages the public relations counsel to imagine himself in turn as a member of the different groups he must reach, and thereafter construct a campaign which will appeal to as many as possible. For example, a hotel wishing to demonstrate its prominence can hold a public celebration with carefully chosen guests ‚Äî(including \\"a leading banker, a society woman, a prominent lawyer, an influential preacher, and so forth until a cross section of the city's most telling activities is mirrored in the committee.\\" (166‚Äì169). The public relations counsel must therefore generate news, \\"no matter what the medium which broadcasts this news.\\" > The public relations counsel must lift startling facts from his whole > subject and present them as news. He must isolate ideas and develop them > into events so that they can be more readily understood and so that they may > claim attention as news. Once interesting news is created it will propagate itself through media channels which already seek to capture public attention. (p. 171) =Part IV‚ÄîEthical Relations= Bernays continues his discussion of news and observes that journalists see public relations practitioners as important sources of newsworthy information. He stresses the centrality of newspapers to culture and writes that the public relations counselor must supply \\"truthful, accurate, and verifiable news\\" to remain in the journalists' good graces. (p. 177‚Äì183) The definition of \\"news\\" is not settled and varies from newspaper to newspaper. Bernays quotes William Henry Irwin's definition that news is \\"a departure from the established order\\". Then, he quotes Irwin's list of principles for newsworthiness, which he points out may somewhat contradict the definition:Will Irwin, \\"What is News?\\", Collier's Vol. 46, 18 March 1911, p. 16. # \\"We prefer to read about the things we like.\\" (\\"Power for the men, affections for the women.\\") # \\"Our interest in news increases in direct ratio to our familiarity with its subject, its setting, and its dramatis person√¶.\\" # \\"Our interest in news increases in direct ratio to the general importance of the persons or activities which it affects.\\" Often, Bernays quotes Lippmann, an \\"overt act\\" is necessary to clarify a state of affairs so that it can become news. Lippmann wrote that a press agent stands between the event and the press in order to control the flow of information. Bernays writes that a counsel on public relations does not merely purvey news but create it. The resulting material must of course be truthful and accurate‚Äîand furthermore it must be well-written and dispensed with sensitivity to the needs of the various media through which it will be broadcast. (pp. 191‚Äì198) Beyond the newspaper, there is radio, lecture tours, meetings, advertising (including billboards and any other type of paid space), plays, cinema, and direct mail. (pp. 199‚Äì207) Defending the role of the public relations counsel as a \\"special pleader\\", Bernays writes that the viewpoints which he fosters are not necessarily worse than those he would discourage. In reality, \\"the only difference between 'propaganda' and 'education,' really, is in the point of view. The advocacy of what we believe in is education. The advocacy of what we don't believe in is propaganda.\\" He quotes Elmer Davis's observation that \\"the relativity of truth is a commonplace to any newspaper man, even to one who has never studied epistemology.\\" (pp. 208‚Äì213) \\"The social value of the public relations counsel lies in the fact that he brings to the public facts and ideas of social utility which would not so readily gain acceptance otherwise.\\" (p. 216) Bernays concludes with a quotation from Ferdinand T√∂nnies which warns that civilization is under threat from lower instincts and that the \\"higher strata of society\\" must \\"inject moral and spiritual motives into public opinion.\\" (p. 217)  Response  Commentators acknowledged that Bernays was mapping out new territory with his book, which claimed to define the \\"counsel on public relations\\" for the first time. The New York Times called it \\"the first book to be devoted exclusively to the occupation which is gradually becoming of overwhelming national importance.\\" Opinions of its merit varied. H. L. Mencken called it a \\"pioneer book\\" at the time but later disparaged it. Future senator Ernest Gruening, in a review called \\"Higher Hokum\\", asked whether persuading the public was much preferable to corralling them by heavier-handed means (the \\"public be damned\\" approach)‚Äîwhether the end result would \\"be greatly different for the public which, while it no longer tolerates being 'damned,' guilelessly permits itself to be 'bunked'? Is seduction preferable to ravishment?\\"Larry Tye, The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations; New York: Crown, 1998; ; pp. 96‚Äì99.  Critical analysis  Crystallizing Public Opinion appeared the year after Lippmann's Public Opinion and can be construed as an application of Lippman's principles to the active manipulation of public opinion.Stuart Ewen, PR! A Social History of Spin; New York: Basic Books (Perseus), 1996; ; p. 164. \\"In 1923, just a year after Lippmann published his tome, Public Opinion, Bernays answered with his own book, Crystallizing Public Opinion. Five years later‚Äîagain just a year after Lippmann's The Phantom Public appeared‚ÄîBernays published a second book on public relations, Propaganda. If Lippmann's prose was intended to sway the thinking of socially cognizant leaders and intellectuals, Bernays's writing style was meant for practitioners in the trenches; his primary interest was to frame the job of public relations counsel in ways that would allow practitioners to take advantage of the insights of modern social and psychological thought. Lippmann's books were filled with intricate ruminations on the processes of human epistemology and theoretical speculations on how these processes might pertain to the project of molding public opinion. Bernays's books were punctuated throughout by vivid narratives‚Äîstories of Bernays's earliest campaigns, public relations feats, and commonplace sales situations‚Äîeach presented to demonstrate how social psychology, and the social scientific approach more generally, might be employed in the everyday work of a publicist.\\" Whereas Lippmann saw a bigger role for government in steering public opinion, Bernays focused on the corporation and its public relations attach√©.C√©sar Garc√≠a, \\"Rethinking Walter Lippmann‚Äôs legacy in the history of public relations\\", PRism 7(2), 2010; p. 4. Professor Sue Curry Jansen argues that Bernays distorted Lippman's work (and that public relations historians such as Stuart Ewen and Larry Tye have uncritically recapitulated Bernays on this point). She writes that Public Opinion is an analysis of the constraints on rationality which confront a democratic society and that \\"Bernays systematically inverts Lippmann‚Äôs critique into an apology for public relations by selectively and deceptively quoting him in support of positions that Lippmann clearly rejects.\\" Whereas Lippmann treated the stereotype as a sort of blind spot, or obstacle to rational thinking, Bernays viewed it as \\"a great aid to the public relations counsel\\" despite being \\"not necessarily truthful\\". She also finds that Crystallizing Public Opinion sometimes attributions quotations to Lippmann which do not match the text of Public Opinion at all.Sue Curry Jansen, \\"Semantic Tyranny: How Edward L. Bernays Stole Walter Lippmann‚Äôs Mojo and Got Away With It and Why It Still Matters\\", International Journal of Communication 7 (2013), 1094‚Äì1111.  Links  * Scan of book at Internet Archive.

Jeger Troop has special reconnaissance (SR) in and around built- up areas as the main focus. The troop was initially created as a one-year pilot program in 2014 by FSK that was later extended for another three years and in 2017 was declared a success. It is reported to be the world's first all-female special forces unit. Background The Norwegian Armed Forces has conscription for all males who are liable for compulsory military service from the year they turn 19 years of age, until the end of the year in which they reach the age of 44 which was originally introduced in 1897. Following the Second World War, women were allowed to serve as voluntary reservists in 1959, in 1976 this changed to allow entry to regular service in non-combat roles and in 1984 all combat positions became open to women. From 2009, all women were obligated to meet the conscription board, the same as males, however military service remained voluntary. In January 2015, the law changed to extend conscription to women, making Norway the first NATO member and first European country to make military service compulsory for both sexes. The Norwegian Armed Forces have a stated objective of increasing female membership to 20 per cent by 2020. During the War in Afghanistan, FSK commanders saw an operational need for female operators who would be able to communicate directly with women to gather intelligence and build community relations as male operators were forbidden from speaking to women due to religious and cultural constraints. The FSK had been tasked with mentoring the Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs Crisis Response Unit (CRU-222) based in Kabul and required female advisers for the CRU and also for arrests to take care of women and children. Women had been eligible for entry into Norwegian Special Operation Forces, against the same male selection criteria, with several making it through the admission process but none had completed the selection phase being unable to compete with the physical strength of the males. History In March 2013, planning for the unit began under the code name \\"Tundra\\", spearheaded by the former and current heads of the FSK, Eirik Johan Kristoffersen and his younger brother Frode Arnfinn Kristoffersen, and the first class began training in June 2014. In 2014, out of 317 applicants for Jeger Troop‚Äôs founding selection program only 88 passed the selection course with 20 completing the 10 month training program and 13 going on to form the unit in 2015. In 2015, there were 196 applicants, with 37 making it through the selection, 17 completed the training and 14 joined the unit. The majority of applicants have a strong sporting background. Jeger Troop was the subject of a 2016 NRK documentary Jenter for Norge () for which a camera crew followed trainees for almost the full year of their training. No Jeger Troop operator has deployed operationally. Selection and training Candidates are selected based on attitude and physical fitness, the minimum physical standards are: one pull-up; 20 push- ups; 35 sit-ups in two minutes or less; 20 back extensions; swim , with no underwater phobia; and perform a road run carrying in 59 minutes. In addition there are required tests in medicine ball throw, standing long jump, and 3000-meter run which will not disqualify, but do count towards selection. There is a 3 week pre-selection course learning basic skills before commencing the week long selection course named \\"hell week\\" that is a test of mental and physical strength involving long marches over several days with little time for rest, and minimum amounts of food and water. Applicants then face a 10 month training program that includes a patrol course, survival course, shooting course, communications course, medical course, parachute course, winter training, winter exercise, close combat course, close quarter battle (CQB) course, vehicle course and urban special reconnaissance course culminating in a final exercise. To complete the program, candidates must be able to march 15 km (9 miles) in full gear ( backpack, weapon, boots) through forests within two hours and 15 minutes or less; perform 50 sit-ups in two minutes, six pull-ups and 40 push-ups; run in 13 minutes or less; and swim in 11 minutes or less, the first 25 metres underwater. In the first year, trainees recreated the World War II sinking of SF Hydro during Operation Gunnerside. The unit trains at Rena leir army camp in Rena.

On 13 February 2017, Koh was abducted by a group of men in Petaling Jaya while on his way to a friend's house. It was captured on CCTV that at least 15 men in three black SUVs were part of the abduction. Police have arrested a man as part of investigations into the subsequent alleged extortion of Koh's family, and later obtained an extension of his remand. However, the police say there is no clue to the pastor's whereabouts. The Inspector-General of Police, Khalid Abu Bakar, says authorities are investigating three possibilities: the first being the pastor‚Äôs personal issues, second being extremist activities and third being kidnap-for-ransom. There are possible links to Koh's role as a Christian activist at a time when Malaysia is moving to enforce stricter Islamic laws. The pastor was involved in a controversy in 2011, after being accused of proselytising Muslims. A box containing two bullets, with a note in written in Malay threatening his life, had been sent to Koh's house. The Malaysian Government Opposition Leader, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, compares Koh's abduction to that of another social activist, Amri Che Mat, who went missing in November 2016. Human rights group Hakam expressed concern over the apparent abduction of another pastor, Joshua Hilmi, and his wife Ruth who also went missing in November 2016. As of August 2018, Koh was still missing with no further information. Following the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia's (SUHAKAM) announcement that its findings concluded that the Malaysian Special Branch (SB) was responsible for the disappearances of Amri and Raymond, and still missing as of 2019, acting Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) Abdul Hamid Bador rapped SUHAKAM for causing negative impact towards the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM). Abdul Hamid added that he was confident that Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohamad Fuzi Harun, then SB Director, would provide an answer to the allegations.

When he gave the speech for prayers at the Abuzar Mosque, a bomb in the tape recorder placed in front of him exploded and his arm, vocal cords and lungs were seriously injured. Background The assassinations in June 1981 commenced by attacking Ali Khamenei and was followed by bombing at the headquarters of the Islamic Republican Party (IRP) in Tehran. Event Five days after Banisadr was deposed, the news of the day was about the Iran‚ÄìIraq War after the declaration of armed conflict. On 27 June 1981, while Ali Khamenei had returned from the frontline and had visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, he went to the Abuzar Mosque to give a speech to the prayers as per his Saturday schedule. At that time, he was the Ayatollah Khomeini‚Äôs representative at the Supreme Council of National Defense. After the first prayer, Ayatollah Khamenei began to answer questions submitted by listeners. A tape recorder with papers was set on the desk in front of Ali Khamenei by a young man who pressed the play button. After one minute the tape recorder sounded like a loud whistle and then exploded. After the bombing the clerics praying at the mosque said that the tape recorder was divided into two parts and on the inner wall of the tape recorder was written \\"the gift of Forqan Group to Islamic republic\\". The convalescence of Ayatollah Khamenei took several months and his arm, vocal cords and lungs were seriously injured.

It was written in reaction to the forced relocation of black South Africans from Sophiatown, to the new township of Meadowlands. The song was popularised by a number of musicians, including Dorothy Masuka and Miriam Makeba, and became an anthem of the movement against apartheid. Background The Afrikaner National Party (NP) was elected to power in South Africa in 1948, and remained in control of the government for the next 46 years. The white minority held all political power during this time, and implemented the system of apartheid. \\"Apartheid\\" involved a brutal system of racial segregation, and the word itself meant \\"separateness\\" in Afrikaans. Black South Africans were forced to live in poverty stricken townships, and were denied basic human rights, based on the idea that South Africa belonged to white people. The NP government passed the Group Areas Act in 1950 and the Bantu Resettlement Act in 1954. These laws forcibly relocated millions of South Africans into townships in racially segregated areas. This relocation was part of a plan to separate the black population of South Africa into tiny, impoverished bantustans. The settlement of Sophiatown was destroyed during the implementation of this plan in 1955, and its 60,000 inhabitants forcibly moved. Many of them were sent to a settlement known as Meadowlands. Sophiatown had been a cultural centre, particularly for African jazz music, prior to the relocation. Composition and performance The forced move away from the Sophiatown township inspired Strike Vilakezi to compose \\"Meadowlands\\". Originally sung by Nancy Jacobs and Her Sisters, \\"Meadowlands\\" was set to an \\"infectious jive beat\\". It featured music writer Todd Matshikiza on the piano. As with many other protest songs of this period, \\"Meadowlands\\" was made popular both within and outside South Africa by Miriam Makeba, and it became an anthem of the movement against apartheid. Several other songs, including Makeba's \\"Sophiatown is Gone\\", and \\"Bye Bye Sophiatown\\" by the Sun Valley Sisters, also referred to the relocation from Sophiatown. \\"Meadowlands\\" has subsequently been quoted in compositions by South African musicians, especially in Cape Town, and was covered by several artists, including the Tulips, and Dolly Rathebe. The song was performed outside South Africa by several artists during the apartheid era, helping \\"expose the injustices suffered by oppressed racial groups\\", according to commentator Michaela Vershbow. In 2007, it was included in the collection \\"Essential South African Jazz.\\" Lyrics and interpretation The lyrics of the song were written in three languages; IsiZulu, SeSotho, and tsotsitaal, or street slang. \\"Meadowlands\\" was superficially sunny and upbeat, including the line \\"We're moving night and day to go to Meadowlands / We love Meadowlands.\\" This led the South African government to mistakenly believe that the song supported the relocation program. This interpretation was the result of the government relying on a literal translation of the lyrics. The government was so pleased with the song that Vilakezi was praised by a bureaucrat for the song, and reportedly, had a housing application approved. However, the lyrics were intended to be ironic. The residents of Sophiatown understood this interpretation, and sang the song as their possessions were removed from the township by government trucks. Thus the song has been referred to as a notable example of using ambiguous meaning to convey anti-government sentiment in a covert manner. Vershbow describes the lyrics of the song, such as \\"We will move all night and day / To go stay in Meadowlands / You'll hear the white people saying / Let's go to Meadowlands\\", as expressing the emotional devastation of the forced move. Scholar Gwen Ansell stated that it was \\"as rich in nuance as a traditional fable\\".

The art blog also collects donations to support nonprofits doing work for immigrant populations such as the ACLU, the American Immigration Council and the International Rescue Committee.  Origins  Riding Up Front was originally a personal blog of Tan's that aimed to record memorable conversations she had with her Uber, Lyft and Taxi drivers during business trips. Following the 2016 American elections, Tan realized there was a growing animosity toward immigrants largely fueled by a lack of understanding. In January 2016, the President Trump issued the travel ban. Consequently, Tan and Dr. Anais Rameau, RUF Board Chair, decided to expand the personal blog into a community-driven creative project in hope to humanize immigrants in light of the current political climate, both in the U.S. and worldwide.

However, a tick plague in the late 1890s and the Federation Drought in the early 1900s forced Pattison to take any available work. Therefore, he qualified as an engine driver, learnt to bore wells, and became a bookkeeper on a cattle station near Normanton, Queensland. It was while he was a bookkeeper in Townsville, he began to experiment in professional writing, by contributing stock paragraphs for newspapers in Townsville. While in North Queensland, Pattison accepted a position as a cattle buyer for the Merinda Meatworks near Bowen, Queensland.

It is celebrated in the memory Lord Bikshantar who will be provided food by Karaikal Ammaiyar, that is Amuthu Padayal in Tamil. Reason of the celebration This festival's history relies on Karaikkal Ammaiyar's life. One day Ammaiyar's husband, Paramathathan, had sent two mangoes to be kept for him. That day a hungry Shaiva devotee (Lord Bikshantar) came to her residence. Ammaiyar gave the devotee, curd rice and one of the two mangoes which her husband gave earlier. Later, when Ammaiyar's husband came home, Ammaiyar served him the other mango. The mango was delicious, and her husband requested that the other mango be served. Ammaiyar went inside kitchen, she didn't know what to do since the mango was already served to the shaiva devotee (Lord Bikshantar). With Lord Siva's grace a Divine Mango appeared in her palm. Ammaiyaar was very happy and served the mango to her husband.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mangani- festival-celebrated/article3600856.ece#! As this fruit was divinely sweet and was infinitely delicious compared to the previous one, her husband inquired as to how Ammaiyar obtained this mango. Subsequently,Karaikkal Ammaiyar worshiped Lord's feet and revealed the truth to her husband, who didn't believe it. He asked her to show another mango with divine help. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva for another mango. Immediately Lord Shiva gave her a similar mango, which she gave it to her husband. The mango then disappeared, and Paramathathan realised the divine nature of his wife. He understood that Ammaiyar was worthy of worship and she cannot be treated as his wife. He then deserted Ammaiyar, becoming a trader and married the daughter of a merchant who then gave birth to their child. Paramathathan named the child with the real name of Ammaiyar, Punithavathi. When the word reached Ammaiyar's family, they decided that they must take her to him. When he saw his former wife, Paramathathan addressed her reverentially, saying that he realised Ammaiyar was no ordinary human being. He worshipped her with his wife and child. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva asking for a boon that she may worship Lord Shiva as a disembodied wraith. She received the boon, and leaving all her beauty and her body behind. This was the reason of formation of this grand festival of Mangani.http://temple.dinamalar.com/news_detail.php?id=44678 Celebration The celebration is celebrated in the Tamil month of Aani (June‚ÄìJuly)lasting a month. Each day the Panchamurthi or the Five divine Gods idol are taken through each streets of Karaikal. On the main day of the festival the huge idol of Lord Bikshatanar is taken through the streets. On the same day, people of Karaikal throw Mangani or Mangoes from their roof towards the crowd. Goodness of eating the Mango caught in the festival are: * The blessings of Lord Shiva is obtained. * Those who did not get child for long years give birth child.

They have different personalities and seek a humble life by stage drama performances. The maternal uncle allowed only Lava and Kusa to act in drama performance, while Jai is not allowed due to his stammering disability, although Jai has a talent in speech delivery and also in way of acting. Lava and Kusa also started sidelining and humiliating Jai. Even though, Lava and Kusa tried to see Jai on their mothers death, because the person who loved Jai a lot at that time is Jai's mother. An instigated and a humiliated Jai later sets the drama stage on fire and flees. After 20 years, all three brothers have become adults. They have separated, they are scattered and seek their own lives in different places.

He happens to meet his twin brother Lava, a bank manager who adheres to his principles and runs an ethical life. Lava is an example for over goodness and gets entangled in many problems with his life because of it, with the fear of losing his job,he gives a loan for land to build a lake but the buyer cheats Lava because the buyer actually used the loan to build a beer shop. And his love, Priya, his marriage broker whom he had fallen in love with, when his marriage was fixed and he realized about his love towards her when she did not talk, meet or see him. Kusa hatches a plan to go to the bank and impersonate Lava, while Lava tries to make Priya, whose marriage was fixed, fall for him. He says that she too loves him but does not accept because of her family, and she never said that she does not love him and only says to go. Priya soon accepts his love. However, Kusa cheats Lava and runs away with the money. Priya disappears, and her father files a kidnap case on Lava because her younger sister claims that she saw Lava kidnap Priya and run away. Priya's father, sister, and a police officer arrive at Lava's house. Lava swears that he did not kidnap Priya. He then receives a call from a colleague, V. A. Rajini, at his bank. She says that there is footage of him stealing money in the bank's locker room. Lava, realizing that Kusa had cheated him, asks the police officer to find Kusa. Kusa is already captured by the police officer and is tied up inside of a truck, where Lava and the police officer go. Lava confronts Kusa and asks him about the whereabouts of Priya. Kusa says that he did not kidnap Priya but did take the money. Lava and Kusa venture that if both of them are alive, Jai may also be. The police officer reveals his identity as Kaakha, who is Jai's mentor, and says that Jai's name is not Jai but Ravan. He pretends to arrest them so that he can bring Lava and Kusa to Ravan (Jai) to kill them. Kaakha narrates the story about Jai after the fire accident. He says that Ravan (Jai) actually started the fire on purpose and then fled to a dangerous town in which Kaakha met Jai and raised him as his own under the name Ravan. Ravan, now a dreadful, powerful and ruthless gangster in small village of Odisha. Ravan (Jai) was trying to gain a seat in politics, but his temper made him an enemy to the public. He has brought them to his house to use Lava and his kindness to woo the people into voting for Ravan (Jai). The Kaakha also tells that Ravan learned the weaknesses of both Lava and Kusa and stole Priya and the money, respectively. After knowing the truth about Ravan (Jai), Lava and Kusa are taken to Ravan (Jai)'s house. Ravan (Jai) shows Lava and Kusa Priya and the money, respectively. Ravan (Jai) tells Lava his role and Kusa that he has to woo Simran, a woman that tried to kill Ravan. Ravan (Jai) also says that they have to change their outfits like him and follow his mentor Kaakha. An empathetic Lava realises his mistake in his childhood, tries to change Ravan as Jai, with the help of Priya, while Kusa tries to escape from Ravan. Meanwhile, Lava succeeds by gaining the love of the public while impersonating Ravan (Jai). Kusa meets Simran, who is trying to take revenge on Ravan for her brother's death, who used to work for Ravan (Jai) but ended up getting killed by Ravan's enemies. Kusa makes a deal with Simran that she has to act like Ravan's lover so that Kusa can get his money back and Simran can take her revenge on Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the truth to Lava and Priya about his deal with Simran. Ravan (Jai) overhears the plan and angrily tries to kill Lava and Kusa. Lava begs Ravan (Jai) to leave Kusa. Just then, he receives a call in which he is told that he is the frontrunner for winning the election. Lava and Kusa hatch a plan to bring their brother back with them. They do a play in which emotional breakdowns occur in trying to convince Ravan (Jai) to be their brother again. Ravan (Jai), overcome with emotion, storms out. Later, it is known that Ravan is secretly trying to kill his brothers. The next day, Lava and Kusa drive a car that has a bomb attached to it. After they leave, Ravan (Jai) reveals his plan to kill Lava and Kusa. The uncle begs Ravan (Jai) to save Lava and Kusa, but Ravan (Jai) does not listen. Then, the uncle asks Kaakha to tell Ravan (Jai) to not kill Lava and Kusa. Kaakha comes to know that he told Kusa this, thinking that he was Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the plan to Lava while they are driving, and they understand Ravan (Jai) and decide to die. Sarkar, who is seeking to take revenge on Ravan (Jai) for his win in the election, stops the car. Sarkar thinks that there are only twins and says that whoever reveals their identity as Ravan (Jai) will be killed and the other will be spared. Both Lava and Kusa pretend to be Ravan (Jai), and in frustration, Sarkar shoots Lava. As Kusa is screaming Lava's name after he is shot, Sarkar thinks that Kusa is actually Ravan if the person that he just shot is Lava. A fight ensues to try and kill them both. Raavan arrives, saving both Lava and Kusa. However, in the ensuing fight he is gravely injured, yet is successful in killing Sarkar. Jai conveys his affection to his brothers before succumbing to his injuries.  Cast  * N. T.

Early life  Mary Florence Wilson was born on January 29, 1884, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the youngest of a large family, the daughter of Colonel William B. Wilson and Sarah Urich. Known to the library world as Florence Wilson, she was a true generalist, interested in everything around her. Wilson was educated at Gibson's College Preparatory School in Philadelphia, and wanted to become a social worker, but due to her delicate health could not obtain permission from her father. She studied at the Drexel Institute the University of Pennsylvania Extension Division, and Columbia University, where she also worked as a librarian. She graduated from the Drexel Institute Library School in 1909, after finally gaining the reluctant consent of her father. From the date of her graduation until 1917, she was a librarian with Columbia University Library. During those years she was involved in a variety of tasks. She organized the drama and English libraries of Columbia University and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was an instructor in cataloging and classification as well as librarian of the natural science library during the last four years at Columbia. Among her many specialties, she also specialized in international relations.  Paris Peace Conference  In 1917 Wilson participated in the Paris Peace Conference, working as a liaison officer of the American Library Association and the Library of Congress. Following that, in 1918‚Äì1919, she became only female member of the American Peace Commission, and only female participant of the conference in general. Her job was taking care of documentation and historical work. Due to the work concerning the conference, she was asked to establish and organize the League of Nations library.  League of Nations  Route Marie-Florence WILSON - Route de Ferney Due to her work with the American Peace Commission, Wilson was \\"asked to organize library of the new League of Nations\\" (p. 110). When she took this position, she was the only \\"female library director in all of Europe\\". She worked as Assistant Librarian to the League of Nations (Second Division) from October 1, 1919, to May 31, 1922, at which point she was promoted to Librarian of the League of Nations (First Division), serving there from June 1, 1922, to December 31, 1926. As Chief of Section, she oversaw a substantial division on the League: between 1921 and 1922, her yearly budget for acquisition of books was $40,000 and she supervised 13 highly qualified librarians. Despite the importance of her position, Wilson's wages comprised less than half of those of her male colleagues. Her role in establishing the organization of the League of Nations Library meant she was responsible for the standardizing text references in a way that was accessible to a large international body. Her initial choice of the American referencing system was challenged by members of the League who favored their own systems of library referencing. After researching multiple European and international libraries, she settled on the Dewey system of referencing, favoring its internationalist appeal for the League. Wilson had a vision for the League of Nations Library as an accessible resource for League members, utilizing a complete bibliography of documents. Unfortunately, she left her position at the League in 1926, before her vision was fulfilled.  After the League of Nations  After her League of Nations work, Wilson never returned to the libraries, choosing instead to focus on volunteer work, especially after the Second World War, as a part of Americaine de Secours Civil. From 1927 until 1929, she worked as an administrator and consultant for the European Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on organization of Endowment's International Mind Alcoves and International Relations Clubs. She was also library advisor for organization's director and American libraries abroad, for example Cairo. In 1927, she travelled through Egypt, Syria, Turkey and Greece, conducting research on American educational facilities for the European Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, results of which were published in Near East Educational Survey. As a part of this work, she travelled to Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece and Turkey in 1928, in which year her analysis of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the process of its creation was published.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the division fought in the Siege of Leningrad until the end of the siege in early 1944, when it advanced into eastern Estonia. The 281st was soon moved north to fight against Finland during the summer of that year, and after Finland's withdrawal from the war fought in battles in East Prussia and Poland during early 1945. The division was disbanded in the summer of 1945.  History  The 281st Rifle Division began forming on 10 July 1941 at Leningrad from reservists. The division's basic order of battle included the 1062nd, 1064th, and the 1066th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 816th Artillery Regiment. It was brought up to strength in July by around 3,000 untrained civilians from Leningrad volunteer \\"fighter battalions.\\" On 13 August, it was sent to the defensive line at Kingisepp, south of the city. For most of the rest of the year, the 281st was a \\"fire brigade\\", directly subordinated to the Leningrad Front. On 17 December, the division transferred to the 54th Army, which was fighting to the east of the Volkhov River. The 281st fought in the Volkhov area as part of the 54th Army, which became part of the Volkhov Front. After the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive ended the Siege of Leningrad in February 1944, the Volkhov Front was disbanded, and the division became part of the 8th Army. The 282nd fought in the Narva area but was soon transferred to the 98th Rifle Corps. The 98th Rifle Corps became part of the 23rd Army, and the division fought in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive, a Soviet attack in the Karelian Isthmus during the summer of 1944, which resulted in the withdrawal of Finland from the war in September. After spending September in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, the 281st and the 98th Rifle Corps moved south to become part of the 2nd Shock Army. The 282nd fought in the East Prussian Offensive and the East Pomeranian Offensive in early 1945.

In the episode, the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) and his new companion Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) visit an off-Earth colony only to find it devoid of any life except for robots that communicate via emoji. Synopsis Despite Nardole's caution, the Twelfth Doctor allows Bill to select her first destination for a trip in the TARDIS. They land in the far future on an off-world Earth colony. The colony is empty except for millions of nanobots called the Vardy that maintain it, along with robotic avatars that interact with the pair via emoji. The robots give the Doctor and Bill badges which report their emotions also through emoji‚Äîseemingly the only way to communicate with the Vardy. The Emojibots, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition. The Doctor suspects they have arrived before the full colony ship is due, but remains curious as to the absence of any type of pre-colony crew preparing for their arrival. They discover the bones of these humans being used for fertiliser. The Doctor realises that if the Vardy sense they are not happy, the nanobots will consume them to their skeletons, and warns Bill to keep smiling as they escape. The Doctor locates the ship that brought the pre- colony crew to the planet, planning on overloading its reactor to destroy the Vardy before the arrival of the unsuspecting colonists. However, Bill discovers a young boy who leads her to a large number of hibernation chambers including some humans just awaking; the Doctor realises that this is the colony ship. The pair review the ship's logs from the non-hibernating flight crew. The Vardy were programmed to help construct and operate the colony and make the colonists happy, monitoring the emotional state of the colonists through the emotion badges and avatars. When one of the flight crew died naturally, it created grief amongst the crew that the avatars were not programmed to register. The Vardy took this as a sign of disease, and killed those who displayed unhappiness. This created a \\"grief tsunami\\" which rapidly wiped out the flight crew, and will likely wipe out the waking colonists when they discover what happened. The colonists believe they must combat the Vardy to protect their hibernating crew, while the Vardy start to show the beginnings of sentience through self-defence. Failing to dissuade any fighting, the Doctor resolves the situation by \\"resetting\\" the Vardy to their original state, before they saw grief as a disease. The Doctor offers to help negotiate between the colonists and Vardy to avoid the same mistake. Later, the Doctor and Bill return to Earth, but find themselves on the frozen Thames as an elephant looks on. = Continuity = The Doctor mentions that there are many Scotlands in space, all striving for independence.

He went on to say ‚ÄòThe Doctor and Bill's growing friendship and Bill's character in particular are the real joys of \\"Smile\\"'. Writing for IGN, Scott Collura also praised the Doctor's relationship with Bill, stating he's ‚Äòtotally sold on this new Doctor/Bill dynamic at this point, and this season's new direction as well.'

It was written by Mike Bartlett and was broadcast on 6 May 2017 on BBC One. \\"Knock Knock\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, receiving criticism regarding the strength of the writing, but praise on the quality of the performances in the story, particularly Suchet's. Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) and her friends rent a house to live in after a recommendation from its landlord, played by guest star David Suchet, but the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) notices something wrong with the house when the floor and the walls creak and creatures come crawling out of the wood. Synopsis Bill and five students (Shireen, Pavel, Harry, Felicity and Paul), seeking to room together, take an offer by an elderly Landlord for a large mansion at very low cost, as long as they do not enter the tower. Bill gets the Twelfth Doctor to help with her move. The Doctor inserts himself among Bill's friends, to Bill's consternation, and is troubled by the numerous noises the house makes. Later, the Landlord mysteriously appears, ostensibly to check on the students. Suspicious of him, the Doctor tests him by asking who the Prime Minister is and names several, including Harriet Jones. The Landlord, however, evades the question and leaves. As night falls, the knocking noises grow, and Bill's friends start to disappear. All the exits from the house are sealed tight, preventing any of them from leaving and separating the remaining ones. Bill and Shireen see Pavel half-absorbed in the wall, and the Landlord appears, striking a tuning fork which causes Pavel to disappear completely. The Doctor discovers the house's woodwork infested with insect-like creatures he calls Dryads. They are responsible for drawing the others into the woodwork prior to consuming them. The Doctor and Harry soon find evidence that every twenty years, a new set of students have been brought to the house to feed the Dryads. The Landlord arrives and admits that he needs the Dryads to keep his daughter Eliza alive in the tower. Eliza, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition The Doctor and Bill converge on the tower, finding Eliza's body is now made completely of wood. The Doctor determines that the Landlord is actually Eliza's son, a memory long forgotten. As a boy, he had brought his terminally-ill mother some dormant Dryads he found, unaware of their power. When they heard a high-pitched sound from her music box, they awoke and started turning Eliza to wood to stave off her illness. Since then, the Landlord has controlled the Dryads to keep Eliza well while signing on new tenants to become the Dryads' source of nourishment. Eliza is dismayed to find she has been \\"living\\" for so long without an actual life outside the house. Being able to control the Dryads, Eliza takes the Landlord into a hug, over his objections, and thanks the Doctor before having the Dryads consume them, while also reconstituting all of Bill's friends. The group escapes the house before it collapses in on itself. Back at the university, the Doctor offers to take over watch of the vault from Nardole. Piano music plays from within as the Doctor enters to have dinner with the prisoner inside. = Continuity = When talking about the Time Lords, Bill asks \\"Do you wear robes and big hats\\", to which the Doctor replies \\"No, big collars mostly\\". This is a reference to many previous episodes in which Time Lords had been seen wearing large collars with their robes, which were introduced in The Deadly Assassin (1976), and had most recently been seen in \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015). The Doctor also inadvertently mentions regeneration, but then quickly changes the subject. =Outside references= Bill is called out for having a Little Mix playlist by her roommates. The Little Mix songs \\"Black Magic\\" and \\"Weird People\\" are played during the episode. The Doctor says it reminds him of Quincy Jones, whom he \\"stepped in for\\" once.

The episode was originally titled \\"The Haunted Hub\\". The Fields House in Newport served as the mansion in this story; it had also been used for the Wester Drumlins house in the episode Blink. David Suchet stated he \\"completely freaked\\" when he realized on the third day of filming that his family had rented exactly the same house the Christmas before for the holidays.David Suchet and Mike Bartlett ‚Äì The Aftershow ‚Äì Doctor Who: The Fan Show, BBC, Published on May 6, 2017 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPk2d7LNr5k Cefn Tilla Court in Usk was also used as a filming location for this episode.

Broadcast and reception  After the episode was first broadcast, people in the UK could view a binaural version of the episode on BBC iPlayer. The episode was watched by 4.32 million overnight, up a half-million viewers from the previous episode, \\"Thin Ice\\", and the highest-viewed story overnight since the series opener \\"The Pilot\\". The episode received 5.73 million views overall, up slightly from the previous episode, and received an Appreciation Index score of 83. = Critical reception = \\"Knock Knock\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, receiving criticism regarding the strength of the writing, but praise on the quality of the performances in the story, particularly Suchet's. \\"Knock Knock\\" holds a score of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, the site's summary reading \\"A bit of narrative weakness aside, \\"Knock Knock\\" is a wonderful mix of nostalgia, horror, humor, and monsters that culminates into a powerful and emotionally complex episode.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a grade \\"B+\\", praising the decision to take on a genre such as the episode did, stating that the \\"episode is a horror movie, with all the customary trappings\\", such as the \\"spookier\\" landlord, the young people, and the eerie music, stating that the episode was \\"old-fashioned\\", but declaring this as praise rather than criticism. In contrast to the positive reviews, Zoe Delahunty-Light of SFX gave the episode 3 stars out of 5, describing \\"Knock Knock\\" as a \\"thoroughly adequate, infuriatingly inoffensive episode\\", describing the writing as poor, and the characterization of Bill as blunt, though praising Suchet's \\"masterful\\" acting in the episode. She also complimented the relationship between the Doctor and Bill, declaring the latter as the Doctor's \\"perfect companion\\", but continuing onto how the story lacked depth, and how it insulted Bill's intelligence. Scott Collura of IGN gave the episode an 8.7/10, returning to the relationship between the Doctor and Bill, complimenting the dynamic between the two, especially the \\"father or grandfather\\" relationship between the two. He also stated that the episode was a \\"straight-up horror story\\", but noted that the one-off stories that had made up the series thus far had not given time to establish any meaningful characters besides the two stars. Ross Ruediger of the New York Magazine gave the episode 2 stars out of 5. He stated that the series thus far has been light on alien menaces and the explanations for them, stating that the mood created was effective, but it did little else to the episode. Ruediger also mentioned the inability to \\"overcome the glaring plot holes and weird inconsistencies in the script\\", such as the plot hole of not releasing the previous tenants before Bill and her friends, and the constant number of questions that resulted from the episode. He did, however, praise Suchet as reliable.

It is written by Jamie Mathieson and was broadcast on 13 May 2017 on BBC One. The Doctor (Peter Capaldi), Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) and Nardole (Matt Lucas) investigate a space station after receiving a distress call sent by them, but find that the station is infested with a crew of walking dead. The trio need to base their plans on how much oxygen they have left, when they find themselves in a situation of no hope. Synopsis The Twelfth Doctor, Bill and an angry Nardole travel in the TARDIS to follow a distress call to a deep-space mining station. When the TARDIS is jettisoned by the station's computers, the trio are forced to wear \\"smartsuits\\", robotic spacesuits capable of independent operation tied to the station. The suits are also the only source of oxygen, as the mining company does not provide an oxygen atmosphere inside the station, and every activity is measured in breaths. The surviving crew warn them that some suits have received instructions to \\"deactivate\\" their \\"organic components\\", killing the wearer via an electrical discharge but remaining autonomous. This signal can be carried by touch, which has caused most of the crew to be turned into zombies, enslaved to the suits' programming. The Doctor and the others plan to walk outside the station to an uncompleted portion not updated in the computer systems to hide. Bill's suit malfunctions during depressurisation and forces her to remove her helmet. To save her, the Doctor gives her his helmet as they spacewalk. He survives the vacuum of space, but has gone blind from the ordeal. The spacesuit, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition The computer discovers their location, but as they flee, Bill's suit again malfunctions and will not move, nor will it allow the others to carry it or release her. The Doctor leaves her behind, assuring her she will not die. She is, however, electrocuted when the zombies touch her. The Doctor reveals the limit of breaths is an algorithm to stop people \\"wasting\\" oxygen, part of the company's automated profit-making system; killing the wearers was just the logical endpoint of corporate profit over human life. He hacks the station's systems to cause the station to self-destruct if they are killed, and convinces the others this is a \\"good death\\" and revenge against the corporation. The computers recognise this threat to corporate profits and recalculate the suits' programming, and the zombies turn over their oxygen supplies to the survivors. The Doctor then revives Bill, knowing that her malfunctioning suit did not have enough power to lethally shock her. The TARDIS is recovered, and they drop the survivors off at their head office to confront the company; the Doctor notes there was a successful rebellion six months later. Nardole restores the Doctor's eyes, but when they return to the university and Bill departs, the Doctor reveals that he \\"can't look at anything ever again. I'm still blind\\". =Continuity= The Doctor tricks Nardole into believing that removing a fluid link will disable the TARDIS, when in fact it does not. In the 1963 story The Daleks, the First Doctor does the same thing to Ian Chesterton, forcing them to investigate a Dalek city to recover the materials needed to fix it. =Outside references= The episode opens with the Doctor saying \\"Space, the final frontier\\". This is the classic opening in the title sequence of the original Star Trek science fiction television series, which ran from 1966 to 1969. The Doctor quotes 1 Corinthians 15:55 when he says \\"Death, where is thy sting?\\"  Production  The read-through for \\"Oxygen\\" took place on 12 October 2016. The episode was filmed as part of the fourth production block alongside the tenth episode of the series, \\"The Eaters of Light\\". Shooting began on 17 October and ended on 18 November 2016. In his newsletter, Jamie Mathieson revealed that \\"Oxygen\\" was originally intended as a prequel to his 2014 episode \\"Mummy on the Orient Express\\". In earlier drafts, Kline, a corporate representative, appears on a monitor to offer the characters promotions and stock options if they will spare the ship. Recognising Kline's voice, the Doctor takes the crew to safety by TARDIS, destroying the ship as they leave. It is revealed that the company behind the mining station will one day have a subsidiary specialising in analysing ancient weaponry, and that Kline will be fired as a result of his fumbling the negotiation, living on only as the voice of the company computer, Gus. Assistant director for the series, Lauren Pate, plays the student who questions the Doctor in the opening scenes. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 3.57 million overnight. The episode received 5.27 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index score of 83. = Critical reception = \\"Oxygen\\" received positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.35/10 from 12 ratings. Zoe Delahunty-Light of SFX Magazine gave the episode a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5, complimenting the idea of oxygen becoming a limited resource, and how the idea related to every plot point of the episode, rather than being an excuse for the tense situations. She also praised Pearl Mackie's portrayal of Bill in the episode, Mackie's acting being \\"consistently honest, raw at times, and never, ever whimsy\\", and her \\"death\\" scene being \\"guttural\\" and \\"heart-wrenching\\". Scott Collura of IGN gave an 8.1, admiring the continuation of standalone stories in the tenth series and the work involving the spacesuits keeping the Doctor and the other characters alive, but also noting the controversial aspect of capitalism that was investigated throughout the episode, stating that \\"this time around the resolution feels a little pat, even if the underlying themes of the episode might resonate strongly for certain viewers.\\" He also stated that the most dramatic scenes of the episode, Bill's \\"death\\" and the Doctor's blindness, did not land as solidly as he'd thought that they should have. Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine wrote a positive review, giving the episode 4 stars of 5. He praised the writer for his mature script, stating that \\"Jamie Mathieson writes great, thought-provoking Doctor Who episodes and \\"Oxygen\\" is no exception.\\" He then went on to compliment the production values, expressing his view that the production team delivered amazing imagery to complement the intense script of the episode. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars, praising the story for its truthfulness to the fundamental themes of the show, but criticizing it for lack of novelty, articulating his \\"struggle with the central conceit that in the future, in space, oxygen will be a commodity that you pay for dearly, even with your life.\\" He also noted how the episode borrowed themes from other fictional films, such as Gravity (2013) and Alien (1979), as well as themes from previous episodes of the programme.

It is written by Peter Harness and Steven Moffat and was broadcast on 27 May 2017 on BBC One. \\"The Pyramid at the End of the World\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics. The Doctor (Peter Capaldi) investigates how a pyramid appeared in Turmezistan overnight and confronts an ancient enemy ready to destroy humanity. It is the second of three loosely connected episodes called \\"The Monks Trilogy\\". Synopsis A five-thousand year old pyramid appears overnight in a disputed area of Turmezistan between American, Russian, and Chinese forces. The Secretary-General of the United Nations recruits the Twelfth Doctor, as President of Earth, to help. The Doctor is still blind (\\"Oxygen\\"), a secret he is keeping from Bill. The Monks who occupy the pyramid cause every clock in the world to display a time counting down to midnight in the manner of the Doomsday Clock. The Doctor has the military leaders use coordinated attacks on the Monks, as a show of strength, but the Monks easily deflect them. The Doctor, Bill, and Nardole soon join the leaders as they negotiate with the Monks. Using the computer running their simulations (\\"Extremis\\"), the Monks show that the Earth will become lifeless within a year. They offer humanity their help to stop a pending cataclysmic disaster, but only if they \\"consent\\". The Doctor warns that this consent would have unknown but everlasting consequences. The Secretary-General offers his consent, but the Monks disintegrate him, saying he gave it out of fear, not \\"love\\". The Doctor realises the Monks are misdirecting them to believe a military disaster is imminent, and instead suspects the threat is biological. He and Nardole find several laboratories performing bacterial work and briefly override their internal camera systems to determine which one the Monks are watching. Bill stays behind as the Doctor and Nardole travel in the TARDIS to the lab. Through a series of inconsequential events, two scientists have accidentally created a super-bacterium capable of breaking down all living organisms, and it is about to be vented into the atmosphere. The TARDIS arrives, but the Doctor sends Nardole back for his safety, unaware that he has been contaminated. Inside the TARDIS, Nardole collapses unconscious. Meanwhile, Bill, in communication with the Doctor, joins the military leaders as they offer to surrender. The Monks still disintegrate them, considering it a strategic move. The Doctor, with the help of Erica, one of the scientists, crafts a makeshift bomb to sterilise the bacteria and destroy the lab. However, he becomes trapped inside, unable to see a combination lock to free himself, use his sonic screwdriver on it, or get Nardole's assistance. He is forced to admit to Bill he is blind. Bill, representing the Doctor's authority, offers her consent to the Monks, insisting they restore the Doctor's sight. The Monks accept, as this consent came from her love for the Doctor. The Doctor regains his vision and escapes the lab, while the Monks assert their control of Earth. =Continuity= The Doctor resumes the title of \\"President of the World\\", given to him in the episode \\"Death in Heaven\\", to be called upon in times of worldwide crisis. The fictional country of Turmezistan was previously introduced in \\"The Zygon Invasion\\". =Outside references= The Doctor compares the Monks' countdown to the real Doomsday Clock and includes a bit of the history behind its rationale. The three military commanders all agree to set aside hostilities and \\"give peace a chance\\", a reference to the Plastic Ono Band song. The Doctor, in congratulating Erica, calls out \\"By George, she‚Äôs got it!\\", a line from the musical My Fair Lady.  Production  Harness originally wanted the human delegation to consist of Korean, American, and British leaders who were thinly-veiled versions of Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump, and Jeremy Corbyn, but had to change them to three generic military personnel when this was not permitted.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the episodes has an approval rating of 87% based on reviews from 15 critics. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, feeling that the events of the episode itself were mediocre, describing it as \\"mostly just unobjectionably decent\\", and how many of the characters in the episode had been memorable or as compelling as the other one-off characters that had featured in the series. However, he went on to praise the ending of the episode and how it saved the episode itself, finding the similarities with the second part of the Tenth Doctor serial \\"The End of Time\\" and how the Doctor managed to save the world, but at a cost. Wilkins commenting on the unexpected ending, stating that it is \\"probably what I'm going to remember from \\"The Pyramid At The End Of The World,\\" especially when thinking of it as the middle entry between the brilliant \\"Extremis\\" and the seriously intriguing-looking \\"The Lie Of The Land.\\"\\" Kathleen Wiedel of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 star rating, noting the ambiguous nature of some parts of the episode, and the issues concerning certain elements, such as the promotion of the Doctor to \\"President of Earth\\" and how this was mostly ignored, and how the necessity for \\"consent\\" from the Monks was not explained. She went on to praise the number of continuity references in the episode, and Rachel Denning's role as the scientist Erica. Ross Ruediger of the New York Magazine gave the episode a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars, complimenting the work and scripts of Peter Harness yet again and his repeated themes of \\"monumental life and death decisions for humankind\\", and also director the Daniel Nettheim and how he \\"took two great scripts and made utterly compelling yet very different end products out of each\\". Ruediger also commented on how \\"politically charged\\" the episode was. He also commented on his reservations about how the initial references to terrorism had been removed from the episode due to the Manchester Arena bombing, and while it was \\"understandable\\", he stated how the sequence posed questions that were relevant to the story. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as \\"a peculiar blend of the deadly serious and hilariously hokum\\". He stated that the best part of the episode was the story line of the two researchers and the slow reveal towards deadly disease as the climax of the episode, and how it was reminiscent of Terry Nation's 1970s serial Survivors.

Continuing on after Bill (Pearl Mackie) gives her consent to the Monks, she and Nardole (Matt Lucas) have to find a way to rescue the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) after he is imprisoned, and end the Monk's invasion of Earth. It is the third and final of three loosely connected episodes called \\"The Monks Trilogy\\". Synopsis The Monks are rulers of the Earth, and appear to have been on Earth for millions of years, guiding human development. Bill and a few others are aware of the truth: the Monks have only been present on Earth for six months. Those who hold this view are imprisoned for \\"memory crimes\\". The Twelfth Doctor appears on television praising the Monks' guidance over humanity. Bill keeps herself grounded in reality by imagining that she is talking with her long-dead mother, based on pictures the Doctor gave her. Nardole, who survived the bacteria due to his alien physiology and is also aware of the truth, locates Bill and helps her to find the prison hulk where the Doctor is thought to be a captive. Inside, after a team of commandos swarm inside, the Doctor tells Bill he is cooperating willingly with the Monks, believing that humanity was doomed without their guidance. Bill becomes distraught and shoots the Doctor, who appears to begin regenerating, but quickly stops. The entire scenario is revealed to have been a test by Nardole, the Doctor and the team, to make sure Bill was not under the influence of the Monks. At the university where the Doctor and Bill work, they enter the Vault to talk to Missy, who says she has encountered the Monks before. She confirms the Monks maintain control by broadcasting a signal containing the false history to their subjugated victims via the numerous statues they have built across Earth, enabled by a psychic link established through the person who originally gave \\"consent\\"; Missy claims she defeated them during her own encounter by killing that individual. The implication is that Bill must die as the one who gave consent on Earth. The controlling Monk, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition Believing there is another solution, the Doctor, Bill, Nardole, and the commandos infiltrate the Monks' pyramid in London so that the Doctor can hijack their broadcast with his own mind to break the psychic transmission. In the central chamber, the Doctor attempts to link his mind to the controlling Monk, who after a struggle overpowers the Doctor. Bill intends to sacrifice herself, linking her own mind to the Monks', despite the Doctor's protests. The Monks unintentionally replace their broadcast with images of Bill's mother, which the Doctor recognizes as a strong, loving memory in Bill's mind. Humanity recovers from the Monks' lies and rebels against them. The Doctor, Bill, and Nardole watch as the Monks abandon Earth. Sometime later, the Doctor and Bill find that most of humanity have no recollection of the Monks. In the Vault, Missy expresses remorse for those she has killed. =Continuity= In images showing the Monks' aid to humanity, clips from the stories \\"Blink\\", \\"Nightmare in Silver\\" and \\"Into the Dalek\\" are shown. Later, a clip from \\"The Pilot\\" is shown, as well as several still images from past episodes of the new series. Magpie Electrical, which debuted in \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\" and recurs throughout the revival series, is shown as the shop where Bill watches one of the Doctor's broadcasts. While reuniting with Bill, Nardole mentions getting sick from the super-bacterium in \\"The Pyramid at the End of the World.\\" =Outside references= Missy briefly plays selections from Eric Satie's Gnossienne No. 1 and Scott Joplin's \\"The Entertainer\\" on her piano.

Filming took place, alongside the subsequent episode \\"Empress of Mars\\", from 16 January to 22 February 2017. In Missy's initial scene, the visual of her eyes superimposed over a panning shot is an homage to a similar scene from the 1996 film. A scene was recorded featuring a family watching an episode of Casualty. This specially filmed casualty scene included Casualty's Connie Beauchamp and Noel Garcia interacting with the Monks as part of the story line. Both characters were played by their regular actors Amanda Mealing and Tony Marshall. Despite being referred to in the Doctor Who Magazine preview of the episode, the scene was ultimately cut from the broadcast version. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 3.01 million overnight, the series' lowest overnight rating in its history at the time, after the rating of 3.10 million for Battlefield in 1989. This was due to the episode being placed directly against the Britain's Got Talent final. The episode received 4.82 million views overall, at the time the lowest official rating since the programme's return in 2005, and it received an Appreciation Index of 82. = Critical reception = \\"The Lie of the Land\\" received mixed reviews, with a number of reviewers finding it the weakest story in the season so far. The episode holds a score of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, the site's consensus reading \\"\\"The Lie of the Land\\" closes a significant chapter for Doctor Whos tenth season‚Äîyet leaves some major characters' fates tantalizingly open.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a score of B-, stating that he felt disappointed in the episode, and how script and its quality were \\"outpaced\\" by the skills of Capaldi's and Mackie's acting, stating that Capaldi was \\"great as ever but whose talents are sometimes misused in service of ideas the story won't commit to\\". He did, however, compliment Michelle Gomez for her role as Missy yet again. Zoe Delahunty-Light of the SFX Magazine gave \\"The Lie of the Land\\" a perfect score of 5 stars out of 5, calling the episode \\"chilling\\", and complimenting the idea of the Monks taking over the human race and its development. She commented especially upon Pearl Mackie, complimenting her on her role in leading the episode, and her \\"uncanny ability to transition between emotions flawlessly\\", especially concerning her scenes with the Doctor and his apparent betrayal. Delahunty-Light also went on to praise how Missy finally got more screen time than she had received in previous episodes. Ross Ruediger of the New York Magazine gave the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating that the episode starting out as \\"disturbingly effective\\", but goes on to certain questions that arose from the episode were \\"frustratingly unanswered\\". He also felt that the Monks had become far less of a danger than they had been in the previous episode, and how it made little sense that the Monks did not defend their leader when he became under attack by the thoughts of Bill and the Doctor. Overall, he stated that \\"The Lie of the Land\\" was a \\"disappointing conclusion to what was an otherwise killer story line\\". Patrick Mulkern from Radio Times also gave the episode a lower rating, rewarding it a 2 stars out of 5. He felt that the worst part of the episode was the poor decision in getting a companion to fire a gun at the Doctor, how the viewers saw \\"nothing that would push her to such an extreme act\\", and stating the act as something that could not be \\"rationalised or condoned\\". He described the actors as being \\"blocked awkwardly\\" and how they appeared uncomfortable in the situation, though he complimented their acting overall throughout the episode.

Congo maintains an embassy in New Delhi. The Embassy of India in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo is concurrently accredited to the Republic of the Congo. India also maintains an honorary consulate in Brazzaville. History India and the Republic of the Congo signed a protocol on Foreign Office Consultations on 17 March 2010, and the first Consultations were held in Brazzaville on 21 January 2011. Several ministerial level visits have taken place between the two countries. India and the ROC were among the first 19 countries to join the International Solar Alliance, proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on 15 November 2016. Trade India was the third largest source for imports to the Republic of the Congo in 2015. Bilateral trade between India and the Republic of the Congo totaled US$368.28 million in 2015-16, declining from $618.41 million the previous fiscal. India exported $166.64 million worth of goods to the ROC, and imported $201.64 million in 2015-16. The ROC was the fourth largest African exporter to India in 2008. The main commodities exported by India to the ROC are non-basmati rice, tea, spirits and beverages, power loom fabrics, pharmaceuticals, meat products, household articles of steel, and bicycles. The major commodities imported by India from the ROC are metallic ore, metal scrap, organic chemicals, pearls, semi-precious stones, oil seeds and petroleum. In June 2010, Bharti Airtel struck a deal to buy Zain's mobile operations in 15 African countries, including the ROC, for $8.97 billion, in India's second biggest overseas acquisition after Tata Steel's US$13 billion buy of Corus in 2007. Bharti Airtel completed the acquisition on 8 June 2010. On 5 November 2013, Airtel entered into an agreement to acquire Warid Congo SA., the ROC subsidiary of the Warid Group, for $70‚Äì80 million. The deal made Airtel the largest mobile network operator in the Congo with 2.6 million customers at the time of the acquisition. Ashok Leyland was awarded a contract to supply 200 buses to the Government of ROC. The ROC was the ‚Äúfocus country‚Äù at the 10th CII-EXIM Bank Conclave on India-Africa Project Partnership in New Delhi in March 2014. ROC Industry Minister Isidore Mvouba attended the event and addressed delegates. Mvouba stated that Indian government and industry had already participated in rural electrification, urban transportation and food quality control projects, as well as in sectors like cement and pharmaceuticals in the Congo. He urged Indian firms to \\"partner the Republic of Congo government in converting the country's comparative advantage in different sectors into competitive strengths\\" and help the country become an emerging economy by 2025. Foreign aid The Congolese Government signed a Line of Credit (LOC) agreement worth US$70 million on 19 December 2011, to fund a rural electrification project. India extended an LOC of $89.9 million in 2014 to develop transportation systems in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. India extended another LOC worth $55 million in the same year for the construction of a greenfield 600 tpd rotary kiln based cement plant. India donated medicines worth $200,000 in 2010 to Congo, and $500,000 as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief for the victims of a blast at an ordnance depot in Congo on 4 March 2012. India implemented the Pan African e-network project in Congo. Tele-education, Tele-medicine and VVIP connectivity nodes were established in Brazzaville under the project. At the second India Africa Forum Summit, India offered to establish a Rural Technology Park (RTP), a Food Testing Laboratory (FTL), an Agricultural Seed Production-cum-Demonstration Centre (ASPDC), and a Centre for English Language Training (CELT) in Congo. The Government of Congo expressed interest on all the facilities, except the Rural Technology Park. Citizens of Congo are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Several officials from Congo have also received training programs under the AIFS. Indians in the ROC As of December 2016, around 300 Indians reside in the Republic of the Congo. They are primarily engaged in trading and the service sector.

They depict scenes of courtesans in the Yoshiwara pleasure district at each hour of the twelve-hour traditional Japanese time system. Description and analysis The series was published in by Tsutaya J≈´zabur≈ç. The multicolour nishiki-e prints are in ≈çban size, about . Seir≈ç (, \\"green house[s]\\") refers to the y≈´kaku licensed pleasure quarters‚Äîspecifically Yoshiwara. The term seir≈ç originated in Chinese to denote a pavilion in which a nobleman kept a mistress; in Utamaro's time it referred to Yoshiwara's most privileged pleasure houses. The series depicts a day in Yoshiwara, beginning with a morning-after sequence at the sunrise Hour of the Hare on the twelve-hour traditional Japanese time system, on which each toki unit lasted two modern hours. The titles appear in a caption shaped as a Japanese clock in a corner of each print. Though many of the prints show courtesans in the midst of entertainment, the male visitors do not appear, leaving it to purchasers of the prints to imagine themselves in the role of customer. The scenes are framed as if in candid moments, but are designed for the benefit of the male gaze, as no matter the place, hour, or state of exhaustion, the women maintain their beauty. =U no koku= alt= U no koku () is the Hour of the Rabbit, about 6:00 in the morning. =Tatsu no koku= alt= Tatsu no koku () is the Hour of the Dragon, about 8:00 in the morning. Two courtesans are taking to their beds at this early hour, their exhaustion signified by their disheveled clothes and hair. It is unlikely their customers would see them in such a state and at such an hour. =Mi no koku= alt= Mi no koku () is the Hour of the Snake, about 10:00 in the morning. =Uma no koku= alt= Uma no koku () is the Hour of the Horse, about 12:00 midday. =Hitsuji no koku= alt= Hitsuji no koku () is the Hour of the Goat, about 2:00 in the afternoon. This would likely be just before the hiru-mise afternoon display of prostitutes. At left lies a pile of , suggesting the courtesans are visiting a fortune teller, in which case the small wrapped packages on the floor by the sticks would be offerings of money to the teller. The new, young courtesan in the middle appears to be explaining how palm- reading works to the at the right. =Saru no koku= alt= Saru no koku () is the Hour of the Monkey, about 4:00 in the afternoon. =Tori no koku= alt= Tori no koku () is the Hour of the Rooster, about 6:00 in the evening. =Inu no koku= alt= Inu no koku () is the Hour of the Dog, about 8:00 in the evening. A courtesan sits on a scarlet felt rug, perhaps in a harimise, where prostitutes sat on display. She writes a letter on a long scroll; courtesans were expected to write to patrons. She bends back in a half-rising posture to whisper into the ear of a , a young girl who works as a courtesan's servant. Before the courtesan sits a luxurious tobacco tray decorated with makie. =I no koku= alt= I no koku () is the Hour of the Pig, about 10:00 in the evening. At such a time, the courtesans are still entertaining their guests; the woman at the left sits erect, carrying a guest's saucer. To the right before her is a , a young girl who works as a courtesan's servant, who appears to be dozing off at such a late hour. The diagonals of the kamuros posture and the courtesan's outstretched arm contribute to the balance in the composition. =Ne no koku= alt= Ne no koku () is the Hour of the Rat, about midnight. The two women in the print are preparing for bed after finishing with the night's festivities. The courtesan at the right has changed into simple nightclothes and is tightening her obi sash with both hands. In a half-rising posture she peers down at the woman to the left, who appears to be a young courtesan-in-training, is folding up the first woman's uchikake kimono with her chin and both hands. =Ushi no koku= alt= Ushi no koku () is the Hour of the Ox, about 2:00 in the morning. It is deep in the night‚Äîthe woman in the print has finished her work and is in her nightclothes; the nape of her neck and her left leg protrude from her robe. She appears exhausted, and her hair hangs disheveled as her head droops. She holds some twisted paper string in her right hand, lit to light her way, and some kaishi paper in her left hand, as if on her way to the toilet. She is putting on some z≈çri sandals, the customary footwear for courtesans in the corridors of the pleasure houses of Yoshiwara. Her mamoribukuro charm pouch hangs from a by≈çbu folding screen at the viewer's right. Art historian Julie Nelson Davis notes that the print may be designed as a \\"sympathetic portrayal of an exhausted woman\\", though she \\"is rendered as an elegant form in a scene designed for the male gaze\\". =Tora no koku= alt= Tora no koku () is the Hour of the Tiger, about 4:00 in the morning. It was at such an after-work hour that courtesans could talk freely, often to badmouth the guests. Two courtesans sit and chat before a hibachi heater. They appear cold, with their arms withdrawn into their kimonos. The woman to the right fans the hibachi with a folded stack of kaishi paper. Legacy The series is rare and highly prized amongst collectors. The French art critic Edmond de Goncourt considered Seir≈ç J≈´nitoki Utamaro's \\"most visually appealing\\" series. Seir≈ç J≈´nitoki inspired the French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's lithographic portfolio Elles.

Since 1981 she has illustrated books by popular Danish authors such as Th√∏ger Birkeland and Klaus Rifbjerg. In addition to writing and illustrating her own books, she has designed signs and posters for LEGO, the Danish Bibliographic Centre and the Danish Road Safety Council. Biography Born on 8 March 1947, Hedlund attended the Danish Design School in Copenhagen, graduating in 1982. Her first published illustrations were in Th√∏ger Birkeland's Rasmus og H√¶ngek√∏jen in 1981 which she managed to complete in just one month. In 1983, as author of Evige Bjerg og de tre st√¶rke kvinder, she gave herself a whole year to create the illustrations to her satisfaction. The Japanese story is aptly enhanced with illustrations containing bamboo, mountrains and gnarled trees. Decorative frames add to the attractiveness of her pictures. Her illustrations in Klaus Rifbjerg's Da Oscar blev tosset (1990) about a child's first tentative experiences of kindergarten present an initially frightening but subsequently more relaxed account of how he eventually fits in. The overall effect is to present a more welcoming environment for children confronted with the prospect of going to kindergarten. Other notable examples of her work are to be seen in Den gr√•dige kat (The Greedy Cat, 1988) about a cat which eats everything in sight and Den arrige kone (The Angry Wife, 1986) which tells the story of a pig keeper who has to dispose of his mad wife if he is to live a happy life. Both stories are written and illustrated by Hedlund. Building on her own difficulties in learning to read, in 1991 Hedlund illustrated L√¶rke og Jeppe - √•ret rundt (L√¶rke and Jeppe - All Year Round) written by her husband Bent Faurby. Her illustrations resemble comic strips although the text takes the form of a real book, increasing the appeal for young readers.

In 1422, Baselius Simon, Syriac Orthodox Metropolitan bishop of Jerusalem, met with Pope Gabriel V of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a fellow miaphysite church, and requested to be consecrated Patriarch of Antioch, as Philoxenus II had died the year before. Baselius told Gabriel of the situation of the church in Syria whereby there were few remaining bishops and Islamic persecution disallowed them from holding a synod to elect a new patriarch.Swanson (2010), p. 122 Gabriel, initially hesitant, was swayed by Baselius and, alongside two Coptic Orthodox bishops and a Syriac Orthodox bishop, consecrated Baselius in Cairo, at the Church of St. Mercurius, and formally enthroned him at the Church of the Virgin Mary. Baselius later met with Pope John XI of Alexandria, Gabriel's successor, during the Holy Week of 1430, and prepared the holy myron together at the Church of the Virgin Mary.Swanson (2010), p. 123 References Bibliography * Syrian Oriental Orthodox Christians Syriac Patriarchs of Antioch from 512 to 1783 15th-century Oriental Orthodox archbishops 1444 deaths Syrian archbishops ","title":"Basil IV Simon"},{"id":"53694874","text":"Djamel Leeflang (born 25 March 1992) is a Dutch footballer currently playing for FC Lienden.

She is in a relationship with their family friend's son (with knowledge of the family) Sooraj (Arun G Raghavan) whose sister Preethi is Bala's best friend. Their marriage is fixed. Suddenly as a shock Jaychandran Nair loses all his properties and wealth and is forced to shift into a rental house. Their elder son Harikrishnan(Naresh Eswar) is forced to go to Kuwait to provide for the family. Due to family clashes between them Bala's and Sooraj's marriage is cancelled and they both part ways (despite their strong attempts to convince their families). Balasudha tries to commit suicide but is saved on time. Her family starts seeing her as sort of a burden as they struggle with their income now. She is forced into an arranged marriage. Venugopan comes to meet Bala in an arranged function of the family and their marriage is fixed. Although Bala and her brother in law (Manoj) tries to convince her parents it didn't work out. Despite VenuGopan being a little too old and also not investigating much about him and his family Bala is forced to marry him. After her marriage she moves in with Venugopan's house in Mulavukad. Her sad destiny continues as we learn that Venugopan and his brothers and alcoholics and that their mother (her Mother in law) is the root of all evils in the family. On her first day there Bala (who is a vegetarian) is forced to clean and cook raw meat and fish. Her sister in law (Anila - Venugopan's brother's wife) warns her about her life there (from this we can see that she is also a victim of constant physical and verbal attacks from her in laws). On their first night Venugopan gets heavily drunk and he gets into their room. The lonely Bala is frightened and disgusted at Venu's actions. Unfortunately on that same night Bala gets raped by him. Every night Venugopan gets mad and he brutally tortures Bala as he is constantly paranoid searching for her 'jaran' (love affair). He blames her for cheating him by aligning her name with every single man she sees, including her brothers and father. Whenever they went to visit any of Bala's relatives Venugopan says Bala is in an affair with the males in her family and this continues day by day with the newspaper boy, milk boy, postman and which ever man Bala speaks to. The tortures continues as Bala slowly and painfully realise that Venugopan is not mentally well. On the day Venugopan sets to go to Pune (as he works there) Bala tells him that she will resume her job as a teacher in the school near her parents‚Äô house and he objects it by blaming that she's in a love affair with the male teachers of her school and beats her up. As Venu leaves Bala packs her bags and leaves for her house. There she sees her parents and brother (Ajayan) who sees her as a disturbance and refuses to fully believe what she says.

Overview Neelima writes in Economic and Political Weekly, The Huffington Post India, The Quint, The Wire, DailyO, DNA, and Hindustan Times. She speaks at academic institutions on agricultural crisis and gender, like Jawaharlal Nehru University, University of Delhi, Azim Premji University, Jadhavpur University, Graphic Era Hill University (Dehradun), Sri Ram College of Commerce (Delhi), JECRC University (Jaipur), Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHDA), Pune. Kota Neelima also participates at many leading literary festivals like Jaipur Literary Festival, Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival, Dehradun Literature Festival, Odisha Literary Festival, Times LitFest, and Delhi Literary Festival. National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran has optioned one of her books, Shoes of The Dead, to be adapted into a movie. Recently, she faced threats from the Karni Sena in Rajasthan for writing an article critical of their role in women empowerment in the state in view of their protest against the movie, Padmavat. Her research organization, Institute of Perception Studies (IPS), maps rural distress and solutions, with special focus on gender and farmer suicides. Another of her initiative StudioAdda conducts periodic outreach events like art and photography shows, and discussions on social, economic and political conditions of India. She was awarded in the Exceptional Women of Excellence category at the Women Economic Forum (WEF) 2019 . Early life Neelima was born to the journalist and author, K. V. S. Rama Sarma, and Uma Sarma in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. She has a Ph.D in Political Science from University of Delhi, and a Master of Arts in International Relations from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Neelima has also been a Senior Research Fellow, South Asia Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Johns Hopkins University, Washington DC. As a journalist, Neelima covered politics for The Indian Express in Delhi and was the Political Editor of The Sunday Guardian. Her academic articles are on distress, farmer suicides and reforms on electoral system in India, like 'Right to Recall'. Author Neelima has written books on the poor and women in India in both genres of fiction and non-fiction. Her non-fiction work about farmer suicides identify new areas of distress, especially among the rural poor. Her new book Widows of Vidarbha, Making of Shadows (Oxford University Press, 2018) is about the life of widows who are left behind by suicides of farmers due to agriculture distress in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. The book reveals the six invisibilities imposed on the women, and how they are forced to relegate their rights and freedoms to the men. Neelima has utilised the genre of fiction to contract the lives of poor farmers with the lives of the powerful who live in the cities of India. Shoes of the Dead (Rupa Publications, 2013) is the comparison of the inheritances of two young men, a political heir and a poor farmer in India, and who wins the game for power. The book's examines how the poor farmers' determination to get justice for the farmer suicide of his brother, threatens to derail the political career of an ambition politician. Death of a Moneylender (Penguin, 2009/Reprint 2016) is the story of a young, urban journalist whose reluctance to cover rural India is a comment on the priorities of mainstream media today. This book was taught, as part curriculum, to the Upper School students of the Collegiate School, Richmond, USA to learn about rural Indian life and agriculture in a changing world of globalisation. Her fourth book, The Honest Season (Penguin, 2016) is a critique of the state of democracy in India. The story centres around six conversations that take place inside a mythical Parliament, and establishes why the Indian democracy can thrive even after ignoring the basic needs of the vast majority of the country. Her non-fiction works also include two books on spirituality. One of them, Tirupati: A Guide to Life (Penguin, 2012) has been translated to Hindi, Telugu and Tamil languages.

Painter Neelima is also a painter. Her works are impressionist-abstract and the medium in oil on canvas. She follows an elaborate artistic process of making the works, which begins with extensive research of ancient Indian texts, which forms the theme of her works. This is followed by charcoal drawings on paper before, finally, converting the images into oil paintings. Her works are informed by the rich tradition of skepticism in the Indian philosophical thought, and seek to re-imagine Upanishadic questions to themes of causation, creation and karma. The symbols used in the paintings are trees, sky, the moon and birds, which undergo multi-faceted and complex redefinition. Neelima's latest work (2018), Metaphors of the Moon, charts the trajectories of the mind as it travels from absence to presence in an eternal cycle. The mind is the metaphor for the Moon. It represents the cyclic process of thought; its creation, immersion and regeneration, and also is a metaphor for absence and presence. Her works have been featured at the Lalit Kala Akademi and the India Habitat Centre in Delhi, and in art shows in Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, among other cities in India. Her works have also been featured at several international exhibitions, including The Nehru Centre, London, Museum, and China Art Museum, National Museum of Fine Arts, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Her works are part of the permanent collection in Museum of Scared Art, Belgium.

Biography  Commettant studied the piano and musical composition at the Conservatoire de Paris (1839‚Äì1843) and made a long tour in the United-States from 1852 to 1855 as a soloist. He left Le Havre on 1 September 1852 and arrived in New York City on the 13th. He then visited the Niagara falls, Mammoth Cave, saw the Mississippi, Lake Superior, Cedar Creek etc. His circuit began on a steamer on the River Hudson, the train then led him from Albany to Buffalo with stop at Niagara Falls. He went to Toronto, Kingston, Mille-Isles, Montr√©al, Quebec then Saratoga and returned to New York where he rested for two weeks. Comettant later visited Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Richmond (Virginia) and Charleston, then spent a month in Mobile in a cotton plantation. On his way to New Orleans, he sailed on the Mississippi and went through Vicksburg, Memphis and Louisville where he took the opportunity to admire Mammoth Cave and ended his journey by Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Unlike many travelers, Comettant focused on American society and institutions; The great spaces of nature were indifferent to him. Although very detailed on political life, religions, education etc. and the American cod, his works, where he invented the character of the French painter Marcel Bonneau, were very fictional. In 1855, on his return to France, he became a professor of music and while composing, worked as a music critic for Le Si√®cle and Le M√©nestrel. Comettant went again on a journey in 1864 and visited Denmark, then in July 1888, was appointed French juror at the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition (1888) where he arrived 6 September after he left Marseille 1 August. He visited Lilydale where he met squatters and Indigenous Australians and, in October 1888, the mines of Ballarat and Sandhurst. He also traveled in the Great Western, where he admired the vines before going to Sydney to attend a banquet (Decembre). After composing his \\"Salute to Melbourne\\" for piano, he returned to France on 28 December 1888.

The HfJS operates in close cooperation with the University of Heidelberg and opens its doors to students and scholars, regardless of religious affiliation. History The center was founded by the Central Council of Jews in Germany in 1979. Already in 1971 the then State Rabbi of Baden moved to establish an educational institution for rabbis, cantors and teachers of religious education. The institute was meant to be formed according to the tradition of the academies of the Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin and to entrench Jewish scholarship again in the scholarly landscape of Germany. One year later the enacted a memorandum in which Heidelberg was suggested as the designated place of residence for the facility so that the academic cooperation with the University of Heidelberg could be carried out. The Central Council of Jews in Germany acted on the proposal with the resolve to utilize the denominational orientation to establish a scholarly institution at which all interested academic parties could seek higher education. Finally, following the resolution of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the University of Jewish Studies in Heidelberg (HfJS) was founded in 1979 with 16 students. Designed as an academic facility, the institution has carried on its goal from the time of its conception to the present day to impart the complexity and fascination of Judaism to its Jewish and non-Jewish students at the highest academic level. Two years after the institution was founded, the HfJS received its national accreditation and subsequently achieved its right to award doctorates in 1995. Furthermore, the HfJS has been a member of the German Rectors‚Äô Conference since 2007 and has been institutionally accredited by the German Council of Science and Humanities since 2009. Throughout the course of construction in the 1980s the institution‚Äôs professors were acting lecturers at other universities. Today the HfJS has 11 professorships and just as many research assistantships. The center serves as a reference point for political discourse, as well as for media, churches and schools. It explores a broad range of research topics within the field of Jewish Studies, including Art, Philosophy, History, Political Sciences, Modern Literatures, Linguistics, Rabbinical literature, Biblical Exegesis and Theory of Religion. Moreover, the HfJS provides strong language training at all levels (in Biblical, Rabbinical and Modern Hebrew, as well as Aramaic and Hebrew-scripted languages, such as Yiddish and Judeo-Arabic). The HfJS has acquired academic partnerships with international universities in Israel, Austria and Sweden and regularly organizes conferences and issues a periodical publication, entitled Trumah. Endowed Chairs =Ignatz Bubis Endowed Chair of History, Religion and Culture of European Judaism= This chair was created in 2001 in memory of the influential chairman and later president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis (1927-1999). Currently held by , this chair concentrates on all facets of European Judaism, from the antique period to the present day, including the diaspora of European communities at large. The focus areas concern political, social and cultural transformation, as well as various mystical and religious movements, as are characteristic of the ever-changing course of Jewish history in Europe. =Ben Gurion Endowed Chair of Israel and Middle Eastern Studies= This chair has been endowed by the State of Baden- W√ºrttemberg and is the only chair in the religion of Israel and the Middle East in the German-speaking world. This chair is a joint research professorship between the University of Heidelberg and the HfJS. Students of all faculties of the HfJS and the University of Heidelberg take part in the curriculum composed of contemporary research topics spanning from socio- cultural to political aspects of Israel and the Middle East. =Other Chairs at the HfJS= * Hebrew and Jewish Literature * Hebrew Linguistics * Literature, Yiddish Studies * Global Jewish History * Religious Pedagogy * Biblical Studies and Exegesis * Jewish Philosophy and Intellectual History * Rabbinic Literature * Jewish Art HfJS Rabbinate The Campus Rabbi at the HfJS, as well as the Beth Midrash in the facility, provides students the opportunity to continue their private Jewish lifestyle.

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law. The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on freedom of expression but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern Republic of Cyprus of the country and a law that falls below Council of Europe standards in the Northern part of Cyprus.Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006 The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is de facto divided. As to 2011, a research by the Open Cyprus Project showed that there was a level of 75% of administrative silence island-wide, in response to information requests. Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible. Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017).http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html  Northern Cyprus  The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner. Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be ‚Äúnecessary in a democratic society‚Äù. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR. The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007. The Right to Access Information Law obliges ‚Äúpublic bodies‚Äù to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted. A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information. Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.  Republic of Cyprus  The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention‚Äôs minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017) The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following: * Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution; * the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s); * the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same terms; * the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies; * the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis; * the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period; * the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002; * the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990; * the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200; * the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001; * the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999. According to experts, these non-specific laws that might grant access to some classes of information, such as environmental information or archives, require amendments to comply with the basic international and European standards. Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted. In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister Ionas Nicolaou expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be ‚Äúone of the best in the European Union‚Äù. Again, in February 2017, the association Access Info Europe has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft. Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no public interest test. Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied. In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee. Since March 2015, Citizen Service Centres have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.  See also  * Media of Cyprus *Access to public information in Europe * Transparency of media ownership in Europe  References Rights Freedom of speech ","title":"Access to public information in Cyprus"},{"id":"53695546","text":"Donald William Lucas (12 May 1905 ‚Äì 28 February 1985) was an English classical scholar, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park during World War II.

The High Commission of India in Khartoum, Sudan is concurrently accredited to Eritrea. India also maintains an honorary consulate in Asmara. History =Early history= Trade relations between Africa and India date back to the 1st century AD, when the Kingdom of Aksum was established in present-day Eritrea and the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Aksum's strategic location in the Horn of Africa with access to the Red Sea, made it an important link in the direct trade route between southern India and the Roman Empire. By the 1st century AD, trade routes between India and the Roman Empire had been well established and trade relations between the two regions had developed significantly as the demand for goods from southern India in the Roman Empire increased. Aksum benefited as an important transit point on the busy route. Silks, spices, pepper, glass, brass and copper from India, Egypt and Arabia passed through Adulis, the empire's main port. Aksum primarily exported ivory which was abundantly available within their empire. A Greek-Byzantine ambassador in Aksum recorded in the 5th century that he witnessed a herd of 5000 elephants in the region. A record from the 6th century notes that large elephant tusks were transported by boats from Aksum to India, Persia and Romania. The Eritrean port of Massawa has been utilized by Indian traders since the 17th century. The 4th Indian Division's 5th Infantry Brigade of the British Indian Army fought in Eritrea in 1941. They secured victory in the decisive Battle of Keren, for which the Bengal Sappers were awarded the Victoria Cross for clearing mines in Metemma. =Modern history= India formally recognized Eritrea shortly after its de jure independence in May 1993. India offered Eritrea assistance in its legislative drafting process after it became independent. Former Chief Justice of India P.N. Bhagwati conducted a workshop on legislative drafting in Eritrea in January 1995. The two countries signed an MoU on co-operation in Agricultural Research and Education in December 2000, and an MoU on Agriculture Cooperation with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research in June 2006. An agreement on cooperation with the Indira Gandhi National Open University was signed by Eritrean officials in 2010. The first Eritrean Ambassador to India was appointed in 2003. While a non-permanent member of the UNSC in 2011-12, India served as the Chair of the UNSC's Somalia-Eritrea Sanctions Committee. No visits at the level of head of state or government has taken place between the two countries. Several Eritrean ministers have visited India. From India, the highest level visits to Eritrea have been at the level of minister of state. Minister of State for External Affairs General V.K. Singh visited Eritrea in September 2015 and met with President Isais Afwerki. Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh visited India to attend the Third India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in October 2015. Eritrean Ambassador to India, Alem Tsesaye Woldemariam, serves as the Dean of African Diplomatic Corps in India. Trade Bilateral trade between Eritrea and India totaled US$244.73 million in 2014-15, rising sharply from $21.30 million the previous fiscal. India exported $14.06 million worth of goods to Eritrea, and imported $230.68 million. Alongside Italy and the UAE, India is one of the largest exporters to Eritrea. The main commodities exported by India to Eritrea are electrical and miscellaneous engineering equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals, millets, cotton yarn and fabrics. The major commodities imported by India from Eritrea are leather, hides (excluding raw hides) and skins. Since 2008, India provides Eritrea unilateral duty free tariff preferential market access for export of goods and services.  Foreign aid  India has provided Eritrea with capacity building assistance in several fields such as legislative drafting, technical scholarships (agriculture, education, health), and food aid. India is a destination for Eritreans for higher studies. India, Eritrea and FAO signed a trilateral agreement in Rome in 1998, under which India sent 100 agricultural experts to Eritrea to help boost agricultural productivity and production, inland fisheries and aquaculture. India donated 5,000 metric tonnes of wheat to Eritrea in 2003, and previously provided 1,500 metric tonnes of wheat and 200 metric tonnes of sugar as relief assistance. An Indian legal expert was deputed to Eritrea for a period of two years at the request of the Eritrean government. India provided a Line of Credit worth $20 million ($10 million each for education and agriculture projects) to Eritrea in July 2009. India inaugurated its Pan African eNetwork project in Eritrea in August 2010. An expert technical team from the MEA and HMT(I) visited Asmara in October 2014, and finalised plans to establish a Vocational Training Centre in the city. Citizens of Eritrea are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Indians in Eritrea As of January 2016, around 1,200 Indians reside in Eritrea. The majority of them live and work in and around Asmara. Other regions with sizeable Indian communities include Anseba, Debub, Northern Red Sea region and the Dahlak islands. The community is primarily employed as school teachers, teaching staff at secondary schools and technical colleges such as the Eritrean Institute of Technology, and businessmen. Some are employed as doctors and construction workers. Over 800 Indian teachers are employed at various colleges, vocational training centers and high schools in Eritrea. Indians make up nearly 80% of the faculty of the Eritrea Institute of Technology. According to the Report of the High level Committee on Indian Diaspora, there were nearly 2,000 Indians in Eritrea in the 1960s. They were primarily employed as teaching staff at secondary schools and technical colleges, as professors at the University of Asmara, and as businessmen. =Peacekeepers= Over 1,500 Indian troops served in the UN Mission for Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), and were deployed in both countries until February 2007. Major General Rajender Singh served as the UNMEE Force Commander from 2004-2006. Indian troops also provided medical assistance and helped in drilling wells, and construction of roads and dams.

Biography  Born of a Vietnamese father and a French mother, Cyril Phan spent his early childhood in Vietnam, until the fall of Saigon in 1975. During his adolescence, he lived for several years in Brazzaville, in the Republic of the Congo. Which inspired his artist name, Cyril Kongo. In 1986, he began tagging Parisian walls to set his mark. In 1988, he joined the MAC crew, a group of Parisian graffiti artists with whom he painted from 1989 to 2001 monumental murals, particularly in the United States where he collaborated with New-York graffiti artists TATS cru. The director ATN devotes a documentary, Trumac, de Paris √† South-Bronx (Trumac, from Paris to South-Bronx) to these imposing works (including a wall about 50 meters long by 8 meters high). Kongo also appears in a 2004 film shot by documentary filmmaker Marc-Aur√®le Vecchione Writers, 20 ans de graffiti √† Paris 1983-2003 (Writers, 20 years of graffiti in Paris, 1983-2003). In 2002, with the Mac Crew, Kongo launched Kosmopolite, the first international graffiti festival in France, sponsored by the suburban city of Bagnolet where he resides. In 2011, Kosmopolite went worldwide with the Kosmopolite art tour, a yearly event in major graffiti hubs : Amsterdam (Netherlands), Brussels (Belgium), Casablanca (Morocco), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Jkakarta (Indonesia). Having reach its primary objective, dissociating graffiti art from its connotation of vandalism, Kosmopolite has been committed since 2011 to transmit its knowledge and the history of the movement by organizing free workshops of initiation to the urban arts, at first to young people and now also to adults. Thanks to the art studio of Kosmopolite, called Narvaland, Cyril Kongo, according to his formula \\"leaped out from the street to the studio\\" (see page 30 of the book devoted to this art). His works are presented in galleries and exhibitions. In early 2020, an exhibit on the roof of Paris la D√©fense Grande Arche is entirely devoted to Cyril Kongo.  Art  thumb Kongo art is based on lettering, i.e. large colorful spray-painted letters, typical of the writing trend of urban art. During his ephemeral art period (1986-2000), Kongo painted huge frescoes, on walls and various other supports, in Paris and its suburbs, but also throughout the world. The only remaining traces of his works of this period are photos and films. From 2000 on, Kongo started painting of perennial surfaces. In 2009, two of his paintings were displayed in the Grand Palais museum in Paris as part of the exhibition \\"Tags in the Grand Palais\\" organised by art collector Alain- Domininique Gallizia. In 2011, Claude Kunetz, a Parisian art dealer, organised Kongo's first solo exhibition \\"De la rue jaillit la lumi√®re\\" (Light springing from the street). From then on, worldwide exhibitions have been numerous. The frontispiece of the Cit√© des Outre-mer in Paris is a mural by Kongo. With this recognition, prestige brands began to commission Kongo for the creation of luxury goods, including a silk scarf (a carr√©) with Herm√®s in 2011; a p√¢te de verre spray-paint can with crystal manufacturer Daum in 2016, and a watch with Richard Mille. In 2018, he is awarded the AD Great design award by Architectural Digest for one of the enamel plates he painted for six of the French luxury brand La Cornue stoves (sold $ 3000,000). The same year, he is asked by Karl Lagerfeld to design for the Chanel Metropolitan Museum of Art show.  Books  * Kongo, √©ditions Cercle d'art (2016) (in English and in French).
