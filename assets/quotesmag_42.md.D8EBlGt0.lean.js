He is the namesake of the Kern River and Kern County, California. Early life Kern was born in Philadelphia, the son of John Kern III and Mary Elizabeth Bignell. He was trained as an artist. His brother Richard Kern (1821‚Äì1853) was also an accomplished artist, and his brother Benjamin Kern (1818‚Äì1849) was a doctor. They joined him on several expeditions. Expeditions =California= In 1845‚Äì46, Kern accompanied explorer Captain John C. Fr√©mont on his Third Expedition into Mexican Alta California.Sierranevadageotourism.org: \\"Walker's Pass (No. 99 California Historical Landmark)\\" Kern received a daily salary of $3.00. He served as a cartographer as well as a documentation artist, collecting botanical and animal specimens on the journey. Each night of the trip Kern drew a field map of the day's route with longitudes and latitudes, and sketched landmarks. En route in Nevada, Kern's drawing documented the Fr√©mont party's killing of over 30 Northern Paiute Indians who were camped at the Humboldt Sink. Google Books: \\"Fr√©mont, Explorer for a Restless Nation\\", by Ferol Egan, text pg. 305; Edward Kern drawings (Bancroft Library collection) pg.320. Just before they reached Klamath Lake, Klamath tribesmen attacked the expedition and several members were killed. A brutal counterattack by Fr√©mont and his group upon a native village resulted in the deaths of many Klamath people. Kern recorded the counterattack in an engraving that was later published with Fr√©mont's report. Sutter's Fort Fr√©mont then ordered his main party ‚Äì which included Kern and Joseph Walker ‚Äì to travel the southern Sierra route over the pass Walker had discovered a decade earlier, while Fr√©mont and a few others crossed the northern Sierra at Donner Pass. Fr√©mont named the pass through which Walker led the party Walker Pass. Kern mapped the Kern River, which at the time was known as the Rio de San Felipe, as named by the Spanish. Later, Fr√©mont named the river after his artist. Kern‚Äôs campsite in the Kern River Valley, at the junction of the South and North Forks of the Kern River, now lies submerged by Lake Isabella. A historical monument for Kern‚Äôs site was placed above the reservoir near its eastern shore on Highway 178. During the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt against Mexico, Fr√©mont placed the 23-year-old Kern in command of Sutter's Fort and its company of dragoons in the Sacramento Valley. That left John Sutter the assignment as lieutenant of the dragoons, and second-in- command of his own fort, until 1847. While in command there, news of the stranded Donner Party reached Kern, as Sutter's Fort had been their destination. Internet Archive: \\"Desperate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West\\", by Ethan Rarick, pg. 165. Kern vaguely promised the federal government would do something for a rescue party across the Sierra, but had no authority to pay anyone. He was later criticized for his mismanagement delaying the search.Xmission.com: The Donner Party: Rescuers and OthersXmission.com: The Donner Party: First Relief Diary; article about Kern's behavior as fund administrator for Donner Party relief. In February 1847, Kern's forces were requested by several settlers who wished to intimidate Indians who had been involved in raids. Kern brought in 20 men, joined by 30 more led by John Sutter, and then proceeded with a series of attacks that killed 20 California Indians in what became known as the Kern and Sutter massacres. =Southwest= In 1848‚àí1849, Edward Kern and his brothers Richard and Benjamin joined Fr√©mont's Fourth Expedition, to the Rocky Mountains in present-day southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.org: Kern Drawings of the American Southwest ‚àí 1849 Google Books: \\"Edward M. Kern, Artist and Explorer\\", by William Joseph Hefferman; University of California, Berkeley, 1951. By the time the last surviving member of the expedition reached Taos on February 12, 1849, 10 of the party had died. To move more quickly to safety, it had been necessary for the brothers to hide their goods (including sketches) in a cave. After arriving in the New Mexico Territory, Benjamin Kern and Fr√©mont's guide Old Bill Williams returned for the hidden goods but were killed by a band of Utes. In August 1849, Edward and Richard Kern joined the John M. Washington military reconnaissance expedition to the Navajo in 1849, to punish the Navajo for raids on the New Mexico settlements and to secure a treaty with them, in addition to surveying the country. The expedition brought both brothers back to New Mexico. Richard's role, as second assistant and artist, was to make portraits of Indian chiefs, costume, scenery, geological formations, ruins, and to copy ancient writings found on stones. Edward's role was as first assistant and topographer.Kern, Richard H. Notes of a Military Reconnaissance of the Pais de los Navajos in the Months of Aug & Sep 1849. Huntington Library Manuscript 4274.Weber, David J. Richard H. Kern: expeditionary artist in the far southwest, 1848-1853. Albuquerque: Published for the Amon Carter Museum by the University of New Mexico Press, 1985. Edward and Richard stayed in New Mexico for two years, working for the Corps of Topographical Engineers. The Kern brothers gave the American public some of its earliest authentic images of the people and landscape of Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Colorado, with views of Canyon de Chelly, Chaco Canyon, and El Morro (Inscription Rock).Google Books: Pioneer Photographers of the Far West; by Peter E. Palmquist, Thomas R. Kailbourn. In 1853, Edward joined Lieutenant John Pope, who was seeking a better route between Santa Fe and Fort Leavenworth. His brother Richard was killed in 1853, while on the Gunnison‚ÄìBeckwith Expedition to survey a railroad route that would pass through the Rocky Mountains. Whampoa\\" =Asia= From 1853 to 1855, Edward Kern served on the ship USS Vincennes on an expedition to East Asia. The captain, Cadwalader Ringgold, was declared insane when they reached Hong Kong. Kern used both photography and drawing during this trip. The expedition landed on the eastern shores of Siberia, where Kern spent several weeks. They returned home via Tahiti and San Francisco. In 1858, Kern joined Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke on a survey of the sea lanes between California and China, returning in 1860. =Civil War= During the American Civil War, Kern served under Fr√©mont, who had command of the Army of the West, but when Fr√©mont was relieved of command, Kern was as well. Personal life Kern suffered from epilepsy beginning at a young age. Late in life he established a studio in Philadelphia. Edward Kern died in November 1863 of an epileptic seizure, at his home on 1305 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. He was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, and later re-interred in New Glenwood Cemetery. =Legacy= Kern's diaries were discovered under the floorboards in an old hotel in Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania, and provided source material for David Weber's book on his brother, Richard Kern. The diary and papers are now in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts holds more than eighty of Kern's works. The Kern River and Kern County, both in California, were named for him. References =Bibliography= * Edward Kern and American Expansion, by Robert V.

The Kreyenhagen Hills form a long foothill belt in the soft formations between Reef Ridge and Kettleman Plain. They are divided into several groups, each a few miles wide, by streams crossing them at right angles. They meet with the steep face of Reef Ridge, and are distinct from the mountains which begin there. To the northeast the strata form ridge after ridge, parallel to each other, and extend the length of the separate divisions between the main stream valleys. These ridges, appear like a series of waves advancing, toward Reef Ridge, and elsewhere to broken waves, as in a choppy sea. The ridges are slightly asymmetric, the northeast flank being a dip slope and fairly smooth, while the southwest flank is a steeper, strike face that is in many places eroded so as to leave sharp gullies and conical intermediate ridges extending outward. The groups of hillocks so produced bear some resemblance to an encampment of tents or huts, and the name Jacalitos, (meaning the little huts), may have been applied to Jacalitos Creek owing to this feature of the hills through which it flows. The greatest symmetry of the parallel ridges appear's in the portion of the Kreyenhagen Hills between Jacalitos Creek and Big Tar Canyon, and there the long, straight, smooth troughs between the ridges doubtless gave rise to the name Canoas, meaning trough, applied to Canoas Creek which passes across the central portion of the hills.Ralph Arnold, Robert Anderson, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, GEORGE OTIS SMITH, DIRECTOR, BULLETIN 398, GEOLOGY AND OIL RESOURCES OF THE COALINGA DISTRICT, CALIFORNIA, WITH A REPORT ON THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE OILS BY IRVING C. ALLEN, G.P.O., Washington, 1910, p.35-36 Kreyenhagen was the name of the family who originally owned the land in the area. In the northern group of the Kreyenhagen Hills, the slope toward Jacalitos Creek on the northwest is steeper and shorter than that toward Zapato Chino Creek on the southeast. The major part of the drainage flows in the latter direction. In the groups of hills between the other streams farther south such a feature is not so clearly to be made out, but it is true that the course taken by the drainage is predominantly toward the southeast. Toward the south the Kreyenhagen Hills become more worn, decline in elevation, and lose their relief. Prominent individual features are absent, and the foothill area is a rolling surface with low ridges and broad drainages sloping gradually toward and merging with the Kettleman Plain.

As a deejay, Meaux was known as the \\"Crazy Cajun\\", a name that stuck with him throughout his long, music career. In 1964, Meaux moved his Tear Drop label and his Crazy Cajun Enterprises to Conroe, Texas, where he partnered with a seasoned record producer, Foy Lee. They not only continued to release new material, but also started various subsidiary labels including Capri Records, Tribe Records, and Eric Records. Together, Meaux and Lee produced many chart singles on the Tear Drop label. They became nationally distributed by Jay Gee Records (J/G) which was owned by Jamie Records in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tear Drop's biggest hit was \\"Talk to Me\\" by Sunny & the Sunglows from San Antonio, Texas, which broke into the Billboard Top 100. Meaux and Lee also scored another hit in 1964 by Gene Summers & the Tom Toms entitled \\"Big Blue Diamonds\\" on their newly formed Capri Records label and later released Summers' rockabilly classic, \\"Alabama Shake\\", also on Capri. In the 1970s, Meaux reactivated the Crazy Cajun record label and began to produce records by early-1960s rocker, Freddy Fender. He scored the biggest hit of his career when Fender's \\"Before The Next Teardrop Falls\\" single broke through all chart boundaries and went platinum selling over a million copies. By this time, Meaux had purchased both the SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston, Texas, and the TNT Records pressing plant in San Antonio.

If a walk does not technically cross the entire continent, but starts and ends in a major city right near two opposing sides of a continent, it is usually considered transcontinental. People have crossed continents walking alone or in groups. Purpose Some people have completed a transcontinental walk due to a whim or a bet. Others have attempted transcontinental expeditions for scientific study or exploration. Transcontinental marches have been organized to serve as a demonstration to attract interest in some topic, or raise funds for a cause. Challenges Depending on the continent to be crossed, different challenges arise. To cross Antarctica on foot, supplying provisions would have to be well-planned. Crossing any continent on foot is also a test of endurance and physical condition. People who do a crossing without support have to transport equipment, tent, food etc., on a carriage or sled. That is an extra challenge, compared to those who have car support. Group transcontinental walks can be tougher to organize logistically than solo or duo efforts, especially when crossing international borders, since there generally needs to be greater accommodations and more thorough approvals for a group. There is also a tougher process of decision making with even a small group than with one or two people. People walking in groups sometimes say that the walking part is easier than dealing with group politics and dynamics. One participant in the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, a transcontinental group march of about 500 people in 1986, said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt agree on anything except to knock at the Porta-Potty.‚Äù North America =Charles Fletcher Lummis= In 1884, Charles Fletcher Lummis was working for a newspaper in Cincinnati when he was offered a job with the Los Angeles Times. Lummis decided to make the 3,500-mile journey from Cincinnati to Los Angeles on foot. He chronicled the 143 days of his journey, sending weekly dispatches to the newspaper. In spite of a broken arm and heavy snows in New Mexico, he finished the trip, and in 1892, his writings of the journey were published as a book, A Tramp Across the Continent. =John Hugh Gillis= In 1906, on a bet and a dare, John Hugh Gillis walked from North Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia. He was the first person to cross Canada on foot. =Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament= In 1986, hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington DC in what is referred to as the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. The march took nine months to traverse , advancing approximately fifteen miles per day. =A Walk of the People ‚Äì A Pilgrimage for Life= A Walk of the People ‚Äì A Pilgrimage for Life called for an end to the Cold War with better relations between the U.S. and former Soviet Union. Walkers started at Point Conception, Calif., in 1984 and went through Texas and the Deep South to New York City. A core group of eight flew to Dublin, Ireland, in 1985 and walked to the border of the former East Germany. They obtained visas to Hungary and walked to that border before visiting several cities by train. Some walked to Geneva, Switzerland, then organized a trip to Moscow, Russia, by train. Australia Australia has been host to a number of people who have walked across the country, who have completed the walk as either a personal challenge or to raise funds and awareness for charity. Antarctica =Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition= The Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition was an attempt from 1914 to 1917, to march across Antarctica, and was the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Europe =Trans-Europe Foot Race= In the Trans-Europe Foot Race, participants cross Europe on foot, although they are mainly running, not walking. It is a multiday race, and in 2003 crossed about 3,200 miles in Europe from Lisbon to Moscow. There were 21 finishers, not counting a wheelchair user. In 2009, it crossed Europe from Bari, Italy, to North Cape, Norway, in 64 days. It had 45 finishers. The participants have support with food, beverages and accommodation. There was also a race in 2012, and another is planned for 2021.  References   Further reading  * *Worsley, Frank A.: Endurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure W.W.

Known as 'Wal', Dudley was born in Fitzroy and played three games for their VFL side in 1940. He kicked two goals on debut against South Melbourne and a further two against Hawthorn. In four first-class cricket matches with Victoria as a right arm fast bowler he took 11 wickets at 36.54. He twice dismissed Bill Brown in a match against Queensland but his career highlight was claiming Don Bradman for a duck, when the great Australian batsman was playing for South Australia. When not representing Victoria, Dudley played for Victorian Premier Cricket club Northcote. He made a total of 240 appearances and took a club record 556 wickets.

From the town of Al Hisn in north of Jordan, he served as major and commander of the 48th Infantry Battalion of the Jordanian army during 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the Battle of Karameh. After the 1967 war, he was promoted to brigadier general and remained in Jordanian Armed Forces until retirement. He is well known for his role in the Samu Incident. Samu Incident Asad Ghanma was the commander of the 48th Infantry Battalion of the Jordanian army during the Samu Incident, which was the first Jordanian force to arrive at the battlefield.Bowen, p. 24. At the time of the Israeli raid into Samu, the Jordan's troops were strained, having been deployed across the 600-kilometer border with Israel and Ghanma's unit was the only one present in Samu's vicinity. The Israeli force consisted of eleven Centurion tanks, fifty armored half-tracks and 500 paratroopers and was backed by Ouragan bombers and eight field guns from the Israeli side of the border to counter any potential Jordanian armored vehicles or artillery.Bowen, pp. 24‚Äì25. As the Israelis entered Samu and surrounding villages, Ghanma's forces, divided into three companies headed directly towards the Israelis' blocking position and were intercepted northwest of Samu.Bowen, p. 25. Two other Jordanian companies were also intercepted from the northeast, but a Jordanian platoon managed to enter the town and engaged in close quarter fighting with the Israelis until the latter routed them. Fifteen Jordanian soldiers and three civilians were killed, 54 were wounded and much of Samu's buildings and infrastructure were heavily damaged or destroyed. An Israeli commander was killed and ten soldiers wounded. After the battle, Asad Ghanma received the Medal of Bravery from the King Hussein, for his role in the battle.

Made from ground hazelnuts, they are not to be confused with the Berner Honiglebkuchen, another Bernese specialty. Composition and production Haselnussleckerli, the smaller variant of the Haselnusslebkuchen. The Berner Haselnusslebkuchen are made of a marzipan-like mass of roasted and ground hazelnuts and about one eighth ground almonds, as well as a little sugar, honey, cinnamon, candied lemon and orange peel, held together by egg white. The addition of water or flour is not necessary, as the oil in the hazelnuts helps the mass stick together. The grinding of the hazelnuts requires extensive experience: if ground too hard, the hazelnut oils will liquefy and evaporate during baking, making the Lebkuchen hard like a zwieback. The hazelnut mass is rolled out into a spread of dough thick. The baker may then cut out DIN A5-sized rectangular pieces and press them into a form traditionally depicting a bear, Berne's heraldic animal (pictured above). She may also use cookie cutters in the shape of a bear or Santa Claus, or she may cut the dough into small rectangular pieces called Leckerli. The Lebkuchen are then allowed to dry for a few hours, during which the crystallizing sugar forms a faint crust on the dough's surface. Afterwards, they are baked at for 10 to 15 minutes. A well-made Haselnusslebkuchen should be crunchy on the outside, but remain soft and moist within. The Lebkuchen may then be decorated further with icing, hazelnuts or almonds. History and usage A sweet similar to the Haselnusslebkuchen, although still containing some flour, is first described in the 1835 Neues Berner Kochbuch, a cookbook by Lina Rytz. During the 19th and early 20th century, Bernese cookbooks record numerous recipes for Haselnussleckerli or Bernerl√§ckerli, indicating that the sweet was initially only produced in the small Leckerli form, with the larger rectangular forms coming into use only in the second half of the 20th century. The now-common name of Haselnusslebkuchen is first used in a 1946 baker's manual. The Lebkuchen's expensive ingredients such as hazelnuts and sugar indicate that it was always a gift article and a holiday sweet; up until the later 19th century, sugar was largely unaffordable for the Bernese working class. Haselnusslebkuchen continue to be made by bakers in the entire canton of Berne during December. In the city of Berne, where tourists provide for a steady demand, they can be bought all year round.

The band‚Äôs sound is highly influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelic rock/folk rock as well as other musical genres. History The band was started by Kristoffer Sj√∂dahl (formerly of Norrsken) and Johan Rydholm. As the two jammed together a lot, they then asked Marcus Allard to join which he said yes and later that year bass player Joakim Dimberg joined to complete the band. The band‚Äôs name arose from an album by Texas rock band Josefus which was entitled Dead Man. Dead Man initially released a vinyl 7‚Äù containing two songs, \\"Ship Ahoy!\\" and \\"Thousand Mile Stare\\", recorded in a basement in the rural town of Kumla. The two songs created a buzz among stoners and hippies in the underground scene in Sweden. =Dead Man (2006‚Äì2007)= Next, Dead Man decided to start on making their debut album. Dead Man snuck into the famous Svenska Grammofon Studion and began to work on their first album. In early 2006, with a fresh set of songs in hand, Dead Man was set to release their eponymous debut album. Released via Sweden‚Äôs Crusher Records, Dead Man was praised by Rock Hard, Metal Hammer and Stoner Rock. =Euphoria (2007‚Äì2009)= In mid-2007, Dead Man once again entered the studio to record their second album, Euphoria. While Dead Man was successful in the underground stoner and progressive rock scene, Euphoria would awaken many more listeners. In February 2009, Dead Man embarked on its first U.S. tour.

History Berlin was one of eight sculptures designed during \\"Skulpturenboulevard Kurf√ºrstendamm\\" (Boulevard of Sculptures: Kurf√ºrstendamm),Skulpturenboulevard - Berlin: von A bis Z (in German) an event commissioned by the city of West Berlin to celebrate Berlin's 750th anniversary in 1987. Of the eight sculptures unveiled, three were allowed to remain past the anniversary year (Berlin, Pyramide, and Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja); the city and Deutsche Bank acquired Berlin after its original lease had expired. For the event, the sculptors were allowed free rein to decide where on or around the Kurf√ºrstendamm to erect their work. The Matschinsky-Denninghoffs chose the Tauentzienstra√üe in front of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged√§chtniskirche, which was heavily damaged during the Bombing of Berlin in World War II, as the place to build and unveil their sculpture. The sculpture consists of four steel tubes extending upwards. Each is about two meters in diameter, reinforced with a concrete base. For about half a meter, one of the two ends on each side tilt, then change direction completely, looping but not touching, symbolizing the closeness and isolation between the two sides of Berlin. The surface of the tubes are covered by chrome nickel steel, which can darken or shine depending on the time of day. Describing the meaning and impact intended by the Berlin sculpture, Brigitte Matschinsky-Denninghoff said, \\"The sculpture is accessible from all sides and thus perceivable to viewers. [What is] emphasized is the direction West-East and East-West. Our sculpture is specifically designed as a big, 'organically grown' gate, forming a double arch which is not just necessary and practical, [but an] invigorating emphasis...we are trying to communicate something of Berlin's situation in a symbolic way.\\" See also * The Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, located nearly * \\"You have nothing to lose but your chains\\", a labor slogan References 1987 establishments in Germany 1987 sculptures Monuments and memorials in Berlin Outdoor sculptures in Berlin Steel sculptures in Germany Works by German people Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf ","title":"Berlin (sculpture)"},{"id":"20676853","text":"Defying Ocean's End (DOE) is a global agenda for action in marine conservation compiled in a 2004 Island Press book.

The conference was organized by Conservation International; convened by American oceanographer, Dr. Sylvia Earle, and Intel Corporation co-founder, Gordon Moore; and chaired by Graeme Kelleher. It included the participation of nearly 150 experts from more than 20 countries, representing the fields of ocean science, finance, and conservation. A select group of senior representatives from world governments, corporations and the media were also in attendance. In addition to Conservation International, a number of large, international conservation organizations collaborated on the conference. These included The Nature Conservancy, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Ocean Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Wildlife Fund.DOE Partners The Conference was sponsored by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, BP, ESRI, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and the Alexander Henry Foundation. The conference was structured into 5 regional case studies, 7 thematic working groups, and a business team focused on developing Action Plans which addressed specific issues and outcomes - with priorities, and costs identified‚Äîfor 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year timeframes. Five case studies were presented to all Conference participants, which addressed lessons learned and recommendations in very different regions: The Caribbean, Seamounts, Antarctic Waters, The Coral Triangle and the Gulf of California. Break-out discussions were divided into seven Thematic Working Groups on widely ranging science, conservation, social, economic and legal topics: *Ocean-Use Planning and Marine Protected Areas *Economic Incentives and Disincentives *Land-Ocean Interface *Maintaining/Restoring Functional Marine Ecosystems *Communication *Ocean Governance *The Unknown Ocean A Business Team led by Larry Linden of Goldman Sachs worked with all groups to identify key cost drivers and estimate reasonable total solution costs. =Results= The DOE website lists the following \\"high level\\" results:About DOE * Global Governance: Treat the 60% of the world ocean outside of national Exclusive Economic Zones as a World Ocean Public Trust. Establish legal and implementation approaches concerning ocean uses in the high seas - including fisheries - under coordinated, international multi-use zoning regimes. * Fisheries Reform: Use market-based mechanisms and changes to subsidies to reform fisheries through development of sustainable fishing projects, and the establishment of a global fund to provide incentives for the adoption of sustainable practices. * Communications: Implement global and regional communications plans; focus on educating the general public worldwide to ocean problems. Initiate global all- media campaigns on major issues. In developing nations, tailor the message to local cultural concerns, understanding and information networks (e.g., tribal elders), and build local capacity for disseminating the message. * Marine Protected Areas/Large Marine Ecosystems: Create, consolidate, and strengthen marine protected areas (MPAs) into a globally representative network. Develop/implement coordinated, global large marine ecosystem (LME) programs in identified priority regions. Provide more robust multi-use zoning and enforcement mechanisms to protect these LMEs. Establish LME/MPA protections over 5% of the world ocean within the next 10 years (0.7% currently). * Global Science: Develop an expanded applied research program focused on top priority marine environments high in endemism and biodiversity - seamounts, shallow- and deep-water reefs, continental slopes, caves and blue holes. =Participants= Notable attendees of the Defying Ocean's End conference included Chris Anderson, Dr. Farooq Azam, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Dr. Sylvia Earle, Cristina Mittermeier, Dr. Russell Mittermeier, Gordon Moore, Dr. Ransom A.

History  = Origins = Following on from recognition that women's rights were often marginalised in the context of human rights, a meeting organised by Women in Law and Development in Africa (WiLDAF) in March 1995, in Lom√©, Togo called for the development of a specific protocol to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights to address the rights of women. The OAU assembly mandated the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) to develop such a protocol at its 31st Ordinary Session in June 1995, in Addis Ababa.Rights of Women in Africa: Launch of a Petition to the African Union , Mary Wandia, Pambazuka News 162; 24 June 2004, republished in \\"African Voices on Development and Social Justice Editorial from Pambazuka News 2004\\" by Firoze Manji (Ed.) and Patrick Burnett (Ed.), Mkuki na Nyota Publishers, Tanzania, A first draft produced by an expert group of members of the ACHPR, representatives of African NGOs and international observers, organised by the ACHPR in collaboration with the International Commission of Jurists, was submitted to the ACHPR at its 22nd Session in October 1997, and circulated for comments to other NGOs. Revision in co-operation with involved NGO's took place at different sessions from October to January, and in April 1998, the 23rd session of the ACHPR endorsed the appointment of Julienne Ondziel Gnelenga, a Congolese lawyer, as the first Special Rapporteur on Women's Rights in Africa, mandating her to work towards the adoption of the draft protocol on women's rights. The OAU Secretariat received the completed draft in 1999, and in 2000 at Addis Ababa it was merged with the Draft Convention on Traditional Practices in a joint session of the Inter African Committee and the ACHPR. After further work at experts meetings and conferences during 2001, the process stalled and the protocol was not presented at the inaugural summit of the AU in 2002. In early 2003, Equality Now hosted a conference of women's groups, to organise a campaign to lobby the African Union to adopt the protocol, and the protocol's text was brought up to international standards. The lobbying was successful, the African Union resumed the process and the finished document was officially adopted by the section summit of the African Union, on 11 July 2003. = Reservations = At the Maputo Summit, several countries expressed reservations. Tunisia, Sudan, Kenya, Namibia and South Africa recorded reservations about some of the marriage clauses. Egypt, Libya, Sudan, South Africa and Zambia had reservations about \\"judicial separation, divorce and annulment of marriage.\\" Burundi, Senegal, Sudan, Rwanda and Libya held reservations with Article 14, relating to the \\"right to health and control of reproduction.\\" Libya expressed reservations about a point relating to conflicts.AU Executive Council endorses protocol on women's rights, Panafrican News Agency (PANA) Daily Newswire, 7 September 2003 = Ratification process = The protocol was adopted by the African Union on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in Maputo, Mozambique.African Union: Rights of Women Protocol Adopted, press release, Amnesty International, 22 July 2003 On 25 November 2005, having been ratified by the required 15 member nations of the African Union, the protocol entered into force.UNICEF: toward ending female genital mutilation, press release, UNICEF, 7 February 2006 As of July 2020, out of the 55 member countries in the African Union, 49 have signed the protocol and 42 have ratified and deposited the protocol. The AU states that have neither signed nor ratified the Protocol yet are Botswana, Egypt, and Morocco. The states that have signed but not yet ratified are Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Madagascar, Niger, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan.  Articles  The main articles are: * Article 2: Elimination of Discrimination Against Women * Article 3: Right to Dignity * Article 4: The Rights to Life, Integrity and Security of the Person * Article 5: Elimination of Harmful Practices ** This refers to female genital mutilation and other traditional practices that are harmful to women. * Article 6: Marriage * Article 7: Separation, Divorce and Annulment of Marriage * Article 8: Access to Justice and Equal Protection before the Law * Article 9: Right to Participation in the Political and Decision-Making Process * Article 10: Right to Peace * Article 11: Protection of Women in Armed Conflicts * Article 12: Right to Education and Training * Article 13: Economic and Social Welfare Rights * Article 14: Health and Reproductive Rights * Article 15: Right to Food Security * Article 16: Right to Adequate Housing * Article 17: Right to Positive Cultural Context * Article 18: Right to a Healthy and Sustainable Environment * Article 19: Right to Sustainable Development * Article 20: Widows' Rights * Article 21: Right to Inheritance * Article 22: Special Protection of Elderly Women * Article 23: Special Protection of Women with Disabilities * Article 24: Special Protection of Women in Distress * Article 25: Remedies Opposition There are two particularly contentious factors driving opposition to the Protocol: its article on reproductive health, which is opposed mainly by Catholics and other Christians, and its articles on female genital mutilation, polygamous marriage and other traditional practices, which are opposed mainly by Muslims. =Christian opposition= The conservative Pope Benedict XVI described the reproductive rights granted to women in the Protocol in 2007 as \\"an attempt to trivialize abortion surreptitiously\\".Pope to diplomats: Respect for rights, desires is only path to peace, 8 January 2007, Catholic News Service The Roman Catholic bishops of Africa oppose the Maputo Protocol because it defines abortion as a human right. The US-based pro-life advocacy organisation, Human Life International, describes it as \\"a Trojan horse for a radical agenda.\\"Marking The International Day of Women, 8 March 2008, Vatican Radio In Uganda, the powerful Joint Christian Council opposed efforts to ratify the treaty on the grounds that Article 14, in guaranteeing abortion \\"in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus,\\" is incompatible with traditional Christian morality.Rights Treaty in Uganda Snags on 'African Values', Women's eNews, 2 June 2008 In an open letter to the government and people of Uganda in January 2006, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Uganda set out their opposition to the ratification of the Maputo Protocol.Open Letter to the Government and People of Uganda Concerning the Ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Right: On the Rights of Women in Africa, Catholic Bishops' Conference of Uganda, document hosted at Eternal Word Television Network It was nevertheless ratified on 22 July 2010.http://www.africa4womensrights.org/post/2010/08/02/Uganda-becomes- the-28th-State-Party-to-the-Maputo-Protocol! =Muslim opposition= In Niger, the Parliament voted 42 to 31, with 4 abstentions, against ratifying it in June 2006; in this Muslim-majority country, several traditions banned or deprecated by the Protocol are common.Niger MPs reject protocol on women's rights, Independent Online, 6 June 2006 Nigerien Muslim women's groups in 2009 gathered in Niamey to protest what they called \\"the satanic Maputo protocols\\", specifying limits to marriage age of girls and abortion as objectionable.JOURN√âE NATIONALE DE LA FEMME NIG√âRIENNE: Les femmes musulmanes s‚Äôopposent aux ‚Äò‚Äôtextes sataniques‚Äô‚Äô relatifs √† la femme.

The publication of Wildwood Dancing follows soon on the heels of previous highly anticipated collections by Juliet Marillier: The Sevenwaters Trilogy, and The Bridei Chronicles.  Setting  Wildwood Dancing is set in early 16th-century Transylvania, and tells the story of five young sisters from the ages of five to seventeen, in the first person from the point of view of Jenica (called \\"Jena\\"), the second sister. This time period would precede the writing of Bram Stoker's Dracula, and therefore Marillier's \\"Night People\\" would not be referred to as vampires.Wildwood Dancing; Authors notes, p. 369  Plot  One winter, Jena's father sets out to the coast of Constan»õa to recover from a serious illness that would kill him if he remained home for the winter. In his absence, he leaves his house, his younger daughters, and his half of the merchant business he and his cousin run in the hands of Jena, and her elder sister Tatiana (called \\"Tati\\"). It is when Jena's father's cousin (called Uncle) Nicolae dies, that things begin to go wrong for Jena and her sisters: Cezar, Nicolae's youngest son, uses his newfound power of being master of his father's estate to take a firm control over the castle in which Jena and her sisters live. Every full moon, the sisters go to the Other Kingdom, where they meet and dance with various magical creatures. With each visit they begin to notice the deterioration of their lives at home: Aunt Bogdana, Nicolae's widow, is falling into depression, the money that was to last them the winter is rapidly dwindling, and Cezar is trying to seize all power over his cousin's estate in an attempt to prove himself after an incident that occurred in his childhood. Eventually, Cezar becomes so bent on revenge for the death of his older brother Costi (who drowned ten years prior to the book) that he suggests felling the forest around both his and his cousins' estates. In distress, Jena attempts to dissuade him from doing so. She also attempts to prevent Tati from seeing Sorrow, her sweetheart, who Jena believes to be one of the Night People. In an effort to persuade her sister that it is not meant to be, Jena enlists the help of Bogdana to organize a party to find suitable husbands at the next Full Moon. Jena and her younger sisters are all upset that they will miss the Full Moon dance, but none so much as Tati; she rapidly loses weight, and her personality fades into almost non-existence. Meanwhile, there was a killing in the village, which had all the markings of an attack of the Night People; reluctantly, Jena tells her sister of what Tadeusz had told her about Dark of the Moon at one of the Full Moon revels. Tati decides to use this portal at Dark of the Moon, where Jena discovers her with Tadeusz's sister, Anastasia. Frightened, the sisters are separated, and Anastasia takes Jena (unwillingly) to see Dragu≈£a's mirror. In the mirror, Jena learns of Sorrow's true heritage, as well as sees a vision of herself and a young man that she would come to love; the young man in this vision then changes into a horrible monster, turning on Jena's younger sisters. Frightened, Jena flees back to the lakeside, where she meets up with Tati and Sorrow. Sorrow then sends the girls over the frozen lake and back to their own world, where they decide to visit the Dancing Glade the next month to both warn the Queen of Cezar's intentions, and ask if she could help Sorrow, and the girl who was revealed to be his younger sister. After miserably failing to propose to (and being rejected by) Jena, Cezar works out that the entrance to the Other Kingdom is indeed in the bedchamber that Jena and her sisters share. Desperate for help, Jena sets out to the lake where Costi drowned, to seek out Dragu»õa. She speaks to the old woman for a little, before she is given a powerful sleeping potion to put both the man and the chaperone to sleep on the night of the full moon. As Jena leaves she gives Gogu, her pet frog she carries everywhere she goes, a kiss on the nose; a bright flash throws both her and the frog apart. When she can see again, she finds a young man on the shore of the lake, whom she instantly knows to be Gogu; she also recognizes him as the young man in the mirror, who turns into a monster. Jena is torn between following her heart and trusting him, and keeping her sisters safe by leaving him behind. Eventually, though she doesn't want to, Jena leaves the young man behind, breaking her own heart to keep her sisters safe. As planned, the sisters drug the man and chaperone in their bedchamber, and seek the help of the faerie Queen. Ileana tells Tati that she has set Sorrow a quest, to be completed within one month; if he succeeds, they will be allowed to wed, and Tati to live in the Other Kingdom. Gogu is also there, and the faerie Queen reveals that he was bound by a spell of silence, giving him his voice back. Gogu then reveals to Jena that he is Costi, which she denies; however, Dragu»õa later reveals that this is true. She had placed the boy under an enchantment to turn him into a frog. She then revealed that it was Jena's doubt that allowed Anastasia to manipulate the image in the mirror; Costi was not a monster, and Jena had broken his heart by claiming that he was a monster, instead of trusting him. Costi returns the next day and takes over his father's estate, and Cezar disappears; however, Jena is too nervous and guilty to speak to Costi. Eventually, Tati convinces her to go visit him and, on the day of the Full Moon, she does. Using three gifts, (the traditional amount for a fairytale), Jena captures Costi's attention for long enough to apologize and for them to confess their love for each other. They then come across an injured Sorrow, to whom they take a dying Tati. The two make their journey to the Other Kingdom, for good. Eventually, life returns to normal, though the family misses Tati. Jena's father returns home, and Jena and Costi look forward to their impending marriage.  Notable characters  * Tatiana: (16) \\"Tati\\". The eldest sister, she is known as the beautiful sister.

Life Valentine Leeper was born on Valentine's Day 1900 in the Leeper Building of Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, daughter of Dr Alexander Leeper, first Warden of that college, and his second wife, Mary (n√©e Moule). Her half-brothers, Reginald Leeper and Allen Leeper, both became prominent British diplomats. Her brother, Geoffrey Leeper, became the first professor of agricultural chemistry at the University of Melbourne.Trinity College - Women at Trinity - Valentine Alexa Leeper Valentine was educated at Melbourne Church of England Girls Grammar School and at Trinity College. For many years she worked as secretary and carer to her father, and then as carer for her mother. After both had died, in her middle age, she obtained work as a school teacher. Views Eccentric and conservative in style, but liberal in many of her views, Valentine acquired from her father the spirit of a controversialist, and over many decades she was a frequent writer of letters to newspapers, government ministers, Anglican church leaders, and many others. She was a commentator and activist on international affairs (e.g. as a long-time member of the League of Nations Union), Indigenous affairs (including as a long-time member of the Victorian Aboriginal Group), education (including the protection of classical studies), the Church (for example, as an advocate of women's ordination). Her other interests include hockey playing. In 1944, she published a pamphlet, Piecrust Promises, attacking what she saw as the British betrayal of Poland to the Soviet Union during World War II, which had originally been fought to protect Poland. For many years in the mid-20th century Valentine Leeper appeared on Australian radio as a provider of little- known information and her own clear opinions. A strong defender of her father's memory and opinions, Valentine Leeper provided much information for a biography of him, written by Professor John Poynter, and published in 1997. In 1998, Valentine Leeper was installed as a Fellow of Trinity College (University of Melbourne). She died in 2001. Her ashes were interred in a garden next to the building in which she was born, and in which she had played as a girl.

It was a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index. The name Cosalt was a portmanteau of the company's original title The Great Grimsby Coal, Salt and Tanning Company. Formed in 1873 as a co-operative of fishing vessel owners, it was a communal best-value support services company involved in servicing and supplying a variety of products and services for fleets, fishing, and other vessels, providing: *Salt - to preserve the food and fish caught *Tanning - to waterproof sails and rope *Coal - to fire the vessels and galleys *Clothing The communal model grew around a number of other fishing and later UK marine ports, before the company was bought out by the son of one of the original founders, businessman (John) Carl Ross of the Ross Group. The company floated in 1971, and was chaired by his son; and then grandson David Ross, co-founder of the Carphone Warehouse. The original businesses has now developed into marine and industrial safety centre, and diversified into other markets, including: Workwear and Corporatewear. Leisure Through its association with Grimsby, Cosalt was a major player in the UK caravan market. It created the Piper brand, and after the failure of Sam Alper's Caravans International bought its brands, including: ACE, Abbey, Bessacarr, Sprite; and later the independent Cotswold brand. However, in the 1990s they began concentrating on static caravans, and sold off many of the touring caravan brand to the rival Swift Leisure. In the mid-2000s and looking to sell the Leisure business, the division was eventually sold to Leeds-based turnaround specialists Endless Fund, but collapsed into administration 12months later. After losing 240 jobs and one factory, it was bought by a management team and renamed Cosalt Custom Homes, preserving 20jobs.

The firm espouses a philosophy of sustainable design, collaborative design, and in-depth research. They have also shown an interest in prefabrication, new technologies and integrating architecture with the actual activities to take place in the buildings they design, especially using \\"teaching\\" design elements in schools. Their interest in productions and craft led them to team up with DuPont to develop Smartwrap, a laminated polymer film that can support thin interstitial films, including photovoltaics, OLEDs, polarizing or UV screens, etc. History James Timberlake and Stephen Kieran met at the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture, joining Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates, before receiving Rome Prizes separately and finally founding their practice in 1984.http://www.aia.org/press2_template.cfm?pagename=release_121307_firmaward The firm maintained itself as a noted sustainable design firm for many years, building a reputation for attention to detail and consistency. The partners were awarded the inaugural Latrobe Fellowship from the American Institute of Architects in 2001. KieranTimberlake received more attention after the publication of Refabricating Architecture, a book that explains and argues for the prefabrication of buildings using Building Information Modeling and close coordination of architects and contractors. Timberlake and Kieran argue that offsite production of buildings would be less expensive, more sustainable, and offer tolerances and techniques not possible in on-site construction. They also insist that mass-customization, as they call it, is the proper extension of the ideas expressed by Le Corbusier and other early modernists, who sought to develop inexpensive and easily built housing.

Scope Hardness of approximation complements the study of approximation algorithms by proving, for certain problems, a limit on the factors with which their solution can be efficiently approximated. Typically such limits show a factor of approximation beyond which a problem becomes NP- hard, implying that finding a polynomial time approximation for the problem is impossible unless NP=P. Some hardness of approximation results, however, are based on other hypotheses, a notable one among which is the unique games conjecture. History Since the early 1970s it was known that many optimization problems could not be solved in polynomial time unless P = NP, but in many of these problems the optimal solution could be efficiently approximated to a certain degree. In the 1970s, Teofilo F. Gonzalez and Sartaj Sahni began the study of hardness of approximation, by showing that certain optimization problems were NP-hard even to approximate to within a given approximation ratio. That is, for these problems, there is a threshold such that any polynomial-time approximation with approximation ratio beyond this threshold could be used to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.. In the early 1990s, with the development of PCP theory, it became clear that many more approximation problems were hard to approximate, and that (unless P = NP) many known approximation algorithms achieved the best possible approximation ratio. Hardness of approximation theory deals with studying the approximation threshold of such problems. Examples For an example of an NP-hard optimization problem that is hard to approximate, see set cover.

Cellular functions include the immune system‚Äôs production of T-lymphocytes and antibodies, and nonimmune related homeostatic functions such as liver gluconeogenesis, sodium reabsorption, osmoregulation, and brown adipose tissue nonshivering thermogenesis. This regulation occurs through the sympathetic and parasympathetic system (the autonomic nervous system), and their direct innervation of body organs and tissues that starts in the brainstem. There is also a noninnervation hormonal control through the hypothalamus and pituitary (HPA). These lower brain areas are under control of cerebral cortex ones. Such cortical regulation differs between its left and right sides. Pavlovian conditioning shows that brain control over basic cell level physiological function can be learnt. Higher brain =Cerebral cortex= Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and the hypothalamus are regulated by the higher brain. Through them, the higher cerebral cortex areas can control the immune system, and the body‚Äôs homeostatic and stress physiology. Areas doing this include the insular cortex, the orbital, and the medial prefrontal cortices. These cerebral areas also control smooth muscle and glandular physiological processes through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system including blood circulation, urogenital, gastrointestinal functions, pancreatic gut secretions, respiration, coughing, vomiting, piloerection, pupil dilation, lacrimation and salivation. =Lateralization = The sympathetic nervous system is predominantly controlled by the right side of the brain (focused upon the insular cortex), while the left side predominantly controls the parasympathetic nervous system. The cerebral cortex in rodents shows lateral specialization in its regulation of immunity with immunosuppression being controlled by the right hemisphere, and immunopotention by the left one. Humans show similar lateral specialized control of the immune system from the evidence of strokes, surgery to control epilepsy, and the application of TMS. Brainstem The higher brain top down control of physiology is mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in the brainstem, and the hypothalamus. The sympathetic nervous system arises in brainstem nuclei that project down into intermediolateral columns of thoracolumbar spinal cord neurons in spinal segments T1‚ÄìL2. The parasympathetic nervous system in the motor nuclei of cranial nerves III, VII, IX, (control over the pupil and salivary glands) and X (vagus ‚Äìmany functions including immunity) and sacral spinal segments (gastrointestinal and urogenital systems). Another control occurs through top down control by the medial areas of the prefrontal cortex. upon the hypothalamus which has a nonnerve control of the body through hormonal secretions of the pituitary. =Immunity= The brain controls immunity both indirectly through HPA glucocorticoid secretions from the pituitary, and by various direct innervations. * Antibodies. There is sympathetic innervation of the thymus gland. Sympathetic control exists over antibody production, and the modulation of cytokine concentrations. * Cellular immunity. An intact sympathetic nervous system is required to maintain full cellular immunoregulation as denervated mice do not produce and activate, for example, splenic suppressor T cells, or thymic NKT cells. * Organ inflammation. Sympathetic innervation of various organs contacts macrophages and dendritic cells and can increase local inflammation including the kidney gut, the skin, and the synovial joints * Antiinflammation. The vagus nerve carries a parasympathetic cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway that reduces proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF by spleen macrophages in the red pulp and the marginal zone and so the activation of inflammation. This control is in part controlled by direct innervation of body organs such as the spleen. However, the existence of the parasympathetic antiinflammatory nerve pathway is controversial with one reviewer stating: ‚Äúthere is no evidence for an anti- inflammatory role of the efferent vagus nerve that is independent of the sympathetic nervous system.‚Äù p. 741 =Metabolism= The liver receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system innervation. * Plasma glucose levels. A vagus brain-liver axis exists that detects lipids produced by the gut and acts to regulate glucose homeostasis. * Glycogenesis. Vagal activation also controls glycogen synthesis in the liver. * lipogenesis. Vagal activation also controls the generation of lipids in brown adipose tissue. * Insulin. Vagal innervation of the pancreas controls the release of insulin release from its beta cells (and this is inhibited by norepinephrine released under sympathetic control from the splanchnic nerve). * Thyroid hormones can control glucose production via the hypothalamus and its sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the liver. =Other = * Thermogenesis ‚Äì this is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system starting in the dorsolateral preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus via projections from the rostral raphe pallidus to the spinal intermediolateral nucleus nonshivering thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue. * Stress ‚Äì norepinephrine and epinephrine, the stress hormones, are released from nerve terminals in the adrenal medulla in the kidney innervated from the sympathetic nervous system‚Äôs splanchnic nerve. * Kidney function ‚Äì the sympathetic nervous system projects to the kidney and controls glomerular filtration rate and so fluid balance, sodium reabsorption, and osmoregulation. Conditioning The brains of animals can anticipatorily learn to control cell level physiology such as immunity through Pavlovian conditioning. In this conditioning, a neutral stimulus saccharin is paired in a drink with an agent, cyclophosphamide, that produces an unconditioned response (immunosuppression). After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself through neural top down control created immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response. This work was originally done on rats, however, the same conditioning can also occur in humans. The conditioned response happens in the brain with the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus providing the output pathway to the immune system, the amygdala, the input of visceral information, and the insular cortex acquires and creates the conditioned response. The production of different components of the immune system can be controlled as conditioned responses: * Antibodies *IL-2 * B, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ naive and memory T cells, and granulocytes. Such conditioning in rats can last a year. Nonimmune functions can also be conditioned: * Serum iron levels * The level of oxidative DNA damage * Insulin secretion * Blood glucose levels See also * Autonomic nervous system * Homeostasis * Homeostatic emotion * Neurogastroenterology * Neuroendocrinology * Neuroimmunology * Parasympathetic nervous system * Peripheral nervous system * Psychoneuroimmunology * Sympathetic nervous system References Autonomic nervous system Homeostasis Neurophysiology ","title":"Neural top‚Äìdown control of physiology"},{"id":"20677329","text":"My Son, My Son! is a 1940 American drama film based on a novel by the same name written by Howard Spring and directed by Charles Vidor.

He stems from the family of a Russian emigrant of aristocratic origin (family Repnin), a family doctor, resident in Prague-≈Ωi≈ækov. At first, he attended a Russian high school in Prague district Pankr√°c, during which time he was preparing for his future piano and composition studies at the Music Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts (AMU), taking piano lessons with Berta Kabel√°ƒçov√° and music theory and composition lessons with Miloslav Kabel√°ƒç. At the Academy he was Jaroslav ≈ò√≠dk√Ω's student from 1952 to 1956. His graduation composition was the symphonic poem The V√≠tkov Hill (V√≠tkov ‚Äì the place of the decisive battle in 1420 near Prague). He worked in the Prague Municipal Education Centre, where he was in charge of the Folk Entertainment department. In the 1960s he founded the People's Conservatory specialising in dance-music and jazz (now Jaroslav Je≈æek Conservatory and College), and became its first director. After crushing of the Prague Spring movement in 1968 his artistic work was banned. However, he managed to secure the position of professor at the Jan Deyl Conservatory and Secondary school for Visually Impaired. Later on he moved to the Prague Conservatory, where he taught music theory and composition from 1976 to 1992. At present, he presides over the administrative board of Dilia, an international agency providing copyright protection. An awardee of the 2003 Supraphon Gold and Platinum Disc, Petrov has composed nearly 1300 works, concentrating in his production mainly on theatre, film, radio, and television music.

The team of architects is led by Shefali Balwani (Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, India) and Robert Verrijt (Technical University Delft, the Netherlands). History Architecture BRIO is a design studio focusing primarily on the fields of architecture, interior and sustainable design. The work of Architecture BRIO is characterized by a conceptual approach towards understanding and reinterpreting the specific context in which it is located. One of their first projects, a design proposal for a Dormitory at the Magic Bus Campus, received critically acclaimInhabitat Article on Architecture BRIO's sustainable design and was featured in the publication Architecture of Change 2Architecture of Change 2, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment Ten years later, Architecture BRIO's work field spans the vast variety of cultures, climates and landscapes across the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia. Each project is seen as a challenge and opportunity to uncover the unique characteristics of these specific conditions, investigating which intervention has a potential for positive change and impact in the way we deal with our natural and built world. Simultaneously the studio believes that architecture should remain a backdrop to life rather than taking centre stage. In order for Architecture is to have a long lasting sensory impact it needs to evoke the urge to be discovered. Their portfolio is significantly diverse, \\"with common themes that concern tectonics of site, formal and spatial explorations of architecture, critical reading of the programme, systems thinking, and clarity of material and detail that have characterised their work.\\" The work of Architecture BRIO has since been published widely in national and international media. The Riparian House was featured in the BBC documentary series The World's Most Extraordinary Homes. Awards Architecture Brio has been the recipient of several prestigious awards. Robert Verrijt was awarded the second prize in the Dutch Archiprix 2004 Dutch Archiprix 2004 for his design of an Asylum Seekers Centre in Maastricht. Together with Floris Cornelisse he won the first prize for the entry Triade in the Europan 8 Competition 2005.

It originally consisted of 11 Maryland inns on the National Road and located in Allegany and Garrett counties. Those that remain stand as the physical remains of the almost-legendary hospitality offered on this well-traveled route to the west. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Allegany County *Clarysville Inn site: The Clarysville Inn stood along the old section of the National Road, U.S. Route 40, to the south of the present road at Clarysville. It was a -story brick structure with flush double chimneys at the gable ends, a symmetrical facade, and 6/6 sash windows. After 1936, the original porch with a balustrade was replaced by semi-circular Tuscan-columned porch which extended the length of the central three bays and also contained an upper-level balustrade. Supposedly built around 1807 by a wealthy mid-western landowner, the Inn was initially used as a tavern along the old turnpike. The inn was used as a hospital during the American Civil War and then used as a restaurant before it was destroyed by fire on March 10, 1999. Once owned by family and Cas Taylor the inn was sold between 1970's and 1995 to an unknown buyer. *Colonial Manor: Colonial Manor, or Turkey Flight Manor, is on the south side of present U.S. Route 40, north of old Route 40 in the Naves Crossroad area at the intersection of U.S. Route 220. It is a -story, mid-19th-century classically influenced brick structure. It was altered in the 1940s when Route 40 was relocated to the north of the house. The building served as a hospital after the American Civil War battle at nearby Falch's Mill in 1864. *Early Frame House: Early Frame House is located on U.S. Route 40 at Pleasant Grove on the slope of a hill several feet above the National Pike. It is a -story, mid-19th-century frame structure with a tin-covered gable roof. *Five Mile House: Five Mile House is one mile west of Four Mile House and five miles west of Cumberland, on U.S. Route 40 at La Vale. It is two and a half stories high and five bays in width, with a large cross gable. *Flintstone Hotel: Flintstone Hotel, also called the Piper Hotel, is located on U.S. Route 40 at Flintstone. It is a large -story classically influenced brick structure the early to mid-19th century. It is said to have been built originally about 1807 for John Davis (a large landowner) as a private residence. Well-known visitors to the hotel are believed to include the Marquis de Lafayette (1824), Henry Clay, and Theodore Roosevelt. *Four Mile House: Four Mile House is one mile east of Five Mile House and four miles west of Cumberland, on U.S. Route 40 at La Vale. It is a -story, mid-19th-century brick structure of Greek Revival influence. An Ionic-columned porch with a turned balustrade stretches across at the first floor level. It was built about 1840 for Samuel Eckles and rebuilt after a fire in the late 1950s or early 1960s destroyed the second floor rooms. *Six Mile House: Six Mile House is located six miles east of Cumberland, on the Baltimore Turnpike, also known as the National Road and later renamed U.S. Route 40. It is a -story brick structure built during the 1830s-1840s. *Stone House: Stone House is on an abandoned section of U.S. Route 40 at Pleasant Valley, about two miles west of Flintstone. It is the shell of an early-19th-century, -story stone structure with a gable roof. It was supposedly built about 1819 as a tavern for Jonas Street. Garrett County *Casselman (Hotel): Casselman (Hotel) is located on U.S. Route 40 at Grantsville. It is a -story, Greek Revival brick structure, built about 1842. It was built for Solomon Sterner to serve travelers on the National Road. *National Hotel (demolished): The National Hotel was on U.S. Route 40 at Maryland Route 495, Grantsville. It was a -story, 19th-century hip-roofed frame structure built about 1842. It was built for Henry Fuller, an innkeeper from Salisbury, Pennsylvania, on the site of the Lehman House, an earlier hostelry. It has been demolished. *Penn Alps, Main Building: Penn Alps, Main Building, stands between present U.S. 40 and old U.S. 40, east of Grantsville. It was built in the early 19th century as a log house, then enlarged to two and a half stories, and \\"modernized\\" in the Italianate style in the late 19th century. It was converted for commercial use with major renovations and additions in the 20th century. *Tomlinson Inn and The Little Meadows: Tomlinson Inn and The Little Meadows is located on U.S. Route 40 at Grantsville. It is a large, rectangular, stone structure built on a hillside. It was constructed about 1818 and has two full stories plus an attic and basement.

It is also the name of the associated town and locality within the City of Gold Coast. It borders New South Wales.  Geography  The highest point, known as Mt Mumjin or Springbrook Mountain is high at Best of All Lookout carpark according to the latest LIDAR survey by Gold Coast City. The plateau is covered in subtropical rainforest and crossed by many small creeks. The area has excellent views to the Gold Coast and is known for its cliffs, waterfalls and forest walks, most of which are protected in the Springbrook National Park. Road access to this eastern Scenic Rim mountain is via Mudgeeraba along the Springbrook Road and from Numinbah Valley via Pine Creek Road. To the south of Springbrook is the Tweed Range, west is the Numinbah Valley and the Lamington Plateau. Both the Nimmel Range and Tamborine Mountain are to the north, as is Hinze Dam while the peak of Mount Nimmel is at the north eastern tip. The plateau is part of a biodiversity hot spot. It is part of the Scenic Rim Important Birdlife Area. Pademelons are commonly seen by visitors.  Plateau  Purlingbrook Falls Springbrook Plateau is the remains of the Tweed Volcano‚Äînow known as Mount Warning and the Tweed Valley.Springbrook National Park: Visitor Information. Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service. 1994. The plateau is an undulating elevated patch that extends north from the southern, forested heights, close to Mount Cougal, just to the east. These subtropical rainforests are part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia and contain the rare Antarctic beech trees. Springbrook plateau has been described as \\"the Switzerland of Queensland\\" and a unique wonder. Springbrook was widely considered to be part of the McPherson Range. As the area's geology was understood it has now come to be typically described as a distinct plateau landform. Notable lookouts on the plateau include Best of All Lookout, overlooking the Tweed Valley directly south of Springbrook, as well as Canyon, Goomoolahra and Purlingbrook lookouts. Springbrook features the Purlingbrook Falls, which is a major tourist attraction as well as Goomoolahra Falls. Apple Tree Park, 2016 The plateau is highly visible on the western horizon from the Gold Coast coastal strip. Springbrook Plateau is in the water catchment area for Tallebudgera Creek and the larger Nerang River dammed by the Hinze Dam, a significant part of the region's water supply infrastructure. Little Nerang Creek flows into Little Nerang Dam in the north of the locality. The Natural Bridge is a rock arch and waterfall on the western slopes of the plateau. A triangulation station is located close to Mount Thillinmam at Bilbrough Lookout. Mobile reception is generally poor at Springbrook. =Preservation= Beginning in 2005 the Beattie Government and Bligh Government spent $40.15 million purchasing 45 properties covering 705 hectares in Springbrook. The aim is to restore critical habitat to world heritage status and eventually expand the Springbrook National Park. The recovery process is conducted by the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society and led by Aila Keto. The land purchases have been criticised because of a lack of accountability, for pushing up land values and negatively affecting tourism by reducing the number of accommodation places, restaurants and cafes. Springbrook National Park rainforest, 2016 The Settlement picnic area, 2016 Springbrook was the site for a trial that involved 200 distributed, wireless sensors that can monitor natural conditions such as humidity, temperature, light, rainfall, fog, water quality and sound. The cutting edge technology was developed by the CSIRO to assist research into the restoration of natural vegetation. Bush camping is not permitted in the national park. There is one camping area in Carricks Road. Springbrook is the eastern end of the Gold Coast Hinterland Great Walk. This mountain hike links to O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat via Binna Burra. Climate Due to its close proximity to the coast, the high elevations and subtropical latitude, Springbrook has a wet climate with mild temperatures. Rainfall at the now closed Upper Springbrook BOM rainfall station averaged 3109 mm annually over 90 years. Springbrook is the only place in subtropical Australia to exceed 3000 mm average rainfall making it probably the wettest place between Townsville and Tasmania. Exceptionally rainy periods have been recorded in some wet years including; 900 mm of rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period before an unnamed cyclone crossed the coast at Coolangatta on 20 February 1954. During a remarkable rainy period, Springbrook received in the month of June 1967. In January 2013, of rain fell over a period of just 4 days, due to the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Oswald. In March 2017, of rain fell in part due to Cyclone Debbie, of which was recorded at Upper Springbrook on the 31st of March 2017, causing enough damage to cut off the two access routes into Springbrook and leaving many residents without electricity.  Flora and Fauna  Springbrook has a rich biodiversity that is among the highest diversity of flora, fauna and fungi in Subtropical Australia. Habitat types include Montane Sclerophyll Forests dominated by temperate eucalyptus trees such as New England Blackbutt (Eucalyptus campanulata) and Blue Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus oreades) both of which are near their Northern limit of distribution. Rocky outcrops and cliffs support Montane Heath shrublands dominated by Tea Trees Leptospermum variable and L. petersonii, Mountain Bottlebrush Melaleuca montana and Cliff Bottlebrush M. comboynensis. The GIant Rosette Plant Doryanthes palmeri is present on cliffs. Many threatened and endemic flora species are present notably the Endangered Springbrook Leatherwood Eucryphia jinksii which is found nowhere else. Four main types of Rainforest occur on Springbrook; Dry Rainforest, Subtropical Rainforest, Warm Temperate Rainforest and small patches of Cool Temperate Rainforest on the highest peaks. The dominance and diversity of trees varies between rainforest types. Dry rainforest occurs in small patches on the Northern and Western sections of Springbrook and features Hoop Pine Araucaria cunninghamii, Cinnamon Myrtle Backhousia myrtifolia, Yellow Tulip Drypetes deplanchei and Lace Bark Brachychiton discolor. Subtropical rainforest favors the rich red basaltic soils of the main plateau over 100 tree species can be present however, signature species of this type include White Booyong Argyrodendron trifoliolatum, Black Booyong Argyrodendron actinophyllum, Strangler Figs Ficus spp. and Giant Stinging Tree Dendrocnide excelsa. Much of this forest type was cleared for agriculture in the early 20th century. Warm Temperate Rainforest grows on low fertility soils derived from Rhyolite and has fewer tree species than subtropical types. Dominant trees of the warm temperate rainforest include Coachwood Ceratopetalum apetalum, Callicoma Callicoma serratifolia and occasionally Springbrook Leatherwood Eucryphia jinksii. Cool Temperate Rainforest is restricted to a single area above 1000m altitude near the Best of All Lookout. This forest type features Antarctic Beech Nothofagus moorei trees are likely to be thousands of years old and are covered in mosses, orchids and filmy ferns which thrive in the moist cloudy micro-climate. The highest altitude rainforests on Springbrook meet the definition of Subtropical Montane Cloud Forests. The Springbrook plateau is very rich in native animals including; marsupials, frogs, birds, lizards, snakes and invertebrates such as Spiny Freshwater Crayfish. Paddymelon Wallabies are among the most commonly sighted marsupials but Bettongs, Bandicoots, Swamp Wallabies are also common ground dwelling mammals. Arboreal mammals include mountain brushtail and ring tailed possums and the rare Eastern Pygmy Possum has also been recorded. Frogs include the threatened Fleay's Barred Frog Mixophyes fleayi, Marsupial Frog Assa darlingtonii and Mountain Frog Philoria loveridgei. Birds are abundant and diverse, the most noteworthy being perhaps Albert's Lyrebird and a true bird of paradise the Paradise Riflebird. Three species of Bowerbird are present being the Satin, Regent and Green Catbird. Reptiles include the Border Leaf Tailed Gecko (Saltuarius swainii) The Land Mullet Skink, Stephen's Banded Snake, Eastern Tiger Snake, Carpet Python, Red Bellied Black Snake. Invertebrates include the Lamington Spiny Crayfish Euastacus sulcatus and the Smaller Springbrook Crayfish Euastacus maidae. A new species of Phasmid Stick Insect was recently discovered at Springbrook and Named Parapodacanthus ailaketoae. Large flightless ground beetles include on the higher Springbrook plateau Nurus perater and at lower elevations at Mt Cougal,Tallebudgera and Natural Bridge Nurus moorei. The striking blue and red Mountain Katydid Acripeza reticulata and Tim Tam Bug Zopherosis georgei that resembles a chocolate biscuit have also been recorded at Springbrook. History Springbrook was originally known as the Numinbah Plateau. The timbered plateau was settled relatively late with both the area's inaccessibility and timber reserve status acting as deterrents. In 1906, the area ceased to be a timber reserve and was opened for agricultural settlement. In the same year the first group of settlers, including James Hardy, arrived from northern New South Wales and referred to the new settlement as Springwood. However it was changed to Springbrook to avoid confusion with mail deliveries to another Springwood located in the Blue Mountains. Following the request of postal officials to change the name to avoid confusion with another location in New South Wales, the area became known as Springbrook. Dairying was encouraged but the settlers found farming difficult and instead cleared for the land for timber. By the 1930s Springbrook was almost completely cleared of trees. In 1911, a school opened. Tourism has been the major industry since the 1920s, with many guesthouses opening during this period. A decent road up the mountain was built in the mid 1920s with the first car reaching the settlement in June 1926. Wunburra State School opened circa 1935 after relocating the then-closed Bonogin Creek State School building. Wunburra State School closed circa 1942. The first declaration of a national park on the plateau was Warrie National Park in 1937. By 1947 a community hall had been built. The post office was closed in 1958. A memorial to the pioneering settlers of the area was built in 1961 to celebrate 50 years since opening of the former Springbrook State School.

The domain was ruled by the Mizuno clan at the time.NAKAJIMA Hiroaki,Tamp≈ç \\"Azumino\\" (Investigating Azumino), Matsumoto, Ky≈çdo Shuppan-sha, 1997 , p.76 Numerous incidents of peasant uprising have been recorded in the Edo period, and in many cases the leaders of the uprisings were executed afterward.Nihonshi Kenky≈´ (Japanese History Study), Yamakawa Shuppan-sha, 2008, p.288 Those executed leaders have been admired as Gimin, non-religious martyrs, with the most famous Gimin being the possibly fictitious Sakura S≈çgor≈ç. But the J≈çky≈ç Uprising was unique in that not only the leaders of the uprising (former or incumbent village heads, who did not personally suffer from the heavy taxes), but also a sixteen-year-old girl (subject of the book Oshyun by Ohtsubo Kazuko) who had helped her father, \\"the deputy ringleader\\", were caught and executed. On top of that, the leaders of the uprising clearly recognized what was at stake. They realized that the real issue was abuse of rights within a feudal system. Because the newly raised tax level was equivalent to a 70% tax rate; an impossible rate. The Mizunos compiled Shimpu-t≈çki, an official record of the Matsumoto Domain about forty years after the uprising.Preface to Shimpu-t≈çki This Shimpu-t≈çki is the major and credible source of information concerning the uprising.TANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, p.30  Background  For several years there had been crop failure caused by severe winters. Azumidaira farmers had suffered from this and many people had starved to death. Poverty was rampant. Under the circumstances some households had to sell their daughters to brothels, and others had to kill newborn babies. Some village heads like Tada Kasuke and Oana Zembei tried to relieve the farmers' suffering by giving away rice from their own storehouses. But their acts of righteousness were met with a harsh reprimand from officials in Matsumoto. Tada Kasuke was fired as the headman of Nakagaya village, and Oana Zembei was fired as the headman of Nir√© village.TANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, p.88 Then in the fall of 1686, the domain government raised taxes to an exorbitant level. (The domain lord who was away from home at the time was obviously not informed of the tax rise.) The reason for this tax rise was that the domain government needed more money. The domain lord of Matsumoto was a fudai daimy≈ç, who was obligated to perform many duties, and therefore had to spend a lot of money. The domain lords of neighboring Takat≈ç and Takashima were not under such pressure to perform such duties, even though they used to be a part of the Matsumoto Domain. They collected lower taxes from their people. When Azumidaira farmers were notified of the tax rise, the atmosphere among tax collectors and peasants became tense, for their neighbors didn't have to pay the same amount of taxes. Event  =Secret meetings= In October 1686, Tada Kasuke summoned a dozen trustworthy farmers to a secret meeting held at a local Kumano Shrine. The sacred place was an appropriate venue for discussing the issue of peasant survival. After a series of such meetings, Tada Kasuke and his followers came to the conclusion that appealing to the magistrate‚Äôs office in Matsumoto was inevitable. They decided to do so even though they knew that to appeal was forbidden. Married men divorced their wives and sent them back to their parents‚Äô homes. They then prepared a letter of appeal of five articles. In the letter they humbly asked for a tax reduction. The five points of the letter of appeal were : 1\\\\. Rendering rice tax after processing is too much of a burden. 2\\\\. We ask for a reduction of rice tax to the level of those of two neighboring domains. 3\\\\. Concerning the part of rice tax collected in the form of soy-beans, half of which is collected in cash; We ask that the tax money be calculated based on the price of rice, not on the price of soy-beans. 4\\\\. Concerning the obligation of transportation of rice, we ask that the obligation be reduced to transporting it only as far as the domain limits. 5\\\\. Concerning the personnel cost of local and Edo offices, which we are obligated to shoulder, we ask that the obligation be cancelled. =Appeal to the Magistrate's Office= Early on the morning of October 14, Tada Kasuke and Oana Zembei, along with their followers,There were fourteen farmers in all. went to the magistrate‚Äôs office outside Matsumoto Castle, and handed in the letter of appeal. What they had not expected was that a huge crowd of farmers would gather and intimidate the officials. Kasuke and his followers had started this out as a peaceful mission. (There is a scholar who refutes this generally accepted notion. He claims that the leaders had intended to mobilize people from the outset. But in the process of dramatizing the story of the executed farmers who would later be revered as Gimin, their initial intention was changed into a more peaceful one.HOSAKA Satoru, Hyakush≈ç Ikki to Sono Sah≈ç (Farmers' Uprising and Its Manners), Yoshikawa K≈çbunkan, 2002, p.110) But when word spread that they were appealing, thousands of peasants flocked to the castle, some of whom stormed shops and the castle gate. The domain lord, Mizuno Tadanao, was away in Edo for sankin-k≈çtai (alternate-year attendance) at the time, so the executives had to deal with the situation themselves. Their biggest concern was how much this incident would negatively affect the position of the Matsumoto Domain. Thousands of farmers were camping out in the cold outside the castle. On the night of October 16, the domain government issued a response paper signed by two magistrates. When the news of the response paper spread, the majority of peasants who had gathered around Matsumoto Castle went home. But Kasuke and his followers were not satisfied with the response. They lingered behind. They were so determined to get a satisfactory answer that they stayed two more nights outside the castle. At last five executives signed the second response paper responding favorably to the farmers' appeal. The documents granted the farmers‚Äô wishes to decrease the tax. Kasuke went home along with his followers. On October 18, the incident was settled peacefully. =Evasive tactic= However, it turned out that the response documents signed by the executives were a tactic used to settle the rebellion. Under the strict Tokugawa administration, domain government's failure to control an uprising meant dethronement for the domain lord. The executives of the Matsumoto Domain who were in charge of the incident needed to suppress it by all means. A month later, Kasuke and other leaders of the uprising were arrested. The response documents were confiscated. Kasuke and his followers along with the male members of their families were executed without trial.Shimpu-t≈çki vol. 28 (Kasuke's twelve-year-old first-born son, ten-year-oldSome people say that the second-born son was eight years old. second-born son, and a mere five-year-old son of one of Kasuke's followers were executed, though they did not take part in the uprising.) Oana Zembei's daughter, OshyunHer real name was Shyun. But feminine names usually took the prefix \\"O\\". The same goes for Osato. was responsible for delivering invitations to secret meetings at the Kumano Shrine. She was also executed (since women were not supposed to be executed for such a crime in feudal times, her name was changed to a masculine name in the official record, Shimpu-t≈çki). Twenty-eight farmers were executed in all. The executions took place on January 5, 1687In the lunar calendar, the 11th month, 22nd day at two separate locations. One execution site was at Seitaka (a temporary site) and the other was at Idegawa. Seventeen farmers from the north of the castle were taken to Seitaka. Kasuke, Zembei, and Oshyun were among them. Eleven farmers from the south of the castle were taken to Idegawa. (In addition to the November executions, the new-born son of Oana Zembei's widow, Osato, was sentenced to death. But the baby died of an unexplained illnessSome people believe that Osato, not wanting to have her baby killed by the authorities, killed him herself. within a few weeks after birth.TANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, pp. 190-191) Kasuke is said to have shouted out for lowered taxes when he was tied to the execution pole. Matsumoto Castle had been built with a structural defect which caused it to lean, rumored to be due to Tada Kasuke's passionate outcry. But the rumor started in the Meiji period when the castle tower actually started to lean to one side.) The keep, leaning to one side (Archive of the Matsumoto Castle Management Bureau) Influence The uprising has been perceived as a struggle for the right to life, and thought to be a forerunner for the Jiy≈´ Minken Undo (Freedom and People's Rights Movement in the Meiji period). This movement swept across the nation in the 1870s and 1880s. The bicentennial anniversary of the J≈çky≈ç Uprising was observed in an atmosphere of excitement over the movement.NAKAJIMA, Tamp≈ç \\"Azumino\\", p.77 Matsuzawa Ky≈´saku, a newspaper journalist from Azumidaira, wrote a play based on the uprising, giving it a title Minken Kagami Kasuke no Omokage (The Image of Kasuke, a Model of the People's Rights Movement). Incidentally, Matsuzawa died in prison exactly 200 years after Kasuke and others had been executed. Gimin-zuka burial mound The burial mound of the executed farmers In 1950, at a construction site near Seitaka shrine in Matsumoto City, a human body was found. In the next few weeks, additional bodies were found. The number of the unearthed bodies came to eighteen. Seventeen bodies were clustered, and oneThe body is arguably that of a person who had died by the roadside. (It had been buried in a normal manner, unlike all the rest.) was found apart from the rest. Four of the seventeen bodies were headless, which coincides with the story handed down by tradition.It is said that after the executions and public display of the severed heads, Kasuke's widow's relatives went to the site and were handed over four heads, Kasuke's head among them. The four heads were buried in the secret corner of the relatives' family cemetery. Many years later, they were reburied in the Tada family cemetery. And one of the seventeen clustered bodies had a larger pelvis and slender bones. Taking these into consideration, historical and medical researchers of the time concluded that it was highly possible that the seventeen clustered bodies were those of the executed farmers of the J≈çky≈ç Uprising.TOBA T≈çru, Ch≈´≈ç-sen (The Ch≈´≈ç Line), self-published, c.1983, pp. 240-247 (The one with a larger pelvis must be Oshyun's body. Oana Zembei's body was also easily identified by its long bones, because he had been known for being tall.) In 1952, the bodies were buried in a mound, and the mound has been called Gimin-zuka. Every year on the anniversary day of the executions of the Gimin, a memorial service is held in front of the mound.Gimin-sai (Gimin remembrance) is observed on November 22. Then questions arise as to the whereabouts of the bodies of the farmers who had been executed at Idegawa execution site. It is widely believed that the eleven bodies have been washed away by river water, for the execution site was on the bank of the Tagawa river.TSUKADA Masakimi, Gimin Shiro ni Sakebu (Gimin Shouts at the Castle), Shinky≈ç Shuppan-bu, 1986, pp.100-101 When Gimin-zuka was built, some soil from the former Idegawa execution site was used in the construction.

She is the younger daughter of Baptista Minola and the sister of Kate, the \\"shrew\\" of the title. The lovely Bianca has several admirers in the play, but Baptista has refused to allow her to marry until his shrewish daughter Kate has found a husband. When Kate marries, Bianca is united with her lover, Lucentio. Theatrically, Bianca is the ingenue in Shrew and the female lead in the play's subplot. Origin The basic elements of the play are present in Don Juan Manuel's 14th-century Castilian tale of the \\"young man who married a very strong and fiery woman\\".Juan Manuel Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio, Exemplo XXXV¬∫ - De lo que contes√ßi√≥ a un man√ßebo que cas√≥ con una muger muy fuerte et muy brava. The play's subplot, involving the characters Bianca and Lucentio, derives from Ludovico Ariosto's I Suppositi, either directly or through George Gascoigne's English version Supposes (performed 1566, printed 1573).F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 181, 483. Role in the play Bianca Minola is the younger daughter of Baptista Minola and sister to Katherina (Kate) Minola. Unlike Kate, Bianca is very obedient and sweet- tempered, causing her to have a good number of suitors. Her father however declares that none may marry Bianca until Kate is wed. Desperate to win Bianca's hand in marriage, one of her suitors Hortensio gets his friend Petruchio, who is willing enough, to marry Kate so that Bianca would be allowed to marry. Hortensio then attempts to woo her in the disguise of a tutor named Litio. Bianca however falls in love with another suitor, Lucentio (also in the guise of a tutor 'Cambio'). The pair are married and at the wedding feast, Petruchio suggests a contest between himself, Lucentio, and Hortensio: They each send for their wives, and whoever's wife responds the most obediently wins. Despite Lucentio's faith in her obedience, Bianca does not come when summoned, saying that she is too busy. When she is forcefully brought to Lucentio by Kate, Bianca insists that her husband was a fool to set store by her obedience. Throughout the play, there is evidence of sibling rivalry between Bianca and Kate as Kate accuses Bianca of being their father's \\"treasure\\" and the one that he wishes to have married first. In one scene, Kate ties Bianca's hands and whips her, in an attempt to discover which of her suitors Bianca likes the best (Bianca however insists that she has yet to meet a suitor that she truly loves). Performances Linda Arvidson plays Bianca in the first screen version of the play directed by D.W. Griffith (1908). Dorothy Jordan plays Bianca in the first \\"talkie\\" film version of the play with Mary Pickford as Kate and Douglas Fairbanks as Petruchio. Natasha Pyne renders the role in the 1967 film starring Elizabeth Taylor as Kate and her then-husband Richard Burton as Petruchio. Susan Penhaligon appears as Bianca in the 1980 BBC television production directed by Jonathan Miller. Laura Boccanera plays Bianca in the most recent film version of the play, Kate - La bisbetica domata (2004) which was billed as the first-ever stop-animation movie made in Italy.IMDb: The Taming of the Shrew In the modern movie version 10 Things I Hate About You, Bianca is played by Larisa Oleynik.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/ In the ABC Family television series 10 Things I Hate About You, Bianca is played by Meaghan Jette Martin.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321805/ References  External links  * Dictionary of quotations - Literary characters introduced in 1590 Female Shakespearean characters The Taming of the Shrew ","title":"Bianca Minola"},{"id":"20677685","text":"Monument to the 1906 Puputan, located in Taman Puputan, Denpasar, Bali. Puputan is a Balinese term for a mass ritual suicidehttps://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=569755f360614b18e28b4567&assetKey;=AS%3A317706304196608%401452758496209 in preference to facing the humiliation of surrender. Notable puputans in the history of Bali occurred in 1906 and 1908, when the Balinese were being subjugated by the Dutch. 1849 The Raja of Buleleng killing himself with 400 followers, in an 1849 puputan against the Dutch. Le Petit Journal, 1849.  1906 Badung puputan  Badung Puputan 1906 On September 20, 1906, a substantial force of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, named the Sixth Military Expedition, landed at the northern part of Sanur beach. It was under the command of Major General M.B. Rost van Tonningen. Badung soldiers made some attacks on the bivouacs of the Dutch at Sanur on September 15, and there was some resistance again at Intaran village. = Kesiman = Overall, the force managed to move inland without much resistance, and arrived in the city of Kesiman on 20 September 1906. There, the local king, a vassal of the king of Badung, had already been killed by his own priest, as he had refused to lead an armed resistance against the Dutch. The palace was in flames and the city was deserted. = Denpasar = The force marched to Denpasar, Bali, as if in a dress parade. They approached the royal palace, noting smoke rising from the puri and hearing a wild beating of drums coming from within the palace walls. Upon their reaching the palace, a silent procession emerged, led by the Raja on a palanquin carried by four bearers. The Raja was dressed in traditional white cremation garments, wore magnificent jewelry, and carried a ceremonial kris. The other people in the procession consisted of the Raja's officials, guards, priests, wives, children and retainers, all of whom were similarly attired. They had received the rites of death, were dressed in white, and had had their ritual kris blessed. When the procession was a hundred paces from the Dutch force, they halted and the Raja stepped down from the palanquin and signalled a priest, who plunged his dagger into the Raja's breast. The rest of the procession began killing themselves and others. Women mockingly threw jewelry and gold coins at the troops. A 'stray gunshot' and an 'attack by lance and spear' prompted the Dutch to open fire with rifles and artillery. As more people emerged from the palace, the mounds of corpses rose higher and higher. The whole procession numbered hundreds, and is said to have been over 1,000 people in all. It was mown down by Dutch gunfire. Alternative accounts describe that the Dutch first opened fire on the Balinese mass moving outside of the palace gate, only equipped with traditional krises, spears and shields, and that survivors killed themselves, or had themselves killed by their followers according to the dictates of the puputan. The soldiers stripped the corpses of the valuables and sacked the ruins of the burned palace. The palace of Denpasar was razed to the ground. The same afternoon, similar events occurred in the nearby palace of Pemecutan, where the co-ruler Gusti Gede Ngurah resided. The Dutch let the nobility at Pemecutan kill themselves, and proceeded with the looting. The massacre is remembered locally as the \\"Badung Puputan\\" and is glorified as an example of resistance to foreign aggression. A huge bronze monument was erected on the central square of Denpasar, where the royal palace used to stand, glorifying Balinese resistance in the Puputan. = Tabanan = The Dutch force continued to the kingdom of Tabanan, where the king Gusti Ngurah Agung and his son fled. They surrendered to the Dutch, and attempted to negotiate a settlement to become a regency of the Netherlands. The Dutch only offered them exile to nearby Madura or Lombok, and they preferred to kill themselves (puputan) in prison two days later. Their palace was plundered and razed by the Dutch.  1908 Klungkung puputan  Another puputan occurred on the 18th of April, 1908, at Klungkung Palace. The intervention was triggered by a Balinese revolt against a Dutch attempt to impose an opium monopoly in their favour. The Raja of Karangasem opposed the monopoly, leading to Balinese riots in the capital of Klungkung. Riots also erupted in Gelgel, when the Balinese killed a Javanese opium dealer. The Dutch sent troops to quell the riots. In Gelgel, they killed 100 Balinese, forcing the Raja to flee to Klungkung. The Dutch then bombarded the city of Klungkung. In a final confrontation on 18 April 1908, Dewa Agung Jambe, the Raja of Klungung, accompanied by 200 followers, made a desperate sortie out of his Palace, clad in white and armed with a legendary kris supposed to wreak havoc on the enemy according to a prophecy. The kris failed to fulfill the desired outcome, and the Raja was instead shot by a Dutch bullet. Immediately, the six wives of the king resorted to puputan, killing themselves with their own kris, soon followed by the other Balinese in the procession. 1946 Marga Puputan Independence fighter I Gusti Ngurah Rai organized a last puputan against the Dutch Army at the Battle of Margarana in 1946, in which 98 soldiers died with him. The Battle of Margarana () was a battle fought between the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) and the recently created, rebelling Ciung Wanara Battalion that occurred in Marga in Bali, Indonesia.

The German director Julius Pinschewer produced this movie called \\"Die Korsett-Anprobe\\". In 1885 the first shops in Munich opened and the company became soon merchants to the royal Bavarian court for lingerie, with branches in Berlin, Amsterdam and Munich.

It is a non-profit charitable organisation whose objective is to deliver teaching in trauma management and patient care. The organisation's primary activities are teaching medical practitioners and other emergency services personnel in the management of trauma and pre-hospital care. In addition to its educational resources, the organisation also has an ATACC Medical Rescue Team (ATACC MRT), composed of practitioners from all specialities. It operates and is available for the purposes of trauma care management in the pre-hospital care environment throughout the United Kingdom on a voluntary basis. There is an ATACC Disaster Response Team (ATACC DRT) available on standby for deployment to international disasters. The ATACC DRT, affiliated with the United Nations, has responded to international disasters and has been involved in disaster response training exercises.  ATACC courses  The ATACC course is an international trauma course based in the United Kingdom. Accredited by two Royal Colleges and emergency medical services, it teaches trauma care and prehospital anesthesia in relation to trauma patient management post Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) certification. Courses run at numerous times throughout the year for candidates drawn from all areas of medicine and trauma care. The ATACC faculty consists of clinicians from each medical speciality and senior members of the emergency services. The course is for those working within trauma, surgery, anaesthesia, emergency medicine, critical care, radiology and pre-hospital medicine. It is also appropriate for any individual in a profession allied to medicine who may encounter trauma patients as part of their daily duties (whether they be Nurses, Operating Department Practitioners [ODPs], Physician Assistants or members of the emergency services) such as Paramedics, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). Other courses developed from the ATACC course include Rescue-trauma training (RTACC), scene safety and assessment (ISAC), critical care transport (BATT), human simulation critical incident training (CISTR). ATACC started as a new approach to trauma education but has since developed into a spectrum of courses in addition to a highly skilled trauma and rescue team providing critical care at the roadside and other difficult environments. Every member of the ATACC team is committed to operating to the highest clinical standards, to keeping the ATACC courses up-to-date and to improving trauma care worldwide.

The ALAS missile system was developed primarily for missions against tanks, armored vehicles, fortifications, command posts, low-flying helicopters, coastal ships, industrial facilities and bridges. It can be deployed by any suitable platform including helicopters, armored vehicles, small ships and infantry. The guidance system is based on video/infrared technology, with the missile connected to the launcher by a fiber-optic cable. The ALAS flies at low altitude and has small radar and infrared (heat) signatures due to using a turbofan motor instead of a turbojet. In recent years, the ALAS platform has found a secondary use as a UAV. Description of system and role The ALAS missile system is intended for two primary missions: * Striking isolated targets from light land vehicles and for anti-ship combat. * Striking land- based targets from the sea. In this scenario, the missile is launched from a small ship or a helicopter. Another possible application of the ALAS missile system would be to defend an airfield and conduct surgical strikes until heavier forces are available. Its range could extend the close-combat kill zone to 5‚Äì25 km in front of the forward line of its own troops and for deeper strikes up to 60 km. The operative flight envelope (required for flight and control system) in the radial axis with respect to the axis of motion is ¬±3g, whereas in the axial direction it is 10g. =Tactical role= The ALAS missile system is intended to attack distant targets, such as: *Static land installations *Tanks and combat vehicles *Hardened targets larger than 5 by 5 meters *Small boats, ships and other coastal targets Variants The two main types of system depend on missiles used as ALAS or RALAS system. =ALAS= The ALAS missile is hot-launched from its canister by means of a solid- propellant boost motor. ALAS is the designation for missiles produced in ALAS-A, ALAS-B and ALAS-C variants. *ALAS-A is a surface to surface variant with range of 25 km. *ALAS-B is a surface to surface variant with range of 60 km. *ALAS-C (Coastal Defence) is an anti-ship variant that is in mutual development between Serbia and UAE with 25 km or 50 km range in future development. ALAS guided missile launch vehicle on Nimr vehicle chassis For the United Arab Emirates it will be delivered on the Nimr 6x6 chassis. The ALAS-C abandoned the initial design and moved the arrow wing forward. It used a small degree of aerodynamic control via rudders and was propelled by an axial turbine engine equipped with a single nozzle. ALAS-C missiles installed the turbojet in the stretch LORANA of missile X-type wing control of the rudder, head mounted as a 45 ¬∞ cross. Located in the wing are the engine's two intake ports, the rear portion of the wing on both sides of the elastomer contains two, flat, engine nozzles and a fiber spool. Employing an INS or optionally a GPS guidance system, the ALAS-C will have a range of up to 25 km, using a video/ccs/iir system to deliver its fragmentation warhead. ALAS-A *Speed: 180 m/s (mid-course) *Altitude: 150-500m *Range: 25 km *Penetration: 800mm RHA Guidance The missile is programmed to follow a preset course around or over any obstructing terrain using electronic terrain maps. the terminal guidance phase uses an infrared image making it possible to transfer thermal images back to the launching platform via a 200 MBit/s data link provided by an optical fibre. Thus, it is possible to manually select a target or abort the mission. Missile communication is realized via optical monomode cable with two channels (communication directions): *Image transmission and data from missile to ground. *Data transmission from ground station to vehicle. Firing station comprises a high-performance compact computer for missile guidance, an operator control panel and a high-resolution display. The system uses advanced control and image processing algorithms, electro-optical converters and radio links. The firing station has an optional GPS and north-seeking device. The firing station is used for mission planning before the engagement. The firing station stores a digitized map and displays the map during missile flight. For some applications, a dual monitor system used. The firing unit can be used as a trainer and simulator without additional hardware. When attacking ships, missiles can fly at an altitude of a few meters above sea level. At this stage of the flight, the flight controls are made according to pre-programmed data. When the rocket reaches the target area, the gunner seizes control. Propulsion During launch, a solid propellant booster accelerates the missile to an initial cruising speed (120‚Äì150 m/s). Then the TMM-040 turbojet ignites to take the missile to the target under control of the guidance system and the operator. Main propulsion characteristics: *Missile main engine is a Mongoose 040 turbojet that permits a sub-sonic top speed of around 640‚Äì740 km/h (340-400 mp/h). *In launch phase uses two assigned propellant boosters. *Solid propellant booster is positioned on the rear side on the missile body placed after turbojet engine with requirements that thrust vector direction going through missile center of gravity position. =RALAS= RALAShttps://www.edrmagazine.eu/idex-2019-yugoimport-from-alas-to- ralas(Rocketized Alas) has solid propellant sustainer rocket engine, accelerated with solid propellant booster engine variant can replace the turbojet with range estimated to 9-10 km with greater speed. It was in early stages of development designated as LORANA (LOng RAnge Non line of sight Attack system). RALAS has a 10.5 kg tandem warhead capable to penetrate over 1,000 mm RHA, or a blast fragmentation one with a 25 meters lethal radius. RALAS is intended for use from land or helicopter platforms for launch. RALAS(LORANA) missile seeker was tested in mid 2012 on light aircraft SILA 450C domestic aircraft (made in Kraljevo, Serbia by Aero-East-Europe) in a series of 10 flights above military multibranch exercise range \\"Pasuljanske livade\\" Serbia. RALAS is an advanced remote non-line of sight attack system battery that consists of a battery command post (based on light wheeled armored SUV or semi) and four launch vehicles, with each vehicle equipped with 4 to 8 containers with missiles. A missile carrier is available for reloading missiles or as a backup control car. RALAS missile consists of the following functional units/sub-systems: *Guidance head with a gyro-stabilized TV camera or Infrared seeker that uses either a contrast or a correlation algorithm *Subsystem management and control: warhead anti-tank tandem with 1 meter penetration of rolled, homogeneous armor steel *Group fired solid fuel propellant formed starting rocket engine and flight rocket engine (both engines developed by EDePro company) *Communication subsystem based on fiber optic cable connection to transfer real-time (part of communication sub system are roll with fiber optic cable with a length of 9 km) *Electronic transmission apparatus for laser video signal to digital signal receiver Specification  *Length: 1.8 meters *Diameter: 175 mm *Wingspan: 1.2 m *Base weight: 60 kg *Warhead weight: 10.5 kg *Rocket motor thrust is 4500 Newtons: burn time is 3.5 seconds *Missile flight speed: 120‚Äì200 m/s *The rocket engine uses two laterally inclined nozzles with 300 N thrust and maximum specific impulse of 14 000 N Guidance The nose missile is mounted with a video unit that allows target detection the size of a tank at distances of 3 km. The field of view available on the display unit is 7 ¬∞ x 5 ¬∞. The fiber optic cable can handle pulling forces of 52 N. Loss of signal in an optical cable is 0.2 dB / km. The cable provides an on-board missile data transmission rate of 128 kbit/s and from the missile to ground control data transmission speed of 240 Mbi /s - available on one video channel and two data channels. The firing station works similarly to ALAS. RALAS(LORANA) can achieve a maximum deviation of 1 m. Operational use Missile takes off from the shipping container-starter. RALAS(LORANA) can be stored in a container more than 10 years without maintenance. After the installation on the carrier the rocket is ready for immediate use. =Launching platform= RALAS is currently integrated on two mobile platforms: *Lazar 3 *Oganj LRSVM M18 ALAS is currently integrated on: *Oganj LRSVM M18 *fast speed boat project by Yugoimport SDPRhttps://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/naval- exhibitions/2016-archives/dimdex-2016-show-daily- news/3768-dimdex-2016-yugoimport-of-serbia-unveils-its-fast-patrol-vessel- interceptor.html *Nimr 6x6https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence- news/2017/june-2017-navy-naval-forces-defense-industry-technology-maritime- security-global-news/5327-new-alas-s-air-coastal-defense-missile-system- developed-jointly-by-nimr-and-yugoimport-for-uae.html Operators Map with ALAS operators in blue =Current operators= * : Contract reported in IDEX2013.

The District Planning process will take into account the resources (natural, human and financial) and the extent of legal responsibilities assigned to the district and below level governments, during the preparation of the district plan. The history of district planning in Kerala is that of intermittent attempts, partial successes and long neglect. It doesn't show any promising growth pattern.From Decentralised Planning to Peoples Planning : Experiences of the Indian States of West Bengal and Kerala, by Charvak, Discussion Paper No 21 July 2000, KRPLLD, Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram But there were many attempts started with sincerity and ended without any worthy output; all those attempts were good learning examples worthy of learning the bottlenecks. A brief history of those attempts is as follows:District planning in Kerala : The concept , history and procedures by K Rajasekharan, In T M Joseph : Decentralized governance and development, New Delhi, Deep & Deep, 2009, p 214‚Äì241 Early initiatives Bringing out a district plan document giving district wise break-up of the annual plan began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. That could be the first event in the lineage of district planning exercise in Kerala. Each department prepared district-wise break up of schemes divisible among districts. That district- wise break-up of schemes has been consolidated into a single document by the Kerala State Planning Board for better monitoring of the state plan at the district level. There was neither any sort of district planning nor any attempt for integration of sectoral schemes at the district level during the period. Those district plans were mere compilations of departmental or similar programmes into a single volume. They were useful for coordination and monitoring, but do not deserve the status of district plans. In 1976, a District Planning Unit was set up in the Kerala State Planning Board. Later, it was transformed into Decentralized Planning Division in the State Planning Board. In the year 1979, the district planning offices were set up in all the districts except in Wayanad. Kollam district plan The district planning offices in Kerala were entrusted with the task of creation of database for each district, by compiling all available secondary data. Kollam district conducted a resource potential survey and went ahead with district planning as a pilot project with focus on industrial sector. A district planning committee was set up with district collector as chairperson to formulate the district plan. District Development Committee - an advisory body of officials and non- officials including the MLA's and MPs in the district, headed by the District Collector, was expected to function as the local planning machinery in the district. The dormant grama panchayats and municipalities were the existing elected local governments below the district level. Eleven technical committees were constituted for each of the major development sectors. Block planning committees were formed at every block consisting of the Chair Person of the Block Development Committee, Presidents of all the Panchayats in the block area and officials of different development departments of the concerned blocks. The district planning exercise in Kollam district was divided into two stages. Stage I: - Assessment of resource endowments and the development potential of the district which included: # Identification of local natural resources # Survey of infrastructure, and # Review of development of different sectors and ongoing schemes in the district Stage II: - Preparation of the district plan by involving people's representatives and local government officials. The District Development Committee had set up the planning bodies, Block planning committee meetings were convened and the planning procedures were explained to all actors. Panchayats were requested to discuss and decide their resource endowments, identify development problems, the schemes and projects to be included in their plan and to involve the experts available locally in the execution of the process. Panchayats were able to complete the tasks in two/three meetings. The block planning committee met again after a month to review the proposals from the Panchayats. They reviewed, modified or supplemented the projects to make them complete or perfect and transmitted those plans to the technical committees at the district. The technical committees held several rounds of discussion to make them conform to the standards of the state level schemes. New proposals were then formulated by the technical committees, whenever needed. The strategies for development of the sector were also evolved by those technical committees. The procedure evolved in this experiment formed the basis of the guidelines for preparation of district plans by Kerala State Planning Board later. The Seventh Five-Year Plan visualized decentralization of planning process from the State-level to the level of districts in the first phase, and then further down to the block level, to increase the effectiveness in implementation of the anti-poverty programmes and to ensure balanced regional development. So the Planning Commission suggested the State government to formulate comprehensive district plans in two or three districts as an experiment. Modality of the process As per the guideline, the exercise of district planning had to start with a resource survey and preparation of a resource inventory based on secondary data as well as through primary survey for both natural and human resources. It was followed by an assessment of the felt needs of the district and formulation of a set of priorities consistent with the State and National priorities. After that, an assessment of the financial resources covering 'untied funds', flowing to the district from state and central schemes as well as the institutional finance, has to be made. The guidelines suggested for the preparation of a perspective plan that should show the long-term development needs and the development potential of the district. The next step was to draw up five-year and annual plans. Such district plans were then to be integrated with the state plan. The guideline suggested an effective monitoring mechanism at the district and the State level to monitor the implementation of the district plan, in terms of finance, physical achievements, devolution of appropriate administrative / financial powers and preparation of district budget. The last item in the nine-point guideline envisaged \\"involving Panchayat Raj Institutions and enlisting the co-operation of the voluntary agencies in the process of decentralised planning\\". Subsequent experiments In order to experiment a pilot exercise in district planning, two districts - Kottayam among the developed and Kannur among the backward ‚Äì were selected. District development committees were entrusted with the overall responsibility of drawing up district plans. A small executive committee was constituted with a district collector as the chairperson, the chairperson of the district development committee as the member-secretary, and selected district officers as members to assist the district development committee in drawing up the plan. Blocks were proposed as the primary units for the district planning exercise. Block planning committees were constituted with one of the district level officers of the development departments as chairperson and BDO as member-secretary. The role of district planning officer was to help the district development committee prepare the block-level inventory of resources & infrastructure and to make a report on the prospects of development. The block planning committees had to assess the felt needs of the different panchayats through discussion and dialogue with representatives of local people. Since the elections to the Panchayats were not held, they were not associated with this district planning exercise. The procedures for enhancing people‚Äôs participation and details of development analysis to be made were determined by the concerned district development committee. The Planning Commission of India later modified the earlier guideline stating that the financial assistance for the exercise could be made only if the study would be entrusted to private consultancy organizations. Accordingly, the above modality was abandoned and the Institute of Management in Government and Kerala Statistical Institute were entrusted with the responsibility of drawing up district plans, respectively for the districts of Kannur and Kottayam. The exercise was, however, kept outside the purview of planning in the State or in the districts in the matter of Five-Year Plan and Annual Plan formulation and was undertaken only as an experimental 'model' in the district planning. Kottayam District Plan The Kerala Statistical Institute started working on the district plan of Kottayam district from December 1988, with focus on land use planning. The resource inventory was prepared based on secondary data. The exercise focused on the preparation of schemes from below in consonance with the felt needs of the people in different localities. As there were no elected bodies at the block and the district levels, meetings of the block planning committees consisting of elected MLAs, Panchayat Presidents, officials, other non-officials and Municipal Councilors, were convened regularly. The committees were expected to put forth development proposals considering the overall development needs, potentials and the felt needs of the people in the region. During that time, the official preparations for district level plans, as part of the Eighth Plan of the State started in the districts. The outlay for Kottayam district in the Eighth plan was Rs. 90 crore. The Kerala Statistical Institute decided to make use of the list of schemes which was being prepared for the government. It invited proposals from the Panchayats based on the list and dovetailed the output to suit an estimated financial outlay of Rs. 100 crore for the public sector as calculated by them. Discussions were held in the BDCs. The panchayat presidents were entrusted with holding discussions in the Panchayats before making suggestions regarding the schemes. The block level discussions were over by January 1989 in all the 11 blocks of the district. By February, meetings were also held in the municipalities. Approximately 700 persons attended those meetings held throughout the district. By July 1989, around 40 Panchayats had submitted their proposals in the prescribed formats and in total 73 Panchayats submitted their projects by the end. Simultaneously, main problems and priorities of the panchayats, particularly with reference to infrastructure facilities, were collected from the Panchayat Presidents with the help of a questionnaire. The Kerala Statistical Institute also undertook a sample household survey to understand the felt needs of the people, to supplement this input. Four panchayats and one municipality were chosen for the sample survey from among the 73 panchayats and the four municipalities. The schemes collected from the Panchayats and the blocks, with the data supplemented from Krishi Bhavans, Panchayats and household survey, formed the basis of the district plan report. Some of the proposals were of good quality, whereas some others were the 'usual type' consisting of construction of roads and bridges. The Kerala Statistical Institute dovetailed them within the fixed total outlay of Rs.100 crore and prepared the final district plan. The district plan was not exactly a compendium of finally selected projects; rather it was an account of the understanding of the consultants regarding the felt needs of the people as expressed by different actors involved in the planning process and the consultants' assessment of the resource endowment of the district. The proposals from below sought to have a lower allocation for agriculture while proposing higher outlays for the allied agricultural sectors such as animal husbandry, dairy, and fisheries in contrast with the actual district sector outlays of the state plan. The allocation demanded for rural development, which perhaps covered anti-poverty and employment generation schemes, was also much higher than the actual allocations. The substantially lower allocation proposed from below on roads was surprising. On the other hand, housing figured prominently in the Kerala Statistical Institute plan than the actual allocation available for the district. At the same time, the allocation for SC/ST welfare was much lesser than half of the actual allotment. The conclusion of the exercise was not very encouraging. It underlined that in the task of identification of schemes and projects of local significance and in presentation of them with adequate details such as importance, costs and benefits, the general public can make very little contribution. The people's participation at the panchayat level was very limited. Kannur District Plan The Kannur District Plan was more a methodological exercise than an operational one. It was submitted on December 1992, almost two years after the Kottayam Plan when the first elected District Councils of Kerala had assumed power. The purpose of the plan was to refine the procedural aspects in district planning. The first step in the planning was to make an analysis of situation, which included preparation of district profile, resource inventory through secondary data collection and mapping techniques, and also through primary survey whenever needed, especially using RRA techniques. The second step in the planning process was to have a sectoral and spatial analysis of the district, which included identification of watershed, geo-climatic typologies, spatial profile of poverty and unemployment, sectoral review of potentials, etc. In the third step, formulation of objectives and strategies based on the situation analysis made earlier was done. The plan reflected the felt needs of the Panchayats / Non Governmental Organisations and contained the long-term and short-term objectives, as well as sectoral strategies. Preparation of development programmes and development projects for inclusion in district plan was the fourth step. A quantitative and spatial schematic plan was drawn up based on a development dialogue with the District Council regarding the financial resource position and development priorities. But this had never happened at all. The experiment met with a premature death. District plans in 2000 In the third year of the much acclaimed Peoples Planning in Kerala, an attempt was made to draw up the district plan for each district in order to complete the cycle of decentralized planning. The basic objectives of the above said district planning experiment was threefold. % to make an assessment of the district, its resources and to provide a macro perspective for district development % to consolidate local government plans % to formulate guidelines for local planning for subsequent years Based on those objectives, district plans were drawn up in the districts with the following three parts or sections. * Perspective for district development * Consolidated plans of the local governments * Guidelines for future The Part I of the district plan was proposed to be prepared once in five years at the beginning of the five-year plan. Part II and Part III of the district plan were expected to be prepared every year. The district plan for each of the 14 districts in Kerala was prepared in the year 2000. The integration of local plans revealed the duplications, gaps and contradictions in the people's planning. As well, it provided guidelines for the preparation of the next years annual plans in the district. The exercise indicated that district plan, in the absence of clear objectives, proper methodology and meticulous preparation can degenerate itself into a bundle of statistics and schemes, without any coherence, direction and integration. So the district planners should have a through knowledge of the objectives of the state and national planning and should customize the district plan in tune with the objectives of the higher level plans while balancing with the projects arising from below.

Linear polyethyleneimines contain all secondary amines, in contrast to branched PEIs which contain primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups. Totally branched, dendrimeric forms were also reported. PEI is produced on industrial scale and finds many applications usually derived from its polycationic character. Properties The linear PEIs are solids at room temperature while branched PEIs are liquids at all molecular weights. Linear polyethyleneimines are soluble in hot water, at low pH, in methanol, ethanol, or chloroform. They are insoluble in cold water, benzene, ethyl ether, and acetone. They have a melting point of 73‚Äì75¬∞C. They can be stored at room temperature. Synthesis Branched PEI can be synthesized by the ring opening polymerization of aziridine.Zhuk, D. S., Gembitskii, P. A., and Kargin V. A. Russian Chemical Reviews; Vol 34:7.1965 Depending on the reaction conditions different degree of branching can be achieved. Linear PEI is available by post-modification of other polymers like poly(2-oxazolines) or N-substituted polyaziridines. Linear PEI was synthesised by the hydrolysis of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) and sold as jetPEI. The current generation in-vivo- jetPEI uses bespoke poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) polymers as precursors. Applications Polyethyleneimine finds many applications in products like: detergents, adhesives, water treatment agents and cosmetics. Owing to its ability to modify the surface of cellulose fibres, PEI is employed as a wet- strength agent in the paper-making process. It is also used as flocculating agent with silica sols and as a chelating agent with the ability to complex metal ions such as zinc and zirconium. There are also other highly specialized PEI applications: =Biology= PEI has a number of uses in laboratory biology, especially tissue culture, but is also toxic to cells if used in excess. Toxicity is by two different mechanisms, the disruption of the cell membrane leading to necrotic cell death (immediate) and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane after internalisation leading to apoptosis (delayed). Attachment promoter Polyethyleneimines are used in the cell culture of weakly anchoring cells to increase attachment. PEI is a cationic polymer; the negatively charged outer surfaces of cells are attracted to dishes coated in PEI, facilitating stronger attachments between the cells and the plate. Transfection reagent Poly(ethylenimine) was the second polymeric transfection agent discovered, after poly-l-lysine. PEI condenses DNA into positively charged particles, which bind to anionic cell surface residues and are brought into the cell via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, protonation of the amines results in an influx of counter-ions and a lowering of the osmotic potential. Osmotic swelling results and bursts the vesicle releasing the polymer-DNA complex (polyplex) into the cytoplasm. If the polyplex unpacks then the DNA is free to diffuse to the nucleus. Permeabilization of gram negative bacteria Poly(ethylenimine) is also an effective permeabilizer of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. =CO2 capture= Both linear and branched polyethylenimine have been used for CO2 capture, frequently impregnated over porous materials. First use of PEI polymer in CO2 capture was devoted to improve the CO2 removal in space craft applications, impregnated over a polymeric matrix. After that, the support was changed to MCM-41, an hexagonal mesostructured silica, and large amounts of PEI were retained in the so-called \\"molecular basket\\". MCM-41-PEI adsorbent materials led to higher CO2 adsorption capacities than bulk PEI or MCM-41 material individually considered. The authors claim that, in this case, a synergic effect takes place due to the high PEI dispersion inside the pore structure of the material. As a result of this improvement, further works were developed to study more in depth the behaviour of these materials. Exhaustive works have been focused on the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as the CO2/O2 and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity of several MCM-41-PEI materials with PEI polymers.X. Xu, C. Song, R. Wincek J. M. Andr√©sen, B. G. Miller, A. W. Scaroni, Fuel Chem. Div. Prepr. 2003; 48 162-163X. Xu, C. Song, B. G. Miller, A. W. Scaroni, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2005; 44 8113-8119 Also, PEI impregnation has been tested over different supports such as a glass fiber matrix and monoliths.C. Chen, S. T. Yang, W. S. Ahn, R. Ryoo, \\"Title\\" Chem. Commun. (2009) 3627-3629 However, for an appropriate performance under real conditions in post-combustion capture (mild temperatures between 45-75 ¬∞C and the presence of moisture) it is necessary to use thermally and hydrothermally stable silica materials, such as SBA-15, which also presents an hexagonal mesostructure. Moisture and real world conditions have also been tested when using PEI-impregnated materials to adsorb CO2 from the air. A detailed comparison among PEI and other amino- containing molecules showed an excellence performance of PEI-containing samples with cycles. Also, only a slight decrease was registered in their CO2 uptake when increasing the temperature from 25 to 100 ¬∞C, demonstrating a high contribution of chemisorption to the adsorption capacity of these solids. For the same reason, the adsorption capacity under diluted CO2 was up to 90% of the value under pure CO2 and also, a high unwanted selectivity towards SO2 was observed. Lately, many efforts have been made in order to improve PEI diffusion within the porous structure of the support used. A better dispersion of PEI and a higher CO2 efficiency (CO2/NH molar ratio) were achieved by impregnating a template-occluded PE-MCM-41 material rather than perfect cylindrical pores of a calcined material, following a previously described route. The combined use of organosilanes such as aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, AP, and PEI has also been studied. The first approach used a combination of them to impregnate porous supports, achieving faster CO2-adsorption kinetics and higher stability during reutilization cycles, but no higher efficiencies. A novel method is the so-called \\"double-functionalization\\". It is based on the impregnation of materials previously functionalized by grafting (covalent bonding of organosilanes). Amino groups incorporated by both paths have shown synergic effects, achieving high CO2 uptakes up to 235 mg CO2/g (5.34 mmol CO2/g). CO2 adsorption kinetics were also studied for these materials, showing similar adsorption rates than impregnated solids. This is an interesting finding, taking into account the smaller pore volume available in double- functionalized materials. Thus, it can be also concluded that their higher CO2 uptake and efficiency compared to impregnated solids can be ascribed to a synergic effect of the amino groups incorporated by two methods (grafting and impregnation) rather than to a faster adsorption kinetics. =Low work function modifier for electronics= Poly(ethylenimine) and poly(ethylenimine) ethoxylated (PEIE) have been shown as effective low-work function modifiers for organic electronics by Zhou and Kippelen et al. It could universally reduce the work function of metals, metal oxides, conducting polymers and graphene, and so on. It is very important that low-work function solution- processed conducting polymer could be produced by the PEI or PEIE modification. Based on this discovery, the polymers have been widely used for organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, perovskite solar cells, perovskite light-emitting diodes, quantum-dot solar cells and light-emitting diodes etc. See also * Tetraethylenepentamine * Ethylenediamine * Polyetherimide (Also goes by PEI) References Polymers Amines ","title":"Polyethylenimine"},{"id":"20677899","text":"Dudley North may refer to: *Dudley North, 3rd Baron North (1581-1666), English nobleman and politician *Dudley North, 4th Baron North (1602-1677), English nobleman and politician, son of the above *Sir Dudley North (economist) (1641-1691), English economist, son of the above *Dudley North (politician, born 1684) (1684‚Äì1730), English landowner and politician, son of the above *Dudley Long North (1748-1829), English Whig politician, great-grandson of the economist *Sir Dudley North (Royal Navy officer) (1881-1961), Royal Navy admiral *Dudley North (UK Parliament constituency) North, Dudley ","title":"Dudley North"},{"id":"20677901","text":"John Johnston (January 31, 1790 - July 11, 1836) was a lawyer and political figure in Nova Scotia.

In addition to the classic concert repertoire, the Young Sound Forum of Central Europe has equally dedicated itself to fostering contemporary music through commissioned compositions as well as performing rarely played pieces by composers ostracized and persecuted by the National Socialist regime from 1933-1945.  History  The Young Sound Forum of Central Europe was founded in 2002 by the German conductor Christoph Altstaedt. The orchestra initially consisted of former members of the Bundesjugendorchester (the German National Youth Orchestra). Following a co-operative project with Czech musicians in the former concentration camp of Terezin (Theresienstadt) in 2003, the idea of a tri-national orchestra including Polish musicians was born in 2004. The patrons of the orchestra are Richard von Weizs√§cker, V√°clav Havel and Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. In its first five years of existence the Young Sound Forum of Central Europe has been equally recognised for its musical excellence and unique repertoire as well as for its contributions to understanding and reconciliation in Europe between Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany. The Young Sound Forum of Central Europe received the Praemium Imperiale \\"Grant For Young Artists\\" 2004, the Marion Doenhoff Award 2005 and the European Youth Orchestra Prize 2006.

The term was originally used by Gery in 1914.  Signs and symptoms  Patients present with a slow-growing, painless, solitary mass, usually of the subcutaneous tissues. It is much less frequently noted in the intramuscular tissue. It is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for years. Benign neoplasm with brown fat is noted. Diagnosis = Imaging findings = In general, imaging studies show a well-defined, heterogeneous mass, usually showing a mass which is hypointense to subcutaneous fat on magnetic resonance T1-weight images. Serpentine, thin, low signal bands (septations or vessels) are often seen throughout the tumor. = Pathology findings = From a macroscopic perspective, there is a well-defined, encapsulated or circumscribed mass, showing a soft, yellow tan to deep brown mass. The size ranges from 1 to 27 cm, although the mean is about 10 cm. A high power hematoxylin and eosin stained photograph of a hibernoma. The tumors histologically resemble brown fat. There are four histologic types recognized, but one is the most frequently seen (typical). There is a background of rich vascularity. # Lobular type: Variable degrees of differentiation of uniform, round to oval cells with granular eosinophilic cells with prominent borders, alternating with coarsely multivacuolated fat cells (pale cells). There are usually small centrally placed nuclei without pleomorphism. The cells have large cytoplasmic lipid droplets interspersed throughout. # Myxoid variant: Loose, basophilic matrix, with thick fibrous septa, and foamy histiocytes # Lipoma-like variant: Univacuolated lipocytes, with only isolated hibernoma cells # Spindle cell variant: Spindle cell lipoma combined with hibernoma  Histochemistry  Oil red O-positive droplets of cytoplasmic lipid can be seen in most cases  Immunohistochemistry  The neoplastic cells are S100 protein positive (approximately 80%), and show membrane and vacuole CD31 immunoreactivity. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a unique brown fat mitochondrial protein, is also positive.  Cytogenetics  There are structural rearrangements of 11q13-21, which are considered most characteristic. This alteration can be detected by metaphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). MEN1 gene (11q13.1) is most frequently deleted, while GARP gene (11q13.5) may also be involved.  Cytology  The fine needle aspiration smears show small, round, brown fat-like cells, with uniform, small cytoplasmic vacuoles and regular, small, round nuclei. There is usually a rich vascular background of branching capillaries. It is not uncommon to also have mature fat cells. = Differential diagnoses = It is important to separate hiberoma from adult rhabdomyoma, a granular cell tumor and a true liposarcoma. = Classification = This lesion has been called a fetal lipoma, lipoma of embryonic fat or a lipoma of immature fat.  Management  Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice, associated with an excellent long term clinical outcome.  Epidemiology  The tumor is rare, affecting adults in the 4th decade most commonly. Patients are usually younger than those who present with a lipoma. There is a slight male predominance.

The book, a cohesive adaptation of several articles previously published by Kelley, concerns the impact made by black members of the American working class on American politics and culture. Kelley's work does not focus solely on race, but considers the compound impact of race, class and gender. 2007's Blue-chip Black: Race, Class and Status in the New Black Middle Class draws from Kelley's text as an example of this focus the influence exercised by working class black bus riders in Birmingham, Alabama on segregation during World War II, an analysis described in 2003's Multiculturalism, Postcoloniality, and Transnational Media as \\"fascinating.\\" Inspired by a concept put forward by political anthropologist James C. Scott, Kelley utilizes the concept of \\"infrapolitics\\" in exploring the political impact of confrontation between black Americans and white Americans, examining what Scott described as \\"the circumspect struggle waged daily by subordinate groups [which] is, like infrared rays, beyond the visible end of the spectrum.\\" Summary Kelley examines the methods of resistance adopted by black working class as well as the spaces where black working class congregated to form an emerging consciousness. Utilizing the theory of historian George Rawick that the only way to detect working-class resistance from the past is to have knowledge of the amount of damage caused to the employer by the employees, Kelley documents the organized and unorganized ways black workers expressed resentment for racist treatment, including slowdowns, theft, leaving work early, quitting, and various acts of sabotage. He also looks in depth at black resistance that took place in public space, namely Birmingham‚Äôs streetcars and buses during World War II. In spite of strict controls by mostly white American bus operators, black working-class riders had no other transportation options and offered fierce resistance‚Äînot just in publicly celebrated incidents of heroism of individuals such as Rosa Parks and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, but in every-day conflicts such as arguments and fights with authorities and other riders. According to Kelley, such incidents not only inspired the individuals involved but also galvanized onlookers to the effect that the governance of public transit became quite difficult, which slowly effected change. Incorporating the theories of Richard Wright and Zora Neale Hurston, Kelley examines the social spaces utilized by black working class to escape the racism and humiliations they suffered at the hands of the authority, such as church and home. These spaces, though sometimes also disrupted by outsiders, allowed the community \\"dark\\" and hidden venues to discuss experiences, grievances, and dreams that helped to shape black working-class consciousness. Kelley spends part of the book investigating the embracing of alternative goals and lifestyles as a means of resisting poor and limited choices. Young black men during the World War II era were largely burdened by poor education and training that it made it difficult for them to find, much less maintain, employment. Rather than adopting the stereotype assigned poor, southern migrants, many working-class blacks embraced a new identity symbolized by the zoot suit. According to Kelley, many of the working-class blacks of the era felt that most of the jobs available to them were \\"slave labor\\", and they instead elected to become hustlers, pimps and gangsters to protest job discrimination and the lack of viable employment options. New identities afforded new opportunities to individuals such as Malcolm Little to study the psychology of white racism, though the choice of criminal life also brought extreme consequences. In more recent times, this alternate choice is demonstrated through \\"gangsta rap\\", which evolved out of the authority- challenging blues of the 19th century. Born from black working class in Los Angeles, the musical genre responds in part to the hard realities of poverty and declining unemployment. Kelley illustrates these facets by referencing the lyrics of Ice Cube, who in \\"A Bird in the Hand\\"‚Äîa track on 1991's Death Certificate‚Äîtells the story of a young man forced to sell crack to survive when the only job he can obtain after graduation is an underpaying one at McDonald's.

She was one of the so-called Universit√§tsmamsellen, a group of five academically active women during the 18th and 19th centuries, daughters of academics at G√∂ttingen University, alongside Meta Forkel-Liebeskind, Therese Huber, Philippine Engelhard, and Caroline Schelling. Life Dorothea was born in G√∂ttingen, the daughter of professor August Ludwig Schl√∂zer, a prominent historian and theorist on matters of education. Schl√∂zer believed that women's intelligence was equal to that of men. To settle a dispute with another professor on the effectiveness of Johann Bernard Basedow's method of education they agreed to educate their first-born children by different methods to see how the results differed.Koolman - History Workshop G√∂ttingen Both children turned out to be girls. Dorothea Schl√∂zer was given a non-Basedow regime, she had the best private tutors, and a rigorous curriculum made it possible for her to read at age four. She was also educated in several languages from an early age, and by the age of 16 she had mastered 9 languages; French, English, Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Hebrew and Greek. She studied mathematics under professor K√§stner who was amazed at her abilities. She later studied botany, zoology, optics, religion, mining and mineralogy.Ogilvie, Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science In addition, she was given instruction in areas then thought to be typically female, such as playing the piano, singing, sewing, knitting, and cooking. Women were usually not permitted to study at G√∂ttingen University at that time, and Schl√∂zer followed an extensive private examination by a faculty committee in the subjects of modern languages, mathematics, architecture, logic and metaphysics, classics, geography, and literature. She obtained her degree in the late 1780s. Dorothea Schl√∂zer differed from most learned women of the time who were thought of as neurotic and unfashionable; Schl√∂zer was considered much more presentable. She knew how to sew and knit and understood how to run a household well. She married a wealthy established merchant, Senator Mattheus Rodde in L√ºbeck in 1792 by whom she had three children. Henceforth, she wrote under the name of Rodde- Schl√∂zer, the first use of the double surname in German. Their home became a centre for social and intellectual life attracting visitors from all over Germany and France. Later in life she studied art in Paris and achieved a high standard. She was commissioned to paint a portrait of Kaiser Franz. She entered into a relationship with the French writer Charles Villers (1765‚Äì1815), in 1794, and lived semi-publicly in a m√©nage √† trois with her husband and Villers. In 1810 her husband's business was declared bankrupt and he went into premature senility. This blow was followed by the death of Villers and two of her children. Weak with disease herself she moved to Avignon, France, seeking a milder climate and hoping to save the life of her only surviving daughter. She died there of pneumonia in 1825, aged 55.

Biography  Weie was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. His father went away when Edvard was still very young and left his family in poverty. To help out, he would deliver newspapers every morning before school and later worked as a house painter. Despite the hardship, he was able to take art lessons. When he came of age, he went to Copenhagen to apply for admission to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, but was not accepted. Hanne Abildgaard. Artist: Edvard Weie Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon It was not until 1905, when he was already twenty-five years old, that he was able to enter the Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler, operated by Kristian Zahrtmann (1843‚Äì1917). It was there that he was introduced to modern art. He became a favored student and accompanied Zahrtmann on a trip to Italy in 1907, but returned prematurely when they had a falling-out. Back in Denmark, he painted a series of interiors and landscapes. From 1911 to 1920, he would spend part of every year painting on the island of Christians√∏. It was there he met the Swedish painter Karl Isakson (1878‚Äì1922). After Isakson's early death in 1922, Weie made an extensive study of his uses of color, and applied what he learned to his own works. Portrait bust of Weie, 1908 He had begun by painting works with a mythological or literary basis, but later came to favor street scenes and views of Copenhagen harbor. He would often paint several versions of the same concept. Due to his intense self-criticism, many of these would end up in the fire. Over the years, his works became increasingly abstract. He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1925, but he was not a member of any artistic movement and contributed numerous harsh critical pieces to newspapers and magazines that served to isolate him from his peers. He felt that contemporary Danish art was in a crisis and lacked human values. In his later years, he rarely exhibited, but gave much of his time to writing a book that would clearly summarize his opinions. It was published posthumously, in 1951, by his widow, under the title Poesi og Kultur. He died during 1943 in Frederiksberg and was buried at Vestre Kirkegard in Copenhagen.

Mailer recognized Cooper as a hunted man with a price on his head, and refuses to assist in his recovery from wounds until his wife convinces him that he will die unless given medical attention. Mailer who has discovered a rich vein of gold and is resolved to go to any length to protect his find, is now blind with suspicion, both over the gold and jealousy of his wife, with Cooper at the Post. As the tensions mount amongst the three, a Coyotero raid traps them and takes Mailers son, Tim (Dandy Curran) and holds him as hostage with the understanding that Mailer will deliver hundreds of rifles within seven days to the Indians for their continued warfare against the white man. Clint Mailer leaves to get the rifles and in the interim, Cooper and Nancy Mailer are drawn closer together with the revelation that Tim is not the son of Mailer. Mailer returns without rifles. Cooper then executes a plan involving the stealing of the rifles from the army post, placing them in the gold mine carefully leaving the mine booby trapped. The mine is blown up as the Indians approach it, Tim is rescued, Cooper and Nancy escape and set out to start a new life with Tim.

He was first elected to Nottinghamshire County Council and Ashfield District Council in 2007 as a Liberal Democrat candidate. He won the Sutton-in-Ashfield North by-election to Nottinghamshire County Council in March 2007, with a 44% swing and 60% increase of the vote share. Two months later, he won a seat on Ashfield District Council. He was elected the Leader of the Council that month becoming the youngest council leader in the UK at that time, aged 26. Early life Zadrozny was born in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire and is of Polish descent. He grew up in Kirkby-in-Ashfield attending Greenwood Primary School then Ashfield Comprehensive School. He attended West Nottinghamshire College where he completed a BTeC National Diploma in Performance Art. He then obtained a Higher National Diploma in Theatre Studies from the college in 2002. Political career Zadrozny was Leader of Ashfield District Council from May 2007 until May 2009. He was elected for the Sutton-in-Ashfield North ward to both the District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council as a Liberal Democrat. While in control of the Council, Zadrozny promoted Community Asset Transfers of two local buildings; The Acacia Centre in Annesley and the Manor Rooms in Teversal Village. His administration launched proposals for a Neighbourhood Charter of environmental pledges, creation of new community protection services and opened the new Lammas leisure centre in Sutton-in-Ashfield.https://www.chad.co.uk/news/video- dame-kelly-opens-new-163-16m-lammas-leisure-centre-1705958 In May 2009, Labour took back leadership of the authority. In June 2009 Zadrozny held his County Council seat. He was re-elected to Ashfield District in 2011 and to the County Council again in 2013. In 2015, following his suspension as a member of the Liberal Democrat Party, Zadrozny left the party and was elected as an Independent for a newly created ward, Larwood. In November that year he formed the Ashfield Independents Party. In 2017 he was elected to Nottinghamshire County Council for the new Ashfields Division as an Ashfield Independent. In 2016, Zadrozny ran for the elected position of the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner. He announced his candidacy in order to highlight his belief that he was victim of a politically motivated attack, relating to his arrest and questioning over historic child sex allegations (charges were subsequently dropped). In 2017 he was elected to Nottinghamshire County Council for the new Ashfields Division as an Ashfield Independent. His party fielded five candidates in that election and won all five. In 2017, he ran in the Hucknall North council by-election, where his party gained the seat after the Conservative incumbent was elected to Westminster and resigned his local council seat. He followed this success in the Sutton Junction and Harlow Wood by-election in December 2018 where his party won with 82% of the vote. In 2018 Zadrozny was once again selected Leader of Ashfield District Council after eight councillors defected from the incumbent Labour administration.

Films have been influential in Indian politics since the days of the British Raj, when movies were used for anti-British propaganda. Nevertheless, the leaders of the Indian National Congress viewed movie media with contempt. It was the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party, that made extensive use of this media for propaganda purposes. Adversaries of Dravidian parties despised the use of films and screen popularity for political gain, and Congress leaders like K. Kamaraj questioned the possibility of movie stars forming governments. C. N. Annadurai, the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from a Dravidian party, was the forerunner in introducing Dravidian ideologies into movie scripts. Of the movies made by Dravidian politicians Parasakthi (1952) was a turning point, as it was a huge box office hit and made radical comments against the social hierarchy set by the caste system and glorified the Dravidian movement. M. Karunanidhi, former Chief Minister, scripted the screen play for Parasakthi, in which Sivaji Ganesan and S.S.Rajendran, two founding members of the DMK, made their screen debuts. Movies produced by the DMK Party received severe censorship from the then ruling Congress government. According to Murasoli Maran, a former Union Minister from DMK, the censors would remove parts of the movies, so that the coherence of the screen play was lost, making the movies a box office failure. The script writers used equivocating phrases and words to evade the censorship. Five out of seven chief ministers from Dravidian parties were actively involved in Tamil cinema either as writers or as actors. M. G. Ramachandran, Jayalalithaa was the most successful. He launched his own Dravidian party after personal differences with the leaders of DMK, and rose to power as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu mostly with the help of his movie fans and low level cadres. The legacy of politics in Tamil filmdom still continues, though less prominently than in the 1950s to 1970s. Background =Dravidian movement= The Dravidian movement was founded in 1925 by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy (popularly known as Periyar). The movement aimed to achieve a society where backward castes have equal human rights, and encouraging them to have self-respect in the context of a caste-based society that considered them to be at the lower end of the social hierarchy. In Tamil Nadu an array of regional parties, termed Dravidian parties, owe their origin either directly or indirectly to the Dravidian movement. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its political rival All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) have been the major Dravidian parties. One of the major platforms of the Dravidian movement was to achieve political change by means of awareness within the society in everyday life.Hodges S (2005)Revolutionary family life and the Self Respect movement in Tamil south India, 1926‚Äì49 Contributions to Indian Sociology, Vol. 39, No. 2, 251-277 Thus Dravidian politicians viewed film media as an apt vehicle to promote such a revolution. =Tamil cinema= Tamil cinema, like its counterparts in other languages in India, is known as a melodramatic entertainment form plotted around twists of fate set in exaggerated locales, and filled with songs and dances. . Although a few stars from other southern states have tried to use film popularity as a stepping stone in politics, such as N. T. Rama Rao (Andhra Pradesh), Rajkumar (Karnataka) and Prem Nazir (Kerala), it was in Tamil Nadu that it was most prominent, with five of the seven Chief Ministers from Dravidian parties hailing from the Tamil film industry. In a state such as Tamil Nadu, where no single caste is predominant, film stars were considered people with wide acceptability to lead. According to Emeritus Professor K. Sivathamby, the movie halls themselves acted as a symbol of social equality. He states Politicizing Tamil cinema Early Tamil films were mainly based on mythological stories, and movies based on contemporary society started only in 1936. With the end of the era of silent movies in the 1930s many stage actors joined the Tamil cinema, and brought the ideologies of Gandhian philosophies with them. Although the Congress party made use of movie stars such as K. B. Sundarambal to appear at political meetings, some congressmen of that era looked upon movie media with contempt. Tamil Congress leaders like C. Rajagopalachari considered movie media to be a source of moral corruption. K. Kamaraj, then president of the All India Congress, mocked DMK's desire to get into power in this statement: DMK and cinema Attempts made by some Congress leaders to use stars of Tamil cinema, however minimal, were limited since this media remained inaccessible to the rural population (who were in the majority). The politicising of movies by the Congress virtually stopped soon after Indian Independence in 1947. With the introduction of electricity to rural areas in the 1950s Dravidian politicians could implement movies as a major political organ. In post colonial India, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was the first ‚Äì at the time the only ‚Äì party to take advantage of visual movie media. Actors and writers of guerrilla theatre, who were inspired by the ideologies of Periyar, brought the philosophies of Tamil nationalism and anti- Brahminism to celluloid media. The movies not only made direct references to the independent Dravida Nadu that its leaders preached for but also at many times displayed party symbols within the movie. Murasoli Maran, former central minister from DMK, considered that the DMK movies reflected the faces of both the past (demonstrating the rich language and culture of Tamils) and the future (with social justice). The DMK films espoused Dravidian ideologies through use of lengthy dialogues in its initial movies. Nevertheless, as the party's political aspirations grew, the movies based on Dravidian social reformation themes were replaced with stories that would enhance star popularity. Censorship in DMK movies The initial DMK movies were not victims of censorship since the party was little known to the censors, but as the party gained popularity in mid-1950s censorship became stronger. According to Murasoli Maran one of the techniques followed by the censors was to make sure that the coherence of the movie was lost so that it was a box office failure. At one point DMK, having had been a target of high censorship, had to move back to stage dramas. But the Dramatic Licensing Act brought censorship to stage plays as well, and two of Karunanidhi's plays were banned. To evade censorship DMK scriptwriters chose to use puns and equivocal phrases. The most commonly used pun was Anna which is the word for older brother in Tamil and also was the popular name for DMK chief C. N. Annadurai. When Anna was praised on screen the audience would break into applause. Script writers of DMK =C. N. Annadurai= The use of movie media as a major propaganda vehicle of Dravidian ideologies was first introduced by Annadurai, the founder chief of DMK, through his scripts. During his initial days with Dravidar Kazhagam, Annadurai wrote dramas which promoted social reforms and non-Brahmin self- respect ideologies. After the formation of DMK, Annadurai, along with E. V. K. Sampath (Periyar's nephew and one of the founders of DMK) and actor K. R. Ramaswamy, staged several plays promoting Dravidian ideologies. The DMK party's head office was purchased using the money raised through these plays. Annadurai scripted six screen plays in total. His first movie was Nallathambi (Good Brother, 1948), which starred N. S. Krishnan. It promoted cooperative farming and the abolition of the zamindari system of taxation. His movies such as Velaikaari (Servant Maid, 1949) and Or Iravu carried the hallmarks of propaganda for Dravidian politics. On Velaikari, Annadurai said that the movie Velaikari made direct criticisms of suppressive landlords who were traditionally allied with Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi. When DMK won the elections in 1967, Annadurai served as its first Chief Minister until his death in 1969. =Karunanidhi= Karunanidhi, the other major leader from DMK, started his propaganda efforts with Parasakthi (1952). Parasakthi was a turning point in Tamil cinema, as until then most movies contained up to 55 songs and were mostly based on mythologies. Parasakthi was initially banned. When it was finally released in 1952 it emerged as a huge box office hit. Like that of his political mentor Annadurai, Karunanidhi's movies carried elements of Dravidian political ideologies such as anti-Brahminism and anti Congress Party messages. Two of the movies that contained such messages were Panam and Thangarathnam. The overall themes of the movies were remarriage of widows, untouchability, self-respect marriages, abolition of zamindari and abolition of religious hypocrisy. Until 1949-50 Tamil film dialogues were in a Brahminical slang of the Tamil language. Annadurai and Karunanidhi introduced Tamil close to formal language and void of Sanskrit influence. According to Professor Robert Hardgrave Jr, the popularity of their movie dialogues made both Annadurai and Karunanidhi \\"stars in their own right.\\" After the death of Annadurai, Karunanidhi assumed the office of the Chief Minister in Tamil Nadu, and with intermediate periods of in and out of power, he served his 5th term as the chief minister from 2006-2011. Actors from Dravidian parties =K. R. Ramaswamy= K. R. Ramaswamy was an actor of both stage and screen in the 1940s and 50s. He was one of the founding leaders of the DMK and it was his earnings that initially financed the party. A talented singer and actor, he was called a Nadipisai Pulavar (acting and singing poet) by the popular masses. Improvements in technology in the film industry, including playback singing, along with personal problems ended the career of Ramaswamy. Nevertheless, he was nominated as a member of the Legislative Council (upper house of the State) by Annadurai in recognition of his service to the party. =N. S. Krishnan= N. S. Krishnan, or NSK as he was popularly known, was a Tamil comic actor and, as the times then required, a talented singer. He was never officially a member of any Dravidian party, but served the DMK to a great extent. He was one of the few non-Brahmins of his era to be popular in a Brahmin-dominated Tamil film industry. His favourite character to play in the movies was a Brahmin buffoon, which he would also enact in DMK meetings. NSK was highly influenced by the ideologies of Periyar and sowed the seeds of anti-Brahmanism in his scripts. NSK served the cause of DMK so much that the last public gathering Annadurai ever attended was to unveil a statue of NSK at a busy intersession in Chennai. =M. R. Radha= M. R. Radha was a stage actor and was popular through his roles as villain on screen. He was an ardent follower of Periyar and was close to most DMK leaders before they split from Dravidiar Kazhagam. Both Annadurai and Karunanidhi were part of M. R. Radha's troupe at different times and had even acted in his plays. =Sivaji Ganesan= Sivaji Ganesan is a veteran actor of Tamil cinema. He started his acting career at the age of six and toured with various drama troupes including that of M. R. Radha. The actor himself was named Shivaji by Periyar E. V. Ramasami after his role portraying the Maratiya king in a play named Chandra Mohan. In Chandra Mohan the Maratiya king triumphs over Brahmins and the role of the villainous Brahmin was played by Annadurai himself. Sivaji Ganesan made his movie debut in 1952 with Parasakthi, which opens with a song that glorifies Dravidian culture. Sivaji was a Tamil, whereas at the time he entered the film industry most other major actors were Telugus. He later became one of the founding members of DMK. Although it was DMK movies that brought Sivaji to the limelight he found that the responsibilities that the party threw at him limited his acting career. His association with DK and with DMK gave him an atheistic reputation that acted as a barrier between him and the religious segment of the audience. Realising that DMK was no longer an asset to his career, he attacked it as a glamour party and broke party protocol by his pilgrimage to Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. With the growing popularity of MGR in the party, Sivaji left DMK and aligned with the Tamil Nationalist Party of E. V. K. Sampath. When the Tamil Nationalist Party was dissolved he joined the Congress Party. Although Congress itself lost in the elections in the 1967, Sivaji's fans kept the party alive. In spite of being an active member of the Congress party, he made sure his movies were free of political references. After differences with party leaders he launched his own party, Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani, in 1989 but with little success, even losing his security deposit in the 1991 assembly election. =S. S. Rajendran= S. S. Rajendran (known popularly as SSR) was initially a theatre artist like Shivaji who starred in many plays for Dravidar Kazhagam. Like Sivaji, he debuted in Parasakthi. Being one of the most popular stars of Tamil cinema in the 1950s and 60s, he raised funds for DMK and acted in movies glorifying Dravidian ideologies.SSR was the first elected member of legislative assembly among actors in India in 1962.Personal problems led to a fall in his film career and in politics. Having spent most of his earnings for the party he found himself in a deep financial crisis. His movie career brought another star of DMK, M. G. Ramachandran, to cross swords with him, and his political ambitions brought Karunanidhi against him. Sensing trouble in all quarters SSR made a highly political movie, Thangarathinam, to coincide with the 1967 election campaign to prove his loyalty to the party. The party won a landslide victory in the 1967 general elections, but soon after the elections the animosity between SSR and Karunanidhi deepened. SSR complained of threats to his life and eventually left DMK to join AIADMK along with his old friend MGR. His aspirations as a political stalwart and as a film superstar were overshadowed by M. G. Ramachandran. =M. G. Ramachandran= M. G. Ramachandran (popularly known as MGR) was the foremost star for DMK propaganda during its peak and was politically the most successful of any film stars in India. MGR had a simple beginning in stage plays at the age of six. MGR was first invited by Annadurai to star in one of his movies in the 1950s. From then on MGR actively participated in the party's meetings. His films such as Nadodi Mannan (Vagabond King, 1958), Enga Vitu Pillai (Son of our House, 1965), Nam Nadu (Our Nation, 1969), Adimai Penn (Slave Girl, 1969) and Engal Thangam (Our Gold or Our Precious, 1970) displayed a stereotypical image of a philanthropic, mundane hero made out of a vagrant who becomes a king. Unlike other DMK actors, MGR used his screen popularity in social works as well, which included financing the poor, running orphanages and participating in disaster relief. MGR's movies portrayed him as a friend of the poor and downtrodden. MGR himself commented MGR always acted as a hero and made sure that he was always portrayed in a good light on screen. With the departure of Sivaji Ganesan from DMK, MGR's position within the party grew stronger. In contrast to Parasakthi, MGR's movies made less reference to social justice but dwelled more on contemporary political scenarios. The movies typically included references to Dravida and MGR would be clad in red and black (the DMK flag colours). In sharp contrast with earlier DMK movies where the overall theme was used for propaganda, in MGR's movies the protagonist was shown as a representative of the party ideology, who would fight against evil and support the poor. Thus he played roles that were directly relevant to the filmgoers and displayed himself as a symbol of the fulfilment of their own dreams. MGR, however, made sure that his social image, which he gained by independent charity and social works, did not get merged with that of DMK. With his rising popularity with the common man MGR fell into controversy by referring to K. Kamaraj, the Congress leader, as My leader. MGR resigned as a Member of Legislative Council. Soon after, the attendance of his then newly released movie dropped, with DMK supporters boycotting the movie. Just before the 1967 general elections MGR was shot by M. R. Radha in a personal dispute. This incident gained support of sympathising voters for DMK in the days leading up to the elections. Professor Hardgrave claims that at the time of the shooting incident MGR's popularity was slowly declining and the incident helped him regain his stature with the masses as well as the party. Whether DMK gained with MGR's popularity or MGR gained popularity with the rise of DMK remains a question for debate. Although MGR's charisma probably played a significant role in DMK's success, his popularity also cost the party much. When the party leaders tried to neutralise his powers, MGR launched his own party in 1972, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with support of the lower cadres alone. According to Professor Hardgrave one of the reasons for antipathy between MGR and the DMK leadership was Karunanidhi's attempt to bring his son M. K. Muthu into the party to replace MGR and to convert MGR fan clubs into Muthu fan clubs. The fictionalised account of the troubled relationship between Karunanidhi and MGR was later portrayed in the Tamil film Iruvar (The Duo) in 1997. When MGR formed his own party, Karunanidhi underestimated MGR's popularity and commented on AIADMK as \\"a successful movie‚Äôs 100-day run\\". However, with the support from his fans and low cadres alone, MGR won the 1977 state elections with a landslide victory and continued to rule the state until his death in December 1987. =J. Jayalalitha= Jayalalitha was one of the main leading ladies to pair with MGR on screen. She was inducted into AIADMK by MGR himself and frequently accompanied him to party rallies until MGR left for the United States for medical treatment in 1984. After his return, MGR was always accompanied by Janaki Ramachandran, his wife of forty years, until his death in 1987. Soon after MGR's death, AIADMK was split between his widow Janaki Ramachandran and Jayalalitha. Although both factions had lost the elections, Jayalalitha's AIADMK won 27 seats when compared to just one won by Janaki's party. Following the election defeat, Janaki retired from active politics and the two party factions rejoined. Although a successful film star of yesteryear, according to Professor Sara Dickey, Jayalalitha's popularity in politics comes from MGR rather than her own success on screen. She served six terms as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Later years In post MGR years, political reference in Tamil cinema had been less sporadic. Rajinikanth, one of the highest paid actors in India, supported the DMK and its ally Tamil Maanila Congress in the 1996 elections. His movie Muthu (1995) makes indirect reference to the then AIADMK head and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha. His movies such as Mannan (film) and Padayappa had characters which were politically identified with Jayalalitha. He later moved his allegiance to the Bharathiya Janata Party in the Indian general election of 2004. Rajinikanth is no longer active in politics. Another leading actor in Tamil cinema, Kamal Hasan, is a well known follower of Periyar. He started his own political party called Makkal Needhi Maiam in 2018. Two contemporary celebrities have launched their own parties. Of them, T. Rajendar was a well known supporter of DMK for a long time, although he did not incorporate its ideas into films. After a personal feud with the DMK leadership he launched his own party All India Latchiya Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 2004. Vijayakanth, a mainstream lead actor who was active in films between the 1980s and 2000s, had earlier converted his fan clubs into social service organisations, initially in a \\"typical, Dravidian, for-the-Tamils\\" fashion. His party, Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam is now placing itself as an alternative to mainstream Dravidian parties. In 2011, his party became the official opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. Vijayakanth himself is from a pro-Congress family.

Career Thompson's father was a former boxing champion.Dykes (1994), p. 372. Born in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Thompson began his football career with nearby Stakeford United. In August 1928, he had trials with Third Division North sides Ashington and Carlisle United, and Second Division Bradford Park Avenue. After declining terms with Ashington, he signed as an amateur with Carlisle before turning professional three weeks later in September 1928.Dykes (1994), p. 373. He spent most of the 1928‚Äì29 season in the club's reserve team, scoring 26 goals as the team won the North Eastern League Second Division and the Cumberland Cup. He made his Football League debut for Carlisle's first team as an inside forward away to Wigan Borough on 2 February 1929, scoring once in a 2‚Äì2 draw; his only other appearance came a week later in a 1‚Äì0 home win over Crewe Alexandra. At the end of the season, Thompson joined Second Division Bristol City, but never made a first-team appearance, instead spending his single season with the club playing in the reserves in both the Western Section of the Southern Football League and the Western Football League First Division. He left before the end of the 1929‚Äì30 season in February 1930 to join Bath City, playing for them in the Southern Football League for just over a year before joining First Division side Blackburn Rovers in April 1931. There he played mostly as a \\"bustling, forceful centre-forward\\", scoring 82 goals in 171 league appearances at a rate of almost a goal a game. This record meant he was Blackburn's leading scorer in four of his five full seasons at the club.Dykes (1994), pp. 372‚Äì3. In 1936, Blackburn were relegated to the Second Division, but Thompson was presented with the opportunity to return to the First Division when he signed for Manchester United for a fee of ¬£4,500 in November 1936.

He made one more appearance for the club the following season, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Southampton on 25 September 1937. In March 1938, he was allowed to leave for Third Division North side Gateshead, for whom he scored twice on his debut, a 4‚Äì1 win over Halifax Town. After just over a year with Gateshead, during which time he scored a total of seven goals in 24 league appearances, Thompson joined York City. He scored in his second appearance for the club ‚Äì a penalty in a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Rotherham United ‚Äì but his time there was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War, and after just three appearances for York, he was not heard from in professional football circles again.

Rugby career Thomas was born to a rector from Bettws, Bridgend, but moved to England when he gained a place at King's College, Cambridge after winning a choral scholarship. At Cambridge, Thomas studied History and was a keen sportsman. He played cricket for the Cambridge seconds, represented the athletics team and won a Blue at rugby. While playing for Cambridge he was first selected to represent Wales in 1912 in a game against the touring South African team. When Thomas was selected for the South African game he was chosen against a stipulated agreement, that stated that no Welsh player could be chosen to represent the country if they played within the London area, but did not play for London Welsh. Eight selectors travelled to Cambridge to watch Thomas play in a Varsity match which saw Cambridge victorious for the first time in seven years.Billot (1974), pg 99.

S. Van Dyke, based on the operetta Bitter Sweet by No√´l Coward. It was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Cinematography and the other for Best Art Direction by Cedric Gibbons and John S. Detlie. The film is based on Coward's stage operetta, which was a hit in 1929 in London. It was filmed twice, first in 1933 in black-and-white (in Britain, with Anna Neagle and Fernand Gravet in the leading roles). The 1940 film is much cut and rewritten, removing much of the operetta's irony. The opening and closing scenes are cut, focusing the film squarely upon the relationship between MacDonald's character, Sarah, and her music teacher, Carl Linden. The opening scene was a flash forward, in which Sarah appears as an elderly woman recalling how she fell in love.

His prolific contributions to the magazine were drawn in a variety of styles, from cartoony to illustrative. Kelly joined the Irish civil service as a messenger boy at the age of 15. At the age of 19 he, fellow cartoonist Arthur Booth, a 28-year-old clerk, and writer Tom Collins, founded Dublin Opinion in 1922, on the eve of the Irish Civil War, with Booth becoming its first editor. Kelly had no formal art training, and developed his style by studying the work of the leading cartoonists of the time. After Booth's death in 1926, Kelly co- edited the magazine with Collins, while continuing to work in the civil service, eventually becoming Director of Broadcasting and Director of National Savings. Kelly's cartoons were also published in The Capuchin Annual from 1942 to 1955. He began painting watercolours in the 1930s, and became a member of the Dublin Sketching Club and the Water Colour Society of Ireland: he exhibited over 60 pieces at the latter from 1941 to 1980, and had a solo exhibition of his watercolours in Dublin in 1972. After Collins' death Kelly struggled on with Dublin Opinion for a few years, before it was voluntarily wound up in 1968. He received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland in 1979, and was president and chairman of PEN.

The Royal Enfield Bullet has the longest unchanged production run of any motorcycle having remained continuously in production since 1948. The Bullet marque is even older, and has passed 75 years of continuous production. The Royal Enfield and Bullet names derive from the British company having been a subcontractor to Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, London. Evolution The Bullet has evolved from a four-valve engine with exposed valve-gear to the latest all-alloy unit construction engine with electronic fuel-injection. =1931-1939= Introduced in 1931 as a four-stroke single cylinder motorcycle, this model was the first to feature the Bullet name. It was different in a number of ways from its successors (which are now familiar): it had an inclined engine with exposed valve gear featuring four valves per cylinder with 350 cc and 500 cc options. In 1933, a 250 cc option was also added to the range. Its frame was also considerably different, having centre- spring girder front forks, being among a new range of models from Royal Enfield that featured them, along with a saddle-type fuel tank. However, common to motorcycles of this period, it had a rigid rear-end, necessitating a 'sprung' seat for the rider, which resulted in the iconic look of the motorcycle that is much replicated today, even though the sprung seat is unnecessary in modern models. After competition success the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet was bought by the British Army for dispatch riders and 3,000 were also supplied to the RAF during the Second World War. =1939-1949= This model refreshed Royal Enfield's model line-up for 1939. It differed in cosmetic details, as well as in having two rocker boxes, which resulted in higher volumetric efficiency for the engine. The basic design with front girder forks was retained. =1949-1956= A number of changes were implemented in order to bring the bike up to date. This model featured a vertical engine with alloy head and higher compression. The frame was changed to a fully sprung design using a swing-arm with non-adjustable hydraulic shockers at the rear, while the front used a brand-new telescopic fork of Royal Enfield's own design. This enabled the introduction of a bench seat made of simple foam and with no large springs. Power transmission was via the same four-speed Albion gearbox as the previous model, with a unique 'neutral- finder' lever the rider could press from any gear other than first to shift to neutral. The crankshaft continued to have a fully floating big-end bearing. The headlight assembly was enclosed with the speedometer and ammeter into a nacelle, which also served as the attachment of the front suspension as well as the handlebars. An otherwise similar model, but with engine displacement of 499 cc, made its debut in 1953. The prototype had done well in a performance trial and went on to win the trophy at the 1948 International Six Days Trial and two Bullet riders won gold medals. In 1952 Johnny Brittain won the Scottish Six Days Trial on a Royal Enfield Bullet and in 1953 he also won the International Six Days Trial without losing a single point. In 1949, the Indian Army ordered Royal Enfield Bullets for border patrol use and the company decided to open a factory in Madras. In 1955, the 350 cc Bullets were sent from the Redditch factory in kit form for assembly in India, but Enfield India Ltd. soon developed the factory and produced complete motorcycles independently under licence. The 1955 model remained almost unchanged for years and Madras produced over 20,000 Bullets annually. =1956-1969= In 1955, Royal Enfield carried out some retooling and redesign at their Redditch plant, in the UK, to modernise the Bullet, and in 1959 some changes were made to the gear ratios. These changes, however, were not incorporated by the Indian arm due to its commitment to supply the Indian Army. Thus the British and Indian lines diverged, never to meet again. Between 1956 and 1960, the British Bullet was released in several models, including a 350 cc Trials \\"works replica\\" version, a 350 cc \\"Clipper\\" model and in 1958 the Airflow version. This model had full weather protection from a large fibreglass fairing and included panniers for touring. The design was developed in partnership with British Plastics and featured as a series in The Motor Cycle magazine. The engines were the same and the only differences were in exhaust, seating, instrumentation, handlebars and fuel tank. Numerous technical improvements were also made, including moving to alternator charging (1956) and coil ignition (1960). The 350 cc model continued in production, but the 500 cc model was discontinued in 1961. In 1962, the UK company was sold and the Bullet discontinued and in 1967, the Redditch factory closed. Finally, in 1970, Royal Enfield closed down completely. Additional to the 'separate gearbox' Bullet the Royal Enfield Redditch factory produced approximately 250 'unit construction' (integral gearbox) Bullets bikes known as 'New Bullets'. Produced in five batches of fifty between 1963 and 1965 these models were essentially a 350 Crusader. However, unlike their 'one piece cranked' smaller sibling the New Bullet had a built up crank and the traditional Bullet bore and stroke dimensions under a Crusader cylinder head. These bikes are difficult to identify as being different from the Crusader. Look for a ten finned barrel on a Crusader and you will have found a New Bullet. By necessity the tool box air intake slot is also a little higher. Other variations from the unit 250 include a 46 tooth rear sprocket, an outrigger bearing on the primary side crankcase a four plate clutch and wider gear cogs. The petrol tank is similar to the earlier unit range item (not the Clipper tank) but has a larger cut out on the underside to clear the taller motor making it 1/4 gallon light on capacity. A New Bullet was modelled for sale to the army and carried panniers and a 'speedo-only' style of casket. According to RE data 232 of these bikes were produced making them a very rare and desirable machine today. =1955-1995= Enfield India Ltd. continued production of the 1955 Bullet design almost unchanged, re-introducing it to the British market in 1977 under the name 'Enfield'. This was a period of stagnation for the Bullet. Royal Enfield Bullet Electra 350, 2004 Due to the protectionist nature of the Indian economy, no need for improvement was apparent, and the brand survived into the 1990s essentially as a domestic Indian commuter bike. Equivalent bikes in the market were the Yamaha RD350 and the Yezdi. Both bikes enjoy a cult following in India, but have been out of production for decades. However, this could not prevent the erosion of the bike's market once the economy was sufficiently opened up to allow the Japanese motorbikes. The bike's high fuel consumption (its main competition was from bikes with superior and more economical 100 cc engines) caused a descending spiral of sales until the company, near bankruptcy, was bought out by Eicher Motors, a tractor and commercial vehicle manufacturer. =1995-1997= Under the newly appointed CEO of Enfield India, Siddhartha Lal, Eicher undertook major investment in the ailing firm. This was started with a lawsuit to secure the trademark and intellectual property rights of the defunct British Royal Enfield, in the hands of the Holder family since the British Royal Enfield's bankruptcy proceedings in 1970.https://abrokebiker.wordpress.com/tag/david-holder/ After winning a trademark lawsuit, the company name was changed to Royal Enfield Motors. Many management and production changes were made, with the production process being streamlined and excess capacity redistributed. Without the large-scale Army/Law Enforcement orders to bail the company out, there was only the individual sales route in which the company had to perform if it were to survive at all. The company also faced the difficult task of catering to a very diverse market. To preserve the Bullet's nature and reputation as a classic British bike, as the Raja Gaadi, and to attract youngsters away from the newly appeared performance motorcycle market, the Bullet marque was split up into two. The Bullet Standard 350 featured all the increased manufacturing quality and reliability but was maintained in the traditional 'Bullet' look, available only in black. A new model, available in more colours and chrome accents, CDI electronic ignition, and gas-charged shock absorbers - but with the same engine and gearbox as the Standard - was launched. This model was called the 'Bullet Electra'. The Electra 350 went on to become the best- selling Royal Enfield model, accounting for around half the company's sales. Alongside these developments, Austrian engine firm AVL was contracted to produce an all-alloy engine suitable as a drop-in replacement for the cast- iron block original engine (with design dating from 1955). The first bike with this engine was launched as the Bullet Machismo 350. This engine did not sell well in the Indian market; many prospective buyers were surveyed as saying that it didn't sound the same as the old engine, lacking the 'thump' noise of its predecessor. The engine did succeed in the Thunderbird model, a chopper style cruiser from Royal Enfield Motors. Also seen was the introduction of a disc-brake on the front wheel as a factory option domestically in India and standard on all exported models. =1997-2009= After ever tighter European emission specifications forced the Bullet Standard 350 to end 2007 as its last model year in the European Union. The 500's had been fitted for some time with an induction pulsed pump to draw in fresh external air and expel it into the exhaust header to make it appear that the emissions were lower than in reality they were! When existing stocks of motorcycles were all sold the British- design engined Bullet became no longer available. All new models exclusively featured the AVL 'lean-burn' engine. The introduction of a five-speed, left foot change gearbox meant that Royal Enfield could 'fix' one of the long- standing quirks of the Bullet design;the original foot-brake is on the left side while the gearchange is on the right (as was the custom with British bikes). Accordingly, the Bullet Machismo 350 was equipped with this left foot change gearbox and a big hit in the foreign markets as it was rich in design and the first chrome model on an Enfield. However, the 'left-shift' gear change provoked a backlash from Indian Bullet customers, forcing the company to not only continue the Bullet Standard with the traditional system, but even on the Electra it was offered only as an option, leading to the Electra four- speed (traditional) and Electra five-speed (left-shift) variants. Sales figures indicated that Indian Bullet customers had shunned the new gearbox, foregoing even the attraction of five-speed transmission to keep the gearshift traditional. However, it became standard fitment on all exported models. New developments included the addition of electric start as an option on some models, while standard on others. In 2007 and 2008, a limited edition, heavily accessorised 500cc lean-burn Machismo 350 and 500 was produced where the motorcycle features 20.85 Nm of torque at 3000 rpm, unique 19 -inch wheels, 280 mm front disc brake & the same engine chassis configuration being exported to Europe, USA & Australia. The Machismo 350 and 500 were discontinued due to a lot of internal noise in the engine. =Since 2007= As a result of work spanning several years, a new set of engines was introduced. These were the unit construction engines (UCE). The 350 cc UCE found use in the domestic model Thunderbird TwinSpark in a configuration with two sparkplugs per cylinder, with integrated 5-speed left-shift gearbox. It has not been featured on any of the Bullet models, domestic or otherwise. By 2011, the old cast-iron engine had been completely phased out, including in the Standard 350 model. Now all Royal Enfield bikes are only available with the all-aluminium UC engine. The 500 cc UCE features fuel injection system, and has greater power than any Royal Enfield 500 cc motor. The 500 cc UCE, with an integrated five- speed gearbox, powers the current Bullet Classic model. Starting in 2009, this engine was available only in the EU to satisfy emissions regulations, but it is available in the United States under two frame models, the Bullet Classic C5, or the Bullet G5, which looks similar and shares paneling with the earlier AVL Electra models. In 2011 a third export model, the B5, was introduced combining the newer 500 cc UCE engine with the traditional Indian domestic tank and frame. In 2017 Royal Enfield equipped Bullet 500 models with Euro 4 compliance which included ABS brakes for front and rear and better emission control system. =Since 2020= Royal Enfield have officially confirmed that they will cease production of their 500cc engine. The majority of their sales comes from the 350cc models and the demand for the 500cc models started to decline in the Indian markets especially after the introduction of the 650 twins. It is to be discontinued in India from March 31 since the Bharat Stage VI emission norms will make them unviable. The company will upgrade its line up of 350cc motorcycles instead for Indian markets and promote its 650cc motorcycles as its primary export drivers. Custom models Swiss motorcycle tuner and Royal Enfield distributor Fritz W. Egli made a custom Bullet using Egli's central tube frame constructed from nickel-plated chromium-molybdenum steel, and a longer stroke crankshaft (105 mm) engine with special main bearings, dry clutch, timing belt primary drive, and 36 mm Keihin flat-slide carburettors. Other custom versions of the Bullet are the Musket, made in Ohio, and the Australian designed Carberry.

He was shot and killed by an Israel Defense Forces sniper, during a battle in Jenin on 22 November 2002. A United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel was vetoed by the United States. In 2005 an English inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. Early life Iain John Hook (born in 1948, Essex) of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was married and father of three sons and a daughter; two of his sons are British military officers. Prior to his work for the United Nations, Iain Hook was a British paratrooper. Hook supervised the reconstruction of a hospital complex in Pristina, Kosovo, in 1999, and also worked on projects in East Timor, Afghanistan, and Serbia. Death and subsequent events =UNRWA Work= Iain Hook was working for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which is \\"created to administer Palestinian refugee camps set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war\\", and which was home to 13,000 Palestinian refugees, as project manager in rebuilding of Jenin refugee camp in West Bank. In October 2002, Hook arrived at the Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin to oversee the rebuilding of the camp. =Death of Iain Hook= On 22 November 2002, Hook left a voice message with Israeli authorities that Palestinian militants (\\"shabab\\"-youth) had \\"knocked a hole in the wall\\" and \\"pinned down\\" his men. During a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper killed Hook. Israeli Army radio claimed that the sniper who killed him mistook his cell phone for a handgun or grenade. The United Nations stated that there were no gunmen at the compound, and claims that the shooting was a mere mistake; Hook was shot in the back by a sniper with a scoped rifle, from a distance of 20 meters. Co-workers evacuated Hook through the hole in the wall, but he died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen before reaching a hospital. Ambulance controversy United Nations immediately arranged an ambulance for patient evacuation but Israeli soldiers on the field delayed the ambulance sent to evacuate Hook and changed its route. The UNRWA statement was later echoed by then UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan in New York City, while Israel military officials have denied the charge. Socialist Worker stated that the army forced the ambulance to wait 25 minutes while Hook \\"bled to death\\". =Diplomatic response= Israeli Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned the British Foreign Minister, Jack Straw to express regrets over Hook's death. The United States vetoed \\"with regret\\" a United Nation Security Council resolution proposed by Syria condemning Israel for the killing; there were 12 votes in favor of the resolution, and 2 abstentions, in the 15 nation vote.\\"US vetoes anti-Israel UN resolution\\", BBC News, 21 December 2002 United States ambassador John D. Negroponte said Syria and the Palestinians seemed \\"more intent on condemning Israeli occupation than on ensuring the safety of United Nations personnel.\\" UN Secretary General Kofi Annan released a statement demanding that Israel punish those responsible for the killing. Israel, however, found that \\"no criminal act had been committed\\" and no criminal charges were filed. More than sixty United Nations workers wrote a letter criticizing Israeli troops for \\"senseless\\" and \\"wanton\\" behavior, complaining of abuse and humiliation. Israel responded by releasing to newspapers what the New York Times called a \\"damning intelligence report\\" alleging UNRWA operations being used as cover for \\"Palestinian terrorists\\", including smuggling arms in UN ambulances and hosting meetings of Tanzim in UN buildings. The United Nations internal report on the matter was the subject of controversy: the initial version stated that peace activists in the compound were bringing young Palestinian men into the compound through a hole in the wall. Following protests by UNWRA staff, the claim was dropped from the report. =Coroner's inquest= Coroner Dr Peter Dean opened the inquest at Ipswich Crown Court. In 2005, Irish activist Caoimhe Butterly gave written eyewitness testimony in the inquest into the killing of Iain Hook by an Israeli military sniper. After the court proceedings jurors unanimously delivered the verdict that the Israeli military was fully accountable for the unlawful killing of Iain Hook. Dr Peter Hansen, former Commissioner General of the UNRWA, said that \\"over the past four years 13 UNRWA workers, including Mr. Hook, had been shot in similar circumstances by the Israeli army\\". In a statement after the verdict, Paul Wolstenholme, a colleague of Hook who was in the compound at time of the shooting, said the Israeli sniper would have known he was not a Palestinian. \\"It was not a case of mistaken identity, it was a deliberate act,\\" he said. =Payment= The Israeli government made an ex gratia payment to the Hook family in an agreement with the British government. The Foreign Office (UK) did not reveal the details under the Freedom of Information Act for \\"releasing information on the death that could damage Britain's relations with another state\\", while John Gillan, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office claimed other information on the death could not be released which is related to the \\"formulation or development of government policy.\\" See also *Tom Hurndall ‚Äì British ISM volunteer fatally wounded in Gaza by IDF sniper, 11 April 2003. *James Miller - British filmmaker fatally shot in Gaza by IDF sniper, 2 May 2003.

The founder, Allan Lockheed, went on to form the similarly named but otherwise unrelated Lockheed Aircraft Company in 1926, which would merge with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form today's Lockheed Martin. History The Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company was established in San Francisco in 1912 by the brothers Allan and Malcolm Loughead. In 1916, the company was renamed the Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company and relocated to Santa Barbara, California, the same year Santa Barbara native Jack Northrop (aged 20) took his first job in aviation working as a draftsman for Loughead Aircraft. The company proceeded to design and construct the Model F-1 flying boat, which debuted on March 29, 1918, and set the American non-stop record for seaplane flight by flying from Santa Barbara to San Diego.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 59, Cypress, CA, 2013. Following the Model F-1, the company invested heavily in the design and development of a revolutionary monocoque aircraft called the Model S-1. However, the asking price of $2500 could not compete in a market that was saturated with post World War 1 $350 Curtiss JN-4s and De Haviland trainers. The Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company closed its doors in 1921. =Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company= Loughead returned to San Francisco in 1912 and went to work as an auto mechanic. There, he and his brother Malcolm spent their spare time building a three-place seaplane to operate from San Francisco Bay. They constantly ran out of money until they convinced Max Mamlock of the Alco Cab Company to invest $4,000 in the plane. Finally, after 18 months, their Model G was christened the ALCO NO. 1 in 1913, and Allan Loughead made a successful flight in it from the waters of the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay. That first flight was on June 15, 1913. The flight reached an altitude of 300 feet and a speed of 60 miles per hour. Allan then returned to take Malcolm for a ride. The Model G made three flights that day. Allan Lockheed recalled in 1942 that the Model G was built mostly with hand tools and called the aircraft \\"one of the first successful three place tractor seaplanes in the United States.\\" While the Model G, the first plane to bear the Loughead (Lockheed) name, was far ahead of its time, few would pay $10 to fly in it. Mamlock soon lost his enthusiasm for aviation and seized the plane. He told the Lougheads if they wanted it back, they would have to repay his $4,000. Consequently, in the hopes of striking it rich, the Loughead brothers spent two unsuccessful years prospecting in California's gold country. With the financial aid of Paul Meyer, Allan and Malcolm Loughead bought the Model G back in 1915 and opened a flying concession at the Panama- Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. In five months, they took 600 paying passengers aloft and netted $4,000. Henry Ford was one person who turned down a ride, saying, \\"I would not take even a straightaway flight four feet above the bay in anybody's aeroplane for all the money in California.\\" In early 1916, the Loughead brothers moved the operation to Santa Barbara, where they were swamped by people wanting to make their first flight. In addition, they made charter flights to the off-shore islands, and local movie companies used the plane to take aerial footage.  Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company  In 1916, the brothers organized the Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara to build a huge 10-place, twin-engined F-1 flying boat for their aerial sightseeing business. They began construction in a rented garage, which attracted the attention of 20-year-old John K. \\"Jack\\" Northrop. Northrop was skilled in drafting and mathematics, and the Lougheads employed him in designing the F-1. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Allan Loughead went to Washington, D.C. to try to get a Navy contract to build the F-1 in quantity. The Navy informed Loughead that it would purchase only previously approved designs. Later, Loughead said of this visit, \\"Down there I lost all the patriotism I ever had.\\" However, he did return with a contract to build two Curtiss flying boats and an agreement for the Navy to test the F-1. When the F-1 was completed, Allan Loughead and a crew of three flew it from Santa Barbara to San Diego in April 1918, setting a record of 181 minutes for the 211-mile flight. After the Navy completed its tests, the F-1 was returned to Loughead Aircraft and was then converted into the F-lA land- plane. Loughead now hoped to interest the Army in it as a long-range bomber or transport plane. The war ended before its conversion was completed. The Lougheads decided to demonstrate the long-range potential of the F-lA by making the first flight from Santa Barbara to Washington, D.C. Their crew included pilot Orvar Meyerhoffer, co-pilot Aaron R. Ferneau, and mechanic Leo G. Flint. They departed Santa Barbara on November 23 and crossed the Coastal Mountains. En route they encountered severe weather, but the weather cleared when they crossed the Colorado River at Yuma, Arizona. Near Tacna, Arizona, an engine failed and Meyerhoffer made a rough landing. Flint worked on the engine while Meyerhoffer and Ferneau caught a train back to Yuma to have the broken tailskid repaired. Then the trio cleared a makeshift runway, took off, and landed at Gila Bend, Arizona, for fuel. On the second takeoff attempt, the engine quit, and the plane crashed nose first into the ground. That ended the F-lA's transcontinental flight. When Loughead Aircraft completed its two HS-2L flying boats for the Navy in early 1919, it then converted the damaged F-lA landplane back into the F-1 flying boat for its sightseeing flight operations. Among their most notable passengers were King Albert and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, whom the Lougheads flew at the request of the U.S. government. Albert and Elisabeth were so impressed with their flight out to Santa Cruz Island that they presented Allan and Malcolm with the Belgium Order of the Golden Crown. In addition, local movie studios gladly paid $50 an hour for flight time in the F-1 and $50 an hour while on standby. In 1919, Loughead Aircraft entered the small aircraft market with the single-seat S-1 Sport Biplane. Intended to be \\"the poor man's airplane\\", it featured an innovative molded plywood monocoque fuselage for which the Lougheads, Northrop and Tony Stadlman received a patent. Its foldable wings allowed storage in a garage, and the lower wings could be rotated to act as ailerons and airbrakes. Because no suitable engines were available, the company designed and built a 25-horsepower water-cooled engine for the S-1. The S-1 was tested successfully at Redwood City, CA in 1919 by Gilbert Budwig and flew well. After the S-1 completed its test flights, the pilot said it was the most flyable plane he had ever flown. The plane made hundreds of flights and proved to be a successful design. At an aircraft show in San Francisco, thousands admired the S-1, but no one ordered the $2,500 plane. Allan Loughead realized that the government's sale of war surplus aircraft for as little as $300 had killed the market for new aircraft. As a result, Loughead Aircraft closed in 1920 and its assets were liquidated in 1921.

They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the Coromandel Coast for close to 430 km between the rivers, Krishna and Pennar. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin while in the south it merges with the Tirupati hills. An extremely old system, the hills have extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520 m which reaches 1100 m at Bhairani Konda and 1048 m at Gundla Brahmeswara.Google Earth Both of these peaks are in a north westerly direction from the town of Cumbum. There are also many other peaks above 800m.http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V18_352.gif Geology The rocks of the Nallamala ranges belong to the Kadapa system which is a series some 20,000 ft. thick. The primary rocks are Quartzite overlaid with an irregular slaty formation. Some sandstone is also to be found. The rocks here are very irregular and soft in texture thus rendering commercial exploitation impossible. These rocks are among the oldest in the world and have been formed as a result of large scale volcanic activity hundreds of millions of years ago. The evidence of the volcanic forces are evident in the foldings into which the rocks have been forced. Climate The Nallamalas have a rather warm to hot climate throughout the year. Rainfall averages about 90 cm and is concentrated in the months of the South West Monsoon (June‚ÄìSeptember). The fissured rocks prevent any water from percolating underground and hence most of the discharge runs off as mountain streams to join the Gundlakamma River, the largest river to arise in these hills. Winters are mostly cool and dry with the average temperature around 25 degrees Celsius. Summers are very hot, with temperatures as high as 45 degrees Celsius.

Lack of water prevents the growth of large trees and the prevalent vegetation consists of Terminalia, Hardwickia and Pterocarpus. Agriculture is almost non existent apart from isolated patches near villages where subsistence farming is practiced. The Nallamala Forests are probably the largest stretch of undisturbed forest in South India apart from the Western Ghats and were particularly rich in game till the 1970s. A large part of the forest is a part of the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve that has a viable tiger population. Leopard sightings too are not uncommon. Many of the adventures of the popular wildlife writer, Kenneth Anderson are set in these forests.Kenneth Anderson: The Call of the Wild; The Black Panther of Sivanipalli Population The uneven terrain and the scarcity of water has prevented the growth of any large cities in this region. Kurnool is the largest city in this region with Nandyal being the second largest and little nearer than Kurnool to the forest. The indigenous population consists of the Chenchus, a forest dwelling tribe who have remained cut off from the modern world even today. Farming is the primary occupation of the people in the plateaus while the Chenchus are still hunter gatherers. The hills were a hotbed of Naxal activities until recently. Police action since 2005 has all but cleared the forest of them. Transport A state highway and the Nallapadu-Nandyal line of the Guntur railway division pass through the hills. The railway was first built by the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and is a feat of engineering, having 2 tunnels at Bogada and Chelama and a few viaducts, the most famous being the now abandoned Dorabavi Viaduct. The railway enters the hills at the Nandikama Pass near Cumbum Lake. The highway follows a zig zag alignment and thus avoids any tunnels. The primary exports of this region are forest produce like timber waste, honey and molasses. Places of interest Srisailam on the River Krishna is the site of a large hydroelectric power project as also an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Mahanandi temple and Ahobilam Nava Narsimha Temples are situated here. A stream descends down the Gundla Brahmeswara peak and ends in a waterfall and sacred pool called Nemaligundam (Peacock Pool). The Mallela Theertham waterfall on the river Krishna is also located in this forest. The Cumbum Lake is one of Asia's oldest man made lakes and dates back to the 15th century. It was built by the Gajapati kings of Orissa for irrigating about 420 km2 farmland by damming a narrow opening between two adjoining hills and later renovated by queen Vardarajamma of Vijayanagara kingdom in the 16th Century.http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?volume=11&objectid;=DS405.1.I34_V11_080.gif Mahanandi Temple View.jpgMahanandi Temple along the foothills of Nallamala Srisailam Entrance Gopuram.jpgSrisailam Entrance Gopuram Mallelatheertham.JPGMallelatheertham Waterfalls, Srisailam Upper Ahobilam temple Gopuram 02.jpgUpper Ahobilam temple Gopuram Notable incidents On 2 September 2009, a Bell-430 chopper carrying the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S.

Mercurius Civicus: Londons Intelligencer, or, Truth impartially related from thence to the whole Kingdome to prevent mis-information (Latin: \\"The City Mercury\\") was an English Civil War weekly newspaper, appearing on Thursdays from 4 May 1643 to 10 December 1646 published by John Wright and Thomas Bates. It supported the Roundhead (Parliamentary) cause. Published in London, each number of the Mercurius Civicus consisted of one quarto sheet folded to make up four leaves, and was priced at one penny. Beginning with the third issue, the front page was usually illustrated with one or two woodcuts, usually of some political or military leader‚Äôs portrait (although the same cut was often used for different persons), making it the first illustrated journal. It is regarded as the \\"first big city newspaper\\" History Parliament passed an ordinance on 14 June 1643 requiring that all news pamphlets be entered into the Stationers Registry, after which Mercurius Civicus suspended publication for a month after the sixth issue appeared on 16 June. It resumed publication a month later on 13 July. Toward the end of that year Wright transferred his interest to his son, John Wright, Jr., after which the imprint appeared as \\"Thomas Bates and J.W.J.\\" until a few months before publication ceased, when only Bates's name is found. The author of Mercurius Civicus was identified only by his initials, R. C., but Joseph George Muddiman identified the editor as Richard Collings, which was confirmed by Joseph Frank by the use of rhymed headlines on the title-page and of a hand to indicate important items. Collings also authored The Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer: sent abroad to prevent mis-information, which appeared on Tuesdays from January 1643 to October 1649, and The Weekly Intelligencer of the Commonwealth, which ran from 23 July 1650 to 25 September 1655 and from May to December 1659. With the cessation of the Civil War and the partial demobilisation of the Parliamentary Army, many of the newspapers that had sprung up ceased publication. The content of Mercurius Civicus suffered, and it was reduced to reusing the same copy as The Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer in late 1646. In the 5 November issue, an editorial appeared intimating that the author had been threatened if he continued to publish, and the paper ceased publication a month later. Modern transcription and homage In 2013 a British historical publisher transcribed and re-published all issues of Mercurius Civicus from 1643. In 2015 The Lady's Realm resurrected the name Mercurius Civicus as its special supplement on the news of the net. Notes References  External links *Front cover, Mercurius Civicus.

History Barking Lodge, St. Thomas in the East, Jamaica (taken from a birth entry transcription by registrar W. Tilly, 1895) Barking Lodge was once a small sugar estate spanning and worked by 150 slaves at the time of emancipation when the property belonged to Philip Forsyth and the heirs of Robert Lindsay, having been owned in 1811 by the heirs of Ambrose S. Carter.Jamaica Surveyed, B W Higman, 2001: p 278 Ambrose S. Carter appears to have first settled the estate in the 1770s. Upon his death in the early 1790s, the plantation may have descended to the Forsyth and Lindsay families into whom Carter's daughters had married whilst another daughter made union with the Dickinson family. Ambrose Carter was latterly married to the owner of Newmarket plantation. Other Carters of the period became proprietors of the Essex and Wilmington estates whilst a family of Carters settled at Bath and one Carter married into the Worsfold family. It is not apparent how these Carters may have been related. The prevalence of the name Carter in this quarter of St Thomas may be attributed to the Carters' slaveholding. The names Carter, Forsyth and Lindsay are those native to Barking Lodge. When sugar production was abandoned, in 1847 Barking Lodge amalgamated with the nearby properties of Unity and Airy Mount under the ownership of Alexander Barclay. Maps suggest the geography and layout of the village to have remained unchanged since this time and it is possible to identify the site of the former sugar works on Unity Road and the site of the overseer's house on Crockett Hill whilst the former slave village was located to the west and within the boundary of Crockett Hill. Controversy Alexander Barclay came to Jamaica from England in 1805 and authored A Practical View of the Present State of Slavery in the West Indies, an apologia for slavery.Alexander Barclay, A Practical View of the Present State of Slavery in the West Indies (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1826) [google.books] Barclay led a notable public life, serving as Custos and Assemblyman for St. Thomas parish, then known as St. Thomas-in-the-East, but continues to spark controversy. When the global financial institution Barclays Bank was accused of having historical links with the slave trade by which the firm profited, Alexander Barclay was presumed to be one of the slave-holding Barclays who had founded the company.*http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/6/30_06nobloodmoney.html and http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/5/30_05barclays_response.html Though Barclays refute those accusations and claim categorically that there is no connection, members of the black community in America angrily protested in 2007 at the bank's sponsorship of the New Jersey Nets basketball arena located in the Brooklyn area, largely populated by Afro- Americans.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/black-leaders- erupt-over-barclays-sports-deal-434712.html External links * Friends of Barking Lodge, a group which collects and preserves historical records relating to the village References Populated places in Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica ","title":"Barking Lodge"},{"id":"20678832","title":"List of National Natural Landmarks in Michigan"},{"id":"20678837","title":"Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, 1903‚Äì1906"},{"id":"20678846","title":"List of National Natural Landmarks in Minnesota"},{"id":"20678858","title":"List of National Natural Landmarks in Mississippi"},{"id":"20678880","text":"The BL 12-inch Mark XI and Mark XII gunBritain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II.

The crusader raiding party captured the Turkish fort of Xerigordos, about four days' march from Nicaea, in an attempt to set up a pillaging outpost. Elchanes arrived three days later and besieged the crusaders. The defenders had no water supply, and after eight days of siege, they surrendered on September 29. Some of the crusaders converted to Islam, while others who refused were killed.  Prelude  The army of the People's Crusade landed in Asia Minor on August 6, 1096, and camped at Helenopolis (Civetot/Civetote) to the north-west of Nicaea, at that time capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm. The young Sultan, Kilij Arslan I, was in the middle of a military campaign to the east, fighting the Danishmend emirate. While waiting for the main crusader army, the disorganized \\"People‚Äôs Crusade\\" army began to attack the villages surrounding Nicaea. The raiding party returned unhindered many times with their booty, at some point even defeating the garrison of Nicaea when it tried to stop them. Reinald led 6,000 Germans (Lombards and Alemanni), including 200 knights, on similar raids. Reinald was unsatisfied with the pillaging results near Nicaea and went farther to Xerigordos, a fortress four days march to the east, to set up a pillaging base. On September 18, 1096, Reinald easily defeated the Xerigordos garrison. Kilij Arslan ordered his general, Elchanes, to deal with the crusader's raiding parties with his troops, mostly mounted archers. The battle Elchanes arrived three days after Reinald occupied Xerigordos, on September 21 and besieged the crusaders tightly. The speed of the Turkish mounted troops surprised the Germans; they had not expected to be besieged and were unprepared and without adequate supplies. Moreover, there was no water system inside the fortress: > Our people were in such distress from thirst that they bled their horses and > asses and drank the blood; others let their girdles and handkerchiefs down > into the cistern and squeezed out the water from them into their mouths; > some urinated into one another's hollowed hands and drank; and others dug up > the moist ground and lay down on their backs and spread the earth over their > breasts to relieve the excessive dryness of thirst.August. C. Krey, The > First Crusade: The Accounts of Eyewitnesses and Participants, (Princeton: > 1921), 71-72 Relief forces never came. Some accounts mentioned that Turks sent two spies to the Crusaders' camp at Civetot to make them think that Xerigordos was still safe, and even that Nicaea had been conquered by Reinald. Other accounts mentioned that Crusader leaders on the field were forced by their troops to advance, but could not make the decision until news of the Xerigordos surrender arrived on October. For eight days, the Crusaders resisted thirst and a rain of arrows and smoke from the Turks. After, the leader of the Germans offered to surrender and to fight for the Turks. The fort surrendered on September 29, 1096. Some of the Crusaders who converted to Islam became slaves, while others who refused to abandon their faith were killed. There are various accounts on Reinald's fate. Some mention that he was killed at the beginning of the siege while trying to ambush the Turks' own water source in front of the fortress, others that he died during the siege, and one that claims he converted to Islam.  Aftermath  Kilij Arslan I became more confident and sent his army to ambush the People‚Äôs Crusade army at the Battle of Civetot en route to Nicaea.

Between 2008 and 2011, he served as speaker of the Slovenian National Assembly. Since February 2012, he has been the president of the social liberal extra-parliamentary party Zares.  Early life and education  Gantar was born in the Upper Carniolan village of Gorenja Vas near ≈†kofja Loka, Slovenia, in what was then Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After finishing a professional school for carpentry, he decided to enroll to the university. After passing the entry exams, he was accepted by the Faculty for Political Sciences at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied sociology. During his student years, Gantar was actively involved in student activities. In 1971, he was among the co-founder of the radical alternative student group November 13th, which included among other the famous philosopher Mladen Dolar.

In 1984, he studied at the University of Essex, where he became acquainted with the liberal critique of Marxism. He became interested in the classical liberal thought and was especially influenced by the works of the Slovene-born British liberal economist Ljubo Sirc, who strongly criticized the Yugoslav economic model. Upon returning to Ljubljana, he was appointed as the chairman of the Communist Party cell at the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 1985, he used this position to defend the essayist Spomenka Hribar, who was accused of denigration of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War because an essay in which she publicly denounced the mass killings of the Slovene Home Guard after World War II. Because of this stand, Gantar was expelled from the Communist Party of Slovenia. In the late 1980s, he was among the first scholars of contemporary underground social movements in Slovenia and Yugoslavia, together with Frane Adam and Gregor Tomc. He was actively involved in the so-called Slovenian Spring, the mass movement that brought to the democratization and independence of Slovenia. He was among the first to denounce the arrest of four journalist in the JBTZ-trial and was member of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, the central platform that led the democratization process in Slovenia between 1988 and 1990.  Political career  In 1989, he obtained his PhD in sociology at the University of Zagreb. In 1990, he joined the Liberal Democratic Party. The same year, he was elected to the Parliament of Slovenia in the first free elections held in Slovenia after World War II. Between 1994 and 2000, he served as the Minister of Environment in the cabinet of Janez Drnov≈°ek. In 2001, he became the Minister of Information Society in the last cabinet led by Janez Drnov≈°ek and later by Anton Rop. In 2004, the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia was defeated by the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party. Nevertheless, Gantar was elected to the National Assembly of Slovenia, where he served as an opposition MP until 2008. In 2007, he joined the newly formed social liberal Zares party led by Gregor Golobiƒç. In 2008, he was re-elected to the Lower House of the Slovenian Parliament.

The panchayath shared boundaries with Erathu panchayath in the north, Ezhamkulam panchayath in the east, Kunnathur panchayath and Kalladayar in the south and Pallikkal and Poruvazhy Panchayaths in the west. Kakkathikkunnu in the north and Pandimalakkunnu (Pandimalappuram) in the south stands as two strong forts in this panchayath which balances the climatic conditions of this area. Kadampanad, Kallukuzhi, Thuvayoor and Mannadi areas form Kadampanad panchayath. Mannadi is known as the place where Veluthambi Dalawa, the great freedom fighter, died. Etymology The name Kadampanad might have been derived from the word \\" khada nadu\\". There is also a belief that this place was occupied by Kadampa dynasty kings and hence the name Kadampanad was derived. History It is mentioned in many literary works of Sangha period like \\"Pathittupathu\\" that Kadampanad was a part of ancient Tamil Nadu. The beautiful architecture of Parakkadavu snanaghatas and kalmandapas, built on the banks of Kallada river, in connection with the Pazhayakavu and Puthiyakavu devi temple of Mannadi are proofs of ancient civilization in this place. Kadampanad was a trade center in the ancient period. Under the Kulashekhara kings, who ruled Travancore with Mahodayapuram as their headquarters, there were many autonomous provinces. Kadampanad was such a province under the control of a Naduvazhi. After the decline of Kulasekhara reign, Kadampanad came under the rule of Venad Kings. Later, Kadamapanad became the part of Kayamkulam territory and when Marthanda Varma formed modern Travancore, it fell under this region. When Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Iyyer was the Divan of Central Travancore, Village uplift unions were formed for the development of villages in Kerala. The village uplift unions were composed of Government nominated representatives. The places come under Kadampanad grama panchayath were part of Kunnathur uplift union at that time. Thonnuram Panthiyil K. Kesavakurup was the president of Kunnathur uplift union. In 1953, when panchayaths formed, panchayath bodies elected by people came into being. The first president of the elected body of Kadampanad panchayath was Koyippurath K. Neelakandan Nair. After the formation of Kerala State, Kadampanad panchayath continued to be a part of Kollam district, under Kunnathur Taluk. In 1983, when Pathanamthitta district was formed, Kadampanad panchayath became a part of it. Geography Kadampanad panchayath covers an area of 23.95 km2. The land is situated in a slanting position from east to west and from south to north. Kallada and Pallickal rivers flow along the south and west sides of the panchayat respectively. The land consists of hilly areas, plains and paddy fields. Paddy, coconut and tapioca were cultivated abundantly in this region. Mannadi and Thuvayoor are two important places in this panchayath. Major portion of Thuvayoor was laid down as a corridor in the east‚Äìwest direction between the Kakkathikkunnu and Pandimalakkunnu. Divisions There are 17 wards in Kadampanad grama panchayath. Demographics As per the latest India census, Kadampanad has a population of 26839 with 12769 males and 14070 females. The literacy rate as per the census data is 92.2% Culture =Religious= The Church of God at Thuvayoor is the first Pentecostal church in Kerala.

Christians from this parish migrated to places like Kayamkulam, Mavelikkara, Kollakadavu, Adoor, Thuvayoor, Kozhenchery, Kaippattoor, Sooranadu, Kallada, Koodal etc., settled there and constructed new churches.

History of Kallooppara The land of Kallooppara was previously known by the name of Perumbranadu, due to its massive storage of rocks and hence being known by the name of 'Perum Parra Nadu', in the previous days and gradually being known as Perumbranad, in the latter days as legend has it. Kallooppara was once the part of Thiruvalla taluk and with the formation of the Pathanamthitta district in 1983, a new taluk was created, Mallapally taluk and Kallooppara became a part of it. It was once governed by the Royalties of the Thekkumkoor Dynasty and Edappally Thampurans (rulers). The Kalari and the fort The old Vemolinad was separated into 'Vadakumkoor' and 'Thekkumkoor' in A.D.1100. Kottayam, Chenganacherry, Thiruvalla, Kanjirapally and some places of high range were included in Thekkumkoor kingdom. Kallooppara was under the control of the Thekkumkoor dynasty. It had Kalari (training center for martial arts) at Kallooppara. The famous Kalari was known as Thekkumkoor fort which existed until recently. The Thekkumkoor army camped here and it was risky for the enemy to attack them. It is said that the King had many close friends in Kallooppara and its surroundings. The Old Nair lord Family at Koipuram in Eraviperoor was in close touch with the Kings. It was this Nair Lord family who had great influence on the king and inspired him to donate Kallooppara sub-division to Edappally dynasty. As the withdrawal of Thekkumkoor kings, Kallooppara came under the Edappally dynasty, which is also known as Elangalloor Swaroopam. The Edappally dynasty has the history of elevation of a temple priest to the royal position of a King. The founder of the Edappally dynasty was a priest of Thrikkakara temple according to the historical evidence and proverbs. Tracing roots to Edappally Kallooppara is known for its religious harmony between all the sects of god loving souls be he a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muslim. Master craftsmen belonging to the Viswakarma clan were brought to Kallooppara from Edappally, and hamlets of the then Thirukochi, now known as Kochi, for parting their craftsmanship in the construction of temples like Kallooppara Devi Kshethram, Thelliyoorkavu, Porittikavu and Kallooppara St Mary's Orthodox Church.https://www.facebook.com/KalloopparaSriBhagavathyTemple CSI CHURCH 1\\\\. CSI St.Stephen's Church - Pariyaram. 2\\\\. CSI St. Peter's Church - Anchilavu Near Puthussery Junction. 3\\\\. CSI St.Stephen's Church - Kallooppara, Water Tank Road St Mary's Orthodox Church In the earlier days the Christian believers of Kallooppara region (Perumpanad district), had to depend on the 'Niranam Church' for the holy mass, funeral ceremonies and other religious rites. The journey on Vallom (small boat) through the Manimala and Pampa rivers was tedious, tiresome and risky. The Edappally Kings were ruling at that time and they used to spend their time in Elangalloor Maddom. a site which once existed on the north side of the river Manimala. An abode for the royal guests that was once equipped with a private pool called the 'Kullipura Mallika' equipped with granite rock paved steps to the Manimala river, can still be seen now in Angadikadavu of Puramattam panchayat. It is said that once while the ruling king of Edappally was having his rest in the Elangalloor Maddom, he happened to see a few number of people coming on a vallom (small boat) singing hymns accompanied by prayers. The king immediately came down to the river bank to observe the sight more closely and found it to be a burial procession, with the body on the floating hearse covered with a white cloth. The procession that started from Manimala was going to Niranam Church for the funeral of the dead, since in those days Niranam Church was the only Christian church in central Travancore. This event moved the Kings heart and having realized the hardship of the Christian subjects, he virtually pointed a plot on the other side of the river, and gave sanction to bury the body and build a tent for worshiping. Sebsequent to the burial of the first dead body on the ground, a handful of Nasranis, mainly \\"Aaruveedan Families took initiative to build a small building that was useful to gather and pray. The Aaruveedan family which was existed in Kalloopara for over 1000 years, had the privilege of building and maintaining this historic church for over 750 years, prior to the time of Adangapurathu family's establishment. The Aaruveedan family stood courageously for the existence of this church despite of many obstacles as a result of religious riots and conflicts up until 1750. It is commonly believed that the founding stone of the church was laid on Malayalam month Karkadakam 3rd of 515 (A.D.1339). The stone day of the church is being celebrated on that day.(For photographs and description cf.The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol.II, 1973, ed. George Menachery)It is also believed that the church has the same age as the origin of Edappally dynasty, the least. The study of the archaeology department also reveals that church was constructed in the 2nd millennium. The sculpture and figure carved in wood also indicates the same. Some letters carved on the slab of holy place of the church also traces back to almost the origin of the church. Though the letters have faded out, they are believed to be of the earlier century. Chengaroor St. George Orthodox Church is the daughter church of kalloopoppara church. Orthodox Church Chengaroor St.George Orthodox Church is the other ancient Church In Kallooppara Panchayath.

The church was formed in Kollavarsham 1085 (A.D 1909) with 27 family members who moved out of the St Mary's Orthodox church due to their strong support to the church reformation movement. This church is situated in the 7th ward of Kallooppara Panchayath. For more details: http://kalloopparastthomasmarthomachurch.org/church_members.php Bethel Mar Thoma Church The history of Mar Thoma Church is an essential part of the history of Christianity in general and that of St. Thomas Christian Community in particular. Bethel Mar Thoma Church, Kallooppara, is one of the Parishes of this great historic Church. Bethel Mar Thoma Church, Kallooppara was established in the year 1912 by forefathers (belonging to 18 families) of strong faith and spirit of renaissance. Ever since 1912, the church has been a luminous candle spreading the message of God's love for human. Community History The families who accepted the new faith From St. Thomas, Disciple (Apostle) of Christ between AD 52 and AD 72, were subjected to much hardship by others at that time and consequently they had to move towards South of Kerala by the end of the 2nd century. Though the Christians devotees of Kallooppara claim their roots to the first century, history dates their arrival and settlement at Kallooppara only from the 9th century onwards. Most of the families migrated from Christian centers like Kuravilangad, Vaikom, Kadambanad etc. Many members from these Christian families further migrated to different parts of Kerala, India, Far East, Middle East, Europe, Africa, Australia, Canada and America; and are valuable contributors in the field of education, science, medicine, engineering, information technology, business, agriculture, religion etc. Demographics India census, Kallooppara had a population of 17719 with 8386 males and 9333 females.

Kavumbhagom is an important junction and part of the Thiruvalla Municipality.Pathanamthitta district website It is also a census village. Kavumbhagom serves as a major road route connecting Changanasserry, Thiruvalla, Chathankerry and Mavelikkara. Thiruvalla Sree Vallabha temple, is very near to Kavumbhagom (0.5km). Also, the junction is gifted with two Hindu Temples, 'Erankavu Bhagavathi Kshetram' and 'Shri Anandeshwa'. This place serves as a major road route connecting Changanasserry, Thiruvalla, Edathua and Mavelikkara. Traditionally, Kavumbhagom was the area around Karunattu Kaavu temple. It was the junction where Tiruvalla-Mavelikkara Road meets Kottayam-Mavelikkara route. As the new road was constructed from Ambili Junction in early 80s, the place which was formerly known as Erankavu started to be known as Kavumbhagom. The former Kavumbhagom Jn. is now called Anchal kutty , thanks to the post box situated there. History The Kaavil market (which is no longer in existence) was once one of the most famous markets of Kerala where there were even foreign trade links. This market was actually situated in the street starting from Erankavu temple to the Kaavil temple in the present Kavumbhagom. Even now the houses in this street are known as \\"Kavilae veedu\\" among their friends and relatives and the houses in the now Pushpagiri-Tholassery area as \\"Malayil\\" because they are on an elevated area compared to Kaavil. It was also the first settlement area of early Christians of Tiruvalla. We can see quotes about this then famous street and its people in the renowned poem \\" Unnuneeli Sandesham\\". This was the heartplace of Thiruvalla up to the 19th Century (East to M C road was forest area. Dens were found in the KSRTC garage area, which are now buried). The first school in Thiruvalla started somewhere in the mid 19th century in Kaavil market, in the road to Pallippalam.

In Koipuram male literacy was at 97.57% while female literacy rate was 97.09%. The native language spoken is Malayalam, though most of the people can understand as well as converse in English. History Koipuram was once a very dense forest area, which were a part of the forests that lead along all the way until Kumbanad. The first occupants of this place was considered to be by the Kovilans, who eloped from Malabar, northern part of Kerala. As the Tippu Sultan, approached northern Kerala for his campaign, some of the generals of the zamorins were instructed to elope to central Kerala to save the lives of the women and children. They at first occupied on the southern bank of the River Pamba, as e preliminary stage of occupancy. They built a temple on that river bank, which they had brought from Malabar when they eloped. This temple is considered to be the present day Idanattidam Devi Temple. Later on, they finalized their occupancy and moved on to the northern bank of the river. They deforested the area and started plantation. Later on, due to the influence of the river, trade flourished on the banks of the river. A daily evening market was held on at the south eastern part of Koipuram, which is supposed to be, the present day Arattupuzha. As trade flourished, the Kovilans became more influential in the area and they were the predominant power in places nearing, present day Aranmula. However, enemies kept on attacking the province due to the crave on wealth and geography. The Kovilans were mightier and invincible than any other force which occupied central Kerala and thus they were not at all laid down by any other province or their army. The place name was then changed to Kovil- puram since the Kovilans occupied it and later as Koipuram. The Kovilans who came thus put their house name as kovilan-veedu and later as konjum veedu. Trade and economy had put on a surge, the Kovilans became much likely to be invincible. With, present day Nellickal as their headquarters, they set for a rule where no one could ever threaten a province. Afterwards, during the Royal British Rule period, they were forced to remain under the jurisdiction of Her Majesty The Queen since they had promised allegiance to the Trivandrum Palace, where now is the present day capital of Kerala. See also: Kumbanad. Palliyodam The Koipuram palliyodam, which was being shared between two Karayogams (karayogam means panchayats in native language), Koipuram and Nellickal for almost 20 years back. Later on, as a part of the conflict between the two places, Nellickal Karayogam conceded to withdraw their share from the Palliyodam cost and Koipuram karayogam owned the palliyodam for themselves from then until now. The past of the palliyodam is well versed throughout the Aranmula premises. It is said that once the Palliyodam has crossed a barrier in front of it, in form of a ridge in the river, without any external help by surging over it. Some say it is supposed to be pure myth while the historians are not yet sure about the incident since there are not much practical evidences rather than some hearsay. The Palliyodam has scored lot more than any other palliyodams, though being in second position to Nedumprayar. The rivalry between these two places extend long back to decades as both of these were the supreme powers in Aranmula boat race for over a period of time. Evidences show that both of these palliyodams are built in a common style named 'ottamanikkaal' which is considered to be a rare form of creation. Landscape Being on the northern bank of the River Pamba, Koipuram provides a marvellous view of landscapes and scenarios. The present day \\"Varattaar\\" which is a seasonal river, is the old course of the River Pamba and has been narrowed due to the introduction of a bridge. The place offers fantastic soothing landscapes and traditions, where it is possible to see a typical Indian village life.

Skartados was a member of the Democratic Party. A resident of the Ulster County hamlet of Milton, where he ran a farm, he was the Assemblyman for the 104th district of the New York State Assembly in the mid-Hudson, which includes both the city and town of Newburgh, the cities of Beacon, and Poughkeepsie, the hamlet of Marlboro, and the town of Lloyd. He defeated 14-year Republican incumbent Thomas J. Kirwan in 2008 for what was then the 100th district, but narrowly lost to him two years later in a contest not formally decided for four months. Kirwan died less than a year into his term, and Skartados won the 2012 special election to fill the seat, the first election held for what was now the redrawn 104th district, which excluded some areas of Ulster County that were heavily Republican. He went on to win the general election that year and re-election in 2014 and 2016. After his death from pancreatic cancer in April 2018, Skartados was succeeded by Jonathan Jacobson. Early life Skartados was born on the Greek island of Astypalaia. He grew up on a small farm which he worked with his father. At age 14, in 1970, Skartados and his mother moved to New York City. Skartados graduated from George Washington High School in upper Manhattan. He later worked in the restaurant industry and eventually owned one. His business savvy eventually allotted him the funds to educate himself at the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he earned a degree in political science. At the same time, he worked at the Commandant's Office of the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, New York. After college, Skartados attained a master's degree in International Studies at the State University of California at Sacramento. He later served an internship at the United Nations Center Against Apartheid. Early career For the next eight years, Skartados worked back at the New York Military Academy as chairman of the Health Department. He also taught Environmental Studies and American History. In 2000, Skartados abdicated his seat at the military academy. Subsequently, Skartados focused on renovating properties in downtown Poughkeepsie, including building the Aegean Entertainment Center, the largest entertainment venue between Albany and New York City. Skartados was the founder and president of the Academy Street Business Association in Poughkeepsie. Skartados helped in the revitalization of the street's business environment, which changed the negative perception of the area. In addition to his work with the Poughkeepsie Partnership ‚Äì a go- between to promote the partnership of business and city government agencies ‚Äì Skartados also served on the mayor's Promotions & Events Committee to help further promote and attract new people to the city of Poughkeepsie. Assembly career His political career began when he defeated 14-year incumbent Thomas Kirwan in 2008. Skartados served the 100th district of the New York State Assembly from 2008 to 2010. However, Kirwan narrowly recaptured the seat in 2010 but died in late 2011. On March 20, 2012, a special election was held for the vacant seat, which Skartados won with more than 60 percent of the vote. He was re-elected for a full term on November 6, 2012, and on November 4, 2014, by 60% of the vote. During his Assembly tenure, Skartados supported bills that focused on the environment, criminal justice reforms, consumer protection, veterans benefits, business regulation reform, family court reform, and library election reform. Skartados secured millions of dollars for struggling schools in Marlboro, Highland and Poughkeepsie. He also helped secure state funding to purchase fire trucks, plows, and police cars, and pursue environmental projects such as the Hudson Valley Rail Trail. Skartados also helped expand non-profit grounds such as soup kitchens, Newburgh Habitat for Humanity, and Newburgh Safe Harbor's Park. He remained in the assembly until his death in April 2018. Personal life and death Skartados had one child at the time of his death. On April 12, 2018, Skartados was hospitalized in Newburgh, New York, with a \\"serious illness\\" and according to his chief of staff was \\"not likely going to recover\\". He died in the hospital three days later, of pancreatic cancer, at age 62. In response to Skartados' death, U.S. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney praised Skartados' \\"legacy as a fighter for the people he loved and a voice for many who had none\\".

It is produced by Scott Sternberg Productions.  Reactions from Star Trek cast members  During the interview with Walter Koenig, Shatner could tell that Koenig was withholding something about how he viewed Shatner. After Shatner persuaded him to continue, Koenig revealed that there had been a feeling on the set of Star Trek that Shatner could get any of them fired, though he never saw Shatner actually follow through on that perceived feeling. Koenig also informed Shatner that while his and other actors' roles may not have been as prominent as Shatner's, Leonard Nimoy's or DeForest Kelley's, there were still contributions they could have made to each scene if Shatner had allowed them to do so. As Koenig put it, they wanted to say to him, \\"Cut the shit, Shatner\\", but did not. Similar to his experience when conducting interviews for Star Trek Memories, Shatner was surprised by this and remorseful, saying that he would have behaved differently if he had known. He then offered to find a role for Koenig on his then current series ($#*!

The investigation's name is a reference to two governing bodies in Illinois: one board controlling the Teacher's Pension System, and the second being the Health Facilities Planning Board. History In summer 2006, Fitzgerald indicated that he was investigating allegations of \\"endemic hiring fraud\\" in state agencies under Blagojevich's control as part of the federal Operation Board Games probe. The effort was characterized at that time as locating \\"a number of credible witnesses\\" but Blagojevich was not accused of any unlawful activities. The May 2007 indictment of Chicago attorney Edward Vrdolyak for his \\"alleged involvement in a kickback scheme concerning the sale of a Chicago Gold Coast neighborhood building was another piece of the \\"Operation Board Games\\" investigation. A total of fifteen individuals have also been indicted in the course of the investigation. The thirteenth indictment, of William F. Cellini, Sr., which is seemingly the last one before Blagojevich and Harris, occurred in October 2008: The focus of the investigation was on Blagojevich, which led to the Rod Blagojevich corruption charges. Blagojevich was convicted on 17 of 20 counts on June 27, 2011. Obama not involved U.S. President Barack Obama (a former senator) is not accused of any wrongdoing nor a target or subject of the investigation, as Fitzgerald has emphasized to the media. The President-elect at the time was not mentioned in the initial indictment, other than the explanation that the vacated Senate seat in question was the one he formerly held. His connections to another target in the investigation, Tony Rezko, who was indicted in September 2006 and convicted in June 2008, have attracted more attention, however. The Obama family purchased a strip of land next to their Chicago house from Rezko's wife. The transaction was legal and at market prices, but occurred after Tony Rezko's initial criminal implications.

Whereas the professional field of music education pertains to the teaching of music in school classrooms or group settings, piano pedagogy focuses on the teaching of musical skills to individual piano students. This is often done via private or semiprivate instructions, commonly referred to as piano lessons. The practitioners of piano pedagogy are called piano pedagogues, or simply, piano teachers.  Professional training  The range of professionalism among teachers of piano is undoubtedly wide. \\"Competent instruction is not always assured by the number of years one has taken lessons\\", warned piano pedagogue and writer of numerous pedagogical books, James Bastien.Bastien, James (3rd Ed. 1988) How to Teach Piano Successfully. Neil A. Kjos Music Co: San Diego, CA. The factors which affect the professional quality of a piano teacher include one's competence in musical performance, knowledge of musical genres, music history and theory, piano repertoire, experience in teaching, ability to adapt one's teaching method to students of different personalities and learning styles, education level, and so on. = Musicians without degrees in piano pedagogy = In the United States, piano lessons may be offered by teachers without higher education specifically focused in piano performance or piano pedagogy. Some teachers may hold degrees in another discipline in music, such as music education or another performance area (voice, orchestral instrument, etc.). Other teachers, without higher education in music, may have studied piano playing independently or have been self-taught. = Undergraduate and graduate studies in piano pedagogy = The field of piano pedagogy may be studied through academic programs culminating in the attainment of a bachelor, master, or doctoral degree at music colleges or conservatories. The undergraduate level may require many years of prior piano studies and previous teaching experience as prerequisites for application. At the graduate level, many schools require applicants to have some teaching experience and at least a bachelor of music or equivalent experience in piano performance and/or pedagogy.University of Michigan Piano Department: Degree programs Although virtually all piano pedagogy programs include a significant portion of performance requirement, the pedagogy major may be distinct from the performance major at some schools. Some members of the latter group may have the option to take courses in the teaching of piano, but not all do. = Professional organizations in the United States = Many piano teachers hold memberships in professional organizations, to maintain their commitment to pedagogy and to network with peers and others in music. These organizations often offer teachers' workshops, conferences, mentorship programs, publications on piano pedagogy, and opportunities for scholarships, competitions, and performances for the students of members. Some prominent organizations in the United States include: * American Council of Piano Performers - ACPP * Music Teachers National Association - MTNA * National Federation of Music Clubs * National Guild of Piano Teachers * Piano Teachers Congress of New York = Professional Organizations in Canada = The main organization that offers certificates and testing curriculum in Canada is Royal Conservatory of Music. There are three levels in their certificate program; elementary, intermediate and advanced. Elementary pedagogy certificate enables teachers to teach beginners up to grade two piano, while intermediate certificate allows teachers to teach up to grade 6 piano. Advanced piano pedagogy is known as \\"ARCT\\" (Associate of Royal Conservatory of Toronto), which enables teachers to teach up to grade 10. There are also a number of theory and history examinations that accompany each certificate program which must be completed. There is also a Piano Teachers Federation based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Citing the influence of Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Carl Orff, √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze, Russian-American piano pedagogue at Longy School of Music, Dr. Faina Bryanskaya, advocates a holistic approach which integrates as many aspects of music-making as possible at once would result in the most effective piano teaching. = Ear training = Dr. Bryanskaya argues that the foremost task for piano teachers at the beginning of a student's study is the introduction of a habit of listening to quality performances of ‚Äúdescriptive and strikingly expressive music‚Äù, as a means for \\"sensitizing [the student] to the meaning of music\\".Bryanskaya, Faina (2nd Ed. 2007). Teaching Fundamentals of Music Making: A Holistic Integrated Approach, A Handbook for Piano and Music Teachers. Brighton, MA (USA). LC 2003-552304. http://www.chipublib.org/search/details/cn/1902269 = Rhythm = Teaching rhythm is important for the student to be able to learn a piece accurately, and also to confidently perform a practiced piece. Developing an internal metronome plays a significant role when teaching rhythm. Teachers may encourage students to count out loud when practicing, or practice with a metronome to develop a steady internal beat. = Notation = Learning to read music is a critical skill for most pianists. There are generally three approaches to teaching students to read music, although combined approaches are increasingly common. The \\"Middle C Method\\", a \\"single note identification\\" method, was the most commonly taught method through the 20th century. It was introduced by W.S.B. Mathews in 1892 but popularized by Thompson's Modern Course for Piano (1936). \\"Middle C\\" teaches positions relative to the middle C; in other \\"single note identification\\" methods, other notes might be used. The \\"intervocalic method\\", developed by Frances Clark with her Time to Begin (1955) curriculum, teaches recognition of patterns, and adds \\"landmark notes\\". The \\"multi-key method\\", developed by Robert Pace and published in 1954, teaches students all major and minor keys fairly quickly. = Technique = Good piano playing technique involves the simultaneous understanding in both the mind and the body of the relationships between the elements of music theory, recognition of musical patterns in notation and at the fingertips, the physical landscape of the entire range of the keyboard, finger dexterity and independence, and a wide range of touch and tone production for a variety of emotional expressions. Skills in all of these areas are typically nurtured and developed for the sake of expressing oneself more effectively and naturally through the sound of the piano, so that the elements of technique will sound alive with musicality. = Improvisation = Modern piano lessons tend to emphasize learning notation, and may neglect developing the creative spirit and sensitive ears which lead to expressive music-making. Studies point to the need for using multiple approaches in learning musical skills which engage both sides of the brain‚Äîthe analytical and the intuitive‚Äîfor students to master all aspects of playing. Therefore, teaching improvisation skills may help students take ownership of the expressive quality of the music they make, and to keep music learning and practicing alive and interesting.Kampmeier, Valerie. \\"Intuitive Improvisation: A Guide for Beginners.\\" American Music Teacher. Dec/Jan 07-08. One way to do so is to make up stories full of different emotions through improvising, in order to reinforce music theory concepts already introduced and to develop a wide range of touch and tone production. Some mainstream piano methods, such as Faber Piano Adventures, have started offering improvisation options. But in most methods, improvisation remains supplemental, with the core curriculum centering around notation, theory, and technique. There are exceptions, such as The Music Tree, where every unit in the core lesson book has an improvisation activity. One playing-based piano method, Simply Music, includes improvisation beginning at the very first lessons and continuing throughout the students' learning experience. = Sight reading = Sight reading heavily depends on the students' ability to understand rhythm, and recognize musical patterns. Teaching sight reading can include teaching students to recognize intervals, scale passage patterns, note reading and the ability to internalize rhythm. The ability to have strong knowledge of different major and minor key signatures can also help students anticipate the accidentals they should expect when sight reading. = Memorization = Memorization is useful to perform a piece confidently. It gives the student ability and freedom to experience the music for all of its intricacies as opposed to focusing on the technicalities of notes and rhythm. Memorization can come easily to some students, and harder for others. The most common memorization technique is muscle memory. However reliance on muscle memory alone can hinder students if they have not made the cognitive connection between every note they play, and leaves room for many memory slips. To have a strong foundation of memorization, students should be able to visualize everything that they play, and be able to start from any passage. Effective memorization results from the \\"combination of visual, kinaesthetic, aural and analytical skills\\".Chappell, Sally. \\"Developing the complete pianist: a study of the importance of a whole- brain approach to piano teaching.\\" Piano Journal, Winter 2000. = Repertoire = Well-known keyboard works written with special attention for pedagogical purposes in mind include:Braudo, Isaiah.

Instructions may sometimes be offered semi-privately (one teacher meeting with a small group of two or more students) or in classes of larger groups, in other intervals of time. Piano lessons are offered in a variety of different settings, including the following:Ulszer, Marienne (1995). The Well-Tempered Keyboard Teacher.

A member of the Namibia national football team, Mbaha competed at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, playing against Ghana and Guinea, and was capped 36 times by Namibia. Mbaha has been deaf since the age of seven. He also plays chess. Club career Having started his career at African Stars in 1998, Mbaha joined fellow Namibia Premier League side Blue Waters in 2003, where he won the Namibia Premier League in his first season at the club. Following a further two years at the club, Mbaha joined South African Premier Division side Black Leopards in 2006, and became a regular player at the club in the early parts of the season. However, he left Black Leopards in January 2007 when his contract with the club was not renewed, having made 8 appearances for the club. In the summer of 2007, he returned to Namibia, signing for Namibia Premier League side Orlando Pirates. He remained at Orlando Pirates for a year and won the Namibia Premier League with the club, the club's first ever title. In August 2008, Mbaha joined South African side Maritzburg United. However, his appearances at the club were limited and he was back-up to American goalkeeper Hunter Gilstrap for most of the season, and made just 3 league appearances as a result. Mbaha would eventually return to Orlando Pirates in the summer of 2009. Mbaha joined Ramblers in the summer of 2010, and remained at the club for two years, before joining United Africa Tigers in 2012. Mbaha rejoined his first club African Stars in 2013, where he would remain until the end of his career. Mbaha won the Namibia Premier League for the third time in the 2014‚Äì15 season, and he also won the Best Goalkeeper of the Season award for that season. He left the club at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. International career Mbaha made his debut for the Namibia national football team on 19 March 2005 in an international friendly match against Lesotho, in which Namibia won 2‚Äì1. His first competitive international appearance came the following month in a COSAFA Cup match against Botswana where despite a penalties defeat to Botswana, Mbaha was praised for his performance. He would become a regular player for Namibia, appearing in the 2006 and 2007 COSAFA Cup tournaments, as well as the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, as Namibia qualified for only their second major tournament of their history, alongside multiple international friendlies. Mbaha was part of the Namibia squad at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, and though he missed the opening game of the tournament as they were defeated 5‚Äì1 by Morocco, he appeared in their 1‚Äì0 defeat to Ghana and a 1‚Äì1 draw with Guinea as Namibia were eliminated in the group stage. During 2008, Mbaha went on to appear in the 2008 COSAFA Cup as well as Namibia's failed 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification bid. Mbaha would remain a regular player for Namibia until 2011, where he would be displaced from his regular place in Namibia's team by Ephraim Tjihonge. He would make one final appearance for Namibia in 2014, in a 1‚Äì0 friendly defeat at home to Ghana, where he would fail to control a back-pass, resulting in a Namibia defeat.

Edava is located 5km North of Varkala city centre, 5km from Varkala Beach and 49km north-west of state capital city Trivandrum. Kappil located in Edava Panchayat is one the major tourist destination in Kerala.  History  Edava was the frontier of the erstwhile Province of Travancore: Venad. This village is on the northwest boundary of Thiruvananthapuram district adjacent to the Arabian Sea and situated between two municipalities, Varkala to the south and Paravur to the north. The railway line between Trivandrum and Kollam passes through this village. Edava may be the only village in Kerala with two railway stations: Edava and Kappil. There is a road (TA Majeed Road) connecting Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram. Edava has witnessed important historical events in Kerala. Historical references show that during the rule of Queen Umayamma one \`Mughal Sardar' attacked Venad in the year 1680. His reign extended from the South of Thovala to Edava. In the year 1726, Queen of Attingal gave permission to the British East Indian Company to build a Pandakasaala (warehouse) near what is now called Vettakkada, close to the Arabian Sea. But even before the setting up of this Pandakasaala, Denmark traders had constructed a trading hub over there. K P Padmanabha Menon, in his seminal work, Kerala History, has quoted English army captain Alexander Hamilton as saying that during the first leg of 18th century: \\"Here on the beach side, Denmark traders have a small warehouse with coconut-thatched roof. It is in a dilapidated condition. Their trading, likewise, is nominal.\\" This location at Vettakkada is still named Paandiyala, a worn-out usage of Paandakasaala, which is the Malayalam for warehouse. The first printing press in the erstwhile Travancore, or perhaps in Kerala, with facility to print in Arabic script, was established in Edava in 1936. It was called Coronation Memorial Press and was situated at what is now called Press Mukku. Its establishment coincided with the coronation ceremony of Travancore King. Orders for books, in Arabic, used to come from even far- flung places such as the present-day Pakistan. Edava is the birthplace of late T A. Majeed, who was the PWD Minister in the first Communist Ministry of 1957. He was known for his impeccable political career minus any blemishes. Edava's secular credentials are impeccable and sublime, with Hindus and Muslims living shoulder to shoulder without making any ripples in the placid social waters of this pristine coastal village. There is no wonder because the village is just a microcosm of a larger Kerala. Edavites, cutting across religious affiliations, are used to wake up to devotional songs from temples and call for prayers from mosques. Edavites, cutting across religious belief, enjoy major temple festivals in the village with all fervor and gaiety, without providing any room for nefarious communal elements to disturb this glorious tradition. Of particular mention is the temple festival of Palakkav Temple.  Geography  Kappil Beach & Estuary Arabian Sea view from the Redhills, Vettakada Demographics India census, Edava had a population of 26,903, with 12,292 males and 14,611 females. While some people eke out a living through fishing, a majority of Edavites migrate to the Middle East countries in search of jobs, and a few find their livelihood in private sector. Edava has had a tradition of its people migrating to countries like Singapore and Malaysia in the 18th and 19th century and this trend still continues even today, though to the Gulf region. Transportation The main road of Edava is TA Majeed Road, which connects Varkala to Paravur through Edava. Edava has two railway stations, one is Edavai railway station and the other is Kappil railway station. Edava may be probably the only village in Kerala with two railway stations. The railway line which connects Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam passes through Edava. The nearest main railway station is Varkala Railway Station which is having stops for almost 90% trains and it is the most important station between Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station and Kollam Junction railway station. Varkala Railway Station is just 3 km away from Edava. The nearest airport is Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, 55 km from Edava.

A large number of dogs wander the streets of Pulluvila to eat chicken waste dumped by hotels. Many children were attacked in the past also. Kochouseph Chittilappilly is the chairman of the Stray Dog Free movement, which advocates action against the risks allegedly posed by stray dogs in Kerala, including the amendment of legislation forbidding the killing of these dogs. The movement has pointed to the danger of rabies and referred to stray dogs as a \\"menace\\". Chittilappilly has staged hunger strikes to protest this legislation, and what he claims is governmental failure to address this issue. He has stated that the government's actions amount to valuing stray dogs over human lives and property. He has encouraged citizens to pressure the government to amend these laws, and to kill stray dogs themselves despite the accompanying 50-rupee fine. Chittilappilly has been arrested under statutes preventing cruelty to animals after tying four stray dogs in front of a police station. The movement is related to governmental plans to cull stray dogs which have prompted an international campaign to \\"Boycott Kerala Tourism\\". Opponents of the Stray Dog Free movement have argued that vaccination and spay/neuter campaigns are a more effective and humane method of controlling the stray dog population. Members of the Stray Dog Free movement have alleged that opposition is being funded by rabies vaccine manufacturers.

Adept and prolific in Russian-to-English translation, Pearce was regarded at the time of his death as \\"one of the most acute scholars of Russian history and British communism never to have held an academic post.\\" Early years Pearce was born in Weymouth, Dorset on 9 May 1915. His father was an upwardly mobile engineer, his mother a domestic servant of Irish extraction. Brian was their only child, a shy and precocious boy, poor at athletics and not popular among his peers.Terry Brotherstone, \\"In Memoriam: Brian Pearce (8 May 1915 ‚Äì 25 November 2008): Personal and Political Reflections,\\" Revolutionary Russia, v. 22, no. 1 (June 2009), pg. 82. His father's growing prosperity allowed Brian the freedom to travel. In 1931 he went to Germany and in 1933 to France, where he further developed the language skills he had learned in school.Brotherstone, \\"In Memoriam: Brian Pearce,\\" pg. 82. Although his parents were Tories, Brian's father investigated a few early issues of the Communist Party of Great Britain's organ, The Daily Worker, which Brian read thoroughly. He was also greatly influenced by an uncle who worked as a railwayman and was a partisan of the socialist Independent Labour Party. Brian also read various books and pamphlets he purchased on his own from a radical bookseller on Charing Cross Road. Brian briefly worked for a company that produced trade journals before going away to University College London in 1934. While a history student there, he joined the Communist Party.Terry Brotherstone, \\"Obituary: Brian Pearce,\\" The Guardian, 11 December 2008. https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/11/brian-pearce-obituary-communist- history Pearce had been expected to get a first in History and win a scholarship to further pursue his research in the Tudor period, en route to a career in academia, but instead received an upper second on his last exam. His only choice if he was to proceed on a PhD program would be to work under the close direction of a supervisor on a topic not of his own choosing. He laboured at that unpleasant task for two years before discovering that another person was almost finished plowing the same research ground, making award of a PhD unlikely.Brotherstone, \\"In Memoriam: Brian Pearce,\\" pg. 84. Pearce henceforth chose a different path. Career Pearce married for the first time in 1939 to a party comrade, Lilla Fox. The pair had three children before separating in the late 1940s. Pearce was drafted into the military early in 1940 and stationed in the north of England. His wartime experiences were uneventful. After being demobilised, Pearce went to work in the civil service, where he learned Russian.Brotherstone, \\"In Memoriam: Brian Pearce,\\" pg. 85. He subsequently left the civil service to work in various Communist Party-related capacities, including as a member of the staff of The Daily Worker, for the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Society, and as a teacher of English at various East European embassies in London. In 1953, Pearce joined a delegation of the British-Soviet Friendship Society and travelled to the Soviet Union. He was also a member of the Communist Party Historians Group, which conducted serious historical research into various questions of the British labour movement. Pearce's world was rocked by the so-called Secret Speech delivered by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1956. The revelations about the violent and criminal behaviour of Joseph Stalin's regime divided the CPGB between those who favoured becoming truly independent and thoroughly democratised and others who disregarded Khrushchev's revelations as hysterical and overblown and having no real relation to the situation facing the Communist Party in the UK. Pearce began contributing to an opposition journal, The Reasoner, which was terminated just as the Soviet invasion of Hungary took place. This event created an even wider fissure in the British Communist Party, ending in September 1957 with Pearce's expulsion from the CPGB. After being expelled from the Communist Party, Pearce turned to Trotskyism as a member of the Socialist Labour League, a membership he retained for many years. Pearce became a professional translator to make ends meet. He was skilled at his craft, combining accuracy with a highly readable style, and was a three-time winner of the Scott Moncrieff Prize for his work. Death and legacy Pearce died on 25 November 2008. He was 93 years old. At the time of his death, he was described as \\"one of the most acute scholars of Russian history and British communism never to have held an academic post.\\" His papers are in the process of being catalogued at Aberdeen University, which will hold the Brian Pearce Archive.Brotherstone, \\"Obituary: Brian Pearce,\\" The Guardian.

He was the founder of both the Witchcraft Research Center which was a part of MI6's war against Nazi Germany, and the Museum of Witchcraft. He was a friend of both Gerald Gardner, who was the founder of Wicca, and also of the notorious occultist Aleister Crowley. Biography =Early life= Williamson was born in Paignton, Devon.The Museum of Witchcraft, page 2 His father was a senior officer in the Royal Navy and was posted abroad. He first encountered witchcraft in 1916, when, on a visit to North Bovey, also in Devon, to visit his uncle, a local vicar, he saw a woman being publicly beaten and accused of being a witch. Williamson tried to defend the woman, and in doing so befriended her. In 1921, whilst at the boarding school Malvern College, Williamson was bullied, but got help from a woman who lived on the school grounds, who was also a witch. She showed him how to cast a spell on the bully, who soon after broke his leg in a skiing accident and stopped bullying Cecil. During Summer holidays, Williamson often went to visit Dinard in France with his grandmother and her friend Mona Mackenzie. Mackenzie was a spirit medium, and she taught Williamson about divination. =Life in Rhodesia= After studying in college, Williamson travelled to Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) to grow tobacco, where his servant, Zandonda, taught him about African magic. =Life in Britain= In 1930, Williamson returned to Britain and moved to London, where he began working as a production assistant at several film studios. As a hobby, he continued to investigate the occult, beginning to collect objects and became an acquaintance of Margaret Murray, Montague Summers and Aleister Crowley. In 1933, he married Gwen Wilcox, a make-up artist, and niece of film director Herbert Wilcox. =World War II= In 1938, MI6 hired Williamson to investigate the Nazi's occult interests, and in doing so he formed the Witchcraft Research Center. An April 1944 news report, while not mentioning the Witchcraft Research Center, reflects their area of expertise in claiming Goebbels was going to 'harness fortune telling, astrology, and necromancy to his propaganda machine'. =Gardner and the Museum= In 1946, Williamson met Gerald Gardner in the Atlantis Bookshop in London at a talk which Gardner was giving. The two became friends largely due to their mutual interest in the theory of the pagan witch cult. In 1947, Williamson tried to open a museum about witchcraft in Stratford-on-Avon, but was forced to change his plans after local opposition. In 1948, Williamson bought a dilapidated windmill at Castletown on the Isle of Man. He turned it into the Folklore Center of Superstition and Witchcraft, and opened it in 1949, along with an adjacent restaurant, the Witches' Kitchen. Williamson employed Gardner to be the 'resident witch' at the museum, which had been renamed the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft after the repeal of the 1735 Witchcraft Act in 1951. However, Williamson and Gardner's relationship began to fall apart, and Williamson wanted to return to England. So in 1952 he sold the museum to Gardner, and moved all his artefacts to a new site, in Windsor, renaming it the Museum of Witchcraft. Gardner, using his own artefact collection, continued to run the museum on the Isle of Man for the rest of his life. At Windsor, Williamson's museum remained open for a year, and was quite successful, but was again forced out due to local opposition. In 1954 he therefore moved the museum to Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire. Here, the museum was damaged in an arson attack, and so, in 1960, Williamson moved the museum to Boscastle in Cornwall, where it remains to this day. =Final years= At midnight on 31 October 1996, Williamson sold the museum to Graham King. Williamson retained some of his artefacts (but none that were on display in the museum) at his home in [Witheridge], a small village near to Tiverton in Devon. After his death in 1999 much of his private collection was acquired by the museum.

It is occasionally found in the aquarium trade and is also of minor importance to local commercial fisheries. It grows to a total length of . Description This hawkfish reaches to a maximum total length of about . The dorsal fin has ten spines and eleven soft rays, while the anal fin has three spines and six soft rays. There is considerable variation in the colouring both among adults and as a result of changes during growth. The main colour is usually yellowish but there is a broad black or dark brown lateral band, mainly on the rear half of the body. The sides of the head and the front of the body are whitish or grey, with red speckles. In Asia, juveniles may be reddish dorsally, while in Oceania they tend to have golden-green upper parts and white underparts. Distribution The species is native to the tropical and sub-tropical Indo- Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea to Japan, New Caledonia and Australasia. In Australia its range extends from the northwest of Western Australia round the north of the country to the border of Queensland and New South Wales. It is found on the seaward side of reefs and on soft-bottomed lagoons to depths of and more. Ecology The black-sided hawkfish is an ambush predator; it usually lies in wait on a head of coral, propped up by its stiff pectoral fins, ready to dart out at passing crustaceans or small fish. It is mainly a solitary fish, but may be seen in pairs or may form small harems with one dominant male and several females. Like other members of the family, it is a sequential hermaphrodite; adults start life as females but the largest female in a group changes sex to a male if that position is vacated.

Selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) are historically and typically steroidal in structure while selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs) are typically nonsteroidal. The combined abbreviation of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist and modulator is SEGRAM. A number of such ligands have been developed and are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical testing. SEGRAMs achieve their selectivity by triggering only a subset the glucocorticoid receptor mechanisms of action.  History  Synthetic steroids with SEGRA-like properties were already discovered in the late 1990s. During the 2000s, many potential SEGRAMs were synthesized, most of them having nonsteroidal structures. In in vitro studies in cellular models these SEGRAM molecules bind to the glucocorticoid receptor with an affinity similar to dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, and with an ability to repress the production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 6 and prostaglandin E2. Moreover, in vitro a particular SEGRAM can promote apoptosis in prostate cancer and leukemia. In vivo studies in mice and rats showed that a topically administered SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking. Current preclinical tests show that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.  Mechanism of action  The benzopyranoquinoline A 276575, an example of a SEGRA with a more corticosteroid-like structure Both non-selective glucocorticoids and selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR to work through (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR in such a way that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways. In the absence of glucocorticoids, the GR resides in the cytosol in an inactive state complexed with heat shock proteins (HSPs) and immunophilins. Binding of glucocorticoids to the GR activates the receptor by causing a conformational change in the GR and thus a dissociation of the bound HSPs. The activated GR can then regulate gene expression via one of two pathways: ;Transactivation: The first (direct) pathway is called transactivation whereby the activated GR dimerizes, is translocated into the nucleus and binds to specific sequences of DNA called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). The GR/DNA complex recruits other proteins which transcribe downstream DNA into mRNA and eventually protein. Examples of glucocorticoid- responsive genes include those that encode annexin A1, TSC22D3 (also known as GILZ), angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase and other anti- inflammatory proteins. ;Transrepression: The second (indirect) pathway is called transrepression, in which activated monomeric GR binds to other transcription factors such as NF-Œ∫B and AP-1 and prevents these from up- regulating the expression of their target genes. These target genes encode proteins such as cyclooxygenase, NO synthase, phospholipase A2, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor beta, ICAM-1, and a number of other pro- inflammatory proteins. Simplified overview of the mechanism of action of a classical glucocorticoid vs the mechanism of action of a SEGRAM Hence the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids results from both transactivation and transrepression. In contrast, studies in rats and mice have shown that most of the side effects of glucocorticoids, such as diabetogenic activity, osteoporosis, as well as skin atrophy, are mainly caused by transactivation. A selective glucocorticoid that is able to transrepress without transactivation should preserve many of the desirable therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects and minimize these particular undesired side effects. Initial evidence that transpression alone can be sufficient for an anti-inflammatory response was provided by introducing a point mutation in the GR of mice that prevented GR from dimerizing and binding to DNA and thereby blocking transactivation. At the same time, this mutation did not interfere with transrepression. While GR is essential for survival, these mice are still viable. However, when these mice were treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, there was no elevation of glucose. These dexamethasone-treated mice were resistant to an inflammatory stimulus. Hence, these mice were responsive to the anti- inflammatory effects of dexamethasone but were resistant to at least some of the side effects. Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and activate GR. However, in contrast to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in such a way that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.  Clinical trials  Phase II clinical trials with one of the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK 245186), started in summer 2009. One was a double blind dose finding study for an ointment against atopic dermatitis conducted by Intendis, a part of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals specialized on dermatology. A Phase III trial started in November 2010, evaluating an ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery, conducted by Bausch & Lomb. A phase II trial with another dissociated glucocorticoid fosdagrocorat (PF-04171327) (a phosphate ester prodrug of dagrocorat (PF-00251802)) for rheumatoid arthritis was started in 2011 by Pfizer. The results of these clinical trials have not yet been disclosed and no SEGRAM has as yet been approved for clinical use.  Potential applications  In chronic inflammatory diseases like atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),..., the side effects of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It remains to be seen whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.  Beneficial atrophic effects  Of note, the atrophic effects of glucocorticoids are not always a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances have shown that the former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.  Chemistry  RU 24858, a SEGRA with steroid structure An octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivative with SEGRA properties Early SEGRAs were synthetic steroids. An example is RU 24858, one of the first compounds of this type to be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A 276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives. All of these compounds have been shown to exhibit SEGRA properties in cellular or in animal models. Mapracorat is one of a number of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less obviously steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples of this group are ZK 216348 and 55D1E1. The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity. 450px List of SEGRMs * Dagrocorat (PF-00251802, PF-251802) * Fosdagrocorat (PF-04171327, PF-4171327) * Mapracorat (BOL-303242-X, ZK-245186)  See also  * Selective receptor modulator * Selective androgen receptor modulator * Selective estrogen receptor modulator * Selective progesterone receptor modulator  References  Anti-inflammatory agents Immunosuppressants Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators ","title":"Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator"},{"id":"20679818","text":"Kulathummal is a village in Thiruvananthapuram district in the state of Kerala, India.

Early career Jim Lewis was born in Hammond, Indiana. He graduated from Indiana State University with a BS in Accounting in 1984. He became a Certified Public Accountant. He later earned his MBA from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University in 1992. In August 1984, Lewis began his first job as an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers where he quickly developed a reputation as a top-notch and versatile professional, and was rewarded with prestigious assignments in audit, tax, and consulting. While at PwC, Lewis passed the examination to become a Certified Public Accountant. After a short period, PricewaterhouseCoopers promoted James Lewis to Senior Accountant. In September 1986, Lewis accepted a job as Manager of Internal Audit for Tokheim Corporation, a multinational company that manufactures fluid movement and measuring devices in Fort Wayne, Indiana. At Tokheim, Lewis directed all financial and operational audits; assisted senior management in the evaluation of acquisition candidates, participated in strategic planning sessions and made numerous recommendations to management; which reduced operating costs, improved operating efficiency, and reduced outside audit fees. In November 1988, Lewis became employed by PepsiCo in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he quickly advanced to the position of Senior Manager, Planning and Analysis. In April 1993, PepsiCo promoted Lewis to Director, Investor Relations. During his tenure as Director, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York ranked PepsiCo‚Äôs Investor Relations function number one in America. In December 1994, PepsiCo promoted Lewis to Area Vice President of the New York, New York regions. In his capacity as Area Vice President, Lewis developed regional snack food businesses for Frito-Lay as general manager and turnaround specialist. He was responsible for the sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and warehouse functions of the Company. He directed an organization of one hundred fifty- five (155) people, including fifteen (15) direct reports. Under his leadership, the businesses experienced a 13% sales increase and a 15% profit increase. The New York region went from last place (out of 22 areas) to first place during his first year as one of the general managers. His team received the company‚Äôs Herman Lay Award for having the highest region score on combined revenue growth, profit growth, and product display execution. In late 1995 Lewis, who was demoted from Vice President, was assigned to the Houston North Zone Region as a Zone Sales Manager. He supervised 13 District Managers and over 100 route sales representatives. Due to problems created by Lewis within the first six months of his tenure, he was moved to the Frito-Lay main office in Houston until he resigned in 1996.

In some parts of its range, it is overhunted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a \\"vulnerable species\\". Description The Chinese goral is intermediate between an antelope and a goat and grows to a shoulder height of and length of . It is stockily built with long, stout limbs and broad hooves. The horns are short and conical and the ears fairly long and pointed. The four teats are in contrast to sheep and goats which normally have two. The coat consists of a short, dense under layer and an upper layer of longer, semierect, coarse guard hairs. The colour is somewhat variable, ranging from pale grey to dark brown or reddish brown. A dark stripe runs along the back and the throat and underparts are pale. Distribution and habitat The Chinese goral is native to parts of southeastern Asia. Its range extends from northeastern India, Myanmar and northwestern Thailand, through northern Vietnam and possibly northern Laos, to most of China apart from the extreme north and west. It is a mountain species and is found in rugged, inaccessible areas, on steep slopes and plateaus, normally staying in rocky areas, but sometimes venturing into nearby evergreen-deciduous forest and mixed woodland. Behaviour Chinese gorals live in small groups of up to 12 individuals, though older males are usually solitary. They are wary and retiring, spending their time on high rocky slopes where they can evade such predators as the wolf and leopard. They move to lower ground in winter. They browse predominately on twigs and leaves of bushes, but also consume grass, nuts, and acorns. Breeding takes place in late spring when one or two kids are born after a gestation period of about 215 days. The young can walk soon after birth and are weaned in the autumn, remaining with the mother throughout the winter. Status The chief threat faced by the Chinese goral is hunting. Animals are killed for their meat and fur and also for medicine. Part of their range is in protected areas where they should be safe, but elsewhere populations are declining. This is thought to be due to overhunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the Chinese goral as being a \\"vulnerable species\\".

With its distinctive gold finish, this was to be the ultimate Brough Superior but production was stopped by the outbreak of War in 1939. Development Animation of the engine (not to scale) Designed as a team effort by Brough, 'Ike' Hatch, and Freddie Dixon, the engine has two horizontally opposed flat twins one above the other and geared together, thus rotating counter to each other forming an H engine. Connecting rods from opposed cylinders were of the fork and blade type and thus shared a common crank pin. All pistons moved in unison, that is to the left or to the right at the same time. The pistons could thus be counterweighted 100% yielding a perfect balance. Primary, secondary and higher-order sources of vibration canceled each other, as did the gyroscopic effects from each crankshaft.Motorcycle Engineering by P.E. Irving, Temple Press Limited, London, Pages 284 and 285. George Brough described it a \\"flat vertical\\" engine. The four cylinders were equating to 988 cc, with the camshafts gear- driven. Further development work was done on the engine, reconfiguring it as (998cc), with chain-driven camshafts. Golden Dream engine The engine was a four stroke engine. The frame was designed to accommodate the unusual engine and was welded together with a fully sprung plunger type springing for the rear wheel, unlike the cantilever swingarm suspension on the Brough Superior SS100. The forks were Brough Superior's \\"Castle\\" forks derived from a Harley- Davidson design, and many components such as the petrol tank, saddle and wheels were the same as standard Brough Superior machines. The Dream had optional three or four speed transmission, manufactured to Brough's own design by David Brown Ltd. of Huddersfield. The final shaft drive had an underslung worm and pinion gear on the rear axle and the propeller shaft was enclosed in a tube. Exhibition and pre-production The Golden Dream was exhibited at the Earls Court motorcycle show in London in 1938. Five Golden Dreams were produced during 1939 and another model was planned for exhibition at Olympia; but World War II was declared in September 1939 and the Brough works were turned over to the war effort, making components for Rolls-Royce. Brough Superior never returned to motorcycle production. Surviving Golden Dreams At least one Dream is running and is owned by John Wallis (the chairman of the Brough Superior Club, Nottingham, England). Two others are under restoration. A Brough Superior Dream was on display at the British National Motorcycle Museum. Like many exhibits it was destroyed in a fire in 2003 but has since been largely restored, although it has never run, as there are no internals in the engine or gearbox.

The cabinet then resigned on March 4, one day before the vote of no confidence was to take place.http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/19/africa/ME-GEN-Kuwait-Health- Minister.php =Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah, June 2007= MPs Musallam Al-Barrak, Abdulla Al-Roumi, and Adel Al-Saraawi grilled the minister, who then resigned before a no-confidence vote could be held. =Health Minister Maasuma Al-Mubarak, August 2007= On August 25, 2007, Faisal Al-Muslim Al-Otaib and Islamist MP Waleed AlŸÄTabtabaie submitted to Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi a motion to grill Health Minister Maasouma Al- Mubarak following the August 23 Jahra Hospital fire which led to the death of two elderly patients. However, the minister resigned before she could be grilled. The first angle of the grilling accused Dr Maasouma of committing violations in the Foreign Medical Treatment Department and toying with ministerial law 2007/25 issued by the minister after assuming office. Indicating according to the law only those patients suffering from diseases for which treatment is not available in Kuwait can be sent for treatment abroad according to the recommendation of a specialized panel of doctors and the physicians in charge of the patient, the MPs said in their grilling motion \\"as per the law the Health Minister and undersecretaries of health cannot interfere in the decision.

They were signed to Spinefarm Records. They released four studio albums. Background myGRAIN formed in 2004. The band roster was Tommy Tuovinen (vocals), Resistor (rhythm guitar), Jonas (bass), and Matthew (guitar) from their former band, New Science Band. DJ Locomotive (drums) and Eve Kojo (Keyboards) joined the band prior to the record deal with Spinefarm Records. The band produced two self-financed demos. The second, The Red Frame, resulted in a record deal with Spinefarm Records. They released their debut album Orbit Dance in April 2006. The debut album consisted of eleven songs of modern metal ‚Äì demonstrating both Nordic and American melodic death metal in its song construction. The band toured heavily in Finland to promote the release of Orbit Dance. During this time they continued to record new songs and in February 2008 they released their second album Signs of Existence. The album has developed myGRAIN's rough but melodic sound into deeper and more confident style. On January 12, 2011, myGRAIN released their self-titled album. In the beginning of 2013 they announced new album Planetary Breathing, to release in April. A little later the album was pushed back by 5 months to September due to disagreements with their label. Planetary Breathing became the final myGRAIN album. The band broke up in May 2015 on Facebook saying \\"All this has taken its toll on the band and for a long time, especially after all the problems we had with the release of ‚ÄúPlanetary Breathing‚Äù, we have struggled with the question whether we still have the fire and the strength to go on...we will most definitely continue making music in our separate projects.\\" A new post appeared on the myGRAIN Facebook page on October 26, 2018, with a YouTube link to a new myGRAIN song called \\"Lightless\\". It is one of 3 new tracks that will be released on an EP in November 2018.

It is commonly known as the Assumption Grotto Church. The church was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1990 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Architecture The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church Complex consists of multiple structures: the church, a convent, a rectory, a cemetery, and the grotto, along with a utilitarian boiler house. A gymnasium and activity building, constructed in the 1960s lies behind the convent behind a vacant area which was previously occupied by a school building. The church is a basilica-plan Neo-Gothic structure, faced with limestone and occupies the middle of the property facing Gratiot Avenue. The interior of the church includes altars and communion rails of Italian marble and stained glass windows illustrating scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary and the saints. The rectory dates to 1918 and lies to the south of the church with the convent to the north dating from the early 1920s. Both are constructed of red brick along with the modest boiler house located next to the convent. A cemetery with a variety of monuments spanning from the early 19th century to the present lies east, to the rear of the church. A large statue of Our Lady of Lourdes stands on the grounds facing Gratiot. Near the rear of the cemetery is the grotto. The shrine is constructed from imported limestone. Boulders placed around the shrine (as well as in the cemetery) were carried by farmers from all parts of Michigan. Some of the stones and many of the limestone pieces are carved with names and dedications. History Side elevation of church When German immigrants first came to Detroit in 1830, they arrived in the middle of a cholera epidemic. Avoiding the city, they traveled north along Gratiot, settling in an area where a handful of French Roman Catholics already lived. The Germans established a small settlement named Connor's CreekAssumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church Complex from Detroit1701.org and built a log church at the site where this church now stands. They called the building Kirchen Wald (Church in the Woods), and Redemptionist missionaries offered Roman Catholic services in the structure. The name was later changed to \\"Chapel of the Assumption\\" and later \\"St. Mary's in the Woods\\" before being designated the \\"Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church.\\" In 1847, Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church was designated a parish‚Äîonly the second in what is now Detroit. In 1852, the first full-time pastor, Father Amandus Van Den Driessche from Flanders, Belgium, was assigned to the church. He began building a permanent brick structure, which was completed by the end of 1852 and sat 500. In 1876, Vandendriessche visited France, and was so impressed by the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes that he had a replica of the grotto, designed by Peter Dederichs, created at the church. The grotto was completed in 1881. On April 30, 1882, Pope Leo XIII signed a proclamation granting partial and plenary indulgences for anyone who visited the Grotto and prayed for the propagation of the faith. As Detroit grew in the early 20th century, so did the parish. When the 1852 church burned, construction began on a third church in 1907. However, the population continued to grow. To meet the needs of the larger congregation, the Detroit architect Aloys Frank Herman (in a solo work apart from his longterm partnership Herman and Simons) designed the current church that was built in 1928-1929. and dedicated on September 22, 1929. The parish today As a result of the fame of the shrine, the Church of the Assumption began to be known as Assumption Grotto. Mass is held daily, with Tridentine Latin Masses every day and both Tridentine and Ordinary Form Masses on weekends and holidays.

Series 1 was produced by RDF Television. The first premiered on 3 September 2007 on BBC One and was presented by Caroline Flack and Reggie Yates. It was filmed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil. Synopsis The adventurers arrive on Scorpion Island and are divided into teams, known as Sting and Claw. Each team consists of five members each for a total of ten adventurers. Over the following three weeks the teams are required to complete various challenges in order to gain various advantages throughout the game, such as extra time. The final objective is to be the first team to escape from the island. During the second week the teams collect Powerplayers for headstarts in the final challenge to escape from the island. On the third week contestants have to use their Powerplayers to gain time advantages. In season 1 the scores were Claw on 3 and Sting on 1. The final challenge was Shadow Mountain Highway. Claw got a 2-minute headstart and eventually won, since Sting's Kyran and Oscar received minor injuries while climbing. Series 1 also aired in Canada in January 2009 and was broadcast on YTV (TV channel).

Sent Kyran to Claw *Double Trouble - Two people from each team walk on a zip line while trying to connect ends of their team colored flag to the zip line. Claw won this challenge. *Landing on Water - Two people from each team search for glow sticks inside a half sunken plane wreck. Sting won this challenge. *Colourfall - Three people from each team must collect team coloured balls as they climb against a torrent of white water up a raging waterfall. Claw won this challenge. *Bike Lane - Two people from each team go one at a time trying to bike across an extremely thin lane 20 metres above one of Scorpion Island's deepest gorges. Claw won this challenge. *Stacked - Teams race head to head to build enormous totem poles, one person on a rope staking the pieces of the pole and the others pulling other ropes to move him/her around. *Reverse Bungees - All of both teams are attached to bungees. Two of each team, are raised up. *Note: This isn't necessarily a challenge, it was the way of swapping two players of each team to the other team. For more, see above (Contestants). *A Bridge Too Far - Two people from each team on at a time attempt to cross a rickety bridge which is missing huge parts and falls down on one side quite often. Sting won this at first, but Claw used their 'take away' powerplay, and took away some of their time and therefore won. *Landslide! - Two people from each team race up a raging mudslide, with mud, steam, smoke and huge boulders in their way. Crashing into each other each time one person falls. Sting won this at first, but Claw used their 'mystery' powerplay, swapping the two teams' times and therefore won. *Canopy Crawl - One person from each team will race head-to-head crawling across a zip-line. Sting won at first, but Claw used their powerplay 'repeat' and on the second time, Claw won. This was, arguably, inevitable, as Sting's Joe had to win the first time to keep himself in the game: at this point Claw's Ayesha could choose not to deploy Repeat if she won first time. Having hardly tried the first time, Ayesha flew across, trouncing an exhausted Joe. *Highway/Shadow Mountain - To win the teams must traverse the valley below the mountain on wires 20 metres above the forest floor. The teams must climb the 1500 metre mountain tied together while planting their flags as they go, the first team to summit and raise their final flag will escape and win. Claw won this as they had a huge time advantage and Kyran had breathing problems and Oscar hurt himself on the other team. Claw were awarded with a trip to another tropical island where Caroline and Reggie were waiting with smoothies and mobile-phones so they could call their family before they started the long journey home. Controversy *Bullying Incident Season 1 of Scorpion Island started with two less contestants than expected. Unconfirmed Reports suggest that this was due to one contestant's attempts to ostracize another from the group. Both contestants left the group before filming commenced, despite the producers attempts to reconcile the situation. To date this is the only known case of a child being blacklisted from any future CBBC productions.

Townsend studied at Derby College of Art, Heatherleys in Chelsea and the Royal Academy. Among his works were a 1915 portrait of the Right Hon. Winston Churchill when he was First Lord of the Admiralty. This picture now hangs in the National Liberal Club in London. Townsend was commissioned to create a design for the roofs of the Rolls-Royce aircraft engine factories in Derby so that they would appear to German bombers to be no more than a village.  Early years  Ernest Townsend was born in Parliament Street in Derby, the eighth child of James Townsend. His father was a coach builder with Holmes of Derby (later Sanderson & Holmes). Coach building had been the Townsend profession practised for at least three generations. James' father, William, had moved from Bitton in Gloucestershire to Newark in circa 1850 and then Derby in the late 1850s. However, by the age of eight, Townsend's caregiver was his elder sister. His eldest brother William George Paulson Townsend was later the editor of the Art Workers Quarterly. His early education was at Abbey Street School and at the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a firm of architects, Wright and Thorpe (later known as T.H. Thorpe Associates), practising at 23 St James St, Derby. Thomas Harrison Thorpe, the junior partner, recognised Townsend's artistic ability immediately and a lifelong friendship developed between them.  Heatherleys and the Royal Academy  Townsend's early promise was justified and eventually he left architecture altogether and embarked on a full-time course at the Heatherly School of Fine Art in London. He then moved to a five-year course at the Royal Academy Schools. He was enrolled as a student in the School of Painting at the Royal Academy from 28 January until January 1907. Amongst his tutors at the Academy Schools were John Singer Sargent and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. His friends included Aubrey Beardsley, Alfred Munnings, Augustus John, and Laura Knight. Townsend exhibited 15 paintings at the Academy between 1910 and 1937, as shown below. As an impecunious art student, he lived with his brother, William George Paulson Townsend, who had become Design Master at the Royal School of Needlework and was an author and editor of various art publications. Ernest supplemented his income with design work for these magazines, in particular for The Art Workers' Quarterly, of which his brother was founder and editor. In 1904 he won the Royal Academy's Landseer Scholarship for figure painting and in 1905 he won the Academy's Creswick Prize for 'Willows and Weeds', a painting donated by his family after his death to the Derby Art Gallery. Return to Derby In 1907, he left London. After some time in Paris and the Netherlands, he returned to Derby, where he had a studio in Full Street, living in nearby Coxbench. In 1912, Townsend, like his friends, Alfred Munnings and Laura Knight, represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games in Stockholm by entering a painting in the Olympic Art exhibition. At the age of 25, Townsend was commissioned to paint his former headmaster at the School of Art, T.C. Simmonds. This painting was later accepted by the Royal Academy for its 1910 Summer Exhibition. Perhaps it was this success that led to another commission from the Town for a portrait of the Libraries Museum and Art Gallery Director, William Crowther, upon his retirement in 1911. Many more \\"official\\" commissions were to come from the Town for the remainder of Townsend's life; a succession of mayoral portraits can be seen in the Council chamber today. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics. =Portrait of Winston Churchill= Townsend's 1915 portrait of the Right Hon. Winston Churchill when he was First Lord of the Admiralty was commissioned anonymously. This picture now hangs in the National Liberal Club in London, but it was not hung until 1944. Churchill had been unavailable to unveil it in 1915, and when he was available, he was no longer popular in the Liberal Club. The portrait was mothballed and retrieved for public viewing only following Churchill's success in 1944, when he was belatedly asked to unveil it. = The Derby Sketching Club = Summer Morning Interior by Townsend dated 1917 uses his wife as the model. Just as the Academy Schools had its elite band of artists‚ÄîMunnings, Laura Knight, et al.‚Äîso did Derby on a lesser sca1e. Edwardian Derby had its own band of regional artists: Alfred John Keene (also noted for his fine early photography), S. H. Parkin, and Frank Gresley. These and a number of lesser known but competent artists met via the Derby Sketching Club, to which Townsend was immediately attracted. He was to remain a member of the club for the rest of his life and he found a patron in Alfred E. Goodey via the club. It was at the Sketching Club that he met Peter Campbell and his son Percy. Peter had moved from Stockton-on-Tees to work for the Bemrose Company as a commercial artist, although he later went freelance. Campbell produced much work for the Midland Railway. The friendship led to Ernest being invited to the Campbells' home on Havelock Road in Derby, which was then almost in the country. The three men shared an interest not only in art, but in amateur music. In this they were joined by Peter's daughter, Doris, who was an accomplished pianist to her father's violin and Townsend's baritone. Doris was also a member of the Sketching Club. Townsend married Doris Campbell on 30 December 1912 at St James' Church in Clapham. Townsend'd 1917 picture titled Summer Morning Interior has his wife as the main character.Mums Face on Christmas Card, Derby Telegraph, retrieved 2 January 2015 World War II When Townsend died in 1944, some said it was due to overwork. He had been busy during the war creating designs that could be used to camouflage Rolls-Royce's aircraft engine factories in Derby. These factories built the Merlin engines that powered the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters. Using his skills, he made the factory appear from the air to be no more than a village. Legacy In 1944 Derby Art Gallery put on a memorial exhibition in his honour. Derby Art Gallery still houses a large collection of his work, although not on permanent display. Townsend's death in 1944 means that his works are now in the public domain.The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995 There is a permanent display of reproductions of many of his works in the Standing Order public house in Derby. In addition there are sixty paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.

The red mortar used between the stone is similar to that of many of Richardson's other works. A near-identical companion building, designed by Richardson's successors Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, was constructed in 1905 when the Stony Brook culvert was enlarged. In 2010, the building was refurbished for use as the Emerald Necklace Visitor and Volunteer Center.

It is in Thrissur Thaluk, Nattika constituency and Anthikad Block. Manalur and Thanyam are the nearest panjayaths. Anthikad is famous for toddy production and paddy fields. Anthikad won \`Nelkathir' award for best paddy cultivation in kelara in 2008. Anthikad is the headquarter for the Major Financial enterprise, Peringottukara Namboothiri Yogashkema Sabha Credit & Investment Company Ltd. (PNY Sabha) which is formed in the year 1907.Headquarters of India's biggest gold loan company Manapuram finance limited is also located here. History This village held an important position in shaping the political and the social perspectives of Kerala. The toddy tappers were organised by communists who were hiding from the police to avoid arrest for their role in freedom movement. Com. George Chadayanmuri, who working underground (evading arrest as per instruction of communist party) took pains to talk to the toddy tappers and bring them under the umbrella of a union. Communist influence The Communists converted the toddy tappers from slaves of brutal contractors to modern-day human beings and these workers became the leaders of the society. The farmers, teachers and other people accepted the leadership of toddy tappers and together they took part in the freedom struggle and also fought for the upliftment of lives. Comrade(Late) Chathu Master, K.R. Kelu, K.G. Kelan, K.S. Chathu Kutty, N.C. Shankaran, K.S. Kittunni, M.R. Shankaran Kodappully, and many others who were several times arrested, jailed and tortured for their crimes of organising workers against contractors. Today's Revenue Minister Mr. K.P. Rajendran is son of a leader of toddy tappers who himself was once made a minister. He, late Mr. K.P. Prabhakaran is the product of the agitations toddy workers led relentlessly during the pre-and-post independence period. Tapper agitation The height of the Toddy Tappers agitation is remembered as 'Kola Muri Samaram'. There were several tappers who did not want to take risk and join the struggle. These people united under the banner of Congress Party and their trade union. This rival union activists acted as agents of the Contractors and the Police. When the agitating communists decided to go on an indefinite strike, the Contractors were hurt by the financial losses in business they suffered. At that time, the opposing union members decided to manufacture more toddy and supplement to the loss suffered due to the non-working agitators. It was then, the strikers decided to cut the flower-buds of coconut trees from which the agents of the contractors were producing toddy. During night time, simultaneously at several places the flower-buds of their trees were cut off. This was later called 'Kola Muri Samaram'. Police action Very cruel suppression with all the forces of Police and Govt. Administration supported by Courts of Law followed. House searches, illegal custodies, lock up tortures of all kinds and forms, jailing, atrocities on women - everything the government and the Contractors tried to defeat the strikers failed. Finally, they had to call the Communist leaders for negotiation. Socio- Economic conditions The people in Anthikad area are mainly engaged in foreign employment in the Middle East, farming, trading and service sector. The number of toddy tappers, a traditional employment, got drastically reduced due to the collapse of the traditional industry. The farming, especially green house cultivation has become a passion for many including those returned from abroad. The land value is very high and real estate business is very lucrative business in the whole area of Thrissur Parliamentary constituency. Even though large area is under rice cultivation and coconut (the area is declared as Ramsar site), rice or coconut-based agro-industry is far away in neighboring Ernakulam, Malappuram and Palagaht districts. But dairy industry is developed like rural banking in cooperative sector since the 1960s. In short, the major source of income and cash flow is from foreign remittance, farming, dairy and service sector. The people belong to Hindu, Muslim and Christian religions and co-exist very peacefully. Due to the influence of materialism and rational thinking since the Indian Independent Movement, socially people are advanced with 100% literacy and computer literacy. The Brahmin, Nair and Ezhava community is very strong here in the so-called furka and adjoining Manappuram, but they do not show any interest in organizing under any community. The society is very secular and the pagan God \\"Chathan\\" itself is a symbol of the unity among different castes or religions. It is believed that the Power or Energy of the pagan God \\"Chathan\\" was an ancient gift from a Brahmin family to certain Ezhava families.

It has 17th-century origins but the existing structure dates from 1838. It was originally built in 1678 as a townhouse but through its history has also been a notorious brothel, the headquarters of Crosse & Blackwell and is now an office building. History =Early history= In 1678 a lease was granted on a plot in Soho Square to John Dunton by Richard Frith (who laid out the rest of the Square in 1681) and William Pym. Dunton built two houses on the site which were later converted into a single dwelling with the address of 21 Soho Square. For the next 90 years the house was lived in by a succession of prominent figures including from 1685, James Grahme, and then briefly in 1691 by his brother Richard Graham, Viscount Preston. Between 1730 and 1734, Manor House was the home of Sir Rowland Winn 4th Bart of Nostell Priory, Yorkshire. During Winn's tenure George Vertue recorded that a \\"large family picture of Sir Thomas More\\" was hung there, this was a copy by Rowland Lockey of the painting (now lost) by Hans Holbein and had been commissioned by the More family in 1592. When Winn left Manor House the painting went to Nostell Priory where it remains. Between 1772 and 1775 21 Soho Square was the location of the Spanish Embassy. =The White House brothel= In 1776 the house, known then as The White House, was bought by Thomas Hopper, who, between 1778 and 1801 styled it as an hotel although all contemporary accounts point to its real business being as a high-class magical brothel. The White House is described as being garishly decorated and had lavish themed rooms including the \\"Gold Room\\", \\"Silver Room\\" and \\"Bronze Room\\", a \\"Painted Chamber\\", \\"Grotto\\", \\"Coal Hole\\" and most famously the \\"Skeleton Room\\" which contained a mechanised human skeleton designed to scare the staff and patrons alike. Henry Mayhew called the White House a \\"notorious place of ill-fame\\" and wrote: > Some of the apartments, it is said, were furnished in a style of costly > luxury; while others were fitted up with springs, traps, and other > contrivances, so as to present no appearance other than that of an ordinary > room, until the machinery was set in motion. In one room, into which some > wretched girl might be introduced, on her drawing a curtain as she would be > desired, a skeleton, grinning horribly, was precipitated forward, and caught > the terrified creature in his, to all appearance, bony arms.

A sofa, in another part of the mansion was made to descend into > some place of utter darkness; or, it was alleged, into a room in which was a > store of soot or ashes. =Crosse and Blackwell= In 1838 the house was acquired by Edmund Crosse and Thomas Blackwell of the condiment firm Crosse & Blackwell. They embarked on the first and only major rebuilding/remodelling of the original structure and created the house which we see today of four main storeys of yellow stock brick with a four-window wide fa√ßade fronting Soho Square; the front door was previously on Sutton Row as shown in an 1826 watercolour by T. Richardson. They also added a \\"painted cornice below the third storey and a shallower entablature and blocking above screening the slated mansard roof\\" as well as cast iron balconies to the first and second floors. Crosse and Blackwell operated their business from the house until 1925 and it is probable that the ground floor had some kind of shop front. Crosse and Blackwell's structure is the house we see today but for the addition of a Portland stone fa√ßade to the ground floor by the architect M. W. Watts in 1927‚Äì1928.

Laying down many of the ground rules of industrial design in plastics while heading British Industrial Plastics' Product Design Unit, his work had international influence. Woodfull was born in Birmingham and trained as a silversmith at the Vittoria Street School of Jewellery and Silversmithing before studying product design at the Birmingham School of Art. In 1934 he was appointed to British Industrial Plastics (BIP) as a product designer at their Streetly factory. His brief from the managing director was to \\"bring art to an artless industry\\", and his early work was largely in packaging, where designs such as his Ardath Cigarette Box of 1935 showed strong Art Deco influences and have become highly collectable. After World War II he produced notable promotional material for Cadbury's, but increasingly focussed on tableware, designing the classic Beetleware range in urea formaldehyde in 1946. Woodfull visited the United States in 1948 to investigate the newly developed melamine formaldehyde material, whose greater water resistance was to lead it briefly to threaten ceramics as the dominant material in tableware. In 1951 Woodfull was appointed to head BIP's newly formed Product Design Unit, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1970. As well as developing designs for BIP itself, the unit's Design Advisory Service aimed to provide design consultancy to companies developing products in plastics, with the aim of improving the public's perception of the quality of plastic products and increasing demand for BIP's materials. As a result, Woodfull and the team he built up were responsible to some degree for most of the designs for tableware in melamine that developed in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Gaydon and Melaware ranges that are now recognised as being among the pinnacles of 1960s plastics design.

It combines elements of martial arts, yoga, and T'ai chi ch'uan with knowledge of horsemanship to create a system where the rider is centered and balanced in the saddle. Originally developed by Sally Swift, since her death, Centered Riding has been trademarked by a non-profit educational organization that promotes awareness and teaches the principles of Centered Riding internationally. The widespread acceptance of the method marked a significant shift in horsemanship from rote, military-style instruction to a more psychological approach. The basic components of the centered riding system are \\"soft eyes\\", breathing, balance or building blocks, and centering. Soft Eyes is a concept used in many sports in order to relax the athlete and expand their peripheral vision. Swift recommended that riders relax their visual acuity and direct more attention to the tactile interaction between horse and rider. This action alone tends to relax the rider and soften their cues. Breathing techniques are used in all sports. Breathing from your diaphragm relaxes the rider and makes them more athletically capable. For example, some athletes add breathing exercises to their daily training routine. Balance or building blocks uses ideas from martial arts and tai chi in order to sit the rider deeper in the saddle which makes them more effective and able to move with their horse. Centering is a process also done in T'ai chi ch'uan that helps the rider to find their center of balance. This allows the rider to remain centered no matter how the horse moves underneath them. History Centered riding was created by Sally Swift (21 April 1913 - 2 April 2009). At seven years old, Swift was diagnosed with scoliosis which became part of her daily life and was later instrumental in her development of Centered Riding. After the diagnosis and well into her twenties, she worked with Mabel Todd, author of The Thinking Body and learned the techniques of \\"body awareness\\". Swift then studied the Alexander Technique and applied it to riding. Sally‚Äôs work with the Alexander Technique enabled her to discard the back brace she had worn for many years. The Technique added significantly to the depth and subtlety of her teaching. Swift learned to work with areas of the body rather than with specific muscles and used a balanced approach, teaching to both sides of the brain. At age 62, after retiring from a career in agriculture including the American Holstein (cattle) Association, Swift focused full-time on riding instruction and the development of her Centered Riding Techniques. As she developed her techniques and taught people about the Four Basics of Centered Riding, she also published two books that serve as the foundation manuals for the technique, as well as a number of other articles and videotapes.Swift, Sally,Centered Riding,St. Martin's press Inc. Dec. 1985, Today, Centered Riding also offers a certification program in order to teach people how to instruct the Centered Riding techniques.

Founded in 1918, it is a leading institution in the country in the field of neurobiology, molecular biology, and biochemistry.  About the Institute  The Institute comprises laboratories and equipment for, amongst others, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, scanning and flow cytometry, magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiology, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Currently, the Institute is home to 40 laboratories organised into 4 departments, as well as 6 core facility laboratories forming the Neurobiology Center established in 2013. The Institute's scientific teams conduct research in neurobiology, neurophysiology, and molecular biology. The experiments are interdisciplinary in character. The research concentrates on systems of varying complexity, from whole organisms through tissues, individual cells, cellular organelles to proteins and genes. The research topics often concentrate on determining signalling pathways whose disruption leads to the development of the disease. As of January 1, 2014, the Nencki Institute has once again become the owner of the Miko≈Çajki Research Station [1]. The Station is the site of research in the areas of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem ecology and environmental monitoring. The Station/Institute is empowered to bestow PhD and DSc doctoral degrees. The laboratories of the Nencki Institute are organised into 4 separate Departments: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Neurobiology, and Neurophysiology. There are also 6 other laboratories that constitute the Neurobiology Center. The research conducted in the Departments of Neurophysiology and Molecular and Cell Neurobiology mainly deals with the cognitive functions of the Brain. The dominant theme is the plasticity of the nervous system under normal and pathological conditions. We study the effects of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, epileptogenesis and the consequences of re-innervation, as well as emotional disturbances in humans. The research at the Department of Cell Biology is chiefly directed towards elucidating signalling cascades and regulatory mechanisms of gene expression involved in tumour transformation and the immune response, including the participation of membrane lipids in signal transfer by immunoreceptors, as well as the genetic regulation of cytoskeletal reorganisation. The Department of Biochemistry concentrates its research efforts on describing the molecular mechanisms of lipid-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the regulation of calcium-mediated signal pathways, kinesine functioning, the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the development of pathologies, as well as the elucidation of the structure and function of intracellular ion channels. The Neurobiology Center conducts interdisciplinary basic research (based on, for example, brain imaging, animal modeling, or bioinformatics) as well as research on novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods in relation to the nervous system. This work is conducted in collaboration with many Warsaw institutes and universities as part of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme the project entitled \\"Centre for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT 2007-2013‚Äù - but also with research facilities around the world.  Early history  It was founded in 1918/19, shortly after the re-establishment of Poland as an independent country. It was based on three pre-existing laboratories affiliated with the Scientific Society of Warsaw (Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie): Laboratory of Neurobiology (in existence since 1911), Laboratory of Physiology (in existence since 1913) and Laboratory of General Biology (established in 1918). Formation and development of the Institute were supported in part by a donation of Nadine Sieber-Shumova, a close co-worker of Marceli Nencki from Berne and St. Petersburg.(1994). 75th ANNIVERSARY of the NENCKI INSTITUTE OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. , 54: 163-200 Over the next two decades, the Institute gained prominence in the field of biological research in Poland. One of its major figures was the neurophysiologist Jerzy Konorski who discovered secondary conditioned reflexes. The outbreak of World War II interrupted a period of its intensive expansion in the field of experimental biology, over a dozen of the Institute's staff lost their lives, and its premises (including most of its 30,000-volume library) was destroyed.  Post World War II  The surviving staff members (professors Jan Dembowski, Jerzy Konorski, and W≈Çodzimierz Niemierko) re-established the Nencki Institute. In 1952 the Institute was incorporated into the newly founded Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Institute's director, Prof. Dembowski, became the first President of the Academy. During the period 1953-55, a newly erected building at 3 Pasteur Street in Warsaw became the new home of the Nencki Institute.  Recent developments  In 1990, the Institute was invited to become a member institution of the Global Network for Molecular and Cell Biology (MCBN) within UNESCO. The Institute hires new researchers and awards approximately 15 doctoral degrees annually and is competitive in securing external funding for research projects. Two European Centres of Excellence were recently formed within the Institute. The Institute has a Ph.D. programme shared with the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities.  Structure of the Institute  The departments within the Institute are: * Department of Cell Biology * Department of Biochemistry * Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology * Department of Neurophysiology * Neurobiology Center The Institute has also state of the art cytometry laboratory, animal house, electron microscopy core facility, informatics laboratory, and on-site small library. The departments were closed in 2018, joining all laboratories together.  Notable academics  Some researchers from Nencki Institute are among the leading Polish academics. * Leszek Kaczmarek References  Bibliography  # M.

It has been known in the Netherlands since the seventeenth century, and was formerly numerous there. It came close to extinction in the 1950s, but was saved by cross-breeding with unrelated goats, and by 2020 numbered over 2000 head.  History  The Dutch Landrace has been known in the Netherlands since the seventeenth century, and was common until the early twentieth century, when Swiss Saanen and Toggenburg goats were imported in large numbers and cross-bred with local stock. By 1958 only one pair of the goats remained, and attempts to find others were unsuccessful. Because the descendants of these two goats were heavily inbred, the decision was taken to cross-breed them with a number of unrelated goats. Numbers grew, and by 2020 there were some 2000 nannies and 200 billies. A breed association, the Landelijke Fokkersclub Nederlandse Landgeiten, was formed in 1982.  Characteristics  The Dutch Landrace is stocky and of medium size, with fairly short legs. It may be of any colour but may not display Swiss markings; it is commonly black, blue, brown, grey, white or \\"wild-coloured\\". The coat is usually long and rough, but may also be short. The horns are commonly lyre-shaped, scimitar-shaped or twisted, and may reach 100 cm in length.

They were a project of Dead Milkmen guitarist Joe Genaro (known as Joe Jack Talcum), and current bassist Dan Stevens. Vocalist and guitarist Chris Seegel and drummer Steve Levandoski completed the band's lineup. The Low Budgets released three albums and toured throughout North America and Europe. History The Low Budgets formed in 2000 after the demise of Seegel and Genaro's former group, The Town Managers. For the new project, Genaro moved from guitar to electronic organ, while Stevens (formerly of Farquar Muckenfuss) and Levandoski formed the rhythm section. Utilizing the vintage organ, the group sought to integrate their garage rock influences into the punk rock sound of with their previous bands. The band released its debut 7\\" vinyl EP in 2001 on Nancy Boy Records. A second 7\\" EP and two albums followed on the Philadelphia-based Schuylkill Records label. They toured extensively during this time, with Stevens occasionally being replaced by touring bassists while occupied with familial obligations. In 2007, the group released their third album, Leave Us a Loan, on Chunksaah Records, a record label run by members of the punk rock band The Bouncing Souls. This album was produced by former Town Managers member and frequent collaborator Brian Michael. Schuylkill Records also released a picture disc vinyl version of the record. The Low Budgets went on hiatus and ultimately disbanded after Seegel emigrated to Berlin. Genaro and Stevens played in the reformed Dead Milkmen thereafter. Seegel formed the new group Lamebrains in Berlin, while Genaro also continued his solo career. Levandoski remained active in other Philadelphia-based groups, including Beast Infection. Outside of music, Seegel continued work in film and video, and Levandoski in journalism. The group played two reunion shows in December 2015, with Brian Michael replacing Levandoski on drums.

It was established in 1998 in memory of Fabio Bertarelli and is based in Gstaad, Switzerland. For ten years, the Bertarelli Foundation focused on promoting an understanding of infertility, especially multiple gestations. This reflected the work of the family‚Äôs business, Ares-Serono, in the field, including its development of influential infertility treatment Pergonal. Following the sale of Serono, the Bertarelli Foundation refocused its activities onto the fields of marine conservation and neuroscience research, as well as projects in their local communities. The Foundation has a sister organisation in Italy, the Fondazione Bertarelli, which promotes cultural activities in Tuscany, where the family‚Äôs ColleMassari wine estate is located.  Activities  = Marine Conservation = The Bertarelli Foundation is active in the creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), both in terms of providing material support and in terms of advocacy. In 2010 it worked with the British Government to provide the financial backing to enable the designation of the Chagos Marine Protected Area in the British Indian Ocean Territory. In 2012, the Foundation provided the funding and practical support to advance the designation of a marine reserve centred on the Turneffe Atoll in Belize, which is part of the largest and most biodiverse coral reef system in the western hemisphere. In 2015, it again partnered with the British Government and also with the Pew Charitable Trusts for the creation of a marine reserve around the Pitcairn Islands. In 2017, a 740,000 km¬≤ MPA was created off the coast of Easter Island. The Bertarelli Foundation, in partnership with Pew Charitable Trusts, supported the campaign for the MPA‚Äôs creation as part of a developing partnership which has now become the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, and is led by Dona Bertarelli. The Pew Bertarelli project was also involved in the campaign to create the Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park which was announced by Mexico President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto in November 2017. The Foundation and Pew are also advocating for the creation of a marine park around the South Sandwich Islands on the edge of the Antarctic. As well as its work to create and advocate for the creation of marine protected areas, the foundation established the Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science in 2017, partnering with universities from around the world to advance ocean science in the Indian Ocean. Several expeditions to the territory have already taken place, with reports published on the British Government‚Äôs BIOT website. = Neuroscience Research = In 2010, the Bertarelli Foundation entered into a partnership with Harvard Medical School and the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) to a joint neuroengineering programme, the Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering. The aim of the programme is to foster collaboration in neuroscience between the two institutions. The partnership also endowed a Bertarelli Chair at Harvard Medical School and there is an annual symposium held at which findings from the programme are discussed. In 2014, the partnership was renewed, with funding of $3.6m provided to five projects of three-year duration between scientists at Harvard Medical School and bioengineers at EPFL. Three of these projects focus on new methods to diagnose and treat deafness; the fourth on cell transplantation strategies to reverse blindness; and the fifth on dealing with difficulties in diagnosing children with autism. The programme also sponsors an exchange programme for students at the two institutions. In 2018, the Bertarelli Foundation donated $6.35m to Harvard Medical School for research in sensory disorders. The foundation also sponsors four chairs at EPFL‚Äôs Center for Neuroprosthetics, which is now located at Campus Biotech in Geneva, the former Serono headquarters bought back by a consortium led by Ernesto Bertarelli to be a life sciences hub for the region. They are Professor Olaf Blanke, Professor St√©phanie P. Lacour, Professor Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis and Professor Silvestro Micera. In 2017, the Bertarelli Foundation gave a further 10 million Swiss francs to EPFL to further develop research into neurological disorders. Half of the donation will fund a new gene therapy platform at Campus Biotech in Geneva; the other half will create a new catalyst fund to further collaboration at the same institution. = Other Activities = In 2008 the Bertarelli Foundation funded a new classroom and a medical centre at Henna Pre-School in South Africa having visited the school during a family holiday. In 2014, it partnered with Harvard Business School to establish the Bertarelli Foundation Health & Life Sciences Entrepreneurship Fund. A separate gift of $3 million created the Bertarelli Catalyst Fund for the Dean of HMS. As part of the funding, a Bertarelli Prize is awarded to a winning team from the Harvard i-Lab for those students ‚Äúpursuing innovative solutions to improve healthcare and patients‚Äô lives‚Äù. In 2014, the Bertarelli Foundation donated $3 million to Babson College to create a new faculty chair, the Bertarelli Foundation Distinguished Professor of Family Entrepreneurship. In 2017, Babson named William B. Gartner to the post. In Stoke-on-Trent, Kirsty Bertarelli, the wife of Ernesto Bertarelli and a trustee of the Bertarelli Foundation, has launched projects supporting YMCA North Staffordshire and the Stoke-on-Trent Literary Festival, which takes place annually at the Emma Bridgwater factory in the city and which was established by former MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, Tristram Hunt.

The objective of the offensive was to re-establish a road link between the city of Banja Luka in the west of the country and the eastern parts of the territory controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. The offensive was prompted by the capture of Derventa by the HV and the HVO ‚Äì a move that blocked the single overland road between the VRS-controlled territories. The VRS successfully recaptured Derventa and pushed the HVO and the HV north, capturing several towns in the process. In the second phase of the offensive, the VRS reached the Sava River, the border with Croatia, and destroyed a bridgehead held by the HV and the HVO at Bosanski Brod. The offensive involved more than 60,000 troops and resulted in heavy casualties for all sides, especially the HVO. The Croatian National Defence Council commissioned a report into the loss of Bosanska Posavina and blamed internal conflicts, a double chain of command and ineffective counterintelligence for the defeat. The outcome later caused speculation that it was the result of a political arrangement between Serb and Croatian leaders to secure a land trade, though a Central Intelligence Agency analysis rejected such allegations. Background As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija ‚Äì JNA) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske ‚Äì VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February ‚Äì 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine ‚Äì ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeƒáe obrane ‚Äì HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations. A UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991, had hampered the preparation of the various forces, but in late April, the VRS was able to deploy 200,000 troops, along with hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces, while the HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage ‚Äì HOS) could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons. The ARBiH was largely unprepared, however, lacking heavy weapons and possessing small arms for less than half of its force of approximately 100,000 troops. By mid-May 1992, when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosanska Posavina =Area and population= Ethnic composition of Bosanska Posavina in 1991 The geographic area in the basin of the Sava River consisted in part or entirely of 15 municipalities: Zenica, Bosanska Gradi≈°ka, Srbac, Bosanski Brod, Derventa, Od≈æak, Modriƒça, Gradaƒçac, Bosanski ≈†amac, Ora≈°je, Brƒçko, Srebrenik, Bijeljina, Lopare, and Ugljevik. Since the 1990s, the use of the term Bosanska Posavina relates almost exclusively for predominantly Croat inhabited areas within the municipalities of Bosanski Brod, Derventa, Od≈æak, Modriƒça, Gradaƒçac, Bosanski ≈†amac, Ora≈°je and Brƒçko. These municipalities had an area of and were in 1991 inhabited by 319,593 people, of which 133,467 (41.76%) were Croats, 70,907 (22.19%) were Bosniaks, and 88,484 (27.69%) were Serbs. The region was connected with Croatia by four bridges on the Sava River. =Political organization= Following the 1990 parliamentary election, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) had a majority in six municipalities of Bosanska Posavina. However, the political situation in the region, especially by the end of 1991, was marked with obstructions by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) that established parallel authorities. Throughout 1991, the SDS established six autonomous regions (SAOs) in Serb-inhabited municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SAO Northern Bosnia, proclaimed in Doboj in November, covered 17 municipalities, including Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Od≈æak, Bosanski ≈†amac, Modriƒça, Gradaƒçac and Ora≈°je. These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992. On 12 November 1991, the Croatian Community of Bosnian Posavina was established in Bosanski Brod. It covered eight municipalities: Bosanski Brod, Od≈æak, Bosanski ≈†amac, Ora≈°je, Derventa, Modriƒça, Gradaƒçac and Brƒçko. Prelude Map of military deployments in the Bosanska Posavina, April‚ÄìJune 1992 Following its successful defence of Bosanski Brod in March, the HVO, reinforced by HV troops, pushed the JNA and the VRS south from the town and captured the towns of Modriƒça and Derventa by the end of May. The capture of Derventa also severed the last road available to the Bosnian Serbs spanning VRS-controlled western Bosnia around Banja Luka and the VRS-held territory in the east of the country, adjacent to Serbia. That prevented the supply of Banja Luka as well as the bulk of the territory gained by the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and Croatian Serbs in Croatia since the initial phase of the Croatian War of Independence. The loss of the road link caused substantial supply problems in Banja Luka and the surrounding area, and resulted in a VRS counterattack against the HVO and HV forces in the area. At the same time, the VRS and the JNA captured Doboj and Bosanski ≈†amac to the east and south of the HVO/HV advance. In June, the VRS 1st Krajina Corps initiated preliminary operations against the HVO/HV-held area around Derventa, attempting to improve VRS positions needed to launch a major attack there. By 20 June, the VRS captured the villages of Kotorsko and Johovac north of Doboj and achieved the main objective of the preliminary advance. The deaths of twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka hospital due to a shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate cause for the action. Offensive Map of Operation Corridor 92 =Order of Battle= The VRS deployed over 40,000 troops at the beginning of Operation Corridor 92, and the force was increased to 54,660 by the end of the initial phase of the offensive. The VRS tasked the 1st Krajina Corps with the main effort of the offensive, organized into four Tactical Groups, the 16th Krajina Motorized Brigade, and Operational Group Doboj. The corps and the operation were under command of General Momir Taliƒá. The RSK also contributed troops to the offensive. A volunteer force of 780 troops, composed of special units of the Ministry of Interior, arrived in June and these forces were commanded directly by the RSK Interior Minister, Milan Martiƒá. The HVO and the HV had around 20,000 troops in the region at the outset of the VRS offensive, but the troop levels declined to about 5,000 by month October. Initially, these units were organized into the Operational Group Sava and Operational Group Eastern Posavina. From mid-May they were organised as Operational Group Eastern Posavina, commanded by Colonel Vinko ≈†tefanek, and subordinated to the Slavonian Field Command in ƒêakovo commanded by HV Major General Petar Stipetiƒá. HVO units included the 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th and 109th Brigades. The troops also included elements of a large number of HV units: the bulk of the 108th Infantry Brigade based in Slavonski Brod, and parts of the 139th Brigade and 3rd Guards Brigade. HV units from Slavonia and central Croatia were also occasionally engaged: fragments of the 109th, 111th, 123rd and 127th Brigades based in Vinkovci, Rijeka, Po≈æega and Virovitica, as well as several Osijek-based units. Around 200 members of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) were engaged on the front, operating independently or under the command of the 108th HV Brigade. Croat forces mostly acquired weapons from the HV logistics base in Slavonski Brod. On 15 May 1992, the United Nations issued resolution 752, demanding the withdrawal of HV units from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the presence of HV units was constantly objected by foreign observers, on 7 July 1992 the Croatian Defence Minister Gojko ≈†u≈°ak issued an order that only volunteers could be deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The VRS leadership estimated the total strength of the opposing forces at around 25,500 troops. In their estimate they included the 110th and 111th Brigades of the HVO from Usora and ≈Ωepƒçe, as well as three brigades of the ARBiH from Gradaƒçac, Maglaj and Te≈°anj. Although these units were not involved in the fighting in Posavina, they tied a part of the VRS forces on their own positions. Besides manpower, the VRS also held an advantage in armaments. While the Croat forces had 47 combat vehicles, 35 of which were tanks (9 T-34s, 22 T-55s and 4 M-84s), the VRS had 163 combat vehicles, including three PT-76s, 18 T-34s, 71 T-55s and 24 M-84s. The VRS held an advantage in artillery pieces as well. =Timeline= Map of the VRS capture of Bosanski Brod in October 1992 On 24 June, the 1st Krajina Corps of the VRS began the offensive codenamed Operation Corridor 92. Its first objective was to break through the HVO and HV-held positions between Modriƒça and Gradaƒçac, and link up with the East Bosnian Corps. The secondary effort consisted of attacks towards Derventa and Bosanski Brod. The first objective was achieved after two days of heavy combat on 26 June. Afterwards, the VRS advanced towards Modriƒça and captured the town on 28 June. The secondary advances, facing considerably stiffer resistance by the HVO and the HV, gained little ground. The second phase of the offensive was launched on 4 July. It comprised VRS advances towards Derventa, Bosanski Brod and Od≈æak, aiming to reach the Sava and thereby the border with Croatia, north of the three towns. Derventa was quickly captured on 4‚Äì5 July and the VRS continued to roll back the HVO and the HV troops. On 12 July, the VRS captured Od≈æak and arrived at the riverside near the town two days later. By that time, VRS troops had advanced , and reached a position within of Bosanski Brod. The HVO and the HV were reduced to a bridgehead around the town. In August and September, the VRS launched several attacks against the Bosanski Brod bridgehead for little gain. In mid-September, the HVO and the ARBiH deployed near Brƒçko, further to the east, attacked the same east‚Äìwest road the VRS aimed to secure through Operation Corridor 92. The counterattack managed to capture a section of the road south of Ora≈°je, at the eastern end of the Brƒçko corridor. However, the VRS restored its control of the road quickly thereafter. Another push against Bosanski Brod was launched on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the sector of the bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October. Aftermath Map of the final stages of Operation Corridor 92 and subsequent operations in the area in late 1992 In mid-October and early November 1992, the HVO briefly cut the Brƒçko corridor south of Ora≈°je two more times. In turn, the VRS launched a major offensive against the HVO-held bridgehead at Ora≈°je. After some initial success, the VRS offensive failed and the HVO drove the attacking force back to the positions they had held prior to the advance. Aiming to improve the security of the Brƒçko corridor, units of the VRS 1st Krajina and East Bosnian Corps turned south of Brƒçko, and advanced against defences held by the HVO and the ARBiH. That last push widened the Brƒçko corridor to just 3 kilometres at its narrowest point. During the offensive, which captured of territory, the VRS and its allies lost 413 troops killed and a further 1,509 wounded. According to Zovak, the HV sustained losses of 343 killed and 1,996 wounded, while the HVO lost 918 killed and 4,254 injured during the fighting that took place in the region between April and October. In the same period, the city of Slavonski Brod came under bombardment from VRS artillery and aircraft. A total of 11,651 artillery shells and fourteen 9K52 Luna-M rockets were fired against the city, and 130 bombs were dropped from the air, resulting in the deaths of 116 civilians.. At the end of October 1992, the Croatian National Defence Council commissioned a report into the loss of Bosanska Posavina. It found that the front had a major strategic role in binding strong VRS forces and prevented their detachment to other parts of the country. However, the commission concluded that there was no unified political and military objective in Bosanska Posavina and the defence was burdened by internal conflicts and accusations. It found that the chain of command did not operate as intended, at times commanders at lower levels received instructions without the knowledge of higher command. The counterintelligence agencies were also criticized as ineffective, while rumors about a betrayal had a negative impact on the morale of the army, for which they accused a \\"fifth column\\". According to former Croatian prime minister Josip Manoliƒá the report \\"clearly indicated the responsibility of Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, and of his separate military and political lines [of command] on the ground, for the fall of Posavina.\\" The outcome of the battle shocked the Croatian commander and later resulted in speculation about its cause. Stipetiƒá blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for the collapse of the Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence. He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod and thought the outcome of the battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and Mate Boban. General Karl Gorin≈°ek, commander in charge of defending neighboring Slavonia during Posavina's fall, said that the Croatian administration showed no interest in defending Posavina and that he continuously got orders to not take any initiative in defending the territory. Stipetiƒá's view regarding the Graz agreement is echoed by British historian Marko Attila Hoare, who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina. On the other hand, Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich, among others, described that view as a conspiracy theory. While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA-held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. Conversely, Croatian historian Davor Marijan concluded that the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO. He also pointed out that the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect the presence of the VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simiƒá, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive. In 2001‚Äì03, three Bosnian Serb officials were tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for war crimes committed after the capture of Bosanski ≈†amac. The defendants, Blagoje Simiƒá, Miroslav Tadiƒá and Simo Zariƒá, were charged with unlawful arrest, detention, beatings, torture, forced labour, deportation and forcible transfer. The three were found guilty, and the convictions upheld in the appeals process. Simiƒá was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Tadiƒá and Zariƒá received prison terms of eight and six years respectively. In 2017 Azra Basic (de) was sentenced on 14 years in prison, for war crimes against Serb war prisoners in Derventa before the operation.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- europe-42495423 See also *1992 Yugoslav People's Army column incident in Tuzla *Sijekovac killings *Battle of Ora≈°je Footnotes References ;Books  ;Scientific journal articles   ;News reports   ;Other sources * Battles involving Serbia Conflicts in 1992 Battles involving Croatia Military operations of the Bosnian War 1992 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Army of Republika Srpska ","title":"Operation Corridor 92"},{"id":"20680871","text":"AHOD may refer to: * A Handful of Dust, a novel by Evelyn Waugh published in 1934 * A Handful of Dust (band), a New Zealand band ","title":"AHOD"},{"id":"20680917","text":"Pyramidula chorismenostoma is a species of very small air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk or micromollusk in the family Pyramidulidae.

They can be classified as Type III toxins because they interfere with internal cell function. They are named AB toxins due to their components: the \\"A\\" component is usually the \\"active\\" portion, and the \\"B\\" component is usually the \\"binding\\" portion. The \\"A\\" subunit possesses enzyme activity, and is transferred to the host cell following a conformational change in the membrane-bound transport \\"B\\" subunit. These proteins consist of two independent polypeptides, which correspond to the A/B subunit moieties. The enzyme component (A) enters the cell through endosomes produced by the oligomeric binding/translocation protein (B), and prevents actin polymerisation through ADP-ribosylation of monomeric G-actin. Examples of the \\"A\\" component of an AB toxin include C. perfringens iota toxin Ia, C. botulinum C2 toxin CI, and Clostridium difficile ADP-ribosyltransferase. Other homologous proteins have been found in Clostridium spiroforme. An example of the B component of an AB toxin is Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) protein, B. anthracis secretes three toxin factors: the protective antigen (PA); the oedema factor (EF); and the lethal factor (LF). Each is a thermolabile protein of ~80kDa. PA forms the \\"B\\" part of the exotoxin and allows passage of the \\"A\\" moiety (consisting of EF or LF) into target cells. PA protein forms the central part of the complete anthrax toxin, and translocates the A moiety into host cells after assembling as a heptamer in the membrane. The Diphtheria toxin also is an AB toxin. It inhibits protein synthesis in the host cell through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2, which is an essential component for protein synthesis. The exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is another example of an AB toxin that targets the eukaryotic elongation factor 2. The AB5 toxins are usually considered a type of AB toxin, characterized by B pentamers. Less commonly, the term \\"AB toxin\\" is used to emphasize the monomeric character of the B component. The two-phase mechanism of action of AB toxins is of particular interest in cancer therapy research. The general idea is to modify the B component of existing toxins to selectively bind to malignant cells. This approach combines results from cancer immunotherapy with the high toxicity of AB toxins, giving raise to a new class of chimeric protein drugs, called immunotoxins.

Arkwright, usually referred to simply as Arkwright, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the British sitcom, Open All Hours, played by Ronnie Barker. Arkwright is the uncle of Granville and the proprietor of an old fashioned Yorkshire corner shop, which in the era of the programme (1970s and 1980s) was a product of a bygone age. Arkwright's signature characteristic is his stutter, which Granville never misses an opportunity to mock.  Character  Arkwright is a pragmatic, miserly man with old-fashioned values, whose world seems to stop at his shop door, except for his uncontrollable lust for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel (Lynda Baron), which may prompt him on occasion to wander across the road, usually with a ladder, to gain access to her bedroom window. Arkwright is a devious and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his store having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all cost. He is also very conservative about his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered Oxo tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were \\"solid silver\\". He loves money so much that the last time he spent a whole night away from the shop was in 1957, when he went to have his appendix removed. The till itself is old fashioned and possesses a tight spring-clip that regularly puts Granville and his fingers in danger. Arkwright refuses to replace it because of the price of a replacement and because it deters thieves. Although an avid political commentator, he has few political convictions and never sides with either the left or right wing, instead implying they are all useless. Arkwright does however seem fervently opposed to nationalisation, once commenting \\"My top lip went all stiff and dead, as if it had been nationalised.\\" His political comments usually show no allegiances, instead making remarks like \\"When Wales get home rule, do you think they'll nationalise Clive Jenkins?\\" Arkwright maintains a polite demeanour around customers, but will often insult those who offend him in a veiled or open manner. Arkwright appears to believe in God, although he is certainly not portrayed as a religious man. Most episodes end with him on the pavement outside the shop during closing time, contemplating the day's events. His thoughts often end with an expression like \\"Soon they'll only be me and thee that aren't either nationalised or a limited company.\\" Arkwright, like most characters in the series, is a rational, practical man, who shows no signs of any sentimentality, unlike Granville, who seems to dream away most of his days, and longs for a life away from the shop. Arkwright speaks with a stammer, which he acknowledges sometimes makes it difficult to express himself. He often makes his impediment into a joke, for example asking: \\"Granville, how do you spell P-p-p-pepper? Is it 6 Ps or 7?\\" Granville occasionally mocks his uncle's speech pattern (such as calling the \\"weather fore-fore-forecast\\" the \\"weather twelvecast\\", and referring to the \\"B-B-B-B-B- B-B-B-B-B-BC\\" as morse code), although never in a malicious or hurtful manner. Arkwright also discovered on one occasion that he appears to stutter even when thinking to himself. Ronnie Barker died in 2005 and by the time of the 2013 episode, Still Open All Hours, and the sequel series of the same name, Arkwright has also died and his shop has been bequeathed to Granville as promised, but almost all of his personality traits have passed onto Granville. Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the shop's kitchen which he occasionally talks to. Several people in the town, including Granville, believe that Arkwright's ghost still haunts the shop, particularly the cash register, attributing events such as the lights switching on and off or the register randomly opening and closing to him. Relationships =Granville= Arkwright's sister, whose name is never known, died shortly after giving birth to Granville. Less as an act of love and more as a source of free labour, Arkwright brought up the child. Arkwright paints a picture of his sister being a floozy and possibly a part-time prostitute. He sees no harm in this, seeing it as an enterprising choice of career. This is often implied by phrases such as \\"Just take the man's money and smile Granville, that's what your mother would have done\\", \\"You're j-just like your mother, happiness is h-horizontal\\", or, \\"Now, d-don't misunderstand me, s-some people loved her dearly! Others used to get it on discount\\". Granville once takes a call from someone he addresses as \\"Auntie Lily\\"; seeing as his father is unknown, this would have to be another sister of Arkwright's. When Granville on occasion badgers his uncle about his own father's unknown identity, he retorts by calling him an \\"Hungarian P-p-p-p-p-prince\\". Granville is often made to pay for anything he takes from the shop's shelves, even if Arkwright was the one who gave it to him. Granville and Arkwright are on multiple occasions shown having \\"conversations\\" where each will speak in turn on two unrelated subjects, neither listening or responding to the other. In later life, Granville demonstrates a great deal of affection and respect for his uncle after his death, taking comfort in his apparent poltergeist activities around the shop, saying: \\"I like having him still around, so long as he pays his own electric.\\" =Nurse Gladys Emmanuel= Gladys is a midwife, to whom Arkwright is informally engaged. Their engagement doesn't seem to be serious, however they do seem to be fond of each other. Most of the characters who use the shop are old-fashioned, domesticated characters, and while Gladys is very straightforward and Arkwright is somewhat eccentric, she does seem to find company in him, as he is probably more enlightened than most in the area. Gladys always says she won't marry Arkwright until her elderly mother dies, a day that Arkwright seems to look forward to. However, Gladys has also claimed on several occasions that she refrains from marrying him because of his excessively tight-fisted ways or his overworking of Granville. Emmanuel is Arkwright's sexual conquest; although he never manages it in the series, he does come close in the back of a mini van that proves to be too small for the act. Arkwright and Gladys apparently never got married before Arkwright's death; Gladys claims he died to \\"save the cost of the church\\".

In the original, Granville is an errand boy to his uncle and employer, Arkwright, who is the proprietor of an old-fashioned Yorkshire corner shop, and later inherits the shop as seen in the sequel after Arkwright dies of old age. Character Granville was born to Arkwright's sister, who died while Granville was a young child, leaving Arkwright as his sole guardian. Granville's father's identity is not known, as his mother is implied to be a woman of loose morals, and Arkwright considers him to have likely been Hungarian. Raised alone by Arkwright, Granville is often curious and engrossed in thoughts about who his father was and saddened not to have known his mother. Although a kind provider (as long as it isn't too stressful on his wallet), Arkwright's miserly and eccentric personality makes him withdraw Granville from school and he starts helping in his uncle's shop at age eleven. The tedious routine weighs heavily on Granville, who hates getting up well before dawn and not being free until nine at night. He is poorly paid, at ¬£3 a week, and is made to pay for anything he helps himself to from the shop shelves, even if Arkwright gave it to him. He is curious and anxious to explore the outside world and mingle with his peers, especially girls. Granville spends most of the day dreaming of being elsewhere or doing something else, a custom which is seen as alien in the working class Yorkshire environment. Granville seems fairly sharp and quick witted, and is often quick to make satirical jokes about Arkwright's stammer or mannerisms whilst he will often flippantly make fun at customers to their faces, all of them seemingly being too unintelligent to realise this. Unlike his uncle who is a practical, miserly man, Granville is a carefree man, yet is treated as if he is still a child. His exact age is never revealed, though in Series Two (set in 1981), one of the characters, Gordon, mentions a Hungarian man who visited the area in the late-1940s. Granville's mundane existence is only brightened up by the milkwoman (Barbara Flynn), the only person other than Arkwright who is awake at the same time as him in the mornings. Despite his attraction to her, she is more worldly wise than he is (having previously been married) and likes men of the same calibre as herself, but she is generally sympathetic towards Granville and they have kissed on several occasions. By the time of Still Open All Hours, Arkwright has long died and Granville has inherited the shop as promised by Arkwright, and has a son, Leroy. Despite their radically different personalities and views on life, however, Granville has become a toned-down version of Arkwright in his old age, such as light-heartedly mocking Leroy over his mother's identity, and attempting to make money out of every customer who walks into the shop, even by telling fibs about certain items such as anchovy paste. At one point, Granville opens a bottle of whisky to pour a drink for a promoter, and then charges him for the whole bottle. As a tribute, Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the kitchen. He occasionally speaks to the photo as if speaking to Arkwright, and continues to mock his late uncle's stutter as a joke. Throughout the series, Granville attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with Mavis, one of Arkwright's more indecisive and now-divorced customers who reciprocates Granville's feelings, but they are often stopped by Madge, Mavis's bitter sister. In response, Granville tries to set Madge up with Gastric, an overweight handyman who initially repulses Madge, though she gradually warms up to him. Granville's more frequent but reluctant customers include Wet Eric, Cyril, Mrs Hussein, Mrs Rossi, and Mrs Featherstone, who now has her eyes on Granville, to his dismay, but soon starts to intrude on the life of Wilburn Newbold, failing to detect that he is not interested, though Newbold often falls for Granville's ploys to keep him and Mrs Featherstone together so she will keep her eyes off him. At one point in the series, Granville is visited by Linda, Leroy's mother, who asks about her son's wellbeing. After she leaves, however, Granville does not tell Leroy, in order to stop him pursuing his mother and possibly ending up heartbroken. In the final episode of the sixth series, Granville proposes to Mavis, who accepts.

Under this IFRS and US GAAP authorized system, financial capital maintenance is always measured in units of constant purchasing power (CPP) in terms of a Daily CPI (consumer price index) during low inflation, high inflation, hyperinflation and deflation; i.e., during all possible economic environments. During all economic environments it can also be measured in a monetized daily indexed unit of account (e.g. the Unidad de Fomento in Chile) or in terms of a daily relatively stable foreign currency parallel rate, particularly during hyperinflation when a government refuses to publish CPI data. Authorized by the IASB during low inflation In the IASB's original Framework (1989), Par 104 (a), CPPA was authorized as an alternative to the traditional HCA model at all levels of inflation and deflation, including during hyperinflation as required in IAS 29. Income statement constant items like salaries, wages, rents, pensions, utilities, transport fees, etc. are normally valued in units of CPP during low inflation in most economies as an annual update. Payments in money for these items are normally inflation- adjusted by means of the consumer price index (CPI) to compensate for the erosion of the real value of money (the monetary medium of exchange) by inflation only on an annual not daily basis. \\"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\\" and can only erode the real value of money (the functional currency inside an economy) and other monetary items. Inflation can not and does not erode the real value of non-monetary items. Inflation has no effect on the real value of non-monetary items. Net monetary gains and losses authorized during low inflation and deflation in IFRS since 1989 Accountants have to calculate the net monetary loss or gain from holding monetary items when they choose the CMUCPP model and measure financial CMUCPP in the same way as the IASB currently requires its calculation and accounting during hyperinflation. The calculation and accounting of net monetary losses and gains during low inflation and deflation have thus been authorized in IFRS since 1989. There are net monetary losses and net monetary gains during low inflation too, but they are not required to be calculated when accountants choose the traditional HCA model. Net constant item gains and losses are also calculated and accounted under CMUCPP. Underlying assumptions IFRS authorize three basic accounting models: 1\\\\. Physical Capital Maintenance.https://insolvencyguardian.com.au/a-ifrsreporting/ 2\\\\. Financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units or Historical cost accounting (see the Framework (1989), Par 104 (a)). 3\\\\. Constant Purchasing Power Accounting (see the Framework (1989), Par 104 (a)). A. Under Historical cost accounting the underlying assumptions used in IFRS are: * Accrual basis: the effect of transactions and other events are recognized when they occur, not as cash is gained or paid. * Going concern: an entity will continue for the foreseeable future. * Stable measuring unit assumption: financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units or traditional Historical cost accounting; i.e., accountants consider changes in the purchasing power of the functional currency up to but excluding 26% per annum for three years in a row (which would be 100% cumulative inflation over three years or hyperinflation as defined in IFRS) as immaterial or not sufficiently important for them to choose financial capital maintenance in units of CPP during low inflation and deflation as authorized in IFRS in the Framework (1989), Par 104 (a). The stable measuring unit assumption (traditional Historical Cost Accounting) during annual inflation of 26% for 3 years in a row would erode 100% of the real value of all constant real value non-monetary items not maintained under the Historical Cost paradigm. B. Under Constant Purchasing Power Accounting the underlying assumptions in IFRS are: * Accrual basis: the effect of transactions and other events are recognized when they occur, not as cash is gained or paid. * Going concern: an entity will continue for the foreseeable future. * Measurement in units of CPP of all constant real value non-monetary items automatically remedies the erosion caused by the stable measuring unit assumption (Historical Cost Accounting) of the real non-monetary values of all constant real value non-monetary items never maintained constant at all levels of inflation and deflation. It is not low inflation, high inflation or hyperinflation doing the eroding. It is the implementation of the stable measuring unit assumption during low inflation, high inflation and hyperinflation. Constant real value non-monetary items are measured in units of CPP in terms of a daily rate at all levels of inflation and deflation. Monetary items are inflation-adjusted daily. Net monetary losses and gains are calculated when monetary items are not inflation-adjusted daily in terms of a daily rate. Variable items are measured in terms of IFRS and then updated daily in terms of a daily rate. All non-monetary items (variable real value non-monetary items and constant real value non-monetary items) in Historical Cost or Current Cost period-end financial statements are restated in terms of the period-end monthly published CPI during hyperinflation as required in IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.  Difference between US GAAP and IFRS  A major difference between US GAAP and IFRS is the fact that three fundamentally different concepts of capital and capital maintenance are authorized in IFRS while US GAAP only authorize two capital and capital maintenance concepts during low inflation and deflation: (1) physical capital maintenance and (2) financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units (traditional Historical Cost Accounting) as stated in Par 45 to 48 in the FASB Conceptual Satement N¬∫ 5. US GAAP does not recognize the third concept of capital and capital maintenance during low inflation and deflation, namely, financial CMUCPP as authorized in IFRS in the framework, Par 104 (a) in 1989. **Concepts of capital *Par 102 A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.IFRS, Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 102 *Par 103 The selection of the appropriate concept of capital by an entity should be based on the needs of the users of its financial statements. Thus, a financial concept of capital should be adopted if the users of financial statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or the purchasing power of invested capital. If, however, the main concern of users is with the operating capability of the entity, a physical concept of capital should be used. The concept chosen indicates the goal to be attained in determining profit, even though there may be some measurement difficulties in making the concept operational.IFRS, Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 103 Concepts of capital maintenance and the determination of profit *Par 104 The concepts of capital give rise to the following concepts of capital maintenance: **(a) Financial capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the financial (or money) amount of the net assets at the end of the period exceeds the financial (or money) amount of net assets at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period. Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of CPP. **(b) Physical capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the physical productive capacity (or operating capability) of the entity (or the resources or funds needed to achieve that capacity) at the end of the period exceeds the physical productive capacity at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period.IFRS, Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 The three concepts of capital defined in IFRS during low inflation and deflation are: * (A) Physical capital. See paragraph 102. * (B) Nominal financial capital. See paragraph 104 (a). * (C) Constant purchasing power financial capital. See paragraph 104 (a).Constant Purchasing Power Accounting The three concepts of capital maintenance authorized in IFRS during low inflation and deflation are: * (1) Physical capital maintenance: optional during low inflation and deflation. Current Cost Accounting model prescribed by IFRS. See Par 106. * (2) Financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units (Historical cost accounting): authorized by IFRS but not prescribed‚Äîoptional during low inflation and deflation. See Par 104 (a) Historical cost accounting. Financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units per se during inflation and deflation is a fallacy: it is impossible to maintain the real value of financial capital constant with measurement in nominal monetary units per se during inflation and deflation. * (3) Financial capital maintenance in units of CPP in terms of a Daily Consumer Price Index or daily rate at all levels of inflation and deflation (see the original Framework (1989), Par 104 (a)) [now Conceptual Framework (2010), Par. 4.59 (a)] under the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power paradigm.http://www.eiilmuniversity.co.in/downloads/Financial_Reporting.pdfpage 25 of 74 See also *Hyperinflation *Inflation accounting *List of International Financial Reporting Standards *Negative interest on excess reserves *Purchasing power *Unit of account References External links *Irving Fisher (1911) The Purchasing Power of Money Accounting systems Inflation Accounting terminology ","title":"Constant purchasing power accounting"},{"id":"20681329","text":"Old St Boniface Church, Bonchurch is a parish church in the Church of England located in Bonchurch, Isle of Wight.

Most corporations are, however, incorporated under the influential Delaware General Corporation Law. United States corporate law regulates the governance, finance and power of corporations in US law. Every state and territory has its own basic corporate code, while federal law creates minimum standards for trade in company shares and governance rights, found mostly in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by laws like the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The US Constitution was interpreted by the US Supreme Court to allow corporations to incorporate in the state of their choice, regardless of where their headquarters are. Over the 20th century, most major corporations incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law, which offered lower corporate taxes, fewer shareholder rights against directors, and developed a specialized court and legal profession. Nevada has done the same. Twenty-four states follow the Model Business Corporation Act,Lucian Bebchuk, The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power 118 Harvard Law Review 833, 844 (2004) while New York and California are important due to their size. History At the Declaration of Independence, corporations had been unlawful without explicit authorization in a Royal Charter or an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Since the world's first stock market crash (the South Sea Bubble of 1720) corporations were perceived as dangerous. This was because, as the economist Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations (1776), directors managed \\"other people's money\\" and this conflict of interest meant directors were prone to \\"negligence and profusion\\". Corporations were only thought to be legitimate in specific industries (such as insurance or banking) that could not be managed efficiently through partnerships.cf A Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, ch 1, ¬ß107 After the US Constitution was ratified in 1788, corporations were still distrusted, and were tied into debate about interstate exercise of sovereign power. The First Bank of the United States was chartered in 1791 by the US Congress to raise money for the government and create a common currency (alongside a federal excise tax and the US Mint). It had private investors (not government owned), but faced opposition from southern politicians who feared federal power overtaking state power. So, the First Bank's charter was written to expire in 20 years. State governments could and did also incorporate corporations through special legislation. In 1811, New York became the first state to have a simple public registration procedure to start corporations (not specific permission from the legislature) for manufacturing business.Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811 It also allowed investors to have limited liability, so that if the enterprise went bankrupt investors would lose their investment, but not any extra debts that had been run up to creditors. An early Supreme Court case, Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819), went so far as to say that once a corporation was established a state legislature (in this case, New Hampshire) could not amend it. States quickly reacted by reserving the right to regulate future dealings by corporations.cf William A. Klein and John C. Coffee, Business Organization and Finance 113‚Äì114 (9th edn 2004) cf Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 US 1 (1824) the right of Congress to regulate interstate trade under the commerce clause. Generally speaking, corporations were treated as \\"legal persons\\" with separate legal personality from its shareholders, directors or employees. Corporations were the subject of legal rights and duties: they could make contracts, hold property or commission torts,See Louisville C&CR; Co v Letson, 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), a corporation is \\"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\\" Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railway Co, 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854) \\"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. but there was no necessary requirement to treat a corporation as favorably as a real person. Joseph Keppler, Puck (January 23, 1889) Over the late 19th century, more and more states allowed free incorporation of businesses with a simple registration procedure.See M Dodd, American Business Association Law a Hundred Years Ago and Today in Law: A Century of Progress: 1835‚Äì1935 (Reppy 1937) 254 and Lawrence M. Friedman, A History of American Law (1973) 166‚Äì175 Many corporations would be small and democratically organized, with one-person, one-vote, no matter what amount the investor had, and directors would be frequently up for election. However, the dominant trend led towards immense corporate groups where the standard rule was one-share, one- vote. At the end of the 19th century, \\"trust\\" systems (where formal ownership had to be used for another person's benefit) were used to concentrate control into the hands of a few people, or a single person. In response, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was created to break up big business conglomerates, and the Clayton Act of 1914 gave the government power to halt mergers and acquisitions that could damage the public interest. By the end of the First World War, it was increasingly perceived that ordinary people had little voice compared to the \\"financial oligarchy\\" of bankers and industrial magnates.See L Brandeis, Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It (1914) In particular, employees lacked voice compared to shareholders, but plans for a post-war \\"industrial democracy\\" (giving employees votes for investing their labor) did not become widespread.The Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge passed \\"An Act to enable manufacturing corporations to provide for the representation of their employees on the board of directors\\" (April 3, 1919) Chap. 0070. This was a measure that allowed corporations to voluntarily give workers votes. It remains in the Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, ¬ß23 Through the 1920s, power concentrated in fewer hands as corporations issued shares with multiple voting rights, while other shares were sold with no votes at all. This practice was halted in 1926 by public pressure and the New York Stock Exchange refusing to list non-voting shares.See William Z. Ripley, Wall Street and Main Street (1927). The practice began again in 1986. It was possible to sell voteless shares in the economic boom of the 1920s, because more and more ordinary people were looking to the stock market to save the new money they were earning, but the law did not guarantee good information or fair terms. New shareholders had no power to bargain against large corporate issuers, but still needed a place to save. Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, people were being sold shares in corporations with fake businesses, as accounts and business reports were not made available to the investing public. The Wall Street Crash saw the total collapse of stock market values, as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced. They sold shares en masse, meaning many companies found it hard to get finance. The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close, and they laid off workers. Because workers had less money to spend, businesses received less income, leading to more closures and lay-offs. This downward spiral began the Great Depression. Berle and Means argued that under-regulation was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932, The Modern Corporation and Private Property. They said directors had become too unaccountable, and the markets lacked basic transparency rules. This led directly to the New Deal reforms of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. A new Securities and Exchange Commission was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public. Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place, new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies, on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable. Given these reforms, a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees, other stakeholders, and the rest of society.AA Berle, 'Corporate Powers As Powers in Trust' (1931) 44 Harvard Law Review 1049, EM Dodd, 'For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1145 and AA Berle, 'For Whom Corporate Managers Are Trustees: A Note' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1365 After World War II, a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue \\"shareholder value\\" but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders, for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends, or providing services for the good of the community instead of only pursuing profits, if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole.e.g. AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow, 13 N.J. 145, 98 A.2d 581, 39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) and Shlensky v Wrigley, 237 N.E. 2d 776 (Ill. App. 1968) However, different states had different corporate laws. To increase revenue from corporate tax, individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a \\"race to the bottom\\" to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state, particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate. \\"Charter competition\\", by the 1960s, had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations. This meant that the case law of the Delaware Chancery and Supreme Court became increasingly influential. During the 1980s, a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors' accountability. To fend off a takeover, courts allowed boards to institute \\"poison pills\\" or \\"shareholder rights plans\\", which allowed directors to veto any bid ‚Äì and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen. More and more people's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market, through pension funds, life insurance and mutual funds. This resulted in a vast growth in the asset management industry, which tended to take control of voting rights. Both the financial sector's share of income, and executive pay for chief executive officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce. The Enron scandal of 2001 led to some reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (on separating auditors from consultancy work). The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 of 2007 led to minor changes in the Dodd-Frank Act (on soft regulation of pay, alongside derivative markets). However, the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s. Corporations and civil law The state of Delaware is the place of incorporation for over 60 per cent of Fortune 500 corporations.See corplaw.delaware.gov. In 1999, from 6,530 publicly traded nonfinancial firms in the US, 3,771 (57.75%) were incorporated in Delaware, 283 (4.33%) in California, and 226 (3.46%) in New York.See L Bebchuk, A Cohen and A Ferrell, Does the Evidence Favor State Competition in Corporate Law? 90 California LR 1775, 1809‚Äì1810 (2002) Corporations are invariably classified as \\"legal persons\\" by all modern systems of law, meaning that like natural persons, they may acquire rights and duties. A corporation may be chartered in any of the 50 states (or the District of Columbia) and may become authorized to do business in each jurisdiction it does business within, except that when a corporation sues or is sued over a contract, the court, regardless of where the corporation's headquarters office is located, or where the transaction occurred, will use the law of the jurisdiction where the corporation was chartered (unless the contract says otherwise). So, for example, consider a corporation which sets up a concert in Hawaii, where its headquarters are in Minnesota, and it is chartered in Colorado, if it is sued over its actions involving the concert, whether it was sued in Hawaii (where the concert is located), or Minnesota (where its headquarters are located), the court in that state will still use Colorado law to determine how its corporate dealings are to be performed. All major public corporations are also characterized by holding limited liability and having a centralized management.c.f. RC Clark, Corporate Law (Aspen 1986) 2, who defines the modern public corporation by four main features: separate legal personality, limited liability, centralized management, and freely transferable shares. When a group of people go through the procedures to incorporate, they will acquire rights to make contracts, to possess property, to sue, and they will also be responsible for torts, or other wrongs, and be sued. The federal government does not charter corporations (except National Banks, Federal Savings Banks, and Federal Credit Unions) although it does regulate them. Each of the 50 states plus DC has its own corporation law. Most large corporations have historically chosen to incorporate in Delaware, even though they operate nationally, and may have little or no business in Delaware itself. The extent to which corporations should have the same rights as real people is controversial, particularly when it comes to the fundamental rights found in the United States Bill of Rights. As a matter of law, a corporation acts through real people that form its board of directors, and then through the officers and employees who are appointed on its behalf. Shareholders can in some cases make decisions on the corporation's behalf, though in larger companies they tend to be passive. Otherwise, most corporations adopt limited liability so that generally shareholders cannot be sued for a corporation's commercial debts. If a corporation goes bankrupt, and is unable to pay debts to commercial creditors as they fall due, then in some circumstances state courts allow the so-called \\"veil of incorporation\\" to be pierced, and so to hold the people behind the corporation liable. This is usually rare and in almost all cases involves non-payment of trust fund taxes or willful misconduct, essentially amounting to fraud. =Incorporation and charter competition= Although every state will have slight differences in their requirements, the process of forming a new corporation is usually quick.See generally, WA Klein and JC Coffee, Business Organization and Finance: Legal and Economic Principles (9th edn Foundation 2004) 137‚Äì140 A corporation is not the only kind of business organization that can be chosen. People may wish to register a partnership or a Limited Liability Company, depending on the precise tax status and organizational form that is sought.See also Limited liability limited partnership Most frequently, however, people will choose corporations which have limited liability for those who become the shareholders: if the corporation goes bankrupt the default rule is that shareholders will only lose the money they paid for their shares, even if debts to commercial creditors are still unpaid. A state office, perhaps called the \\"Division of Corporations\\" or simply the \\"Secretary of State\\",e.g. in Delaware see the Division of Corporations at corp.delaware.gov, in New York see the Division of Corporations at dos.ny.gov/corps, and in California see the \\"Business Entities\\" section of the Secretary of State website at sos.ca.gov/business will require the people who wish to incorporate to file \\"articles of incorporation\\" (sometimes called a \\"charter\\") and pay a fee. The articles of incorporation typically record the corporation's name, if there are any limits to its powers, purposes or duration, identify whether all shares will have the same rights. With this information filed with the state, a new corporation will come into existence, and be so be subject to legal rights and duties that the people involved create on its behalf. The incorporators will also have to adopt \\"bylaws\\" which identify many more details such as the number of directors, the arrangement of the board, requirements for corporate meetings, duties of officer holders and so on. The certificate of incorporation will have identified whether the directors or the shareholders, or both have the competence to adopt and change these rules. All of this is typically achieved through the corporation's first meeting. Corporate income tax as a share of GDP, 1946‚Äì2009. One of the most important things that the articles of incorporation determine is the state of incorporation. Different states can have different levels of corporate tax or franchise tax, different qualities of shareholder and stakeholder rights, more or less stringent directors' duties, and so on. However, it was held by the Supreme Court in Paul v Virginia that in principle states ought to allow corporations incorporated in a different state to do business freely. and see Henry N. Butler, Nineteenth century jurisdictional competition in the granting of corporate privileges (1985) 14(1) Journal of Legal Studies 129 This appeared to remain true even if another state (e.g. Delaware) required significantly worse internal protections for shareholders, employees, creditors than the state in which the corporation operated (e.g. New York). So far, federal regulation has affected more issues relating to the securities markets than the balance of power and duties among directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that one state's laws will govern the \\"internal affairs\\" of a corporation, to prevent conflicts among state laws.See Edgar v MITE Corp, White J., citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ¬ß 302, Comment b, pp. 307‚Äì308 (1971) Also VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v Examen Inc, 871 A2d 1108, 1113 (2005) 'The internal affairs doctrine applies to those matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholder.' So on the present law, regardless of where a corporation operates in the 50 states, the rules of the state of incorporation (subject to federal law) will govern its operation.Contrast the European Union decisions, including Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd (2003) C-167/01 and see Simon Deakin, Two Types of Regulatory Competition: Competitive Federalism versus Reflexive Harmonisation. A Law and Economics Perspective on Centros (1999) 2 Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies 231 Early in the 20th century, it was recognized by some states, initially New Jersey, that the state could cut its tax rate in order to attract more incorporations, and thus bolster tax receipts.See WL Cary, 'Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections on Delaware' (1974) 83(4) Yale Law Journal 663, 664, noting how under Woodrow Wilson acting as governor tightened New Jersey law, provoking Delaware to change its regulation. Quickly, Delaware emerged as a preferred state of incorporation.See William Ripley, Wall Street and Main Street (1927) 30, 'The little state of Delaware has always been forward in this chartermongering business.' In the 1933 case of Louis K. Liggett Co v Lee, Brandeis J. represented the view that the resulting \\"race was one not of diligence, but of laxity\\", particularly in terms of corporate tax rates, and rules that might protect less powerful corporate stakeholders. Over the 20th century, the problem of a \\"race to the bottom\\" was increasingly thought to justify Federal regulation of corporations. The contrasting view was that regulatory competition among states could be beneficial, on the assumption that shareholders would choose to invest their money with corporations that were well governed. Thus the state's corporation regulations would be \\"priced\\" by efficient markets. In this way it was argued to be a \\"race to the top\\".See RK Winter, 'State Law, Shareholder Protection, and the Theory of the Corporation' (1977) 6 J Leg Studies 251 An intermediate viewpoint in the academic literature,This is vast. See K Kocaoglu, 'A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law' (2008) Georgetown University Law Center Working Paper, on SSRN suggested that regulatory competition could in fact be either positive or negative, and could be used to the advantage of different groups, depending on which stakeholders would exercise most influence in the decision about which state to incorporate in.e.g. W Bratton, 'Corporate Law's Race to Nowhere in Particular' (1994) 44 U Toronto LJ 401. See also Under most state laws, directors hold the exclusive power to allow a vote on amending the articles of incorporation, and shareholders must approve directors' proposals by a majority, unless a higher threshold is in the articles. =Corporate personality= In principle a duly incorporated business acquires \\"legal personality\\" that is separate from the people who invest their capital, and their labor, into the corporation. Just as the common law had for municipal and church corporations for centuries,e.g. Case of Sutton's Hospital (1612) 77 Eng Rep 960 it was held by the Supreme Court in Bank of the United States v Deveaux that in principle corporations had legal capacity. At its center, corporations being \\"legal persons\\" mean they can make contracts and other obligations, hold property, sue to enforce their rights and be sued for breach of duty. Beyond the core of private law rights and duties the question has, however, continually arisen about the extent to which corporations and real people should be treated alike. The meaning of \\"person\\", when used in a statute or the US Bill of Rights is typically thought to turn on the construction of the statute, so that in different contexts the legislature or founding fathers could have intended different things by \\"person\\". For example, in an 1869 case named Paul v Virginia, the US Supreme Court held that the word \\"citizen\\" in the privileges and immunities clause of the US Constitution (article IV, section 2) did not include corporations. This meant that the Commonwealth of Virginia was entitled to require that a New York fire insurance corporation, run by Mr Samuel Paul, acquired a license to sell policies within Virginia, even though there were different rules for corporations incorporated within the state.The larger consequence was that insurance regulation remained state based, as the Court also held that insurance did not generally affect interstate commerce. This latter ruling was, however, overturned by United States v South-Eastern Underwriters Association, By contrast, in Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific Railroad Co, a majority of the Supreme Court hinted that a corporation might be regarded as a \\"person\\" under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Southern Pacific Railroad Company had claimed it should not be subject to differential tax treatment, compared to natural persons, set by the State Board of Equalization acting under the Constitution of California. However, in the event Harlan J held that the company could not be assessed for tax on a technical point: the state county had included too much property in its calculations. Differential treatment between natural persons and corporations was therefore not squarely addressed. In 2010\\"> In the late 20th century, however, the issue of whether a corporation counted as a \\"person\\" for all or some purposes acquired political significance. Initially, in Buckley v Valeo a slight majority of the US Supreme Court had held that natural persons were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their political campaigns. Over a strong dissent, the majority therefore held that parts of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 were unconstitutional since spending money was, in the majority's view, a manifestation of the right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. This did not affect corporations, though the issue arose in Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce. A differently constituted US Supreme Court held, with three dissents, that the Michigan Campaign Finance Act could, compatibly with the First Amendment, prohibit political spending by corporations. However, by 2010, the Supreme Court had a different majority. In a five to four decision, Citizens United v Federal Election Commission held that corporations were persons that should be protected in the same was as natural people under the First Amendment, and so they were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of money in donations to political campaigns. This struck down the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, so that an anti-Hillary Clinton advertisement (\\"Hillary: The Movie\\") could be run by a pro-business lobby group. Subsequently, the same Supreme Court majority decided in 2014, in Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc573 US _ (2014) that corporations were also persons for the protection of religion under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Specifically, this meant that a corporation had to have a right to opt out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which could require giving health care to employees that the board of directors of the corporation might have religious objections to. It did not specifically address an alternative claim under the First Amendment. The dissenting four judges emphasized their view that previous cases provided \\"no support for the notion that free exercise [of religious] rights pertain to for-profit corporations.\\"per Ginsburg J (dissenting), at page 14 of the dissent 573 US _ (2014) Accordingly, the issue of corporate personality has taken on an increasingly political character. Because corporations are typically capable of commanding greater economic power than individual people, and the actions of a corporation may be unduly influenced by directors and the largest shareholders, it raises the issue of the corruption of democratic politics.cf Kennedy J (dissenting) Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, =Delegated management and agents= Although a corporation may be considered a separate legal person, it physically cannot act by itself. There are, therefore, necessarily rules from the corporation statutes and the law of agency that attribute the acts of real people to the corporation, to make contracts, deal with property, commission torts, and so on. First, the board of directors will be typically appointed at the first corporate meeting by whoever the articles of incorporation identify as entitled to elect them. The board is usually given the collective power to direct, manage and represent the corporation. This power (and its limits) is usually delegated to directors by the state's law, or the articles of incorporation.e.g. DGCL ¬ß141(a), \\"The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\\" California Corporations Code ¬ß300(a) . NYBCL ¬ß701, \\"Subject to any provision in the certificate of incorporation authorized by ... [the] certificate of incorporation as to control of directors ... the business of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of its board of directors ... \\" This is a change from an old dictum in Manson v Curtis, 119 NE 559, 562 (NY 1918) where it was said that a director's powers are \\"original and undelegated\\". For support for this position, see Johannes Zahn, Wirtschaftsf√ºhrertum und Vertragsethik im Neuen Aktienrecht 95 (1934) reviewed by Friedrich Kessler (1935) 83 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 393 and Stephen Bainbridge, Director Primacy and Shareholder Disempowerment, 119(6) Harvard Law Review 1735, 1746, fn 59 (2006) Second, corporation laws frequently set out roles for particular \\"officers\\" of the corporation, usually in senior management, on or outside of the board. US labor law views directors and officers as holding contracts of employment, although not for all purposes.See NLRB v Bell Aerospace Co, excluding \\"managerial employees\\" from the scope of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 ¬ß2(3) and (11). See further A Cox, DC Bok, RA Gorman and MW Finkin, Labor Law Cases and Materials (14th edn 2006) 92‚Äì97 If the state law, or the corporation's bylaws are silent, the terms of these contracts will define in further detail the role of the directors and officers. Third, directors and officers of the corporation will usually have the authority to delegate tasks, and hire employees for the jobs that need performing. Again, the terms of the employment contracts will shape the express terms on which employees act on behalf of the corporation. The actions of all employees, in the course of employment become those of the corporation, when it goes right or wrong because it is thought that if a corporation takes the benefits of an employee's work, it should also take the burdens.cf Turberville v Stampe (1697) 91 ER 1072, per Lord Holt CJ Toward the outside world, the acts of directors, officers and other employees will be binding on the corporation depending on the law of agency and principles of vicarious liability (or respondeat superior). It used to be that the common law recognized constraints on the total capacity of the corporation. If a director or employee acted beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation (ultra vires), any contract would be ex ante void and unenforceable. This rule was abandoned in the earlier 20th century,See RS Stevens, 'A Proposal as to the Codification and Restatement of the Ultra Vires Doctrine' (1927) 36(3) Yale Law Journal 297 and MA Schaeftler, 'Ultra Vires ‚Äì Ultra Useless: The Myth of State Interest in Ultra Vires Acts of Business Corporations' (1983‚Äì1984) Journal of Corporation Law 81 and today corporations generally have unlimited capacity and purposes.Revised MBCA ¬ß3.01(a) presumption that a corporation's purpose is to 'engage in any lawful business unless a more limited purpose is set forth in the articles of incorporation.' Also ¬ß3.04, precludes a corporation from asserting ultra vires as a defense from having contracts enforced against it. However, not all actions by corporate agents are binding. For instance, in South Sacramento Drayage Co v Campbell Soup Co220 Cal App2d 851, (3d Dist 1963) it was held that a traffic manager who worked for the Campbell Soup Company did not (unsurprisingly) have authority to enter a 15-year exclusive dealing contract for intrastate hauling of tomatoes. Standard principles of commercial agency apply (\\"apparent authority\\"). If a reasonable person would not think that an employee (given his or her position and role) has authority to enter a contract, then the corporation cannot be bound.See further, Restatement of the Law of Agency (3rd edn 2006) However, corporations can always expressly confer greater authority on officers and employees, and so will be bound if the contracts give express or implied actual authority. The treatment of liability for contracts and other consent based obligations, however, differs to torts and other wrongs. Here the objective of the law to ensure the internalization of \\"externalities\\" or \\"enterprise risks\\" is generally seen to cast a wider scope of liability. =Shareholder liability for debts= One of the basic principles of modern corporate law is that people who invest in a corporation have limited liability. For example, as a general rule shareholders can only lose the money they invested in their shares. Practically, limited liability operates only as a default rule for creditors that can adjust their risk.LA Bebchuk and JM Freid, 'The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy' (1996) 105 Yale LJ 857, 881‚Äì890 Banks which lend money to corporations frequently contract with a corporation's directors or shareholders to get personal guarantees, or to take security interests their personal assets, or over a corporation's assets, to ensure their debts are paid in full. This means much of the time, shareholders are in fact liable beyond their initial investments. Similarly trade creditors, such as suppliers of raw materials, can use title retention clause or other device with the equivalent effect to security interests, to be paid before other creditors in bankruptcy.All such interests need to be registered to take effect under the Uniform Commercial Code art 9 However, if creditors are unsecured, or for some reason guarantees and security are not enough, creditors cannot (unless there are exceptions) sue shareholders for outstanding debts. Metaphorically speaking, their liability is limited behind the \\"corporate veil\\". The same analysis, however has been rejected by the US Supreme Court in Davis v Alexander, where a railroad subsidiary company caused injury to cattle that were being transported. As Brandeis J put it, when one \\"company actually controls another and operates both as a single system, the dominant company will be liable for injuries due to the negligence of the subsidiary company.\\" The International Court of Justice in Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd[1970] ICJ 1 acknowledged that there is invariably a principle of piercing the veil to prevent abuse of the corporate form. There are a number of exceptions, which differ according to the law of each state, to the principle of limited liability. First, at the very least, as is recognized in public international law,See Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd [1970] ICJ 1 courts will \\"pierce the corporate veil\\" if a corporation is being used evade obligations in a dishonest manner. Defective organization, such as a failure to duly file the articles of incorporation with a state official, is another universally acknowledged ground.e.g. MBCA ¬ß2.04 However, there is considerable diversity in state law, and controversy, over how much further the law ought to go. In Kinney Shoe Corp v Polan939 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1991) the Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that it would also pierce the veil if (1) the corporation had been inadequately capitalized to meet its future obligations (2) if no corporate formalities (e.g. meetings and minutes) had been observed, or (3) the corporation was deliberately used to benefit an associated corporation. However, a subsequent opinion of the same court emphasized that piercing could not take place merely to prevent an abstract notion of \\"unfairness\\" or \\"injustice\\".See Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc, 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992) A further, though technically different, equitable remedy is that according to the US Supreme Court in Taylor v Standard Gas Co known as the \\"Deep Rock doctrine\\" corporate insiders (e.g. directors or major shareholders) who are also creditors of a company are subordinated to other creditors when the company goes bankrupt if the company is inadequately capitalized for the operations it was undertaking. The trend in US corporate tort cases, particularly in oil spill disasters, as with The Amoco Cadiz case and in the Deepwater Horizon litigation, is to either pierce the corporate veil or hold parent corporations directly liable for the harm their enterprise causes. Tort victims differ from commercial creditors because they have no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic \\"enterprise\\", which usually composes groups of corporations, where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence.See generally AA Berle, 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343 A concept of \\"enterprise liability\\" was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and antitrust law that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation,Berkey v Third Avenue Railway, 244 NY 602 (1927) or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations.e.g. Walkovszky v Carlton 223 NE2d 6 (NY 1966). Contrast the dissent of Keating J and the Californian decision Minton v Cavaney, 56 Cal2d 576 (1961). Traynor J held the veil would be pierced when shareholders \\"provide inadequate capitalization and actively participate in the conduct of corporate affairs.\\" This meant the family of a girl who drowned in a swimming pool would be compensated. More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst oil spills in history, caused by the Amoco Cadiz which was owned through subsidiaries of the Amoco Corporation, the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure.In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz off the Coast of France on March 16, 1978, 1984 AMC 2123 (ND Ill 1984), McGarr J, at 2191, \\"As an integrated multinational corporation which is engaged through a system of subsidiaries in the exploration, production, refining, transportation and sale of petroleum products throughout the world, Standard is responsible for the tortious acts of its wholly owned subsidiaries and instrumentalities, AIOC and Transport.\\" The courts therefore \\"usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases\\" because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability.Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc, 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992) citing WM Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (1990) ¬ß 41.85 at 71, \\"courts usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases. This is because the party seeking relief in a contract case is presumed to have voluntarily and knowingly entered into an agreement with a corporate entity, and is expected to suffer the consequences of the limited liability associated with the corporate business form, while this is not the situation in tort cases.\\" c.f. Fletcher v Atex Inc 8 F.3d 1451 (2d Cir. 1995) Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the US Supreme Court in United States v Bestfoods held if a parent corporation \\"actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of\\" a subsidiary's facilities it \\"may be held directly liable\\". This leaves the question of the nature of the common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds.e.g. Texas Business Corporation Act of 1997, art 2.21(2) One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise liability regime, such as pro rata rather than joint and several liability is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size.Henry Hansmann and Reiner Kraakman, Towards Unlimited Liability for Corporate Torts 100(7) Yale Law Journal 1879, 1900‚Äì1901 (1991) A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in tort to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil. Corporate governance The New York Stock Exchange, along with Federal and state laws, is a significant regulator of corporate governance for listed corporations, particularly on shareholder voting rights and board structures. Corporate governance, though used in many senses, is primarily concerned with the balance of power among the main actors in a corporation: directors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.See Peter Gourevitch and James Shinn, Political Power and Corporate Control (Princeton 2005) 4 A combination of a state's corporation law, case law developed by the courts, and a corporation's own articles of incorporation and bylaws determine how power is shared. In general, the rules of a corporation's constitution can be written in whatever way its incorporators choose, or however it is subsequently amended, so long as they comply with the minimum compulsory standards of the law. Different laws seek to protect the corporate stakeholders to different degrees. Among the most important are the voting rights they exercise against the board of directors, either to elect or remove them from office. There is also the right to sue for breaches of duty, and rights of information, typically used to buy, sell and associate, or disassociate on the market.See Robert C. Clark, Corporate Law 86 (Aspen 1986) The federal Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, requires minimum standards on the process of voting, particularly in a \\"proxy contest\\" where competing groups attempt to persuade shareholders to delegate them their \\"proxy\\" vote. Shareholders also often have rights to amend the corporate constitution, call meetings, make business proposals, and have a voice on major decisions, although these can be significantly constrained by the board. Employees of US corporations have often had a voice in corporate management, either indirectly, or sometimes directly, though unlike in many major economies, express \\"codetermination\\" laws that allow participation in management have so far been rare. =Corporate constitutions= In principle, a corporation's constitution can be designed in any way so long as it complies with the compulsory rules set down by the state or federal legislature. Most state laws, and the federal government, give a broad freedom to corporations to design the relative rights of directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders in the articles of incorporation and the by-laws. These are written down during incorporation, and can usually be amended afterwards according to the state law's procedures, which sometimes place obstacles to amendment by a simple majority of shareholders.e.g. DGCL ¬ß242(b)(1) requires a resolution by the directors, and then a majority vote of shareholders, and the affected classes of shareholder. In the early 1819 case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward the US Supreme Court held by a majority that there was a presumption that once a corporate charter was made, the corporation's constitution was subject to \\"no other control on the part of the Crown than what is expressly or implicitly reserved by the charter itself.\\"cf William A. Klein and John C. Coffee, Business Organization and Finance 113‚Äì114 (9th edn 2004) \\"The decision evoked much contemporary protest, because to many it seemed to imply that once a corporate charter was granted, the corporation was beyond legislative control. In fact, its significance was more limited than this because, as Justice Story pointed out ... the state could insert a provision in any charter that it granted reserving its right to amend or further condition the charter.\\" On the facts, this meant that because Dartmouth College's charter could not be amended by the New Hampshire legislature, though subsequent state corporation laws subsequently included provisions saying that this could be done. Today there is a general presumption that whatever balance of powers, rights and duties are set down in the constitution remain binding like a contract would.cf, the English Court of Appeal case, Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame [1906] 2 Ch 34, cited in Jesse H. Choper, John C. Coffee and Ronald J. Gilson, Cases and Materials on Corporations (8th Edition 2012) Most corporation statutes start with a presumption (in contrast to old ultra vires rules) that corporations may pursue any purpose that is lawful,e.g. DGCL ¬ß102(b) whether that is running a profitable business, delivering services to the community, or any other objects that people involved in a corporation may choose. By default, the common law had historically suggested that all decisions are to be taken by a majority of the incorporators,Attorney General v Davy (1741) 26 ER 531, per Lord Hardwicke LC and that by default the board could be removed by a majority of shareholders for a reason they themselves determined.R v Richardson (1758) 97 ER 426, per Lord Mansfield However these default rules will take subject to the constitution that incorporators themselves define, which in turn take subject to state law and federal regulation. The NASDAQ is the second biggest stock in the US, after the New York Stock Exchange. It specializes in IT sector, that saw its first major crash with the Dot-com bubble of 2000. Although it is possible to structure corporations differently, the two basic organs in a corporate constitution will invariably be the general meeting of its members (usually shareholders) and the board of directors.cf Manson v Curtis, 223 NY 313, 119 NE 559 (1918) holding that the board of directors could not be effectively abolished so as to allow large shareholders to dominate. Boards of directors themselves have been subject in modern regulation to a growing number of requirements regarding their composition, particularly in federal law for public corporations. Particularly after the Enron scandal, companies listed on the major stock exchanges (the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and AMEX) were required to adopt minimum standards on the number of independent directors, and their functions. These rules are enforced through the threat of delisting by the exchange, while the Securities and Exchange Commission works to ensure ultimate oversight. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.01 requires that listed companies have a majority of \\"independent\\" directors.See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(1) \\"Independence\\" is in turn defined by Rule 303A.02 as an absence of material business relationship with the corporation, not having worked for the last three years for the corporation as an employee, not receiving over $120,000 in pay, or generally having family members who are.See NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.02 The idea here is that \\"independent\\" directors will exercise superior oversight of the executive board members, and thus decrease the likelihood of abuse of power. Specifically, the nominations committee (which makes future board appointments), compensation committee (which sets director pay), and audit committee (which appoints the auditors), are required to be composed of independent directors, as defined by the Rules.NYSE Rule 303A.04-06. See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(3)-(4) allows one of three directors to lack \\"independence\\" if he or she is not an officer or family member of an officer. Similar requirements for boards have proliferated across many countries,This is generally thought to have begun with the UK Cadbury Report. and so exchange rules allow foreign corporations that are listed on an American exchange to follow their home jurisdiction's rules, but to disclose and explain how their practices differ (if at all) to the market.e.g. NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.11 The difficulty, however, is that oversight of executive directors by independent directors still leaves the possibility of personal relationships that develop into a conflict of interest. This raises the importance of the rights that can be exercised against the board as a whole. =Shareholder rights= While the board of directors is generally conferred the power to manage the day-to-day affairs of a corporation, either by the statute, or by the articles of incorporation, this is always subject to limits, including the rights that shareholders have. For example, the Delaware General Corporation Law ¬ß141(a) says the \\"business and affairs of every corporation ... shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\\"DGCL ¬ß141(a) Also see DGCL ¬ß350, shareholder agreements may only affect a board's discretion in close corporations, and Galler v Galler, 32 Ill2d 16 (1964) However, directors themselves are ultimately accountable to the general meeting through the vote. Invariably, shareholders hold the voting rights,This is not inevitable, as in corporations without shareholders, or those which may choose to give a voice to employees, e.g. Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, ¬ß23 though the extent to which these are useful can be conditioned by the constitution. The DGCL ¬ß141(k) gives an option to corporations to have a unitary board that can be removed by a majority of members \\"without cause\\" (i.e. a reason determined by the general meeting and not by a court), which reflects the old default common law position.Attorney General v Davy (1741) 2 Atk 212 and R v Richardson (1758) 97 ER 426 However, Delaware corporations may also opt for a classified board of directors (e.g. where only a third of directors come up for election each year) where directors can only be removed \\"with cause\\" scrutinized by the courts.The case law on the meaning of \\"with cause\\" is conflicting. In New York, see Fox v Cody, 141 Misc 552, 252 NYS 395 (Sup Ct 1930) and Auer v Dressel, 306 NY 427, 118 NE 2d 590, 593 (1954) and in Delaware, see Campbell v Loew's Inc, 36 Del Ch 563, 134 A 2d 852 (Ch 1957) referring back to Auer. More corporations have classified boards after initial public offerings than a few years after going public, because institutional investors typically seek to change the corporation's rules to make directors more accountable.Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock, Embattled CEOs, 88(5) Texas Law Review 987, 1008 (2010) In principle, shareholders in Delaware corporations can make appointments to the board through a majority vote,DGCL ¬ß211(b) and can also act to expand the size of the board and elect new directors with a majority.DGCL ¬ß228 However, directors themselves will often control which candidates can be nominated to be appointed to the board. Under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, ¬ß971 empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission to write a new SEC Rule 14a-11 that would allow shareholders to propose nominations for board candidates. The Act required the SEC to evaluate the economic effects of any rules it wrote, however when it did, the Business Roundtable challenged this in court. In Business Roundtable v SEC,647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011) Ginsburg J in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals went as far to say that the SEC had \\"acted arbitrarily and capriciously\\" in its rule making. After this, the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to challenge the decision, and abandoned drafting new rules. This means that in many corporations, directors continue to have a monopoly on nominating future directors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has a statutory duty to regulate some aspects of director elections and shareholder voting rights, though its rule-making authority has continually been challenged by the Business Roundtable.See Business Roundtable v SEC, 647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011) and Business Roundtable v SEC, 905 F2d 406 (DC Cir 1990) Apart from elections of directors, shareholders' entitlements to vote have been significantly protected by federal regulation, either through stock exchanges or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Beginning in 1927, the New York Stock Exchange maintained a \\"one share, one vote\\" policy, which was backed by the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1940.See Joel Seligman, Equal Protection in Shareholder Voting Rights: The One Common Share, One Vote Controversy, 54 George Washington Law Review 687 (1986) This was thought to be necessary to halt corporations issuing non-voting shares, except to banks and other influential corporate insiders.See William Z. Ripley, Two Changes in the Nature and Conduct of Corporations 11(4) Trade Associations and Business Combinations 143 (1926); or Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York 695 However, in 1986, under competitive pressure from NASDAQ and AMEX, the NYSE sought to abandon the rule, and the SEC quickly drafted a new Rule 19c-4, requiring the one share, one vote principle. In Business Roundtable v SEC905 F 2d 406 (DC Cir 1990) the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck the rule down, though the exchanges and the SEC subsequently made an agreement to regulate shareholder voting rights \\"proportionately\\". Today, many corporations have unequal shareholder voting rights, up to a limit of ten votes per share.e.g. NYSE Listed Company Manual ¬ß313.00 Stronger rights exist regarding shareholders ability to delegate their votes to nominees, or doing \\"proxy voting\\" under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Its provisions were introduced to combat the accumulation of power by directors or management friendly voting trusts after the Wall Street Crash. Under SEC Rule 14a-1, proxy votes cannot be solicited except under its rules. Generally, one person soliciting others' proxy votes requires disclosure, although SEC Rule 14a-2 was amended in 1992 to allow shareholders to be exempt from filing requirements when simply communicating with one another,See, SEC Release No. 34-31326 (October 16, 1992) changing rules so that (1) preparing and filing proxy statements are not needed if a person is not seeking to obtain voting authority from another person, but owners of over $5m are required. (2) no prior review of preliminary proxy solicitation materials (3) proxies are required to unbundle proposals so there are separate votes on each. and therefore to take collective action against a board of directors more easily. SEC Rule 14a-9 prohibits any false or misleading statements being made in soliciting proxies. This all matters in a proxy contest, or whenever shareholders wish to change the board or another element of corporate policy. Generally speaking, and especially under Delaware law, this remains difficult. Shareholders often have no rights to call meetings unless the constitution allows,e.g. DGCL ¬ß211(d). See also, SEC 13d-5, dating from times when groups of investors were considered potential cartels, saying any 5% shareholder voting block must register with the Federal financial authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission. and in any case the conduct of meetings is often controlled by directors under a corporation's by-laws. However, under SEC Rule 14a-8, shareholders have a right to put forward proposals, but on a limited number of topics (and not director elections).SEC Rule 14a-8 outsourced workers, or supply chains.Economic Policy Institute, 'More compensation heading to the very top: 1965‚Äì2009 ' (May 16, 2011) Based on data from Wall Street Journal/Mercer, Hay Group 2010. On a number of issues that are seen as very significant, or where directors have incurable conflicts of interest, many states and federal legislation give shareholders specific rights to veto or approve business decisions. Generally state laws give the right for shareholders to vote on decision by the corporation to sell off \\"all or substantially all assets\\" of the corporation.DGCL ¬ß271, and cf Katz v Bregman, 431 A2d 1274 (1981) includes assets under 50% of the company's value. However fewer states give rights to shareholder to veto political contributions made by the board, unless this is in the articles of incorporation.cf the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 ss 366‚Äì368 and 378 One of the most contentious issues is the right for shareholders to have a \\"say on pay\\" of directors. As executive pay has grown beyond inflation, while average worker wages remained stagnant, this was seen important enough to regulate in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 ¬ß951. This provision, however, simply introduced a non-binding vote for shareholders, though better rights can always be introduced in the articles of incorporation. While some institutional shareholders, particularly pension funds, have been active in using shareholder rights, asset managers regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 have tended to be mute in opposing corporate boards, as they are often themselves disconnected from the people whose money they are voting upon. =Investor rights= Most state corporate laws require shareholders have governance rights against boards of directors, but fewer states guarantee governance rights to the real investors of capital. Currently investment managers control most voting rights in the economy using \\"other people's money\\".See earlier, LD Brandeis, Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It (1914) an JS Taub, 'Able but Not Willing: The Failure of Mutual Fund Advisers to Advocate for Shareholders' Rights' (2009) 34(3) The Journal of Corporation Law 843, 876 Investment management firms, such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley or BlackRock, are often delegated the task of trading fund assets from three main types of institutional investors: pension funds, life insurance companies, and mutual funds.See AA Berle, Property, Production and Revolution (1965) 65 Columbia Law Review 1 These are usually substitutes to save for retirement. Pensions are most important kind, but can be organized through different legal forms. Investment managers, who are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, are then often delegated the task of investment management. Over time, investment managers have also vote on corporate shares, assisted by a \\"proxy advice\\" firm such as ISS or Glass Lewis. Under ERISA 1974 ¬ß1102(a),ERISA 1974, 29 USC ¬ß1102 a plan must merely have named fiduciaries who have \\"authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan\\", selected by \\"an employer or employee organization\\" or both jointly. Usually these fiduciaries or trustees, will delegate management to a professional firm, particularly because under ¬ß1105(d), if they do so, they will not be liable for an investment manager's breaches of duty.29 USC ¬ß1105(d) These investment managers buy a range of assets (e.g. government bonds, corporate bonds, commodities, real estate or derivatives) but particularly corporate stocks which have voting rights. The largest form of retirement fund has become the 401(k) defined contribution scheme. This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, named after the Internal Revenue Code ¬ß401(k), which allows employers and employees to defer tax on money that is saved in the fund until an employee retires.26 USC ¬ß401(k) The individual invariably loses any voice over how shareholder voting rights that their money buys will be exercised.JS Taub, 'Able but Not Willing: The Failure of Mutual Fund Advisers to Advocate for Shareholders' Rights' (2009) 34(3) The Journal of Corporation Law 843, 876 Investment management firms, that are regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and ERISA 1974, will almost always take shareholder voting rights. By contrast, larger and collective pension funds, many still defined benefit schemes such as CalPERS or TIAA, organize to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are labor union organized Taft-Hartley plans,Taft- Hartley Act of 1947, 29 USC ¬ß186(c)(5)(B) and state public pension plans. A major example of a mixture is TIAA, established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918, which requires participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees.This followed Carnegie's attendance the Commission on Industrial Relations in 1916 to explain labor unrest. See W Greenough, It's My Retirement Money ‚Äì Take Good Care of It: The TIAA-CREF Story (Irwin 1990) 11‚Äì37, and E McGaughey, Participation in Corporate Governance (2014) ch 6(3) Under the amended National Labor Relations Act of 1935 ¬ß302(c)(5)(B) a union organized plan has to be jointly managed by representatives of employers and employees.29 USC ¬ß302(c)(5)(B) Many local pension funds are not consolidated and have had critical funding notices from the U.S. Department of Labor.See US Department of Labor, Critical, Endangered and WRERA Status Notices' (Retrieved August 11, 2016) But more funds with beneficiary representation ensure that corporate voting rights are cast according to the preferences of their members. State public pensions are often larger, and have greater bargaining power to use on their members' behalf. State pension schemes usually disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average more than a third of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries.See D Hess, 'Protecting and Politicizing Public Pension Fund Assets: Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Governance Structures and Practices' (2005‚Äì2006) 39 UC Davis LR 187, 195. The recommended Uniform Management of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act of 1997 ¬ß17(c)(3) suggested funds publicize their governance structures. This was explicitly adopted by a number of states, while others already followed the same best practice. For example, the California Government Code ¬ß20090 requires that its public employee pension fund, CalPERS has 13 members on its board, 6 elected by employees and beneficiaries. However, only pension funds of sufficient size have acted to replace investment manager voting. No federal law requires voting rights for employees in pension funds, despite several proposals.e.g., sponsored by Bernie Sanders, Workplace Democracy Act of 1999, HR 1277, Title III, ¬ß301. See further R Cook, 'The Case for Joint Trusteeship of Pension Plans' (2002) WorkingUSA 25. Most recently, the Employees' Pension Security Act of 2008 (HR 5754) ¬ß101 would have amended ERISA 1974 ¬ß403(a) to insert 'The assets of a pension plan which is a single-employer plan shall be held in trust by a joint board of trustees, which shall consist of two or more trustees representing on an equal basis the interests of the employer or employers maintaining the plan and the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries.' For example, the Joint Trusteeship Bill of 1989, sponsored by Peter Visclosky in the US House of Representatives, would have required all single employer pension plans to have trustees appointed equally by employers and employee representatives.See HR 2664 There is also currently no legislation to stop investment managers voting with other people's money, in the way that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ¬ß78f(b)(10) bans broker- dealers voting on significant issues without instructions.This was inserted by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 ¬ß957: Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ¬ß6(b)(10), 15 USC ¬ß78f(b)(10) =Employee rights= While investment managers tend to exercise most voting rights in corporations, bought with pension, life insurance and mutual fund money, employees also exercise voice through collective bargaining rules in labor law.See generally, A Cox, DC Bok, MW Finkin and RA Gorman, Labor Law: Cases and Materials (2011) part 11 and RL Hogler and GJ Grenier, Employee Participation and Labor Law in the American Workplace (1992) Increasingly, corporate law has converged with labor law.See the popular text by the former Dean of Harvard Law School, RC Clark, Corporate Law (1986) 32, 'even if your aim is not to understand all of law's effects on corporate activities but only to grasp the basic legal 'constitution' or make- up of the modern corporation, you must, at the very least, also gain a working knowledge of labor law.' The United States is in a minority of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries that, as yet, has no law requiring employee voting rights in corporations, either in the general meeting or for representatives on the board of directors.See further worker- participation.eu On the other hand, the United States has the oldest voluntary codetermination statute for private corporations, in Massachusetts since 1919 passed under the Republican governor Calvin Coolidge, enabling manufacturing companies to have employee representatives on the board of directors, if corporate stockholders agreed.Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, ¬ß23. This was originally introduced by An Act to enable manufacturing corporations to provide for the representation of their employees on the board of directors (April 3, 1919) Chap. 0070. Also in 1919 both Procter & Gamble and the General Ice Delivery Company of Detroit had employee representation on boards.NM Clark, Common Sense in Labor Management (1919) 28‚Äì29 In the early 20th century, labor law theory split between those who advocated collective bargaining backed by strike action, those who advocated a greater role for binding arbitration,See generally JR Commons and JB Andrews, Principles of Labor Legislation (1920) and US Congress, Report of the Committee of the Senate Upon the Relations between Labor and Capital (Washington DC 1885) vol II, 806 on Straiton & Storm and proponents codetermination as \\"industrial democracy\\".See Commission on Industrial Relations, Final Report and Testimony (1915) vol 1, 92 ff, and LD Brandeis, The Fundamental Cause of Industrial Unrest (1916) vol 8, 7672, C Magruder, 'Labor Copartnership in Industry' (1921) 35 Harvard Law Review 910 and S Webb and B Webb, The History of Trade Unionism (1920) Appendix VIII Today, these methods are seen as complements, not alternatives. A majority of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have laws requiring direct participation rights.See further, www.worker-participation.eu In 1994, the Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report examined law reform to improve collective labor relations, and suggested minor amendments to encourage worker involvement.Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report (1994) Congressional division prevented federal reform, but labor unions and state legislatures have experimented. The United Auto Workers at the Chrysler Corporation successfully made a collective agreement in 1980 to have employee directors on the board. Shareholding institutions tend to monopolize voting rights in corporations. Corporations are chartered under state law, the larger mostly in Delaware, but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose.n.b. The New Jersey Revised Statute (1957) ¬ß14.9-1 to 3 expressly empowered employee representation on boards, but has subsequently been left out of the code. See further JB Bonanno, 'Employee Codetermination: Origins in Germany, present practice in Europe and applicability to the United States' (1976‚Äì1977) 14 Harvard Journal on Legislation 947 Because of unequal bargaining power, but also historic caution of labor unions,e.g. RA Dahl, 'Power to the Workers?' (November 19, 1970) New York Review of Books 20 shareholders monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through collective agreements, as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through employee stock ownership plans, but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks that could not be diversified. Corporations included where workers attempted to secure board represented included United Airlines, the General Tire and Rubber Company, and the Providence and Worcester Railroad.See B Hamer, 'Serving Two Masters: Union Representation on Corporate Boards of Directors' (1981) 81(3) Columbia Law Review 639, 640 and 'Labor Unions in the Boardroom: An Antitrust Dilemma' (1982) 92(1) Yale Law Journal 106 However, in 1974 the Securities and Exchange Commission, run by appointees of Richard Nixon, rejected that employees who held shares in AT&T; were entitled to make proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors.American Telephone & Telegraph Company, CCH Federal Securities Law Reporter 79,658 (1974) see JW Markham, 'Restrictions on Shared Decision-Making Authority in American Business' (1975) 11 California Western Law Review 217, 245‚Äì246 This position was eventually reversed expressly by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 ¬ß971, which subject to rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board.This was subject to litigation in Business Roundtable v SEC, 647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011) but the SEC eventually produced implementing rules. Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions, for example, the United Auto Workers successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at Chrysler in 1980,JD Blackburn, 'Worker Participation on Corporate Directorates: Is America Ready for Industrial Democracy?' (1980‚Äì1981) 18 Houston Law Review 349 and the United Steel Workers secured board representation in five corporations in 1993.'The Unions Step on Board' (October 27, 1993) Financial Times However, it was clear that employee stock ownership plans were open to abuse, particularly after Enron collapsed in 2003. Workers had been enticed to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their retirement savings from 401(k) plans in Enron stock, against basic principles of prudent, diversified investment, and had no board representation. This meant, employees lost a majority of pension savings.PJ Purcell, 'The Enron Bankruptcy and Employer Stock in Retirement Plans' (March 11, 2002) CRS Report for Congress and JH Langbein, SJ Stabile and BA Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law (4th edn Foundation 2006) 640‚Äì641 For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation simply for investment of labor, without taking on undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with worker directors, though often linked to corporate stock.See RB McKersie, 'Union-Nominated Directors: A New Voice in Corporate Governance' (April 1, 1999) MIT Working Paper. Further discussion in E Appelbaum and LW Hunter, 'Union Participation in Strategic Decisions of Corporations' (2003) NBER Working Paper 9590 Directors' duties While corporate constitutions typically set out the balance of power between directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, additional duties are owed by members of the board to the corporation as a whole. First, rules can restrain or empower the directors in whose favor they exercise their discretion. While older corporate law judgments suggested directors had to promote \\"shareholder value\\", most modern state laws empower directors to exercise their own \\"business judgment\\" in the way they balance the claims of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Second, all state laws follow the historical pattern of fiduciary duties to require that directors avoid conflicts of interest between their own pursuit of profit, and the interests of the corporation. The exact standard, however, may be more or less strict. Third, many states require some kind of basic duty of care in performance of a director's tasks, just as minimum standards of care apply in any contract for services. However, Delaware has increasingly abandoned substantive objective duties, as it reinterpreted the content of the duty of care, allows liability waivers. =Stakeholder interests= Most states follow the approach in Shlensky v Wrigley,237 NE 2d 776 (Ill App 1968) that directors do not only need to maximize shareholder profits. They can balance the interests of all stakeholders, as in a decision to not put in floodlights to play nighttime baseball games, in the community's interest. Most corporate laws empower directors, as part of their management functions, to determine which strategies will promote a corporation's success in the interests of all stakeholders. Directors will periodically decide whether and how much of a corporation's revenue should be shared among directors' own pay, the pay for employees (e.g. whether to increase or not next financial year), the dividends or other returns to shareholders, whether to lower or raise prices for consumers, whether to retain and reinvest earnings in the business, or whether to make charitable and other donations. Most states have enacted \\"constituency statutes\\",28 states in 1991. See C Hansen, 'Other Constituency Statutes: A Search for Perspective' (1991) 46(4) The Business Lawyer 1355, Appendix A for a list of laws. The Connecticut General Statute Ann. ¬ß33-756 goes further than most in requiring directors take account of stakeholders. which state expressly that directors are empowered to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the way that their conscience, or good faith decisions would dictate. This discretion typically applies when making a decision about the distribution of corporate resources among different groups, or in whether to defend against a takeover bid. For example, in Shlensky v Wrigley the president of the Chicago Cubs baseball team was sued by stockholders for allegedly failing to pursue the objective of shareholder profit maximization. The president had decided the corporation would not install flood lights over the baseball ground that would have allowed games could take place at night, because he wished to ensure baseball games were accessible for families, before children's bed time. The Illinois court held that this decision was sound because even though it could have made more money, the director was entitled to regard the interests of the community as more important. Following a similar logic in AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow a New Jersey court held that the directors were entitled to make a charitable donation to Princeton University on the basis because there was \\"no suggestion that it was made indiscriminately or to a pet charity of the corporate directors in furtherance of personal rather than corporate ends.\\"39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) So long as the directors could not be said to have conflicting interests, their actions would be sustained. Dodge v Ford Motor Co notoriously held in 1919 that corporations had to be run \\"primarily for the profit of the stockholders\\" though most states, and the Supreme Court, have since followed the view that directors must balance all stakeholders' interests.See Lynn Stout, Why We Should Stop Teaching Dodge v. Ford, 3 Virginia Law and Business Review 163 (2008) Delaware's law has also followed the same general logic, even though it has no specific constituency or stakeholder statute.See Davis v Louisville Gas and Electric Co, 16 Del Ch 157 (1928) 'the directors are chosen to pass upon such questions and their judgment unless shown to be tainted with fraud is accepted as final. The judgment the directors of the corporation enjoys the benefit of a presumption that it was formed in good faith, and was designed to promote the best interests of the corporation they serve.' See also Unocal Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co, 493 A2d 946 (Del 1985) The standard is, however, contested largely among business circles which favor a view that directors should act in the sole interests of shareholder value. Judicial support for this aim is typically found in a case from Michigan in 1919, called Dodge v Ford Motor Company.170 NW 668 (Mich 1919) Here, the Ford Motor Company president Henry Ford had publicly announced that he wished not merely to maximize shareholder returns but to raise employee wages, decrease the price of cars for consumers, because he wished, as he put it, \\"to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number\\". A group of shareholders sued, and the Michigan Supreme Court said in an obiter dictum that a \\"business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.\\" However, in the case itself a damages claim against Ford did not succeed, and since then Michigan law has been changed.Michigan Business Corporation Act ¬ß¬ß251 and 541a(1)(c), and see Churella v Pioneer State Mutual Insurance Co, 671 NW2d 125 (2003) distinguishing Dodge. The US Supreme Court has also made it clear in Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc that shareholder value is not a default or overriding aim of corporate law,573 U.S. _ (2014) at page 23, \\"While it is certainly true that a central objective of for- profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives.\\" unless a corporation's rules expressly opt to define such an objective. In practice, many corporations do operate for the benefit of shareholders, but this is less because of duties, and more because shareholders typically exercise a monopoly on the control rights over electing the board. This assumes, however, that directors do not merely use their office to further their own personal goals over the interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. =Conflicts of interest= Since the earliest corporations were formed, courts have imposed minimum standards to prevent directors using their office to pursue their own interests over the interests of the corporation. Directors can have no conflict of interest. In trusts law, this core fiduciary duty was formulated after the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1719 in the United Kingdom. Keech v Sandford held that people in fiduciary positions had to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, and this rule \\"should be strictly pursued\\".[1726] EWHC Ch J76 It was later held that no inquiry should be made into transactions where the fiduciary was interested in both sides of the deal.See Whelpdale v Cookson (1747) 27 ER 856 These principles of equity were received into the law of the United States, and in a modern formulation Cardozo J said in Meinhard v Salmon that the law required \\"the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive ... at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\\"164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928) The standards applicable to directors, however, began to depart significantly from traditional principles of equity that required \\"no possibility\\" of conflict regarding corporate opportunities, and \\"no inquiry\\" into the actual terms of transactions if tainted by self- dealing. In a Delaware decision from 1939, Guth v Loft Inc,5 A2d 503 (Del 1939) it was held that Charles Guth, the president of a drink manufacturer named Loft Inc., had breached his duty to avoid conflicts of interest by purchasing the Pepsi company and its syrup recipe in his own name, rather than offering it to Loft Inc. However, although the duty was breached, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the court will look at the particular circumstances, and will not regard a conflict as existing if the company it lacked finances to take the opportunity, if it is not in the same line of business, or did not have an \\"interest or reasonable expectancy\\". More recently, in Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc,637 A2d 148 (Del Supr 1996) it was held that a non- executive director of CIS Inc, a man named Mr Broz, had not breached his duty when he bought telecommunications licenses for the Michigan area for his own company, RFB Cellular Inc.. CIS Inc had been shedding licenses at the time, and so Broz alleged that he thought there was no need to inquire whether CIS Inc would be interested. CIS Inc was then taken over, and the new owners pushed for the claim to be brought. The Delaware Supreme Court held that because CIS Inc had not been financially capable at the time to buy licenses, and so there was no actual conflict of interest. In order to be sure, or at least avoid litigation, the Delaware General Corporation Law ¬ß144 provides that directors cannot be liable, and a transaction cannot be voidable if it was (1) approved by disinterested directors after full disclosure (2) approved by shareholders after disclosure, or (3) approved by a court as fair.See also the Revised Model Business Corporation Act ¬ß8.61 and California Corporation Code ¬ß310 *Miller v Miller, 222 NW.2d 71 (1974) Corporate officers and directors may pursue business transactions that benefit themselves as long as they can prove the transaction, although self-interested, was nevertheless intrinsically \\"fair\\" to the corporation. *Lieberman v Becker, 38 Del Ch 540, 155 A 2d 596 (Super Ct 1959) *DGCL ¬ß144 contains the rule that the burden for proving unfairness remains on plaintiff after disclosure *Flieger v Lawrence, 361 A2d 218 (Del 1976) the burden of proof shifts onto the plaintiff to show a transaction was conflicted if approval by disinterested stockholders or directors has been given to a transaction. Also Remillard Brick Co v Remillard-Dandini Co, 109 Cal App2d 405 (1952) *Oberly v Kirby, 592 A2d 445, 467 (Del 1991) *Cinerama Inc v Technicolor Inc, 663 A2d 1156, 1170 (Del. 1995) *Benihana of Tokyo Inc v Benihana Inc., 906 A2d 114 (Del. 2006) =Duty of care= In Ultramares Corporation v Touche,174 NE 441 (1932) a case concerning Touche, Niven & Company (now Deloitte) across from the NYSE,At 30 Broad Street, New York City. Cardozo CJ held that the ordinary duty of care applicable to professionals performing services requires people to act \\"with the care and caution proper to their calling\\". The duty of care that is owed by all people performing services for others is, in principle, also applicable to directors of corporations. Generally speaking, the duty of care requires an objective standard of diligence and skill when people perform services, which could be expected from a reasonable person in a similar position (e.g. auditors must act \\"with the care and caution proper to their calling\\",See Ultramares Corporation v Touche, 174 N.E. 441 (1932) and builders must perform their work in line with \\"industry standards\\"See Terlinde v Neely, 275 SC 395, 271 SE2d 768 (1980)). In a 1742 decision of the English Court of Chancery, The Charitable Corporation v Sutton,(1742) 26 ER 642 the directors of the Charitable Corporation, which gave out small loans to the needy, were held liable for failing to keep procedures in place that would have prevented three officers defrauding the corporation of a vast sum of money. Lord Hardwicke, noting that a director's office was of a \\"mixed nature\\", partly \\"of the nature of a public office\\" and partly like \\"agents\\" employed in \\"trust\\", held that the directors were liable. Though they were not to be judged with hindsight, Lord Hardwicke said he could \\"never determine that frauds of this kind are out of the reach of courts of law or equity, for an intolerable grievance would follow from such a determination.\\" Many states have similarly maintained an objective baseline duty of care for corporate directors, while acknowledging different levels of care can be expected from directors of small or large corporations, and from directors with executive or non-executive roles on the board.e.g. Barnes v Andrews, 298 F 614 (SDNY 1924) A director of the Liberty Starter Co, now insolvent, was accused of having contributed to the failure by being inattentive on the board. Acknowledging the duty of care, but distinguishing on these facts, Learned Hand J held, \\"It is easy to say he should have done something, but that will not serve to harness upon him the whole loss, nor is it the equivalent of saying that, had he acted, the company would now flourish. An inattentive director or directors cannot be held liable for a corporate loss if it is shown that proper attentiveness to corporate affairs by all the directors would still not have prevented the loss complained of. In order words, it must be demonstrated that the accused director's slothfulness was a cause of the company's loss. This notion of causation is thus a critical element in any action brought against a poorly performing board of directors and has had a tremendous impact on the course of modern corporate governance.\\" However, in Delaware, as in a number of other states,e.g. Indiana Code Ann ¬ß23-1-35(1)(e)(2) requires willful misconduct or recklessness before any liability. c.f. Model Business Corporation Act ¬ß8.30(a) which requires a director act in good faith and what he or she reasonably believes to be in the company's best interests. the existence of a duty of care has become increasingly uncertain. In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation964 A 2d 106 (Del Ch 2009) ensured that no director of any major banking corporation could be held liable for breach of the duty of care, even though its risky practices caused the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008.See further, JC Coffee, 'What went wrong? An initial inquiry into the causes of the 2008 financial crisis' (2009) 9(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 1 In 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court passed one of its most debated judgments, Smith v Van Gorkom.488 A2d 858 (Sup Ct Del 1985) Before this, the leading case was Graham v Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co, 188 A2d 125 (Del Supr 1963) The directors of TransUnion, including Jerome W. Van Gorkom, were sued by the shareholders for failing to adequately research the corporation's value, before approving a sale price of $55 per share to the Marmon Group. The Court held that to be a protected business judgment, \\"the directors of a corporation [must have] acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.\\" Failing to act on an informed basis, if it caused loss, would amount to gross negligence, and here the directors were liable. The decision triggered a panic among corporate boards which believed they would be exposed to massive liability, and insurance firms who feared rising costs of providing directors and officers liability insurance to corporate boards. In response to lobbying, the Delaware General Corporation Law was amended to insert a new ¬ß102(b)(7). This allowed corporations to give directors immunity from liability for breach of the duty of care in their charter. However, for those corporations which did not introduce liability waivers, the courts subsequently proceeded to reduce the duty of care outright.See also Cinerama Inc v Technicolor, Inc, 663 A.2d 1156 (1995) directors proved the 'entire fairness' of a merger, selling to MacAndrews & Forbes Group, even though directors failed to conduct an adequate market check to determine if other bidders would have given a higher price. Van Gorkom was distinguished. In 1996, In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation698 A 2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996) required \\"an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists\\", and in 2003 In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation825 A 2d 275 (2003) went further. Chancellor Chandler held directors could only be liable for showing \\"reckless indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders\\" through actions that are \\"without the bounds of reason\\".See also, Brehm v Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (2000) Del Supreme Court, \\"Due care in the decisionmaking context is process due care only. Irrationality is the outer limit of the business judgment rule. Irrationality may be the functional equivalent of the waste test or it may tend to show that the decision is not made in good faith, which is a key ingredient of the business judgment rule.\\" In one of the cases that came out of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the same line of reasoning was deployed in In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Chancellor Chandler, confirming his previous opinions in Re Walt Disney and the dicta of Re Caremark, held that the directors of Citigroup could not be liable for failing to have a warning system in place to guard against potential losses from sub-prime mortgage debt. Although there had been several indications of the significant risks, and Citigroup's practices along with its competitors were argued to have contributed to crashing the international economy, Chancellor Chandler held that \\"plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove bad faith conduct by the director defendants\\". This suggested that Delaware law had effectively negated any substantive duty of care. This suggested that corporate directors were exempt from duties that any other professional performing services would owe. It remained unclear, with a change in the Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court in 2014, whether this position would remain. =Derivative suits= Because directors owe their duties to the corporation and not, as a general rule, to specific shareholders or stakeholders, the right to sue for breaches of directors duty rests by default with the corporation itself. The corporation is necessarily party to the suit.See generally Davenport v Dows, and Ross v Bernhard, This creates a difficulty because almost always, the right to litigate falls under the general powers of directors to manage the corporation day to day (e.g. Delaware General Corporation Law ¬ß141(a)). Often, cases arise (such as in Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc) where an action is brought against a director because the corporation has been taken over and a new, non-friendly board is in place, or because the board has been replaced after bankruptcy. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a conflict of interest because directors will be reluctant to sue their colleagues, particularly when they develop personal ties. The law has sought to define further cases where groups other than directors can sue for breaches of duty. First, many jurisdictions outside the US allow a specific percentage of shareholders to bring a claim as of right (e.g. 1 per cent).e.g., the German Aktiengesetz 1965 ¬ß148 This solution may still entail significant collective action problems where shareholders are dispersed, like the US. Second, some jurisdictions give standing to sue to non-shareholder groups, particularly creditors, whose collective action problems are less.e.g. BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders [2008] 3 SCR 560 Otherwise, third, the main alternative is that any individual shareholder may \\"derive\\" a claim on the corporation's behalf to sue for breach of duty, but such a derivative suit will be subject to permission from the court. Increasingly courts have denied that the board should restrict derivative suits, as in the 2003 case In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation824 A.2d 917 (2003) where it was held that an insider trading claim against Oracle Corp CEO Larry Ellison could proceed.The case was subsequently settled. See 'Oracle's Chief in Agreement to Settle Insider Trading Lawsuit' (September 12, 2005) NY Times The risk of allowing individual shareholders to bring derivative suits is usually thought to be that it could encourage costly, distracting litigation, or \\"strike suits\\" ‚Äì or simply that litigation (even if the director is guilty of a breach of duty) could be seen as counterproductive by a majority of shareholders or stakeholders who have no conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is generally thought that oversight by the court is justified to ensure derivative suits match the corporation's interests as a whole because courts may be more independent. However, especially from the 1970s some states, and especially Delaware, began also to require that the board have a role. Most common law jurisdictions have abandoned role for the board in derivative claims,See for example, the UK Companies Act 2006 ss 261‚Äì263 and in most US states before the 1980s, the board's role was no more than a formality.See RM Buxbaum, 'Conflict-of- Interest Statutes and the Need for a Demand on Directors in Derivative Actions' (1980) 68 Californian Law Review 1122 But then, a formal role for the board was reintroduced. In the procedure to bring a derivative suit, the first step is often that the shareholder had to make a \\"demand\\" on the board to bring a claim.Delaware Chancery Court Rules, Rule 23.1, requires exhaustion of internal remedies. Although it might appear strange to ask a group of directors who will be sued, or whose colleagues are being sued, for permission, Delaware courts took the view that the decision to litigate ought by default to lie within the legitimate scope of directors' business judgment. For example, in Aronson v Lewis473 A 2d 805, 812 (Del 1984) a shareholder of the Meyers Parking System Inc claimed that the board had improperly wasted corporate assets by giving its 75-year-old director, Mr Fink, a large salary and bonus for consultancy work even though the contract did not require performance of any work. Mr Fink had also personally selected all of the directors. Nevertheless, Moore J. held for the Delaware Supreme Court that there was still a requirement to make a demand on the board before a derivative suit could be brought. There was \\"a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best interests of the company\\", even if they owed their jobs to the person being sued. A requirement to make a demand on the board will, however, be excused if it is shown that it would be entirely \\"futile\\", primarily because a majority of the board is alleged to have breached its duty. Otherwise it must be shown that all board members are in some very strong sense conflicted, but merely working with the accused directors, and the personal ties this potentially creates, is insufficient for some courts.e.g. in New York, see Barr v Wackman 329 NE.2d 180 (1975) and In re Kaufmann Mutual Fund Actions, 479 F.2d 257 (1973) cert denied 414 US 857 (1973) This indicated a significant and controversial change in Delaware's judicial policy, that prevented claims against boards. In 1981, in Zapata Corp v Maldonado430 A 2d 779 (Del Sup 1981) the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Zapata Corp., founded by George H.W. Bush, could not be sued for breach of fiduciary duty. An \\"independent investigation committee\\" was competent to reject the demand for a derivative suit, despite being appointed by the board. In some cases corporate boards attempted to establish \\"independent litigation committees\\" to evaluate whether a shareholder's demand to bring a suit was justified. This strategy was used to pre-empt criticism that the board was conflicted. The directors would appoint the members of the \\"independent committee\\", which would then typically deliberate and come to the conclusion that there was no good cause for bringing litigation. In Zapata Corp v Maldonado the Delaware Supreme Court held that if the committee acted in good faith and showed reasonable grounds for its conclusion, and the court could be \\"satisfied [about] other reasons relating to the process\\", the committee's decision to not allow a claim could not be overturned. Applying Connecticut law, the Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held in Joy v North692 F.2d 880 (1982) that the court could substitute its judgment for the decisions of a supposedly independent committee, and the board, on the ground that there was scope for conflicting interests. Then, the substantive merits for bringing the derivative claim would be assessed. Winter J held overall that shareholders would have the burden \\"to demonstrate that the action is more likely than not to be against the interests of the corporation\\". This would entail a cost benefit analysis. On the benefit side would be \\"the likely recoverable damages discounted by the probability of a finding of liability\\", and the costs side would include \\"attorney's fees and other out-of-pocket expenses\\", \\"time spent by corporate personnel\\", \\"the impact of distraction of key personnel\\", and potential lost profits which may result from the publicity of a trial.\\" If it is thought that the costs exceed the benefits, then the shareholders acquire the right to sue on the corporation's behalf. A substantive hearing on the merits about the alleged breach of director's duty may be heard. The tendency in Delaware, however, has remained to allow the board to play a role in restricting litigation, and therefore minimize the chances that it could be held accountable for basic breaches of duty.c.f. more recently, In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation, 824 A.2d 917 (2003) concerning insider trading, approving a derivative claim on the basis of the director's personal ties. Minority shareholder protections *Ivanhoe Partners v Newmont Mining Corp., 535 A.2d 1334 (Del. 1987) a shareholder owning over 50% of shares is a controlling shareholder; but actual control may also be present through other mechanisms *Citron v Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp., 569 A.2d 53, 70 (Del. 1989) non-controlling shareholders do not owe duties to minority shareholders and may vote their shares for personal gain without concern *In re Cysive, Inc. Shareholders Litigation 836 A.2d 531 (Del. 2003) Nelson Carbonell owned 35% of Cysive, Inc., a publicly traded company. His associates' holdings and options to buy more stock, however, actually meant he controlled around 40% of the votes. Chancellor held that \\"without having to attract much, if any, support from public stockholders\\" Carbonell could control the company. This was especially so since \\"100% turn-out is unlikely even in a contested election\\" and \\"40% block is very potent in view of that reality.\\" *Kahn v Lynch Communications Systems, Inc. 638 A.2d 1110 (Del. 1994) Alcatel held 43% of shares in Lynch. One of its nominees on the board told the others, \\"you must listen to us. We are 43% owner. You have to do what we tell you.\\" The Delaware Supreme Court held that Alcatel did in fact dominate Lynch. *Perlman v Feldmann, 219 F.2d 173 (2d Cir 1955), certiorari denied, 349 US 952 (1955) held it was foreseeable that a takeover bidder wished to divert a corporate advantage to itself, and so the selling shareholders were required to pay the premium they received to the corporation *Jones v H.F. Ahmanson & Co. 1 Cal.3d 93, 460 P.2d 464 (1969) holders of 85% of comm shares in a savings and loan association, exchanged shares for shares of a new corporation and began to sell those to the public, meaning that the minority holding 15% had no market for the sale of their shares. Held, breach of fiduciary duty to the minority: \\"majority shareholders ... have a fiduciary responsibility to the minority and to the corporation to use their ability to control the corporation in a fair, just, and equitable manner.\\" *New York Business Corporation Law section 1104-a, the holders of 20 per cent of voting shares of a non-public corporation may request that the corporation be wound up on grounds of oppression. *NY Bus Corp Law ¬ß1118 and Alaska Plastics, Inc. v. Coppock, 621 P.2d 270 (1980) the minority can sue to be bought out at a fair value, determined by arbitration or a court. *Donahue v Rodd Electrotype Co of New England 367 Mass 578 (1975) majority shareholders cannot authorise a share purchase from one shareholder when the same opportunity is not offered to the minority. *In re Judicial Dissolution of Kemp & Beatley, Inc 64 NY 2d 63 (1984) under a \\"just and equitable winding up\\" provision, (equivalent to IA 1986 s 212(1)(g)), it was construed that less drastic remedies were available to the court before winding up, and \\"oppression\\" was said to mean 'conduct that substantially defeats the 'reasonable expectations' held by minority shareholders in committing their capital to the particular enterprise. A shareholder who reasonably expected that ownership in the corporation would entitle him or her to a job, a share of corporate earnings, a place in corporate management, or some other form of security, would oppressed in a very real sense when others in the corporation seek to defeat those expectations and there exists no effective means of salvaging the investment.' *Meiselman v Meiselman 309 NC 279 (1983) a shareholder's 'reasonable expectations' are to be determined by looking at the whole history of the participants' relationship. 'That history will include the 'reasonable expectations' created at the inception of the participants' relationship; those 'reasonable expectations' as altered over time; and the 'reasonable expectations' which develop as the participants engage in a course of dealing in conducting the affairs of the corporation.'

The burden then shifts to the defendant to show the fairness of the transaction. The court considers both the terms, and the process for the bargain, i.e. both a fair price, and fair dealing. However, if the director shows that full disclosure was made to either the disinterested directors or disinterested shareholders, then the burden remains on the plaintiff. *Revlon Inc v MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., 506 A.2d 173 (Del. 1985) *Hanson Trust PLC v ML SCM Acquisition, Inc, 781 F.2d 264 (2d Cir 1986), asset lock up in contested takeover, violation of duty of care *Unitrin Inc v American General Corp. *Unocal Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co 493 A.2d 946 (Del. 1985) *Moran v Household International Inc, 500 A.2d 1346 (Del. 1985) *Lacos Land Co v Arden Group Inc, 517 A 2d 271 (Del Ch 1986) *Paramount Communications Inc v QVC Network Inc, 637 A.2d 34 (Del. 1994) Corporate finance *US Securities and Exchange Commission *Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act *Stock certificate, Unissued stock and Treasury stock =Securities markets= *Securities Act of 1933 *Securities Exchange Act of 1934 *Williams Act *SEC Rule 10b-5, unlawful to make 'any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading.' *Blue Chip Stamps v.

History The church dates from 1847 and 1848 by the architect Ferrey.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner It was built to replace Old St Boniface Church, Bonchurch, which nevertheless has escaped demolition. The church is cruciform in shape with a south porch and two north vestries and an organ chamber. The bell turret contains a single bell which weighs 4cwt and is tuned to the key of Eb. Much of the funds for building the Church were paid for by Captain Swinburne, father of Algernon Swinburne, the poet. On the screen dividing the Rector's Stall from the nave is a memorial to Lord Admiral Earl Jellicoe of the Battle of Jutland, who worshipped here. Triptych East Windows are an early work by William Wailes and depicts various scenes of Christ's life on earth. The roundel window crowning the triptych depicts The Angels appearing to the Shepherds announcing Christ's birth. The windows around the church feature many saints including the East Anglian saints, St Benedict Biscop, tutor to the Venerable Bede, and St Edith. Much of the glass is by Henry Holiday and Shrigley and Hunt.

The design changes the way the pistons are connected to each other and to the crankshaft, emphasizing engine friction reduction. Additionally, by connecting the pistons to each other in a more efficient manner, it reduces the type and number of bearings on the crankshaft for further reductions in friction. The Brickley Engine was invented by Mike Brickley, an engineer from Austin, Texas. The engine configuration has three US patents.  History  Fascinated with the steam engine, Brickley designed and built a steam-powered bicycle while in high school. Interest in other types of heat engines followed, each with its accompanying acquired knowledge base. A breadth of disciplines including thermodynamics, engineering design, and hands-on machine tool experience as each applies to the steam engine, the Stirling engine, and the internal combustion engine, allowed for an unusual way to view the problem of engine friction. Based on this knowledge history, he created the design for the Brickley Engine. Three U.S. patents were granted: 7,219,647, 7,481,188, and 8,047,178. The Brickley Engine was included in The New York Times Magazine's eight-annual \\"The Year in Ideas\\" issue (2008) where it was highlighted as one of the most notable inventions of the year.  Design  The design of the Brickley Engine differs to that of a standard four-cylinder engine because it implements a new force transfer mechanism that eliminates the need of many traditional parts in a standard four-cylinder engine, such as the piston skirts and multiple connecting rods. In this transfer mechanism, there can be two opposing pairs of pistons located on opposite sides where each piston has a forward and a reverse stroke. The strokes of the two opposing pistons in each opposing pair are synchronized in both directions. These pistons can be linked to a single connecting rod at a pivot point to drive a crankshaft. The focus of the design in each of its embodiments is to reduce the distance traveled by the loaded areas of oil being sheared inside the engine. = Benefits = Implementing this design in modern vehicles can have multiple benefits as compared to a standard four-cylinder engine: *Lower CO2 and better fuel efficiency for any given displacement; SI or CI engine. *Because of a short crankshaft, greater compatibility with hybrid power train. *Allows for a four cylinder version of the engine to be internally balanced eliminating the need for a balance shaft. *Less expensive, lighter crankshaft. A single throw crankshaft uses less material, is easier to manufacture, and cheaper to produce than one typically having four throws and five main bearings. *Because of the efficiency of squeeze films at the pins, an increase in reciprocating mass plays a much less important role. *Friction gains retained with engine down-speeding. *Being that the cylinders are connected to each other before being connected to the crankshaft, the forces transferred from one cylinder to another, are done more efficiently at a small fraction of the losses usually incurred. With the improvement in the efficient management of the forces created within the engine, the energy that would normally be lost in a standard four cylinder engine is converted into power. With the configuration of the Brickley Engine, it is calculated that the engine would improve fuel mileage and cut CO2 emissions by 15-20%.  Proof-of-Concept engine  As of February 2018 a 692cc proof-of-concept engine had been built. Preliminary test results show FMEP @ 1550 rpm is 0.18 Bar (using 10W-40 oil @135 degrees F). Most engines are over twice this amount of friction. Inventor Mike Brickley discussed his proof-of-concept engine on a reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) in April 2018.https://www.reddit.com/r/Skookum/comments/8cggu7/im_mike_brickley_inventor_of_the_brickley_engine/ In April 2020 Brickley discussed engine test results in a couple of threads on engineering forum Eng-tips.com. https://www.eng- tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=467756 https://www.eng- tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=467961 From the fuel consumption graphs @2600 rpm, savings at BMEPs of 2bar and 4bar (approximations for light cruise and easy acceleration) would be 34% and 21% respectively.

It is the first in Henryson's collection known as the Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian. The Cok and the Jasp is framed by a prologue and a moralitas, and as the first poem in the collection it operates on a number of levels, and in all its parts, to introduce the larger cycle. Sources Grain gathering in the 14th century Although the Aesopian tale of The Cock and the Jewel, which Henryson re-tells, is typically simple, it is one of the most ambiguous in the fable canon. It presents what is, in effect, a riddle on relative values with almost the force of a k≈çan. One modern translation of the fable, in its most cogent form, runs thus: The standard medieval interpretation of the fable, however (which Henryson follows) came down firmly against the cockerel on the grounds that the jewel represents wisdom rather than mere wealth or allure. This interpretation is expressed in the verse Romulus, the standard fable text across Europe in that era, written in the lingua franca, Latin. Henryson tacitly acknowledges this \\"source\\" in his own expanded version by claiming to be making a \\"translatioun\\" from the Latin and directly quoting some of its lines.Henryson directly quotes the second line of the prologue to the verse Romulus, \\"Dulcius arrident seria picta iocis,\\" in his own prolog ‚Äî a clear and deliberate identifier of his auctor. See Edward Wheatley, Mastering Aesop: Medieval Education, Chaucer and his Followers, University Press of Florida, 2000. p.152. The Romulus was a standard classroom text used in primary education to teach Latin. Since The Cock and the Jewel (De Gallo et Jaspide) was the first fable in this standard collection, it was, de facto, a universally familiar text in literary consciousness throughout Europe. Prologue There is little doubt that the succinct prolog which leads into the Cok and the Jasp is intended to introduce a general collection of Fabillis, not solely the Fabill of the Cok and the Jasp.The textual witnesses which place Henryson's Cok and the Jasp at the head of the sequence (as also occurs in the verse Romulus) include the Charteris and Bassandyne editions of 1570 and 1571 respectively. Earlier manuscript witnesses, being more fragmented, do not universally make this clear. See John MacQueen, Complete and Full with Numbers: The Narrative Poetry of Robert Henryson. Scottish Cultural Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 5. Rodopi. Amsterdam/New York. 2006. p.283. It opens with a defense of poetry (expanded from the verse Romulus), presents an apologia for making the translatioun, establishes the first person narrator, summarises Aesop's work and provides a bridging passage into the First Fabill. left The first four stanzas develop a general argument that fiction, even though it may be feinyeit by nature, can have a sound moral purpose at heart, and that stories which are pleisand (line 4) or merie (line 20) are better suited to convey wisdom than dry scholastic writing. Henryson develops his meaning using three images; cereal cultivation (stanza 2), the nuttis schell (stanza 3) and the bowstring (stanza 4). In stanza 5 (the middle stanza of the prolog) the narrator identifies and directly addresses his audience for the first time as my maisteris, or in other words, his own university educated peers. The writer, in effect, is figuring himself in the role of student before his teachers (his readers). The stanza also makes cryptic reference to an unnamed commissioning patron for the poem who may or may not have existed.The poem (says the narrator) was not written on his own vane presumptioun, but: :...be requeist and precept of ane lord :Of quhome the name it neidis not record. : (M.F. lines 34-5) Most critics express doubt there was any such actual patron, but the possibility cannot strictly be ruled out. The humility topos continues into the next stanza where the narrator pretends to have no understanding of eloquence and an ability only to write in rude and hamelie language, a self-deferential reference to his choice to create poetry in Scots rather than Latin. He concludes by inviting his readers to correct any mistakes they may find. A brief precis of Aesop's fable literature then follows in the next three stanzas with a stark view of its purposes and some comments on how animal behaviour and human nature compare.For instance: :Na mervell is ane man be lyke ane beist :Quhilk lufis ay carnal and foull delyte; :That schame can not him renye nor arreist... : (M.F. lines 50-53) The ninth stanza ends with a swift bridging passage into the first Fabill. Fable right Of all the thirteen taillis, the Cok and the Jasp most pretends to be like the static and conventional re-tellings more usual in fable genre. Henryson's innovation and development from his sources chiefly involve presenting an unusually well- rounded, imaginatively realised figure of the cok in a specific and concretely drawn setting. He establishes explicit reasons for the loss of the jasp and sets the location for its discovery as a midden. He also expands the cockerel's arguments and ultimate reasons for the rejection of the jasp as a carefully orchestrated passage of fully fleshed oration which nonetheless continues to sound as if it is being delivered in the voice of a cockerel. But since this is not so much a story ‚Äî more a strongly drawn vignette ‚Äî the fabill does not yet fully live up to the requirements for fully effective storytelling argued for in the prolog. This will come in the subsequent fabillis, and so, in a sense, the First Fabill partly acts to defer reader's expectations. The cok addresses the stone directly, acknowledges its worth, recognises it has been misplaced and argues, realistically enough, that to him it is of no practical use. The jasp, he says, is an object that belongs more properly to a lord or king (line 81), while he is content simply to satisfy his humble wants in draf, corn, wormis and snaillis ‚Äî his daily meit. The rhetorical climax comes in the seventh stanza of the fabill in which the cok, rising on a number of rhetorical questions, finishes with an almost fantastical exortation for the stone to levitate and transport itself back to some more royal place: :Quhar suld thow mak thy habitatioun? :Quhar suld thow duell bot in ane royall tour? :Quhar suld thow sit bot on ane kingis croun, :Exaltit in worschip and in grit honour? :Rise gentill jasp, of all stanis the flour :Out of this midding, and pas quhar thow suld be; :Thow ganis not for me, nor I for the. (M.F. lines 106-112) And the cock, leaving the jasp, exits the poem to seek his meit (line 114). Moralitas St Peter and the Cock. The poet immediately follows the taill with a moralitas. This was a common device in medieval and renaissance fable literature, and its use here establishes the convention that Henryson will employ consistently through all thirteen of the Morall Fabillis. In this case, however, before the Moralitas properly begins, stanza 18 (the ninth stanza of the fabill) as a footnote to the taill, intercedes with a compressed account of the qualities of the jasp, including its protective properties, which almost instantly casts doubt on the wisdom of the cock's decision. For example, lines 125-6: :Quha hes this stane sall have gude hap to speid, :Of fyre nor water him neidis not to dreid. In a sense, stanza 18 presents a new riddle and, to be answered, requires the cock's argument to be turned. The Moralitas proper is usually given to begin after stanza 18 in most textual witnesses except Bannatyne.See the Charles Elliot edition of Robert Henryson's poems, Oxford Clarendon Press, reprint 1978. (Note to Morall Fabillis, line 120). Page 147. Its five stanzas come down explicitly against the cock and so, by implication, present a conceit of closure on Aesop's more open and enigmatic original. The narrator minces no words in expressing how serious the cockerel's error has been in rejecting the stone because, he says, the jasp represents science, in the sense of wisdom, which he defines in terms that bring it close in meaning to concepts like dharma. In the final stanza he laments mankind's general failure to respect and comprehend these values: :Bot now, allace, this jasp is tynt and hid; :We seik it nocht, nor preis it for to find‚Ä¶ He closes, with pretended indifference, by advising the reader, if he so wishes, to go seek the jasp where it lies.Henryson closes the fabill moralitas: \\"Of this mater to speik it wer bot wind;/Thairfore I ceis and will na forther say:/Ga seek the jasp, quha will, for thair it lay. (M.F. lines 159-61.) Themes Heraldic cockerel with grain Henryson's expansion of Aesop's fable makes its inferences concrete, introduces complexity and raises a large number of themes in a very short space. In relation to other known fable literature in Europe up to that time, the loading is extremely rich. Even though the moralitas comes down sincerely and emphatically on the side of the rejected stone, nevertheless, the cockerel has raised questions that are not necessarily easily resolved. The subsequent poems will appear to further intensify many of those doubts and dichotomies rather than resolving them. Therefore, the riddling aspect to the Aesopian original is, in some regards, not ultimately overturned and is arguably maintained as part of the fabric of the poem. Among the specific issues touched on or implied in Henryson's expansion are questions of fiction and truth, appetite, self-interest, fecklessness, materialism, duty, wisdom, hierarchy, equality, education, social order, government, the nature of aristocracy, the nature of royalty and many others. There is also the question of who the cockerel ultimately represents and whether, in some sense, Henryson's poem itself is ultimately the jasp which the reader has encountered \\"in the midden\\" to take or leave as he or she wishes. Opening lines It is worth noting that the opening of Henryson's Prolog to the Morall Fabillis echoes the opening lines of John Barbour's Brus. It is therefore a variation on the theme of the relation between truth and report in literature. For comparison, the first ten lines, of The Brus, composed in the 1370s, run: :Storyss to rede ar delitibill :Suppos that thai be nocht but fabill, :Than suld storys that suthfast wer :And thai war said on gud maner :Have doubill plesance in heryng. :the first plesance is the carpyng, :And the tother the suthfastnes :That shawys the thing rycht as it wes, :And suth thyngis that ar likand :Till mannys heryng ar plesand. (Barbour, The Brus, lines 1-10) Henryson's first stanza, written just over a century later, uses a number of the same (or similar) terms, but, in shorter space, generates a slightly less sanguine impression of the relation between narrative, audience and subject. The differences are subtle, but distinct: :Thocht feinyit fabillis of ald poetre :Be not al grunded upon truth, yit than :Thair polite termes of sweit rhetore :Richt plesand ar unto the eir of man; :And als the caus that thay first began :Wes to repreif the haill misleving :Off man be figure of ane uther thing. (Henryson, Morall Fabillis, lines 1-7) Numbers The first fabill, in all its three parts, occupies 23 stanzas, distributed 9‚Äî9‚Äî5. *Prolog: 9 stanzas *Fabill: 9 stanzas, including stanza 18 on the properties of the jasp (see above). *Moralitas: 5 stanzas Because of the ambiguity of the status of stanza 18 (as in a sense a second \\"mini\\" moralitas) the count could be interpreted as * 9‚Äî8‚Äî6, or even perhaps, * 9‚Äî8‚Äî1‚Äî5.

Background After defeating the Carthaginian navy sent to stop them from reaching Africa at the battle of Cape Ecnomus, the Romans landed close to Aspis, to the south of Carthage. Battle The Romans moved to besiege Aspis by building a trench and palisade to defend their ships. Carthage was not yet prepared to fight on land and the city fell after the garrison made a short resistance.Siege of Aspis, 256 B.C. Rickard, J (10 May 2007), Siege of Aspis, 256 BC. Retrieved on December 13, 2008. By taking Clupea, the Romans controlled the area of land opposite to Carthage and secured their rear in order to scour the enemy before them. The Romans forced Aspis to surrender, and having left in their place a proper garrison, they sent some messengers to Rome to inform them of their success and to receive instructions on the next measures to be pursued. They then decamped with all their forces, and marched through the country to plunder it. Aftermath After defeating the Carthaginians, the Romans dispatched most of their fleet back to Rome except for a number of 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. The rest of the army, under the command of Marcus Atilius Regulus, remained in North Africa. Advancing inland and plundering the territory along the way, they stopped at the city of Adys.

The final phase involved the 24 teams that finished in the top three in each group in the group stage and the eight teams that finished in third place in the UEFA Champions League group stage. Each tie in the final phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals are also equal, 30 minutes of extra time were played. If goals were scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, there would be a penalty shootout after extra time. In the draw for the Round of 32, matches were played between the winner of one group and the third-placed team of a different group, and between the runners-up of one group and the third-placed team from a Champions League group. The only restriction on the drawing of teams in the Round of 32 was that the teams must not be from the same national association or have played in the same group in the group stages. From the Round of 16 onwards, these restrictions did not apply. In the final, the tie was played over just one leg at a neutral venue. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores had remained tied.

The draw saw each UEFA Cup group winner paired with the third-placed team from another UEFA Cup group and each UEFA Cup group runner-up paired with a third-placed team from the UEFA Champions League, with the only restriction on the draw being that teams from the same national association could not be drawn together.

Hilkene (November 4, 1925 - April 26, 1990) was the captain and starting left tackle of the undefeated 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team. The team defeated the USC Trojans 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl and has been selected as the greatest Michigan football team of all time. Hilkene was named captain of the 1945 team but missed the season due to wartime service in the U.S. Navy. In 1947 he returned as captain. Hilkene later served for many years as an executive at General Motors. He was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1992. Youth Hilkene was a native of Indianapolis, Indiana, where he attended Shortridge high school. College football =Early seasons= He joined the Michigan Wolverines football team as a 17-year-old freshman in September 1943 where he was a reserve player. Hilkene later joked that he was a \\"retired end\\" in 1943, \\"retired to the bench so long he didn't earn a letter.\\" At the start of the 1944 season, Hilkene competed for the starting lineup at the end position with Art Renner and Dick Rifenberg. Hilkene won the job and was the starting left end in nine of the team's ten games in 1944. The team was 8-2 that year, outscoring opponents 204-91. On his 19th birthday, Hilkene scored his first and only collegiate touchdown on a pass from Howard Yerges in a 41-19 win over the University of Pennsylvania. At the conclusion of the 1944 season, Hilkene was selected by the Big Ten coaches as an Honorable Mention player on the Associated Press All Western Conference Team. In December 1944, Hilkene was also voted by the Michigan players to be the captain of the 1945 football team. Hilkene also played basketball as a backup center for Michigan in 1944 and 1945. =Military service= As a sophomore in 1944, Hilkene enlisted in the U.S. Navy and participated in the V-12 Navy College Training Program while continuing his studies in Ann Arbor. In mid-February 1945, Hilkene was transferred from the university for advance military training. At the time of his transfer to active duty, newspapers published a photograph of Coach Fritz Crisler saying farewell to Hilkene with the following caption: > \\"Losing football players and captains is getting to be an old wartime story > for Michigan's grid coach, Fritz Crisler. Crisler here is saying 'so long > and best of luck' to Bruce Hilkene, Indianapolis, Ind., football captain > elect. Hilkene has been transferred from Michigan to an advanced Navy > training base.\\" Hilkene missed the 1945 season due to his military service. =1946 season= Hilkene returned to the Michigan football team for the 1946 season, but was moved to left tackle where Coach Fritz Crisler needed Hilkene's \\"fast-charging ability for an aggressive offensive line.\\" Hilkene proved to be a \\"line standout.\\" With the return of numerous players from military service, the 1946 team had five present and former team captains competing for a spot in the lineup: Art Renner, Joe Ponsetto, Bob Wiese, Paul White and Hilkene. Hilkene won a starting spot as left tackle in six of Michigan's nine games in 1946. At the end of the season, Hilkene was named an Honorable Mention at the tackle position on the Associated Press 1946 All-America Team. Having been unable to assume his position as captain of the 1945 team due to military service, Hilkene received the honor again when the Michigan players voted at the end of the 1946 season to name Hilkene, then a 193-pound tackle, as captain of the 1947 team. =1947 season= Best team in Michigan history Bump Elliott, Pete Elliott (No. 45), Fritz Crisler and Hilkene (No. 75) celebrate 1947 Big 9 championship after defeating Wisconsin. The 1947 Michigan football team captained by Hilkene went undefeated in the regular season and went on to defeat USC 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game. The 1947 team outscored its opponents 394-53 and was selected by the ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia as the best team in the history of Michigan football. The team had two first-team All-Americans, Bob Chappuis and Bump Elliott, and its performance in the 1948 Rose Bowl still stands as the most points scored, and the largest margin of victory, in Rose Bowl history. The 1947 team is also remembered as the first team fully to embrace the concept of defensive and offensive specialization. Previously, most players had played their positions on both offense and defense. But in 1947, Coach Fritz Crisler established separate offensive and defensive squads. Only Bump Elliott and Jack Weisenberger played on both squads. In November 1947, Time magazine ran a feature article about the 1947 Wolverines (with Bob Chappuis‚Äô photograph on the cover) focused on the new era of specialization marked by Crisler‚Äôs decision to field separate offensive and defensive units.‚Äù Offensive line play Hilkene played on the offensive unit in Crisler's team of specialists, and seldom played on defense. Hilkene won praise both for his line play and for his leadership on the 1947 squad. He was one of the key blockers for the powerful offense of the 1947 team, and a November 1947 newspaper profile called him the \\"Michigan Pilot\\" and \\"one of the stars of Michigan's famed offensive line is Tackle Bruce Hilkene, a speedy 190-pounder. Bruce played end in 1943-44, winning a letter.\\" An Associated Press cartoonist featured Hilkene in a pre-Rose Bowl cartoon, calling him \\"the lightest tackle in the Big Nine -- and the scrappiest.\\" Ohio State scout, Esco Sarkkinen, pointed to Hilkene's speed at the tackle position as one of the strengths of the 1947 Michigan team. Sarkkinen noted, \\"To show the speed of the tackles, Capt. Bruce Hilkene, who operates on the left side, is a converted end.\\" Team leadership as captain Hilkene also played a key leadership role on the 1947 team. After the undefeated regular season concluded, the Long Beach Press-Telegram published a three-column profile of Hilkene under the headline, \\"Hilkene Unsung Hero of Michigan Eleven.\\" The article noted: > \\"Captain Bruce Hilkene doesn't consider himself a great tackle, nor does he > pretend to be a forceful leader, yet he is the mucillage of the 1947 > Michigan football team. Twice elected captain of the Wolverines, Hilkene > kept the squad together throughout the season. His mild mannerisms off the > field belied his inspirational actions which helped guide one of the > greatest Michigan teams ...\\" He regularly called unscheduled team meetings on his own initiative to iron out any problems with the team. Teammate Pete Elliott later recalled a team meeting called by Hilkene after the team had a terrible practice. He said, \\"Our captain that year, Bruce Hilkene, announced that right after our meal, we were going to have a team meeting and straighten things out. Nobody said a word during the meal. We got to the meeting and everybody had long faces on. Hilkene said that if anyone had a problem, now was the time to let it out in the open.\\" Star receiver Dick Rifenburg, stood up, looked at Hilkene and said with a straight face, \\"I don't think I'm getting enough publicity.\\" According to Elliott, \\"Everybody just died laughing.\\" Fritz Crisler called Hilkene \\"one of the finest captains that we've ever had since I've been here.\\" In June 1948, Hilkene was one of ten Michigan players selected to play in the annual game between the College All-Stars and the Chicago Cardinals. Later years Hilkene was the 283rd pick in the 1948 NFL Draft, being selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but did not play professional football. As of 1961, Hilkene was working as a labor relations executive with a Detroit automotive firm. Hilkene worked for many years as a General Motors Corp. executive. His son, Mike Hilkene, played football (at the end position) for the Michigan Wolverines in the late 1960s. In April 1990, Hilkene died of cancer at his home in La Quinta, California. In 1992, he was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. In 1997, his wife, Lee, and son Michael (one of Hilkene's three children) attended a 50-year reunion of the 1947 Michigan team. At the time, his wife noted, \\"Bruce felt that football taught him so much. In a way, it influenced the rest of his life. And it was the same way for the entire team.\\" See also * University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor References 1925 births 1990 deaths American football offensive tackles Michigan Wolverines football players Sportspeople from Indianapolis Players of American football from Indiana People from La Quinta, California ","title":"Bruce Hilkene"},{"id":"20681616","text":"St John the Baptist Church, Yaverland is a parish church in the Church of England located in Yaverland, Isle of Wight.

It is a hospice in Dorset for children with life-limiting conditions. The majority of the children who are cared for by Julia's House are unlikely to live beyond the age of 18. The hospice costs ¬£1.9 million to be maintained. Only 3% of this cost is provided by the government. History Julia's House is named after Julia Perks, a paediatric nurse who died from cancer in 1997. Julia highlighted the need for facilities and services for children with life- limiting and life-threatening illnesses in the Dorset area. She particularly wanted to raise awareness of the need for more respite for the families of these children. Julia's House was founded by Michael Wise, who was the local councillor of Julia Perks. Wise helped the hospice to raise ¬£15,000 in 2008. The charity began in 2003, when Julia's House appointed two children's community nurses, who started working in home care for terminally ill children. Julia's House began with its main effort on providing care in the families' own homes. Before being converted into a hospice, Julia's House was once a family home. In March 2006, it became a hospice that is an area for children to play and relax during the day. It also provides an occasional overnight service for 3 children and home care for 50 children. The chief executive of the hospice is Martin Edwards. Shirt controversy In July 2008, Julia's House replaced Park Engineering as the logo on Weymouth F.C.'s shirts. This deal was made to raise the profile of both the charity and the football club. It was a free sponsorship deal. However, a number of people became concerned that Julia's House was paying Weymouth F.C. for the shirt deal so that the charity could have more publicity. When the charity began losing fundraising money due to this controversy, it denied these beliefs, and Mike Bartlett, the development director at Julia's House, issued the following statement: References External links * Official website Children's charities based in the United Kingdom Organizations established in 2003 ","title":"Julia's House"},{"id":"20681802","text":"Down South may refer to: * Down South (film), a 1931 Toby the Pup cartoon * Down South (Rhett Akins album), 2008 * Down South (Doc Watson album), 1984 See also * Southdown (disambiguation) * South Down (disambiguation) ","title":"Down south"},{"id":"20681819","text":"Raymond Roy Rippelmeyer (born July 9, 1933 in Valmeyer, Illinois) is a retired American professional baseball player and pitching coach.

An illegally-made, genetically-engineered, extraterrestrial lifeform resembling a blue koala, he is one of the franchise's two title characters, alongside his human adopter and best friend Lilo Pelekai, and its primary protagonist. Stitch was created by Lilo & Stitch co-writer and co-director Chris Sanders, who also voices him in all Western-produced media that he appears in, while Ben Diskin voices the character in the English versions of the Eastern-produced television series Stitch! and Stitch & Ai. In the franchise's chronology, he was originally created by Dr. Jumba Jookiba to cause chaos across the galaxy. Stitch is marked by his mischievous behavior, which endeared him to Lilo, who adopted him as her \\"dog\\". Through Lilo's beliefs in the Hawaiian concept of ohana, meaning 'family', Stitch evolved from an uncaring, destructive creature to a loving, more self-conscious being who enjoys the company of his adoptive family on Earth. He became a firm believer of the ohana concept, and with the help of Lilo applied it to reform Jumba's 625 prior experiments, nearly all of whom Stitch treats as his \\"cousins\\". Development left Sanders originally created the character in 1985 for an unsuccessful children's book pitch, and developed a treatment for an animated feature featuring the character. The idea for the character was shelved until around 1996 when then-President of Walt Disney Feature Animation Thomas Schumacher approached Sanders and asked him if he wanted to a pitch a story, giving Sanders the opportunity to use his character again. When Sanders said that the alien character was going to crash-land in a forest filled with other animals, Schumacher told Sanders that the animal world was already \\"overly alien\\" to humans, and suggested that the character should end up in the human world to provide better contrast and juxtaposition for the story. In later development for the film's story, the character was originally going to be the leader of an intergalactic gang of criminals, with Jumba being one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture him. Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively. The character was originally meant to be incapable of speaking intelligibly. However, when the Lilo & Stitch production team realized that the film's story \\"hinged\\" on the character being able to explain himself at the end of the film, Sanders provided vocals for Stitch during early animation. After getting used to Sanders's vocalizations for Stitch, the production team eventually established him as the official voice of his own character. Physical appearance Stitch is a blue koala-like alien standing around three feet tall. He has large rabbit-like ears (with asymmetrical notches on the outer rims of each ear‚Äîone near the tip of his right ear, one near the base of his left ear‚Äîwith the back of the ear tips colored indigo), a wide mouth, a round nose, black eyes, a small, short, stumpy tail; three tufts of fur on top of his head and on his chest, aqua countershading around his eyes and from his lower lip extending down to the bottom of his abdomen, four arms (two of which are usually retracted), three retractable spines that run down his back, four sharp retractable claws on each of his front and back paws (hands and feet), two retractable antennae on his head, and abstract indigo markings on his back and occipital that vaguely look similar to snow angels (with the back marking having two large \\"bulges\\" in the middle that allude to his four arms). He is referred to as a dog by Lilo throughout much of the franchise, as he was taken to a pound and disguised himself as one in order to escape his captors by being adopted by Lilo. He was initially believed by Lilo to be a collie that had been hit by a car, while Nani thought he was a koala of a sort before they found out he was an alien genetic experiment. He has a limited ability to change his physical appearance, as he can retract his lower set of arms, his claws, his antennae and the three spines on his back into his body. Sanders's initial design concepts for Stitch, as seen in early concepts of the film's story, differs from the final version. Stitch was originally going to have a greener fur coloration, which was changed to the now-familiar blue in early development. His black eyes were slightly smaller compared to his final version, his ears flared at their bases instead of close to their tips, and some early drawings placed his nose below the eye line instead of above. The early drawings also showed him with white or silver claws instead of dark blue claws, and he wore a yellow-orange spacesuit with burnt orange pants instead of the more uniform red-orange spacesuit that he wears in the original film's first act. History =Lilo & Stitch= As revealed in the first film, Stitch was created by \\"evil genius\\" Dr. Jumba Jookiba, who called him \\"Experiment 626\\". Both Jumba and 626 were captured and put on trial by the United Galactic Federation. 626 is then sentenced by the Grand Councilwoman to life imprisonment on a desert asteroid and Captain Gantu (who despises him) escorts him. 626 escapes and crash-lands in Kauai, Hawaii. Disguising himself as a dog to hide from his captors, 626 was adopted by a little girl named Lilo, who names him \\"Stitch\\". Stitch is trained by Lilo to be good, using Elvis Presley as a model for his behavior. Lilo's efforts prove to be fruitless at first, as Stitch is unable to suppress his destructive programming. Nevertheless, Lilo enjoys having Stitch as her new \\"puppy\\". Although at first he only wanted to use her as a human shield from Jumba and Agent Pleakley, whose mission was to capture him, Stitch slowly develops feelings for Lilo, to the point where he saves her from Gantu. After his heroics, the Grand Councilwoman allows Stitch to serve his exile on Earth with Lilo as his warden, citing her dog adoption certificate (subsequently, Lilo seems to have become not only a best friend but also a sister figure to Stitch). =Stitch! The Movie= In Stitch! The Movie (2003), Stitch discovers the remaining 625 genetic experiments locked in a crate, in the form of dehydrated pods. In order to rescue a kidnapped Jumba, a trade between Dr. Jacques von H√§msterviel and Jumba for the experiments is organized, but it instead results in the freedom of the experiments and the capture of Lilo and Stitch. H√§msterviel then tries to clone Stitch but he was rescued by Experiment 221 (\\"Sparky\\"). Stitch then rescued Lilo and landed H√§msterviel's spacecraft back in Kauai, where the Grand Councilwoman. =Lilo & Stitch: The Series= In Lilo & Stitch: The Series (2003‚Äì06), Stitch and Lilo have to capture Jumba's other experiments, turn them from evil to good, and find them a home. Along the way, he meets his match: Experiment 627 who is tougher than him, but whom Stitch eventually defeats with greater intelligence. He also is affected by 15 experiment powers: Amnesio wipes out his memory, being poked by Spike's spine makes him goofy, Babyfier turns him into a baby, Spooky turns into water and nearly drowns him, Lax makes him lazy, Dupe duplicates him into four (weakening his strength), Frenchfry serves him unhealthy junk food meals (along with Lilo and Pleakley) and fattens him up into a giant bowling ball, Yaarp sounds out his loud megaphone (deafening him), Snooty sucks out his mucus (effectively dehydrating him), Swirly hypnotizes him, Drowsy (in the episode \\"PJ\\") puts him to sleep, Houdini makes him invisible, Swapper switches him into Lilo's and then Pleakley's bodies, Bugby turns him into a bug, and Slushy freezes him. However, the powers wear off. He also meets Angel (Experiment 624) who is introduced as a love interest for Stitch (evil at first, she becomes good out of love for Stitch). =Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch= In Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch (2005), which is set between the first film and Stitch! The Movie, Stitch is living well and is reasonably well-behaved (although still hot-tempered and mischievous) with the exiled Jumba and Pleakley in Lilo's (and her older sister Nani's) house, until he begins malfunctioning. Since he was not fully charged after his creation, Stitch experiences periodic glitches that have him reverting to his original destructive programming, appearing to suffer from a \\"fit\\" or \\"seizure\\". Seeing this, Jumba strives to create a proper charging chamber for Stitch. Not wanting to hurt anyone and not knowing about Jumba's plan, Stitch attempts to leave Earth for a remote planet, while Lilo, Jumba, and the others desperately try to have him return so they can recharge him. Although they are too late when they place him in the recharging pod, Stitch seems to be revived by Lilo's love, in accordance with her belief that love is more powerful than death. =Leroy & Stitch= After they have successfully captured all the remaining experiments prior to the events of Leroy & Stitch (2006), the Grand Councilwoman offered Stitch the chance to become the captain of the Galactic Armada and its new flagship, The BRB (Big Red Battleship) 9000. However, that would require Stitch to be separated from Lilo. Not wanting to make Lilo sad, he chooses to return to Kaua'i but Lilo tells him he should go. Before he leaves with Jumba and Pleakley, Lilo gives him a necklace with a tiki of the god Ku Tiki to give him strength. When Gantu breaks out Dr. H√§msterviel in an action of frustration, Stitch is sent on his first mission to capture the evil rodent once more. But when he arrives at Galactic Defense Industries, Stitch faces off against a new experiment ‚Äî Leroy, who is an enhanced clone of Stitch. Stitch fights well and is about to beat Leroy when Pleakley shows up unexpectedly, allowing Leroy to take advantage of Stitch's lapse in concentration and beat him. He is placed in a cage and sent with Jumba and Pleakley heading towards a black hole. After they are sent towards the black hole, Leroy heads off towards Earth to capture all of the other experiments for H√§msterviel. Later, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley escape from the black hole, and arrive on the planet Turo. There they rescue Lilo, 625 (now known as Reuben), and Gantu, and fly Pleakley's carpool van back to Earth to assist the other 624 experiments in the defeat of an army of Leroys. Now, with Leroy defeated, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley return to Earth with Lilo, realizing family is more important than spaceships, laboratories, and prestige. =Stitch! (anime)= In the anime series Stitch! (2008‚Äì11, not including later TV specials), Stitch seems to have reverted to his destructive nature, and is first seen in the first episode being chased in a spaceship by Jumba and the authorities, ending up on an island in the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. On the island, Stitch gained a new human friend named Yuna Kamihara. The original version (aired in Japan) initially left out what happened between Lilo and Stitch that caused them to be separated, although the heavily edited English dub of the anime had Jumba imply that Stitch ran away out of jealousy of Lilo having a boyfriend. Lilo herself did not appear in any way in the anime until episode 23 of ~Best Friends Forever~ (Season 3), where she, now a fully-grown woman, visits Okinawa's New Town with her daughter, Ani (who looks incredibly like her when she was a child and whom Stitch thought was Lilo in the beginning). Lilo and Stitch were able to reconcile upon reuniting, with Lilo explaining what happened on the day Stitch left her. They both have a happy reunion, she hugs him, promises to visit him again, and asks Stitch to take good care of his new family. She then gives Stitch his tiki necklace back before leaving to return to Hawaii. =Stitch & Ai= In the Chinese animated series Stitch & Ai (2017), Stitch has been kidnapped from Lilo by space criminals and is held captive in their spaceship. However, when a rival gang attacks the ship wanting Stitch for themselves, he uses the opportunity to escape back to Earth. He ends up in the Huangshan mountains and meets a young Chinese girl who lives there named Wang Ai Ling, who (similarly to Lilo) takes him into her family as her new pet \\"dog\\". Stitch also looks for a temple seen in a vision he had, while Jumba and Pleakley also join their new \\"family\\" to protect them. =Personality= Throughout the course of the entire Lilo & Stitch franchise, Stitch is depicted as a character that is unlikable to many people except Lilo (on rare occasions, even she falls out with him, most notably in Lilo & Stitch 2, where she strongly considers him to be bad, unaware that the glitches he was possessed by at the time were reverting him back to his original destructive behavior) due to his destructive and temperamental behavior. People who are averse to Stitch, such as Mertle or H√§msterviel, describe him as \\"ugly and deformed\\", while people with an affection (like Lilo, Jumba, and Nani) for him describe him as \\"cute and fluffy\\". This reflects the basic idea behind Stitch and also his cousins: they do not correspond to many established criteria of good physical appearance in that they have an extra pair of arms or misshapen heads. When Stitch is in his \\"evil\\" form, he is undeniably worrying as his somewhat botched physique underlines his at the time twisted behavior; in \\"good\\" form however (the form that the audience most often sees), Stitch's display of emotion at being rejected due to his behavior and looks while trying to act good for Lilo is meant to make him seem more adorable to the audience. Despite his surface destructiveness, which does not go away even after he has become \\"good\\", Stitch is a complex character; according to his creator Jumba, Stitch as a destructive machine was not given a higher purpose in life. Since Stitch is trapped on an island where there are relatively few things to destroy, he has many occasions to reflect on other occupations than evil. It is implied that Stitch destroys only because that is what he is programmed to do; but since he has a personality of his own (a fact that only Lilo truly understands), he also has the choice, even will, not to do so. Despite having superhuman strength and a high level of computer-intelligence, Stitch is emotionally fragile and has a childlike personality beneath his \\"monster\\" appearance. Lilo believes that one reason why he originally pursued his destructiveness was for similar reasons to her own naughtiness, that it was because he was emotionally scarred (for having been made as a monster by Jumba) but received little understanding or sympathy from others. Stitch becomes much more well-meaning after his betterment, but is frequently unable to control all of his impulses to antisocial actions. Fortunately for him, Lilo (and later Reuben and Angel) is always there to support him, and he returns her support willingly. Abilities and weaknesses While explaining his creation to the Galactic Council early on in Lilo & Stitch, Dr. Jumba gives the following rundown of Stitch's powers: \\"He is bulletproof, fireproof, and can think faster than a super computer. He can see in the dark and can move objects at least 3,000 times his size. His only instinct ‚Äî to destroy whatever he touches!\\" In the original Lilo & Stitch film, Jumba claimed that Stitch's \\"destructive programming was taking effect and that he would be irresistibly drawn to large cities to \\"back up sewers, reverse street signs, and steal everyone's left shoe.\\" This is shown in the Lilo & Stitch: The Series episode \\"Kixx\\", where Lilo and Stitch are watching Keoni skateboard, then Stitch looks in Keoni's rucksack and eats Keoni's shoe, Keoni replies by saying \\"Hey, my shoes!\\" in which Lilo says, \\"He only eats the left ones!\\" While Stitch is never seen shot by a bullet, he can endure being shot by plasma projectiles. He can even catch them in his hands before throwing it back to the shooter, as shown in the original film, Stitch! The Movie, Leroy & Stitch, and Stitch & Ai. Stitch was shown to be hit by one in the episode \\"Finder\\" when H√§msterviel, armed with a self-made plasma cannon, shot him with it, which only made Stitch unconscious (it is assumed that plasma projectiles are deadly to humans as Lilo occasionally is almost shot by one in the franchise). As he dodges all other plasma projectiles, Jumba did claim that Stitch being hit by one would stun him long enough to be defeated by a foe. He did survive the crash of his spaceship with only a scratch, is only briefly stunned by a fall of several thousand feet, and has to be run over by three tractor-trailers in succession to be knocked out. As for fireproof, in the original film he drives a tanker truck full of gasoline into a volcano, which in the ensuing explosion he is propelled into the air, a move he uses to strike at Gantu's spaceship to thwart his capture of Lilo. Thinking faster than a supercomputer is harder to quantify, but he does escape from captivity fairly ingeniously, builds a model of San Francisco after only glancing at Earth vs. the Spider; grabs a crossword puzzle from the table and finishes it in about 8 seconds; is often seen solving complex mathematical equations; builds a bomb out of a plasma bolt, Lilo's doll Scrump, and a roller skate; builds a \\"bucking bronco\\" out of a toaster, a vacuum cleaner, and a lamp; a DNA double helix from only coconuts, hollow sticks and a turntable; is able to understand he can use a human as a shield from Jumba, by Pleakley's presence; and generally picks up quickly on what is happening around him. He is also fluent in playing string instruments like the guitar or the ukulele, and is capable of driving any sort of vehicle, which can be as simple as riding a tricycle‚Äîwhich his strength allows him to speed one up to beyond the normal capabilities of a tricycle propelled by a human‚Äîor as complex as piloting intergalactic spaceships. His ability to lift objects 3,000 times his own size and weight is seen several times throughout the franchise, including incidents where he picks up a descending blast door, hits Dr. Jumba with a thrown Volkswagen Beetle (shouting gleefully, \\"Blue punch buggy! No punch back!\\") and stops a tanker truck. This ability is sometimes joked about in the later series; for example, in Stitch! The Movie, H√§msterviel, while physically restraining Stitch for a cloning experiment, counters Stitch's strength with restraint devices, that are equal in strength themselves, as H√§msterviel loudly declares, to 3,001 times Stitch's own weight. Another such example of the limitation of such strength was during Lilo & Stitch: The Series, where Stitch showed his strength off on a television show by holding up two bulldozers on a platform only to have it come crashing down on him when Gantu lets loose a piece of paper which attaches itself to one of the bulldozers, stating he can hold up to three thousand times his weight, but not an ounce more. The pads on Stitch's hands and feet can secrete a sticky substance allowing him to adhere to almost any surface and scale buildings and walls. His skeletal system is very flexible, allowing him to become a rolling ball and also to allow him to squeeze through tight spaces. Stitch's legs are small, but powerful enough to enable him to jump several feet into the air and he's shown to be very agile. His eyes can pick up various forms of light and he can filter out one or the other if necessary. Stitch can see in normal vision (during this mode, his eyes appear black in color), night vision (which is green), infrared (red) and X-ray (bright green). Furthermore, he also can magnify his vision. However, his high sensitivity to light also causes flash lights to be very painful to him. In the original film, Stitch earns respect for performing Elvis Presley, but he then attacks his fans after the flashes from their cameras bother him. Stitch also can act as an audio amplifier, radio, and/or microphone, illustrated in the original film when he uses a finger as the needle on a record player, and the music comes out of his open mouth, then again in The Series episode \\"The Asteroid\\" when he uses his ears to overhear from a distance Cobra Bubbles talking to a scientist about the threat of an asteroid close to impacting the Earth, and the sound of the discussion comes out of Stitch's mouth to allow Lilo to listen to it. He has an acute sense of smell and hearing and is also dexterously skilled in hand-to-hand combat, using all four arms or just two. Stitch can also be noted for his immortality. Although the Lilo & Stitch franchise is set in the current year, he is shown to have no signs of aging as seen in the episode \\"Skip\\" for 10‚Äì20 years, much to his chagrin (although suggested by an aged Lilo to grow a goatee to make him look older), as well as in the Stitch! anime series which is set years after Leroy & Stitch (as seen by Lilo's reappearance as an adult in this show). Stitch is proven to be ticklish in Lilo & Stitch: The Series. In \\"Shortstuff\\", Stitch is tickled by a ray used to make him bigger. Stitch's greatest weakness is his inability to float or swim due to his dense molecular structure, which causes him to sink in water. Another weakness is the fact that his super-sensitive hearing can lead to temporary deafness when exposed to sonic blasts. Stitch originally had an instinctive aquaphobia, but was able to overcome it because of Lilo. In episode 6 of Lilo & Stitch: The Series, Experiment 300 (\\"Spooky\\") was activated. It has the ability to transform into people's worst fear; for Stitch it transformed into water, until Lilo showed Stitch her coping mechanism for when she gets scared (for her it's singing the chorus of \\"Aloha  ªOe\\"), which is how Stitch was able to save her later in the episode. Another of Stitch's weaknesses, as mentioned earlier, is that he cannot lift things over 3,000 times his size and weight. Also as mentioned earlier, since Stitch's molecules were not fully charged upon creation as shown in Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, if his initial charging was not finished he would later suffer seizure-like glitches that would revert him to his original destructive programming before dying. This issue was resolved by the film's end, and he no longer suffers these glitches. Stitch also has different abilities in the Asian-produced spin-off shows Stitch! and Stitch & Ai that were not previously revealed in the 2002 to 2006 Western-produced continuity. In Stitch! ~Best Friends Forever~ (the anime's third season), he has a hidden power cell within him that can supercharge his powers to greater levels. In Stitch & Ai, he has metamorphosis abilities that change his appearance in some form and give him additional abilities, including being able to sprout quills around his neck, extend a patagium to glide through the air like a flying squirrel, and most significantly, when his destructive programming is fully triggered, grow into a giant monster with four laser-firing tentacles that sprout forward from his back, further enhancing his destructive capabilities. (This particular ability contradicts a deleted version of the opening scene of the original Lilo & Stitch film, which shows the then-Experiment 626 having already caused destruction in an alien city in his smaller, familiar true form.) In other media =Kingdom Hearts series= Stitch appears as a summon in the video game, Kingdom Hearts II, making a minor influence at Hollow Bastion (in part being responsible for sending Sora and the others into Space Paranoids). He also appears along with his homeworld, Deep Space, as a fighting partner to Ven and Aqua in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. The world is set in space and revolves around on his escape from Gantu's custody, before arriving in Radiant Garden. Stitch appears in Kingdom Hearts III as a summon much like in Kingdom Hearts II. =Disney Infinity= Stitch was included in the Toy Box Starter Pack (alongside Brave's Merida) for Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition. =The Kingdom Keepers= Playing only a small role in the beginning of Disney in Shadow, this gigantic blue alien confused as a dog, as Finn described it chases Finn followed by some of the earlier pirates. Thought to have come out of Stitch's Great Escape!, he apprehends Finn and Maybeck. In Power Play, the keepers suspect that Stitch might have been put under a spell and may not actually be an Overtaker. In Shell Game, Stitch saves Finn at Typhoon Lagoon from CPR Dummies. =References in other Disney media= Stitch makes a cameo amongst the crowd of Disney characters coming in to watch the film The Lion King 1¬Ω, appearing silhouetted in his full form. There is a Stitch doll off to the left corner on the lowest shelf in young Jim Hawkins' room in Disney's other 2002 intergalactic film Treasure Planet. Stitch appears riding in his spaceship passing by Aladdin and the Magic Carpet briefly three times in the Virtual Magic Carpet Ride game included on Disc 2 of the 2004 Aladdin Platinum Edition DVD. In Brother Bear, Stitch makes a surprise appearance in the outtakes. Stitch is referenced in the background twice in the 2014 film, Big Hero 6. While Hiro Hamada is distracting Aunt Cass as she's making hot wings, there is a photo of Mochi the cat on the wall behind him on the stairs. In the photo, viewers can see that Mochi is dressed up as Stitch, in his orange alien outfit. Later, when in Fred's mansion bedroom, a Stitch pillow can be seen on Fred's bed along with a Splodyhead (Experiment 619) pillow. Stitch appears in the 2011 motion-controlled video game Kinect: Disneyland Adventures as a meet-and-greet character who appears in the park's Tomorrowland area. He is also featured in the Nintendo 3DS life simulation games Disney Magical World and Disney Magical World 2 as an interactive character that the player can speak to and assist in quests. Reception and legacy After the success of the original Lilo & Stitch film, Stitch quickly became one of Disney's most popular characters. The Verges Kaitlyn Tiffany wrote in a May 2017 article arguing that the character remains popular fifteen years after Lilo & Stitchs release due to his flawed nature, which made him \\"endlessly relatable\\", and would outlast more recent characters who are similar in certain aspects to him such as the Minions of Universal Studios's Despicable Me franchise and Baby Groot of Marvel Studios's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as a result. Not all reception towards the character has been positive; Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote an article released on the same day that a live-action Lilo & Stitch remake was reported to be in development stating that he preferred the human leads Lilo and Nani over Stitch, considering the alien to be a detriment to the film. Mendelson stated that he hated the alien character because \\"he spent 99% of the movie making [Lilo and Nani's] lives even harder to the point of possible ruin and death\\" and that watching the character's mischief \\"was an exercise in frustration and concern for the sympathetic human leads.\\" References Extraterrestrial superheroes Fictional adoptees Fictional characters from Hawaii Animated film characters introduced in 2002 Fictional characters with superhuman strength Fictional characters with superhuman senses Fictional genetically engineered characters Fictional illeists Fictional mammals Kingdom Hearts characters Lilo & Stitch characters Male characters in animation Science fiction film characters Science fiction television characters ","title":"Stitch (Disney)"},{"id":"20681844","text":"Mustafa Kamal, Mostafa Kamal or variations may refer to: *Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk (1881‚Äì1938), Turkish field marshal, revolutionary statesman, and founder of the Republic of Turkey as well as its first President *Mostafa Kamal Tolba (1922‚Äì2016), Egyptian scientist *Mustafa Kamal (judge) (1933‚Äì2015), Chief Justice of Bangladesh *Abu Hena Mustafa Kamal (1936‚Äì1989), professor of Bengali literature *Mostafa Kamal (Bir Sreshtho) (1947‚Äì1971), Bangladeshi military hero *Mustafa Kamal (politician) (born 1947), Bangladeshi politician *Lotfi Mustafa Kamal (born 1952), Egyptian airman and politician *Mostafa Hussein Kamel (born 1960), Egyptian Minister of State for Environmental Affairs *Syed Mustafa Kamal (born 1971), Pakistani politician and former mayor of Karachi *Mostafa Kamal (footballer) (born 1973), Egyptian footballer *Mustapha Kamal N'Daw (born 1981), Gambian footballer ","title":"Mustafa Kamal"},{"id":"20681851","text":"Chris Beasley may refer to: *Chris Beasley (researcher), Australian academic *Chris Beasley (baseball) (born 1962), former Major League Baseball player *Chris Beasley (rugby league) (born 1983), player in Super League for the Celtic Crusaders *Chris Beasley, actor in Isidingo ","title":"Chris Beasley"},{"id":"20681866","text":"Michal Fikrt (born April 6, 1982 in Most, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech professional ice hockey player.hokej.cz Michal Fikrt He plays goaltender for TH Unia O≈õwiƒôcim in the Polska Liga Hokejowa.

They hid their Jewish past by all means, making even their descendants have no idea of it. Currently, Jews have integrated into Costa Rican society, and an important amount of entrepreneurs, politicians and artists are Jews. Costa Rica has had four vice presidents of Ashkenazi Jewish origin; Rebeca Grynspan, Astrid Fischel, Luis Fishman (although he did not hold the position) and Luis Liberman, as well as several deputies and ministers, and a first lady, Doris Yankelewitz. The current Jewish community is estimated at some 2,000 Ashkenazi and about 850 Sephardic arrivals in the twentieth century. History The country has had three major waves of Jewish immigration; the first, that of Sephardi, arrived at the time of colonization, who were mainly located in Cartago and who converted to Catholicism, Guzm√°n Stein, Miguel. La migraci√≥n sefardita en Costa Rica y la lapidaria f√∫nebre como fuente de investigaci√≥n de una comunidad in√©dita V Congreso Centroamericano de Historia. 19 de julio de 2000. which was the compulsory religion at that time. They assimilated into the Costa Rican colonial society and lost their Jewish traditions and identity. In the nineteenth century Sephardic merchants arrived from Cura√ßao, Jamaica, Panama and the Caribbean, settling in the Central Valley and converting to Catholicism. The possible permanence of crypto-Jews who practiced Judaism secretly in Escaz√∫ is pointed out by some as an origin of the legend of the \\"Witches of Escaz√∫\\", a myth so deeply rooted that the figure of the witch is part of the identity of the canton. The oldest Jewish community in Costa Rica was Sephardic. The first Sephardic Jews arrived in colonial times and settled in the colonial capital Cartago and its surroundings. The largest migration of Sephardic Jews occurred in the nineteenth century from Panama, Jamaica, Cura√ßao and Saint Thomas, the majority settling in Alajuela and San Jos√© and prospering in trade. Some of these families were the Sasso, the Robles, the Maduro, the Halman, the M√©ndez- Chumaceiro, the Salas de Lima and, arriving as conversos, the Lindo and the Piza. This community maintained close blood and family ties by marrying each other. The Sephardic Jews, like the Protestants, Muslims and Bah√° º√≠s, were interred in the \\"Foreign Cemetery\\" regardless of their nationality, because this was the only cemetery for non-Catholics until the secularization of cemeteries in 1884. Even after of the creation of the Hebrew Cemetery, the Sephardim largely maintained the custom of using the Foreign Cemetery. The second great emigration occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially due to the rise of Nazism in Europe and mainly from Poland. One of the villages that most Jewish immigrants came from was ≈ªelech√≥w. This population, predominantly Ashkenazi, was devoted mainly to door-to-door sales and payments, thus the name \\"polaco\\" (Spanish for Polish people) became a colloquial synonym for Jews, as well as for door-to-door salesmen in general. This population was mostly located in San Jos√©, especially in the areas of Paseo Col√≥n and La Sabana. The first Orthodox synagogue was founded in San Jos√© under the name Shaarei Zion. The Ashkenazi community, the largest one, is almost entirely from Poland and the majority of synagogues belong to this ethnic group. Like the Sephardi, the community has maintained a close family bond between members of the same group. Both communities usually remain separated with family unions only within the same ethnic line. An exception was the Fischel-Robles family, after the marriage of the Ashkenazi dentist Maximiliano Fischel Hirshberg with the Sephardic Ada Robles Sasso, family to the former Vice President Astrid Fischel Volio and the founders of the Fischel Pharmaceutical Corporation. Anti-semitic rhetoric became common after the first wave in the political discourse and media at the time. Notable anti-semites included Otilio Ulate Blanco, owner of the Diario de Costa Rica newspaper and future president, and poet Luis Dobles Segreda. During this period the Nazi Party of Costa Rica was founded by a faction of the German and Italian communities. During the 1930s the nationalistic government of Le√≥n Cort√©s Castro (1936‚Äì1940) was hostile to the Jews and restricted their entry into the country as well as implementing policies that limited their economic development. Cort√©s closed the country to further Jewish immigration and appointed Max Effinger (leader of the Nazi Party) as Migration Director. Things did not improve immediately during the next government of Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia (1940‚Äì1944) influenced by National Catholicism, although after the declaration of war against the Axis powers in 1941 the government focused on the persecution of Germans, Italians and Japanese. The relations improved definitively during the subsequent administration of Teodoro Picado Michalski (1944‚Äì1948), himself the son of a Polish mother, who lifted economic restrictions from the time of Cort√©s. The Calder√≥nist government of Picado faced fierce opposition during that tense decade. The opposition candidate in the 1948 elections was Otilio Ulate Blanco. Ulate was the presumed winner of the elections, although with mutual accusations of voter fraud, which caused rejection of the results by the ruling party and finally the outbreak of a revolution. The rebellious side, led by Jos√© Figueres and Ulate (and in which many Italians and Germans served, for obvious reasons opposed to Calder√≥n) was the victor. At first, the Jewish community was seen as close to the regime and the San Jos√© Synagogue was burned, however, Figueres promised to the Jewish community not to tolerate anti-Semitic attacks. Apart from these complex ethnic tensions of the 1940s, the relationship of the Jews with the rest of Costa Rican society has been generally stable. Costa Rica voted in favor of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and was, along with El Salvador for many years, one of the only countries with embassies in Jerusalem. This was modified in 2007 when, during the second √ìscar Arias administration, the embassy was moved to Tel Aviv and Costa Rica established diplomatic relations with the Arab world. Under the presidency of Laura Chinchilla Costa Rica voted in favor of the entry of Palestine to the UN and UNESCO and during the government of Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s the Costa Rican chancellery condemned Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in 2014. The third great migratory wave of Jews occurred in the nineties, of Americans and Israelis who retired to spend their last years in Costa Rica. In 2013, the Costa Rican population was 4,870,000 and the Jewish population was estimated at about 2,000 individuals. Antisemitism and growth of Neo-Nazism Since the 1930s, there were a significant number of Costa Ricans and Germans based in Costa Rica sympathetic to fascism and National Socialism, however the country supported the Allies during the Second World War. The president of the Nazi Party of Costa Rica at that time was Max Effinger, a Costa Rican of German origin, who was appointed as an immigration advisor in the government of Le√≥n Cort√©s Castro. Other notable anti-Semites were Otilio Ulate Blanco, Luis Dobles Segreda, and to lesser extent Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia, according to Jacobo Schifter, Lowell Gudmundson and Mario Solera. Despite the existence of an Anti-Zionist component of the far- right Free Costa Rica Movement active between the 60s and 90s, no major anti- Semitic controversy was notable until the 2002 Costa Rican general election in which Vice-Presidential nominee Luis Fishman Zonzinski assured that after being fired by Abel Pacheco de la Espriella's campaign team Pacheco and collaborators made anti-Semitic comments. The deputy for the 2010‚Äì2014 period Nestor Manrique Oviedo Guzm√°n then of the Citizens' Action Party (although later he defects to National Restoration), accused then Vice President of the Republic, Luis Liberman, of benefiting his Jewish co-religionists in a network of corruption. His statements were condemned by the benches of the main political parties (including Oviedo's party) and by the Jewish community that issued a statement through the Israelite Center and the Governing Council of that period. The most recent case of an important political figure whose statements were accused of anti-Semitism was that of right-wing populist candidate Juan Diego Castro who in a 2019 video accused Leonel Baruch, owner of the newspaper CRHoy and of Jewish origin, of being an \\"evil banker\\" and made comments mocking the Holocaust. His statements were condemned by the Jewish community, the Israeli embassy and most of the benches of the Legislative Assembly. In April 2012, it was discovered through Facebook that a young police officer was an adherent of Nazism and a member of a neo-Nazi group. This, in turn, led to the discovery that there were several adherents in the police forces or the Costa Rican Public Force. The officer in question was dismissed and the authorities investigated the connection of Costa Rican police to the extreme right. The young man was identified as Ronald \\"Murdoch\\" Herrera and father of three daughters. In 2015, the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Costa Rican government to close a store in San Jos√© that sells Nazi paraphernalia, Holocaust denial books and other products associated with Nazism. In 2018, it transpired that a series of neo-Nazi Facebook pages had openly or discreetly carried out a vast campaign instigating xenophobic hatred by recycling old news or divulging Fake news, which ended in an anti-migration rally in La Merced Park in San Jos√© with the participation of some far-right and neo-nazi groups (although not all participants were of such). An anti- xenophobic rally was organized the exact next week.

As of 2013, the Jewish population is around 25, predominately in the capital of Port-au-Prince. History =The first Jewish settlement= In 1492, the first Jew to ever set foot in Haiti was Luis de Torres, an interpreter for Christopher Columbus. After Haiti was taken over and colonized by the French in 1633, many Dutch Jews (of whom many were Marrano) emigrated from Brazil in 1634 and became employees of the French sugar plantations and further developed the trade. In 1683, the Jews were expelled from Haiti and all other French colonies, due to the Code Noir (Black Code), which both restricted the activities of free Negroes and forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism. However, despite the Code Noir, a limited number of Jews remained in French trading companies as leading officials, including foreign citizens (Dutch Jews, Danish Jews, and English Jews) or holders of special residence permits (lettres patentes). These Jews tended to specialize in agricultural plantations, with Portuguese Jews from Bordeaux and Bayonne settling mainly in the southern part of Haiti (Jacmel, J√©r√©mie, L√©og√¢ne, Les Cayes, Petit-Go√¢ve, and Port-au-Prince) and Cura√ßaoan Jews settling in the northern part (Cap-Haitien and Saint Louis). In the mid-1700s, many Jews returned to Haiti, but were later murdered or expelled during the 1804 Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint Louverture. Due to a lack of Jewish community centers, many youth did not grow up with a Jewish education and had to hide their Judaism, as only Catholics were permitted to attend public school. Jews generally preferred to settle on the coastline in port cities, as many were involved in commerce and trade, establishing communities in major industry centers. Recently, archaeologists uncovered an ancient synagogue of Crypto-Jews in the city of J√©r√©mie, the only one found on the island; J√©r√©mie was inhabited by many mixed-race families of Jewish descent. Several Jewish tombstones have also been found in port cities such as Cap-Ha√Øtien and Jacmel. By the end of the 19th century, approximately thirty mostly Sephardi Jewish families had arrived from Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt; many Jews from the Middle East felt secure emigrating to Haiti, as a law in France had been passed during this period that gave French citizenship to minorities in the Americas. Modern Times Passport issued to Hans Erich Max Emden by the Haitian government, who managed to escape the holocaust. In 1941 he used it to travel to Argentina. In 1915, during the United States occupation of Haiti, roughly 200 Jews lived in Haiti at the time. During the 20 years period of occupation, many Jews left Haiti for the United States and South America. In 1937, Haiti was responsible for saving about 70 Jewish families (an estimated total of up to 300 lives) during the Holocaust (according to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee), by issuing passports and visas to Jews escaping Nazi persecution. Some were Austrian Jews, Polish Jews, German Jews, and a trickle of Romanian Jew and Czech Jewish descent. Haiti played a small, yet critical role in saving Jewish lives during the darkest chapter in the Jewish story Unfortunately, though, it seems that more Jews were unable to acquire visas to Haiti due to the cost. Professor David Bankier, of the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that after 1938, ‚Äúthe cost [of a visa] was outrageous: If you wanted to go to Haiti, you had to pay $5,000.‚Äù Haiti at the time, was still unfairly paying reparations on an exorbitant debt with interest fees to France after the Haitian Revolution that could have hindered their efforts to continue issuing these visas for free. There were others apart from this bunch who never came to Haiti at all, but from Germany they were given Haitian passports by the Haitian government that allowed them to flee Germany and into other countries. Grateful to the Haitian government, many of these European Jews stayed in Haiti until the late 1950s in which many Haitian Jews left, so that their children could marry other Jews and not assimilate, while finding better economic opportunities. The 1957 Jewish population of Haiti was about 200. The mid-20th century was a time where a continued departure of Jews from Haiti for the United States and Panama because of the economic conditions and civil violence in the country. =Judaism= Today, the Jewish community is led by Rabbi Douglas Lapin, a local businessman. The Jewish community is known as the \\"Consistoire d'Haiti\\" and has been recognized as the representative of the Jewish community by the Haitian Ministry of Religion (Ministere des Cultes) . Rabbi Lapin has likewise been recognized as the Rabbi in Haiti by the Haitian government. The community is very small and mostly consists of UN, NGO, and diplomatic personnel, although there are a small number of Haitian Jewish families. The community does Kosher chicken slaughtering (shkita) and has occasional gatherings for Jewish festivals such as Succos and Purim. There is also an Esrog, Myrtle (Hadasim) and Willow (Aravos) plantation to supply local needs for Succos. The community is working on developing a synagogue and community center. There is a complete library of Jewish liturgical books (seforim), Megillas Esther and Sefer Torah. =Business= The 1960s was a time of wealth and high hopes of large future development for Haiti. At the time met many family Jewish names such as: Alvarez, Cardozo, Cohen, Dreyfus, Goldman, Hakim, Hillel, Khan, Monsanto, Pereira, Salzmann, Silveira, and Weiner, which most had forgotten their ethno-religious backgrounds. Today, less than a hundred Jews remain in Haiti on its 9.5 million inhabitants; however, the Weiners (coffee exporters) and the Salzmanns (refugees from Austria) are still today relevant in trade.

Later, Jews arrived there to escape the Inquisition. Due to the power of the Catholic Church in Honduras, few Jews migrated there during the Spanish Colonial Period. In the 1920s, a few German Jews settled in Honduras as a result of invitations from the government.

A commentator on Radio Globo, David Romero, suggested on the air that perhaps it would have been better if the Jews had been exterminated in the Holocaust.

Yankel Rosenthal, a former minister of investment, was arrested on October 6th, 2015 after landing at Miami airport. He, together with his cousin Yani and uncle Jaime Rolando, a four-time presidential candidate and newspaper owner, were also charged with money laundering and other services that support the international narcotics trafficking activities of multiple Central American drug traffickers and their criminal organisations. Seven of their businesses were labelled under the US Kingpin Act as \\"specially designated narcotics traffickers\\".

It was the first post established outside the Willamette Valley, opened at Celilo Falls along the Columbia River on March 21, 1838, by Rev. Daniel Lee and Rev. Henry K. W. Perkins. Establishment Mission at The Dalles Lumber for the buildings was cut mostly by neighboring Wascos and the mission was often called Wascopam after them. The mission consisted of a schoolhouse, garden, stable, barn, and two dwellings along with a cleared pasture adjacent to the wood huts used by the Native American villagers. Supplies were procured from Hudson's Bay Company stations Fort Vancouver and Fort Nez Perc√©s along with the Methodist stations of Mission Bottom and later Mission Mill with Chinookan and Walla Walla escorts. During one such trip the provisions for the party had dwindled and a horse had to be consumed until salmon could be purchased from a Clackamas village. The main tribes proselytized to from this location were the Walla Wallas, the Wascos, the Wishram, the Klickitats, the Cascades and the Shastas. Missionaries used Pulpit Rock to preach to the natives and was at first successful in converting some. Pulpit Rock Pulpit Rock Pulpit Rock is a rock about tall in what is now The Dalles, Oregon. Prior to Euro-American settlement the rock was carved by natural elements in an open area on a slight slope. The Methodist missionaries were known to preach to the local Native Americans during the 1830s and 1840s from this rock. The rock currently stands in the intersection of 12th and Court streets, directly south of The Dalles-Wahtonka High School,http://www.worldisround.com/articles/19048/photo25.html with a historical marker. The city kept the rock at its location in the middle of a street due to history surrounding the rock. A mural on a building in downtown The Dalles features the rock prior to the development of the current roads and neighborhood around it. Closing The Wascopam Mission was sold for $600 to Marcus Whitman in 1847, who intended to move there. However after the Whitman Massacre and the eruption of the Cayuse War, the mission was occupied by the Oregon militia. The station was returned to the Methodist Mission in 1849, and as the ABCFM had yet to be pay for the station, its bill of purchase was waived. The Dalles mission did not get used again by the Methodists, and it was sold to the Federal Government for $24,000. The U.S. Army developed Fort Dalles during the 1850s on the site of the Wascopam Mission, becoming the center of modern town of The Dalles. The remaining indigenous people inhabiting the surrounding region were evicted by the U.S. Army to the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. During litigation that reached the Supreme Court in 1883 between the church and settlers in the area, the Methodists land claims of the Dalles were rejected. Three years later the church gave $23,000 to settlers who had previously paid for lots on the now defunct claim.

Two Great Sheep tells the gentle story of a peasant couple, played by Sun Yunkun and Jiang Zhikun, who are charged with caring for two foreign sheep that they must somehow breed for the community. Liu's second film and the first under government approval, Two Great Sheep can be located as part of a broader trend of independent Chinese filmmakers switching their focuses to state-approved productions during the early years of the 21st century. Besides Liu, these years saw many of the leading figures of the \\"sixth-generation\\" turning in their first SARFT-approved productions, including Jia Zhangke (2004's The World), Zhu Wen (2004's South of the Clouds), and Wang Xiaoshuai (2005's Shanghai Dreams). Two Great Sheep premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2004.  Plot  The film follows a peasant couple, Zhao Deshan (Sun Yunkun) and his wife Xiuzhi (Jiang Zhikun), living in rural Yunnan province near Zhaotong in southern China. Their lives are thrown into upheaval when the local mayor (Chen Dajiang) \\"rewards\\" them with two foreign sheep donated by a former villager, now an official in Beijing. The couple is then tasked with breeding the sheep for their wool and to bring prosperity to their small community. Much to their chagrin, the sheep do not take to their new environment and the couple are forced into ever more ingenious ways of making the sheep appear greater than they really are. As they do so, they also come to value the sheep as companions in their family. When it becomes clear that the two \\"great\\" sheep are not the boon they were thought to be, the local authorities repossess the animals. Only now the simply peasant couple no longer wish to give them up.  Cast  * Sun Yunkun as Zhao Deshan, a simple peasant farmer living in rural Yunnan who is tasked with caring with the eponymous sheep. * Jiang Zhikun as Xiuzhi, his wife. * Chen Dajiang as the mayor of Deshan and Xiuzhi's home village. * Zhao Shengling as Liu, the provincial governor  Production  A graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, Liu started his career with the independent film, Chen Mo and Meiting (2002). Though never released in China, the film caught the attention of Chinese producers at the China Film Group (CFG), who selected Liu to participate in the New Film Project, a joint investment by the CFG and the Peking University- Kwans Group to fund new directors. With expectations that the film would be not only critically, but more importantly commercially successful, the China Film Group invested ¬•5 million to Liu for his next project, Two Great Sheep. The \\"New Film Project\\" would in turn give way to Beijing Starlight International, a new company focused on independent filmmakers which was also responsible for the film's international distribution and sales. Shot primarily in the southern province of Yunnan, Two Great Sheep was also produced in part by the Yunnan Provincial Association for External Cultural Exchange.  Reception  The New York Times critic Stephen Holden aptly summed up the two ways of viewing Two Great Sheep: as either \\"an uplifting fable about teamwork and good citizenship or as a spoof of a frightened society's blind obedience to authority.\\" Steve Rhodes espoused the latter view in his review of the film, seeing Two Great Sheep as a \\"simple film, simply told.\\" Many critics, however, chose a middle view, and saw the film primarily as a metaphor for China's bureaucratic machine and its effect on the common peasant. Derek Elley of Variety noted how the film \\"homes in on the stratified nature of Chinese rural society,\\" though he does not go as far as to suggest what Liu Hao intended with the film. Elley does argue, however, that the film is distinct from similar films, notably Zhang Yimou's 1992 The Story of Qiu Ju, mainly in that Two Great Sheep there is a \\"lack of bitterness or despair.\\" A similar review noted that the film was nothing if not a celebration of the \\"tenacious resiliency of the will to survive.\\" Other critics took a negative view and saw the film's lack of bitterness or other strong \\"message\\" as a flaw. Slant Magazine's Ed Gonzalez felt the film went on too long without a clear message, holding that he was \\"not exactly sure if Hao is for or against Bolshevism.\\"  References   External links  Two Great Sheep at Cinemasie 2004 films Chinese films Films set in Yunnan 2004 comedy films Films about sheep Chinese comedy films ","title":"Two Great Sheep"},{"id":"20682135","text":"Kamiar 'Kami‚Äô Rokni () is a Pakistani fashion designer and media personality.

He became widely known for his aid work and as a prominent early Zionist. R√ºlf was born in Rauischholzhausen, Hesse, Germany. He received a teaching certificate in 1849, became an assistant to the county rabbi and then taught in other small communities. He received his rabbinical certificate in 1854 from the University of Marburg and his Ph.D in 1865 at the University of Rostock. That year he became the rabbi of Memel, East Prussia. R√ºlf first found fame for his part in the 'Jankel Widutzky case' in which an English minister attempted to convert Widutzky, a Jewish youth, in Memel. R√ºlf attacked the missionary in the article Jankel Widutzky, der den H√§nden der Judenbekehrungs Mission entzogene Knabe (1867), sparking indignation in Germany. Widutzky was thus not converted and entered Rabbinical college. Rabbi of Memel Memel, in addition to being an important port on the Baltic, was a frontier town and a crossroads between East and West ‚Äì it lay at the tip of East Prussia, on the border of Russia's Lithuanian province (the Kovner Gubernie). The Jewish community in Memel was divided between Western Jews (Prussian/German) and the Eastern Jews (Polish/Russian/Lithuanian), with the different groups having their own institutions and leaders. This mirrored a continent-wide division based largely on the Easterners' fixation on traditional religious education and their perceived ignorance of worldly affairs. R√ºlf arrived as rabbi of the German Jews but tried to unite the communities. Beginning in the late 1860s with his relief works, R√ºlf gained an international reputation for his assistance to Russian Jews. Thereafter, he strove to establish himself as expert on Eastern European Jewry and as a spokesman and intercessor on their behalf. He would use the press and public opinion as leverage for this activity, making the most important change in the tactics of intercession during the 19th century. To supplement his small pay as rabbi, R√ºlf became an editor of the Memeler Dampfboot, the city's largest liberal newspaper. From 1872 until he left the city, he was editor-in-chief. In 1862 R√ºlf and Rabbi Yisrael Salanter founded a chevra kadisha together in Memel. In 1879 R√ºlf created an Armenschule, or school for poor children and in 1886 R√ºlf directed the funding and building of a synagogue for the German Jews. In 1875 for example, R√ºlf collected funds among the German Jews to assist the Lithuanian and Russian Jews in building their Beth Midrash.Rosin, Joseph. Klaipƒóda (Memel). JewishGen KehilaLinks. Retrieved 2016-05-31. In this way he won over the Eastern Jews who had first dismissed this ‚ÄúDoktor-Rabbiner‚Äù of the wealthier German minority. In 1871 he and two collaborators caused a Jewish hospital to be built in Memel. It drew so many patients to the city that in 1896 a new, larger building was put up. It has been restored and still stands today, in use as a hospital, at its scenic hilltop site. The early 1880s saw a series of efforts to force Jews out of Memel in increasing numbers. R√ºlf raised a great deal of money for the exiles' travel and living expenses. Many of these people were given enough to reach the United States. In 1885, R√ºlf used his political contacts in Germany to prevent a final mass expulsion of Jews from Memel. In 1898, R√ºlf retired from his position and moved with his family to Bonn, Germany. International aid work R√ºlf travelled east to study the cruel conditions of Jewish life in Russia and Lithuania. In response he wrote My Journey to Kovno (1869) and Three Days in Jewish Russia (1882). During this time he received reports, smuggled over the Lithuanian border, on the Russian pogroms. In Memel these were translated into German and sent to England, where they later appeared in two long articles in the London Times on January 11 and 13, 1882. Russian Jews were even able to escape to Germany through an underground directed by R√ºlf. R√ºlf established and headed the ‚ÄúPermanent Committee for Helping Russian Jews‚Äù in the 1880s. He organized a massive relief campaign in Germany for Russian Jews, and tens of thousands came to know him as 'Rabbi H√ºlf' or 'Dr. H√ºlf', meaning 'Help'. R√ºlf saved around 30,000 Jews from starvation during Lithuania's 1867-1868 famine. To this end, he collected an amazing 630,000 Mark in Germany, transferring it to 230 Lithuanian settlements over a year and a half. Zionism R√ºlf was struck by the fact that Russian Jews saw themselves simply as Jews, in contrast with 'Western' Jews who identified with their nation of residence. In 1881 he had a conversion to this view of Jewish identity. Within months, Russian Jew Leon Pinsker published Auto-Emancipation, calling for a Jewish state in response to anti-Semitism. R√ºlf agreed with the basic idea but little else, compelling him to write Aruchas Bas-Ammi (1883). There he went further than Pinsker, specifying that the Jewish homeland must be in Palestine and its language must be Hebrew, and calling for immediate purchase of land and immigration to Palestine. Three years later, R√ºlf's was one of the first portraits to appear in Kneset Israel, a great distinction.Knesset Israel, vol. I, 1886 Correspondents over these years included Pinsker and Nathan Birnbaum, coiner of the term Zionism. R√ºlf's letters and other writings are preserved in the R√ºlf Collection at the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, Israel. R√ºlf was hurt when, in 1896, the young Theodor Herzl was embraced as Zionism's international leader. That was the year in which Herzl published his landmark Der Judenstaat. However, R√ºlf came to Herzl's defense against the anti-Zionist ‚ÄúProtest Rabbis‚Äù who impeded the First Zionist Congress, leveraging his considerable reputation and writing Declaration versus Declaration in the June 25, 1897 Die Welt. In 1898, R√ºlf introduced Herzl at the Second Zionist Congress at Basle, Switzerland. In Memel, R√ºlf had been the mentor of David Wolffsohn, who went on to succeed Herzl as the second President of the World Zionist Organization. Wolffsohn came to Memel at age 17 from his Lithuanian hometown, and R√ºlf taught and greatly influenced him. Late in life, R√ºlf attempted to warn European Jews of the dangers they faced from German anti- Semitism. In Topical Study, in the May 18, 1900 Die Welt, he wrote that the end of the century would not mean the end of the murder of millions of Jews. Less than fifty years later, his own children were unable to escape the Holocaust.Benno R√ºlf remembranceJacob R√ºlf remembrance Family and legacy Isaac R√ºlf died in Bonn, four years after relocating there to continue his work in philosophy. His sons became personal friends of Konrad Adenauer, future first Chancellor of West Germany. The danger to Jews from Nazi power increased while Adenauer was mayor of Cologne, and Adenauer offered refuge to R√ºlf's son Benno at his family home in Rh√∂ndorf. However, Adenauer was himself forced to flee and take refuge at a monastery.\\"Real Memory By City Woman For Adenauer\\", Unknown Schenectady Newspaper, April 20, 1967.

It is located at 2525 Massachusetts Avenue, Northwest in the Embassy Row neighborhood. The chancery is housed in a new building, inaugurated by Turkish President S√ºleyman Demirel on April 23, 1999. Designed by Shalom Baranes Associates, it reflects aspects of Turkish vernacular architecture while harmonizing with the styles of the Sheridan- Kalorama neighborhood. Previously, the embassy had been housed in a mansion farther south, at Sheridan Circle and 23rd Street, N.W. The building today serves as the Turkish ambassador's residence. It was originally built for Edward Hamlin Everett, a bottling millionaire, in 1915. The Everett House was designed by George Oakley Totten, Jr., a Washingtonian who had spent a brief period in Turkey as the official architect for Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The Turkish government leased the building in 1932 and purchased it four years later. 2017 violent clashes On May 16, 2017, armed Turkish security forces attacked pro Kurdish protesters demonstrating on behalf of the North American Kurdish Alliance outside the ambassador's residence during a visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, forcing intervention by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. On March 31, 2016, Turkish security forces had attacked protesters and journalists further down Embassy Row during a speech by President Erdoƒüan at the Brookings Institution.

It is one of only two remaining intact and unchanged neighborhood theaters in the city of Detroit (the second being the Redford Theatre). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History The Alger Theater, presumably named for Michigan governor Russell A. Alger, was built by Detroit theater developers Saul and Hattie Sloan. The Sloans leased the theater to Detroit theater magnate George Washington Trendle, and it first opened on August 22, 1935, as a neighborhood cinema.The Historic Alger Theater from the Friends of the Alger Theater When the Alger Theater opened, it was a luxury theater, and included amenities such as sound and projection equipment, seating, and air conditioning. It continued as a movie house for forty years. However, as the surrounding neighborhood suffered socioeconomic changes, attendance began dropping off. In the mid- nineteen seventies, ownership changed hands, and the theater was used for live performances and music in addition to movies. However, the theater closed its doors in 1981. In 1984, ownership changed hands again, and the Alger was re- opened as a B-movie house. However, profits were slim, and the theater closed again in less than a year. In 1986, the theater was purchased by Friends of the Alger Theater, a nonprofit community-based organization composed of neighborhood residents and businesses dedicated to preserving the Alger Theater. They are developing programming for the community while raising funds to refurbish and reopen the theater. Description The Alger sits at the corner of Warren Avenue and Outer Drive. It is constructed of structural steel faced with brick. A two-story square-plan tower structure with an instepped parapet stands at the corner, dominating the building's facade. The tower houses the theater entrance and box office. A vertical sign with the theater's name extends from the tower toward the street. Along the Warren facade, four single-story commercial spaces faced with painted yellow brick line the sidewalk; the facade of the theater proper above is set back. On the interior of the theater, the inner and outer lobby and the balcony-less auditorium still show much of their historic finish. The auditorium is constructed of concrete block with horizontal banding in smaller concrete brick; it originally sat 1182 people but now seats 825. The stage was extended into the seating area to provide for theatrical performances. Stepped metal sconces with rounded ends adorn the walls. An anchor for community building Friends of the Alger Theater is a 25-year-old nonprofit organization. Alger Theater Matters The Friends were awarded historic designations for the theater on the state, federal and local levels. In March 2009, the city's Historic Designation Advisory Board unanimously voted to recommend that the City Council approve the designation. The Detroit City Council approved the formal local historic designation on Oct. 21, 2009. The state and federal designations were granted in 2005. In order to provide cultural opportunities and build community in the surrounding neighborhoods, the Friends provide free off-campus programming including a theater arts class at local Detroit Public Schools in partnership with Matrix Theater Company and the summertime outdoor movie series, Film on the Hill, at Balduck Park on the third Saturdays of June, July and August. In 2014, the theater was surveyed for asbestos and underwent abatement, clearing a large barrier to restoration. The group is currently raising funds for repairs to stabilize the theater, planning events and fundraising for full renovation of the 825-seat Art Moderne space.
