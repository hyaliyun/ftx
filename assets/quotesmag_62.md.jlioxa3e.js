The dam was a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, completed from 1946 through 1948 as one element of the vast Columbia Basin Project for irrigation water storage, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. Pinto Dam is an earthen structure, 130 feet high and 1900 feet long at its crest, that provides offstream storage of water. The six-mile-long crescent-shaped reservoir it creates, Billy Clapp Lake, was originally called Long Lake Reservoir, but was renamed for one of the sponsors of the project, a lawyer from Ephrata, Washington. The lake offers year-round fishing for yellow perch, crappie, rainbow trout, and walleye. The Stratford Wildlife Recreation Area borders Billy Clapp Lake on its eastern shore and hosts migrating waterfowl. Another sizable lake, Brook Lake, also stands below the dam. Columbia Basin Project Pinto Dam and Billy Clapp Lake are part of the Main Canal (1951) of the Columbia Basin project.Draft Environmental Statement, Columbia Basin Project, Washington; Columbia Basin Project, Ephrata, Washington; Department of the Interior, (INT DES-75-3), Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior; Washington, D.C.; 1975 The canal is , from Banks lake to Billy Clapp Lake. From the Billy Clap Lakes outlet, the lower reach of the Main Canal continues westward to divide into the East Low and West Canals near Adco on Washington 28. The canals total length is about including about in Long Lake. By constructing Long Lake Dam, later renamed Pinto Dam, Reclamation utilized the coulee to avoid additional canal costs. The Columbia Basin Project; Wm. Joe Simonds; Bureau of Reclamation History Program; Denver, Colorado; Research on Historic Reclamation Projects; 1998 =Billy Clapp Lake= Billy Clapp Lake formed behind Pinto Dam along the length of Long Lake Coulee. The coulee is the result of the Missoula Floods. The reservoir is long and wide with a maximum depth of feet. Previous to the creation of the reservoir, the basin contained five smaller lakes, i.e., Long, Coffee Pot, Pot, Cold Spring and July Lakes. =Pinto Dam= Pinto Dam, a zoned earth and rockfill structure, is long and high above bedrock. An uncontrolled open-channel emergency spillway is provided around the left abutment of the dam in a channel excavated in rock.

The dam will divert water from the Misicuni River to the Cochabamba Valley for several purposes to include providing water for irrigation and municipal water uses. In addition, the dam has an associated 120 MW hydroelectric power station, powered by 3 turbines 40 MW each. Construction on the dam began in June 2009 but was halted in November 2013 due to contract disputes. The company finished the construction and is started the operations in September 2017. Characteristics and costs The project has three components: * Phase I includes an already completed 20 km tunnel with the capacity to provide 2 cubic meters per second of drinking water and 1 cubic meter per second for irrigation to Cochabamba and the surrounding areas. Its cost was US$84 million. * Phase II includes a 120-meter-high concrete-face rock-fill dam with a 460-hectare reservoir with a storage capacity of 154 million cubic meters, as well as pipelines, pumping stations, a water treatment plant and an irrigation network to irrigate 4,000 hectares (under construction as of 2013). Its cost was also estimated at US$84 million, * Phase III includes a hydropower plant with an installed capacity of 120 MW at an estimated cost of US$200 million (under construction since April 2010). Water will be diverted from the reservoir through a long penstock to the plant. The dam will be the highest and largest dam in Bolivia. Misicuni project director Ramiro Saniz said in 2009 that the water from the Misicuni river is not sufficient to fill the reservoir and that other sources are needed. Background and construction progress The public company in charge of developing the project is Proyecto Misicuni, an entity created by law in 1987. The contractor for the US$90 million dam component is the Consorcio Hidroelectrico Misicuni (CHM). The Misicuni consortium, led with 51 percent ownership by Grandi Lavori Fincosit S.p.A. of Italy, was the sole bidder for the project. Bidding was limited to Italian companies and CHM was the only company to submit a bid. The consortium also includes Bolivian, Colombian and Venezuelan firms. The dam component was originally expected to be completed in 2014. However, in November 2013 the contract was canceled amid delays because CHM \\"failed to pay for pension funds, health insurances and other labour benefits and to contract key technical personnel.\\" Benefits The tunnel provides 4.5-7.5 million cubic meters of water per year to Cochabamba since 2005, depending on whether the flow of the river is low or high and supplying about 10 percent of the city's drinking water. Once the dam will be completed, the amount of drinking water available will increase tenfold to 63 million cubic meters per year. Environmental and social impact 1365 people live in the reservoir area that will be flooded and will be relocated. The Tunari National Park will also be affected. Financing The dam is partially financed by the Italian government through a 25 million Euro loan and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF). Total funding from Italy for Phased II and III is USD 93 million. Bolivia will have to pay back the loan over in 20 years with a 0.10% interest rate. The construction of the penstock, hydropower plant and power transmission line is funded by a US$101 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank approved in 2009. These works were expected to be completed by 2015, but were only 30 percent completed as of April 2013.

Biography Edith Anne Stewart was born in Glasgow, to Jane Louisa Faulds and Robert Stewart, a civil engineer. She attended the Glasgow High School for Girls. Her family lived in Germany and in Surrey, England, during her childhood. In 1919 she married the Rev. Professor James Alexander Robertson of Aberdeen, also the child of a Free Church Minister. They moved to Aberdeen, where James obtained a position as Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at the United Free Church College in Aberdeen. He wrote a number of well-received works on the New Testament, and was said to have been an effective preacher. In 1938 James was appointed Professor of Biblical Criticism at the University of Aberdeen. He remained there until he was forced to retire in 1945 due to poor health. James Alexander Robertson died in 1955. Edith lived on for almost twenty years. Work Edith Anne Robertson's work reflects her strong belief in Christianity and her interest in the culture and language of the north east of Scotland. In 1930 she published Carmen Jesu Nazereni, a verse version of the gospels. She also published a life of Francis Xavier. Later she published two collections of poems by Walter de la Mare and Gerard Manley Hopkins that she had translated into the Scots language. She corresponded with many literary figures including Marion Angus, David Daiches, Flora Garry, Nan Shepherd, Douglas Young and Samuel Beckett. Her poem The Scots Tongue (1955) gives her thoughts on the language that she loved: ::Gin I'm a livan tongue loe me; ::Saebins we'll hae mair bairns; ::Gin I'm a deid tongue nae call for keenin, ::Ye'll find me wi the gods ::Ayont the Reaveries o Time: ::Yon are the gowden tongues!

Muir incautiously maintained in 'Scott and Scotland') and incapable of expressing subtleties of feeling (as MacCraig too often assents). Moreover it does fill the gap I emphasised (in my Nelson anthology), when I remarked on the comparative lack of mystical verse in Scots.\\" A critic wrote in the Scottish international Review that \\"in verse, Edith Anne Robertson used a supple and graceful Scots, carrying a large vocabulary with apparent ease in well-varied metres.\\" Bibliography   * References Sources  1883 births 1973 deaths Lallans poets People from Glasgow Scottish women poets 20th-century Scottish poets 20th-century British women writers ","title":"Edith Anne Robertson"},{"id":"36547139","text":"Leighton Price (born 24 March 1989) is a New Zealand rugby union player.

The temple was built around 1250 BC by Ramses II. It is situated in the far north of present-day Sudan, a few kilometers south of Faras, on the west side of the Nile. On the temple walls, several sacrifices are depicted. The location of the temple was not well chosen, as it is only a few inches above the high tide of the Nile. This resulted in penetration of the lower wall layers, salt crystallization on the wall surfaces, and stones being worn down over the centuries. In addition, the temple was preyed upon by the local population. Other finds at the site include cemeteries, parts of Qubanstele, and the stele with the \\"blessings of Ptah\\". The 1963 excavations of Aksha were initiated because of the construction of the Aswan Dam. One of the discoveries included a relatively well-preserved temple wall, the western wall of the courtyard. Along its entire length, it contains a carved list of the foreign nations which Ramses II. After the temple was deemed worthy of preservation, archaeologists from the University of Ghana sawed the wall into individual blocks. It was rebuilt in the garden of the National Museum, protected by a pavilion. References Further reading * Friedrich W. Hinkel: \\"Auszug aus Nubien\\". 2. Auflage.

He was the global head of creator services at Spotify. Life and career =1972–1998: Early life and career beginnings= Carter grew up in West Philadelphia. Troy Carter was born on November 14, 1972 and was raised in West Philadelphia, attending Huey Elementary and Sayre Middle School. At the age of two, Carter's parents divorced. At the age of seven, his father, who had remarried, shot and killed his new wife's brother after an argument and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Despite this, his father and step-mother stayed together, and after prison his father rebuilt his life, with Carter calling him \\"one of my real heroes.\\" In 1990, at the age of 17, Carter dropped out of West Philadelphia High School in pursuit of a career in the music industry with his high school rap group 2 Too Many, eventually being signed by Will Smith and James Lassiter to their label WilJam Records. After the group lost their contract after a year, they disbanded and Carter then went on to work both for DJ Jazzy Jeff in the studio and for Lassiter as a personal assistant. At age 22, Carter tried to start an artistic collaboration with the Will Smith's recording studio based in Philadelphia. The year later, he was promoting rap concerts around Philadelphia for artists such as The Notorious B.I.G. It was through this that he met record producer Sean Combs, who hired Carter as an intern for Bad Boy Records in New York City for a year and a half. After Carter's internship at Bad Boy had ended, he moved to Los Angeles in order to work with James Lassiter again, only to be fired and sent back to Philadelphia. According to Lassiter, his decision was largely influenced by his beliefs that Carter had started to exhibit an entitled attitude, saying, \\"I would constantly talk to him about it, about work ethic and starting at the bottom and working his way up. When he rejected it, I told him to go back to West Philly. He had to go back and experience this for himself, and come out on the other side.\\" For the next several years, Carter struggled trying to find success in Philadelphia, citing it as one of his \\"darkest times.\\" =1999–present: career= In 1999, after several years of working in Philadelphia, Carter met then-emerging rap artist Eve in Germantown, and she asked him to be her manager. In addition, Carter began managing other rap acts such as Nelly and Floetry. That same year, Carter teamed up with Jay Erving, son of retired basketball player Julius Erving, and co-founded the talent management company Erving Wonder. In 2003, Carter moved back to Los Angeles and helped Eve get her own show on UPN. The following year, Carter and Erving sold Erving Wonder to British-based firm Sanctuary, with Carter serving as the company's executive vice president. Over the next two years, Erving Wonder's deal with Sanctuary fell apart, Eve fired him, and by 2006, Carter not only lost all the money from the Sanctuary deal, but he was severely in debt. His home mortgage was foreclosed and his car was repossessed. As Carter was facing eviction from his home, record producer Vincent Herbert, who had just left Universal Records, introduced Carter to a new client, then-unknown Lady Gaga, who had just been dropped from Def Jam Records. For the next year, Carter, Herbert, and Gaga went around California, performing at multiple clubs each night with both little money and little support. It was also in 2007 that Carter founded Coalition Media Group, and its management division Atom Factory in 2010. In 2011, he co-founded The Backplane, a Silicon Valley-based startup that attempts to \\"redefine social media\\" by allowing celebrities and brands to \\"connect with fans, foster community, and cultivate brand loyalty\\". It was also in 2011 that Carter received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special for his work on the HBO special Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden, sharing the nomination with Lady Gaga, Vincent Herbert, Jimmy Iovine, and Mo Morrison. The following year, he created A \\\\ IDEA, a product development and branding agency, as well as AF Square, an angel fund and technology consultancy with investments in over 40 startups including Spotify, Warby Parker, Songza, Dropbox, Fab.com, and Uber. Since signing Lady Gaga in 2007, Carter has gone on to manage numerous other artists such as John Legend, Greyson Chance, Mindless Behavior, Priyanka Chopra, Lindsey Stirling, Meghan Trainor, The Ceremonies and Pia Mia. He is a member of the 2012 class of Henry Crown Fellows at The Aspen Institute. He is on the board of advisors of 'opinion-network' start-up State.com. Carter appeared as a guest Shark during the seventh season of reality TV show Shark Tank, which aired on October 9, 2015.Alex Konrad, \\"Ashton Kutcher, Troy Carter And Chris Sacca Test Investing Chops On New Season Of 'Shark Tank'\\" Carter was named to Oprah Winfrey's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders in 2016. In July 2018, it was announced that Carter would exit Spotify in early September and assumed an advisory role. Personal life Carter and his wife Rebecca have five children.

County, Wisconsin. It is found in a series of quarries and outcrops that are notable for their large concentration of exceptionally preserved trace fossils in Cambrian tidal flats. One quarry in particular also has the distinction of preserving some of the first land animals. These are preserved as three-dimensional casts, which is unusual for Cambrian animals that are only lightly biomineralized.Collette and Hagadorn, 2010 Additionally, Blackberry Hill is the first occurrence recognized to include Cambrian mass strandings of scyphozoans (jellyfish).Getty and Hagadorn, 2008  Age and stratigraphic placement  The strata at Blackberry Hill are known to belong to the Elk Mound Group;Schieber et al., 2007 however, the lack of good stratigraphic markers (i.e., index fossils) in some Blackberry Hill localities, coupled with uncertainties about the age range of the Elk Mound Group itself, make it difficult to assign a precise age to these strata. Many researchers consider these rocks to be Late Cambrian,Getty and Hagadorn, 2008 which is the age to which the Elk Mound Group was originally assigned;Ostrom, 1966 however, some recent authors now believe the Elk Mound Group and the fossils of Blackberry Hill could date back to the Middle Cambrian, based on certain fossils obtained from other areas.Seilacher and Hagadorn, 2010Young and Hagadorn, 2010  Geological and environmental setting  Most of the strata are composed of well bedded quartz sandstone and orthoquartzite. They were deposited mainly on intertidal and supratidal sand flats near or along the shoreline of the supercontinent Laurentia.Collette et al., 2012 Ripple marks and numerous other sedimentary structures identical to those found on modern beaches abound on the strata surfaces. One of the most conspicuous features is extensive areas of specific structures not unlike those associated with modern biofilms and microbial mats. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the feeding potential of this presumed microbial material was one of the forces that lured the first animals out of the sea.MacNaughton et al., 2002 It is also believed that the same material aided in the exceptional preservation of many of Blackberry Hill's trace fossils.Seilacher, 2007, page 28Seilacher, 2008  Significance Among the many paleontological discoveries thus far made at Blackberry Hill are the following: *The first body fossils, and therefore the identity, of one of the first animals to walk on land. *The only fossils that link those animals with their trackways. *Body fossils of what may be the first phyllocarid. *Identification of the maker of Protichnites trackways after over 150 years of speculation. *The largest concentrations of fossilized, stranded scyphozoans (i.e., jellyfish).Hagadorn et al., 2002 *What may be the first mating behavior in the fossil record. The largest, most productive quarry is still in operation, thereby revealing fresh surfaces and the potential for new discoveries on a continuing basis.  Biota  Sedimentary structures associated with biofilms and microbial mats are the only evidence of non- animal life at Blackberry Hill, as is the case elsewhere in this pre- embryophyte period in the history of Earth's life on land. The animal life of Blackberry Hill was, however, represented by several kinds of macrofossils, all preserved as three-dimensional casts or impressions, including: * Mosineia macnaughtoni– These large (up to 10+ cm in length) arthropods, apparently having paddle or oar-like appendages, along with another genus from similar- aged strata of Quebec, have been identified as the oldest euthycarcinoids in the fossil record and some of the first animals to walk on land. It is thus far known from only three exoskeletons preserved ventral-side-up, all lacking the heads and carapaces. *Arenosicaris inflata– This smaller arthropod (up to approximately 5 cm in length), more common than Mosineia (over 40 specimens to date), is thought to be one of the oldest members of the Phyllocarida, and possibly one of the oldest crustaceans in the fossil record. Disarticulated or splayed carapaces have been found in addition to essentially complete exoskeletons; however, the head is poorly known. Limbs, which are rarely fossilized in phyllocarids, are typically preserved in the A. inflata specimens. *Scyphozoan medusae – Most of these are dome-shaped fossils, usually represented as body cavity infillings formed as the stranded animals pumped their bodies in an attempt to escape, and in so doing, ingested sand.Hagadorn and Belt, 2008, page 429 Being composed mainly of water, scyphozoans rarely fossilize; however, they are found by the hundreds on some surfaces of one Blackberry Hill quarry. The size of these fossils is also noteworthy; some specimens have achieved a diameter of 950 cm, making them the largest scyphozoan fossils on record.  Trace fossils  *Protichnites – These trackways (up to 8 cm wide at Blackberry Hill) are characterized by two parallel rows of paired footprints, often in sets, and a medial furrow or series of medial impressions, presumably from a dragging or touching tail. The maker of Protichnites was conjectural since 1852, when Sir Richard Owen, the pioneering British anatomist and paleontologist who coined the term “dinosauria,” first named and described them based on material from equivalent strata of Quebec.Owen, 1852 Fossils from Blackberry Hill named P. eremita,Hagadorn and Seilacher, 2009 found over 150 years later, solved the mystery by eventually revealing that at least some Protichnites were likely produced by the euthycarcinoid Mosineia macnaughtoni. P. eremita was originally interpreted to have been the product of an arthropod with the assistance of a mollusk shell that it used in hermit crab-style behavior. *Diplichnites – These trackways at Blackberry Hill often resemble Protichnites, except they lack medial markings. They may have been made by the same animal(s) that produced Protichnites, based on individual trackways having medial furrows that appear and disappear as the animal travelled. It has been suggested that some Diplichnites are undertracks, whereby the animal walked on the top layer of sand, but only the tips of its appendages reached the underlying layer.Goldring and Seilacher, 1971 In these cases, the top layer might then exhibit Protichnites due to the tail that dragged on the surface, and the bottom layer would result in the furrow-less Diplichnites. It is possible that some Diplichnites were produced by trilobites or unknown arthropods, but no fossils of trilobites have been found thus far at Blackberry Hill.Hoxie, 2005 *Climactichnites – These distinctive trace fossils, up to 14 cm in width and resembling tire tracks, are the most conspicuous trackways at Blackberry Hill, literally covering large surfaces of certain strata. Two ichnospecies are found: C. wilsoni, which are surface trackways that have lateral ridges; and C. youngi, which are burrows that lack lateral ridges. Their maker was likely a large, slug-like mollusk.Yochelson and Fedonkin, 1993Getty and Hagadorn, 2009 Occasionally the resting trace, Musculopodus, is found at one end of a C. wilsoni trackway. It has been speculated that the animal may have remained burrowed in the sediment in the daytime to avoid desiccation from the sunlight, and emerged at night to feed on the near-shore and on-shore microbial mats; however, there is no direct fossil evidence of grazing at Blackberry Hill, such as fossilized fecal pellets or strands. *Other trace fossils – A variety of less conspicuous trace fossils is common at Blackberry Hill. The resting trace Rusophycus, bilobate linear traces similar to Cruziana and Aulichnites, and ropelike traces are sometimes found in close association with Arenosicaris inflata and are believed to result mainly from the burrowing activity of that phyllocarid.Collette et al., 2010 References Further reading       External links  *Blackberry Hill fossils :Provides a discussion of Blackberry Hill fossils, as one of Paleontology Portal’s “Famous Flora and Fauna” pages.

This locality is of particular importance because there are very few Nubian remains from that era. it dates to the period just before the beginning of the Kingdom of Kush. Hillat al-Arab contains about twenty tombs carved into rock, each consisting of several rooms, and meant for different people. As the ceiling of the main chamber collapsed in antiquity, there was no grave robbing. The grave chamber was painted in a rather primitive style. Artifacts in the tombs include vessels and jewelry. The ceramics from the oldest grave is largely Egyptian; at that time, the area was under Egyptian rule. Many vessels and jewelry were directly imported from Egypt, although the area was still hardly under its dominion. Grave 19 is of particular interest because it was used for centuries.

It manages numerous projects in Thailand as well as other countries in Asia. The foundation's mission focuses on three main areas: “improving social and economic development, preserving the environment, and supporting local art and culture.”\\"Origin\\", Mae Fah Luang Foundation Under Royal Patronage, Retrieved 2012-06-21. In 1972, Her Royal Highness Princess Srinagarindra (Princess Mother), grandmother of the present King of Thailand, Vajiralongkorn, founded the Hill Crafts Foundation to offer market access for craft-making villages in the northern highlands. It was renamed the Mae Fah Luang Foundation in 1985, after the name given to the princess mother by the ethnic minorities, 'royal mother from the sky'. The new name indicated the growing scope of social development efforts the foundation was assuming based on the ideas and philosophy of the princess mother. In 1988, the MFLF initiated its flagship project, the Doi Tung Development Project, on Doi Tung in Chiang Rai, with the goal of providing people with sustainable livelihoods. The MFLF developed the Sustainable Alternative Livelihood Development (SALD) model, which emphasizes understanding the needs of the local people and their socio-geographical realities, as well as integration and involvement of all levels. This model has been replicated in its projects in Thailand, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Indonesia.  History  The Mae Fah Luang Foundation (MFLF) was founded in 1972 by Princess Srinagarindra as the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation under the Royal Patronage of Her Royal Highness. The Hill Crafts Foundation addressed the problem of poverty and poor living conditions faced by the ethnic minority groups in northern Thailand by promoting and marketing their handicrafts to supplement their income, as well as teaching them skills and disciplines such as Thai language, basic math, and health education at Rai Mae Fah Luang in Chiang Rai (today known as the Mae Fah Luang Art and Culture Park). In 1985, the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation was renamed the Mae Fah Luang Foundation under the Royal Patronage of Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother, as it initiated more extensive rural development projects. The MFLF undertook its first comprehensive development project, the Doi Tung Development Project, in 1988 at Doi Tung to tackle opium cultivation at its root: poverty and lack of opportunity. The project aimed to create self- sufficient communities that would become independent of external support and well equipped to adapt to the changing environment. Today, this work is known as the SALD model. The Hall of Opium, an exhibition hall, was established in 2003 to educate people about illicit drugs, especially opiates, in order to reduce drug abuse. With the development of the Doi Tung area and easier access to schooling opportunities, the Rai Mae Fah Luang, which previously offered boarding and education facilities to ethnic children, was transformed into the Mae Fah Luang Art and Cultural Park in 2008, in line with its mission to preserve and support local art and culture. The MFLF has continued to expand its efforts in supporting vulnerable communities in Thailand and internationally, playing an important role as an intermediary between state and private organizations. The subsequent projects target the root causes of poverty by addressing areas of health, livelihood, and education based on the identified best practices from the Doi Tung Development Project, as well as the development philosophy of the princess mother.  Flagship projects  = Doi Tung Development Project (1988-2017) = The Doi Tung Development Project (DTDP) started in 1988, covering approximately 15,000 hectares of the Doi Tung area, in the Golden Triangle, a major region of opium production, impacting 11,000 people in 29 villages. This mountainous watershed area had been subject to slash-and-burn cultivation, opium cultivation, and trafficking of both human and arms. The project aimed to resolve problems faced by locals, from lack of health care, education, and governmental support, over a span of 30 years (1988–2017), in three phases: Phase I (1988–1993): This phase ensured the basic necessities of life, providing basic health care, including drug rehabilitation, developing infrastructures such as roads and reservoirs, and reforesting the area. Schools, health care centers, and a cottage industry training center were built. New crops, such as coffee and macadamia, were introduced to replace opium. Phase II (1994–2002): The second phase focused on creating a sustainable model through which the locals could generate income and become self-sufficient by establishing occupational development centers for agriculture, agro-processing, handicrafts, and tourism. The Doi Tung brand was created to serve as the main channel of income to finance social activities of the DTDP. It includes four business units: food, handicrafts, horticulture, and tourism. The DTDP became financially self-sustainable by 2001 through the Doi Tung brand. It has now established over 20 cafes and stores throughout Thailand. Its products range from coffee and macadamia to clothes, housewares, and stationery. Phase III (2003–2017): This phase is about strengthening the business units and to make sure that income-generating entities are stabilized. This final phase prepares to transfer the management of the DTDP from the MFLF to the local people by emphasizing the training of human resources In 2003, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recognized the DTDP as one of the world's best examples of alternative development. In 2009, the Secretary General of the MFLF received the Schwab Foundation's \\"Social Entrepreneur of the Year for the Region of East Asia\\" for the MFLF's efforts in combating social problems and improving people's quality of life while restoring the natural environment. In 2012, the DTDP partnered with the housewares company, IKEA, to create the Allvarlig tableware collection. In 2013, Ikea entered into a partnership with Doi Tung to produce ceramics, tableware, and mulberry paper sold in the limited edition collections Annanstans and Hantverk. Accomplishments * A 1,000-day Rehabilitation Program was carried out from 1991 to 1994, to assist the nearly 500 residents addicted to opiates. It had a relapse rate of about 15%. After the program ended, drug rehabilitation became the responsibility of the local communities, with assistance from the project. * Forest coverage has increased from 42% of total project area of about 15,000 hectares to over 90%. Opium is no longer grown. * In 1989, the average local income was US$120 per person per year. In 2011, the number had increased to almost US$1,400 per person per year. On average, each household earns about US$9,150 a year. * Total income from agricultural land has increased about three-fold from US$388,889 in 1988 to about US$1.2 million in 2007, although the total agricultural area was reduced from 58% to approximately 11% (replaced mainly by reforestation). * Thai citizenship has been granted to 76% of the population, up from only 38% in 1992. * In 1992, 56% of the population was illiterate and only 0.2% had college degrees. Today, the number of college or university graduates has increased from 18 to 528 people. The majority of the new generation goes to schools in the project area.Schwab Foundation Application 2009 = Mae Fah Luang Art and Cultural Park = In 1979, the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation, with cooperation from various international organizations including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), established a youth leadership program to equip ethnic minority children with basic education and social skills, training them in agriculture, craftsmanship, and leadership. The training program was conducted at Rai Mae Fah Luang, which is now the Mae Fah Luang Art and Culture Park. The Rai Mae Fah Luang became a home to hundreds of youths from rural areas with no access to education so that they could attend schools in the city. The role of the Rai Mae Fah Luang as an educational institution came to an end when the DTDP established schools in the vicinity of their villages. Today, the area has been transformed into the Mae Fah Luang Art and Culture Park, housing the region's largest collection of Lan Na arts, including the teak wood exhibition, a botanical collection, and the Golden Pavilion that the people of Chiang Rai built and presented to the princess mother in honor of her 84th birthday. = Hall of Opium = The Hall of Opium was created to reduce the demand for drugs through knowledge and education. While the DTDP tackles the drug problems from the supply side, this centre tries to solve drug problems from the demand side. A result of almost 10 years of research, the exhibition at the Hall of Opium conveys the history of opium and its trade across the globe, as well as provides a comprehensive source of knowledge on opium, opiates, and other narcotics. The exhibition also presents current issues regarding the efforts to control drugs and the impacts of drug abuse, with the belief that education can deter drug abuse.  The SALD Model  The Sustainable Alternative Livelihood Development (SALD) model of MFLF emerged from the experience of the Doi Tung Development Project. It places the local community at the center of their own development, promoting economic, environmental, and social growth by building a strong community driven by local wisdom. The people-centric model uses a holistic approach that addresses health, livelihood, and education needs. It emphasizes local ownership and leadership to nurture independence to prepare the locals to continue on their own development regardless of external assistance. The model follows four general stages: * Initial preparation of the development team ** Gain support from all the parties of interest—government officials, the private sector and the community—ensuring that they agree on the goals, and are committed. ** Build a facilitation team that will coordinate the resources, such as fundings, among relevant parties, as well as make sure that the ideas generated will be the basis for discussions with the communities. * Preparation of the community ** This step is geared toward building trust through communication and implementation of programs addressing immediate needs, known as the “Quick Hit”, usually concerning healthcare and food. **The foundation seeks to ensure that the community members are prepared and eager to get involved with the projects by getting them to understand their own problems and needs, how to address them, and the benefits of doing so. * Implementation ** The implementation process continues building confidence and motivating people by working hand-in-hand with them, often creating incentives (such as improved livestock, access to irrigation and value-added products) for them. Here, the ideas are carried out through a learning-by-doing process and incorporating local wisdom. ** In the next phase, the MFLF aims to create market driven value-chains by employing practices used in professional business, building on local capacity. * Exit (this stage focuses on the following objectives to make sure that the community is self-sufficient and can continue with their own development) ** The establishment of rules and regulations within the community ** Allocate duties and responsibilities among locals to address future needs ** Provide additional knowledge if needed  Domestic Outreach  = Pang Mahan Reforestation Project (2005-2008) = Key partners: Siam Commercial Bank PLC, Chaipattana Foundation The Pang Mahan Reforestation Project covers 2,250 hectares and is home to six ethnic minority groups in 18 villages, totaling about 7,600 people. This CSR initiative centers on reforestation as a means to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, becoming the first domestic outreach project that utilized and adapted the foundation's SALD approach. At Pang Mahan, the MFLF planted multiple variants of native plants, a method known as \\"assisted tree regeneration\\", improving on lessons learned at Doi Tung where the method of monoculture reforestation involved clearcutting any remaining trees before replanting. The MFLF implemented other mechanisms to support the preservation of forests, like establishing community regulations among locals to prevent forest fires, as well as creating a gas fund to promote cooking with gas instead of firewood. Additionally, an extensive irrigation system was constructed. An \\"economic forest\\", reserved for long-term plantings of crops for profit, i.e., tea trees, and a \\"sustenance forest\\", intended for everyday use, i.e., bamboo for food and construction, were designated. In addition, a seed bank and a livestock bank were set up to reduce daily expenses and provide the community with supplementary income. The average income per family in the 18 villages increased from 18,611 baht per family per in 2004 to 97,882 baht in 2008. Forests were restored and biodiversity in the area was revived. Most importantly, locals became leaders in development. = Puna Reforestation Project (2006-present) = Key partner: Chaipattana Foundation At Puna, the earlier reforestation models at Doi Tung and Pang Mahan were refined to become the Natural Tree Regeneration method or “reforestation without planting.” This method can be used when the soil has not been completely destroyed or demineralized over an extended period of time from chemical use, and there are still trees in the area. In the project area of 3900 hectares, no new trees were planted. The project focused on land zoning and land management. Instead, the forest is left alone so it could regenerate itself. The reserve forest was protected from grazing, forest fires, and human interference. As in Pang Mahan, sustenance and economic forestry zones promoting bamboo, banana, and tea oil were implemented to provide livelihood. The average income per family increased from about US$750 to US$2,400 per family per year within three years. = Integrated Rural Livelihood Development Model in Nan (2009-2011) = Key partner: Royal Initiative Discovery Institute The development in Nan Province spanned three districts: Tha Wang Pha District, Song Khwae District, and Chaloem Phra Kiat District, covering a total of 21 villages. The watershed in Nan Province contributes to as much as 45% of the water that flows into the Chao Phraya River, yet the villages face problems of drought in the summer and severe flooding and landslides during the rainy season. The local communities relied on slash-and-burn cultivation and high levels of chemical pesticides and fertilizers to cope with land shortages on the steep slopes. The communities had problems of poverty and one village was 17 million baht in debt at the start of the project as the villagers often had to borrow money to buy food or take out loans for agricultural production. With help and labor from the locals, the MFLF worked to maximize the use of the existing irrigation system, making repairs as well as building new check dams, weirs, and reservoirs to direct water to agricultural plots. The locals took ownership of construction works and were later equipped with the knowledge to carry out subsequent maintenance necessary. This improved system of weirs and canals has allowed farmers to grow rice at least twice a year as well as post- harvest crops. The project introduced terraced rice paddy fields to deal with the problem of demineralized soil and land shortages, increasing productivity, and reducing the use of forestland. A bank of economic plants was founded to provide locals with seedlings such as sugar palm, rattan, and eagle wood. This not only reforested the area, helping to prevent further soil erosion, but also created long-term income. In addition, a livestock bank providing comprehensive services, from husbandry knowledge to feed and medicine and livestock management, was set up, helping to build capacity for local youths. This livestock bank has reduced economic vulnerability since the villagers raise these livestock as food, and earn extra income from selling extra meat. The ownership of the project was handed to the local community in 2011 and village committees were established to manage each different area. = Huay Klai Sustainable Water Management Project in Udon Thani (2011-present) = Key partners: Chaipattana Foundation; Royal Initiative Discovery Institute; Model Farm Project at Her Majesty the Queen's Initiative of the Northeast Region; Ministry of Interior; Udon Thani Provincial Administration The project in Nong Wua So District of Udon Thani Province focuses on the underutilized Huay Klai Reservoir as the main subject. Huay Klai Reservoir is an example of rural development that lacks integration among responsible governmental agencies. The primary survey showed that the reservoir was in perfect condition, yet communities in the vicinity could not fully benefit from it since there was no proper water distribution system. Working with the local administration and local people, the MFLF created a new water distribution system, while the Model Farm piloted two model cultivation plots in the village, whose techniques are now used in over 150 more plots. The locals were given vegetable seeds, taught about soil utility, multi-storey cropping, and tending to livestock. They have become self-reliant, consuming and earning income from their own agricultural products instead of having to buy them. With the increase in income and work opportunity, the locals are able to remain in the area to earn a living instead of having to find work in other areas and overseas.  International Outreach  Doi Tung has proved to be a model for development efforts around the globe. = Yong Kha, Shan State, Myanmar (2002-2004) = Key partners: Government of Thailand; Government of Myanmar Like the people in Doi Tung, the locals in Yong Kha had also been dependent on opium cultivation as a source of income. Many of the 6,022 locals were facing health problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, scabies, malnutrition, and other common diseases. Here, the first outreach project replicating the SALD model was carried out, first by providing health care by Thai mobile medical units to address their immediate needs. Fourteen locals were trained to diagnose and treat malaria, tuberculosis, and common diseases to expand the local health care capacity. Within a year, there was zero mortality from malaria and the infection rate reduced from 20% to 2% in three years. Identified by the local people as significant priorities, a 16-bed hospital and a school for 500 students were built by local workers. A small-scale irrigation system was built by the community to aid growing sustenance and cash crops all year round. A seed bank and a pig bank were also set up. Children were taught a formal curriculum as well as practical agricultural skills in the school's vegetable plot, chicken coop, and fishpond. After three years, the total investment in this project amounted to US$640,000 (US$106 per person per year). It generated benefits to the community in cash and in kind equivalent to US$704,574 (US$117 per person per year). The project ended in 2004 due to changes in the government of Myanmar but development activities continued under local staffing. = Balkh, Afghanistan (2006-2012) = Key Partners: The Government of Afghanistan The Afghan Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) The Afghan Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) The Provincial Government of Balkh Province Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) The Government of Belgium Ministry of Development Cooperation The Royal Danish Government The A4 Sheep Bank Project (A4SB) is a six-year project carried out by the MFLF in cooperation with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development of Afghanistan (MRRD) and the Provincial Government of Balkh, together with the local community. The A4 Sheep Bank (A4SB) project reaches out to almost 500 households in 15 villages in Dehdadi and Nahr-e-shahe districts, Balkh Province. The goal of the project is to revive the Afghan Karakul sheep industry in order to strengthen rural livelihood, improve income and pave the way towards the creation of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) adding value to sheep by-products. The A4SB received initial funding from the Belgian Government, followed by the Royal Thai Government and MRRD's National Area Based Development Program (NABDP), and most recently, from the Danish Embassy in Afghanistan through MRRD's Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program (AREDP). The project trained local Afghan youths as para-veterinarians to operate a subscription-based Mobile Veterinary Unit. The subscribing sheep owners provide payment for the veterinary services in the form of livestock, which is then used in a sheep-loan system, or A4 Sheep Bank. The Sheep Bank lends sheep to economically vulnerable farmers, with the goal of reducing poverty and deterring them from illicit activities like opium poppy cultivation. The farmers repay the loans with the sheep's offspring, which can then be loaned to other farmers, creating a revolving fund. Over the past five years, the A4 Sheep Bank Project has achieved significant results- reducing economic vulnerability and promoting community-based economic participation, allowing Afghan sheep owners themselves to assist poorer fellow Afghans. The accumulated economic impact for 464 beneficiary households in 15 villages - from the reduced livestock mortality rates, increased sheep offspring for the 287 registered sheep owners, and sheep loans provided to 177 economically vulnerable households - approximates over US$1,890,000 in 2012. In addition, the improved quantity and quality of sheep provide a larger raw material pool to capture further downstream value-adding opportunities and lead towards the development of related community-based enterprises. The A4 Sheep Bank Project is currently in its last phase. The project is working to support the transition of the mobile veterinary unit into a privatized business as well as assist sheep owners to form enterprise groups involved in trading live sheep, pelts, skins and wool. In addition, a wool-processing and yarn-spinning project will be established in order to create immediate employment opportunities and income for Afghan women to work from their homes. The production of high-quality handspun yarn would be able to add value to sheared sheep wool and link into other downstream industries such as textile, carpets and handicrafts, generating further income and job prospects. = Aceh, Indonesia (2006-2012) = Key Partners: The Government of Thailand Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) The Government of Indonesia National Narcotics Board of Indonesia (BNN) Office of the Governor of Aceh Provincial Health Office of Aceh The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Sambinoe Foundation The MFLF was approached by the UNODC and the Government of Indonesia to help solve the problem of cannabis cultivation by creating other possible livelihood activities to alleviate poverty using the SALD approach. The project sought to double the income per capita from less than US$1 to more than US$2 per day for the target population who have endured 30 years of civil conflict and the 2004 tsunami. In 2007, the MFLF piloted the Malaria Management Program in Lamteuba Village Cluster, with a population of approximately 4,700, training the local health team to carry out malaria treatment, from diagnosis to treatment and prevention. The program successfully reduced the infection rate to less than 0.05% in an area where malaria had been endemic. The program has since extended assistance to other areas in Indonesia, including capacity building for over 1,000 midwives and health technicians. Lamteuba is now a model of malaria management, providing knowledge to people from government organizations and academic institutions. In 2012, the MFLF local malaria team started a malaria management program in Aceh Jaya District, another area in Aceh where malaria is endemic, in cooperation with the Provincial Health of Office of Aceh, local health authorities and community representatives. The MFLF, in cooperation with the Prostheses Foundation of the princess mother in Chiang Mai, Thailand trained four Acehnese amputees on low-cost and effective prostheses production in 2007. The Foundation then aided in establishing an Achenese operated Prostheses Center at the Zainoel Abidin Hospital in Banda Aceh, where artificial limbs are produced for those who have lost their limbs, mainly from the political conflict or tsunami disaster. In December 2008, with Sambinoe Foundation and the local Government of Aceh, the MFLF established the \\"Sustainable Rural Development Centre\\" in Maheng-Lamcot Village, Aceh Besar District as a one-stop learning and demonstration centre on irrigation, agriculture, livestock, and basic value adding initiatives. Over three years, the various development activities, including the goat farm, seed banks, vegetable cultivation plots, and rice mill, have brought about an increase in income for the community of Maheng-Lamcot from an average of 83 US cents to US$2.70 per person per day. = Yenan Chaung Township, Magwe Region, Myanmar (2010-Present) = Key Partners: Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries of Myanmar Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency (TICA) Office of the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand (ONCB) Yenan Chaung Township is one of the least developed townships in Magwe Region, which has a population of about 150,000. The people in the region suffer from insufficient water both for household consumption and agricultural cultivation- having limited sources of ground water and relying almost solely on rain for growing crops. They mostly plant beans and sesame since there is not enough water to grow rice. They utilize their livestock for work, transportation and to sell for cash. For additional income, the locals cut down trees to sell as logs and coals, as well as leave the area to find work. During 2011–2012, the MFLF worked in 16 villages in 4 village tracts covering approximately 2,000 household beneficiaries or 9,370 people, with the possibility to extend to a wider area. The project first started by setting up an anti-venom serum bank, since there was a serious problem with snake bites and lack of serum access, resulting in preventable deaths. Secondly, the Foundation worked with the community on developing water resources- including installing hand pumps, digging new wells, and repairing and building reservoirs and weirs. In the process, the locals learned how to care for these water systems. A goat bank, as well as para-veterinary training and services, complemented by livestock medicine funds, were set up to increase assets and income for the people. In addition, the MFLF established a seed bank to allow the villagers easier access to cultivation inputs. The MFLF is also helping to develop alternative energy sources - including biogas from cattle manure as well as solar power for lighting in order to help reduce expenses and promote a healthier lifestyle for the villagers. Basic value addition to local agriculture produce is also being introduced in order to educate villagers on basic entrepreneurial skills and lead to more long-term and sustainable income for the community.

Directed by Michael Bay and starring Sean Whalen, it was the first commercial in the \\"Got Milk?\\" advertising campaign. The ad depicts a history buff, portrayed by Whalen, who is unable to audibly voice the answer of a radio contest because he runs out of milk to wash out the peanut butter sandwich stuck in his mouth. Its title refers to the American politician of the same name, the contest answer. Production The commercial was created by advertising agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and initially ran in October 1993 as the first ad in the \\"Got Milk?\\" advertising campaign. It was directed by Michael Bay, then a recent film graduate of the Art Center College of Design, through Propaganda Films. Bay directed his first feature film the following year, and quickly became well-known as a commercially successful film director. According to Jeff Goodby, it was Bay who made the ad \\"visually unforgettable\\" with \\"the idea of having this guy live in a warehouse or whatever\\", resulting in a \\"mixture of history and weirdness\\" that was both memorable and funny. The ad was edited by Tom Muldoon, and its music was composed by Jonathan Elias. Synopsis The ad takes place in a warehouse turned into a private museum or shrine, housing a history buff's (Sean Whalen) collection of artifacts revolving around the Burr–Hamilton duel. The hapless history buff spreads peanut butter on a piece of bread while listening to classical music on the radio. At the end of the music, the radio host (voiced by Rob Paulsen) announces a $10,000 contest in which he will make a random call and ask the question, \\"Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?\\" The man bites off half his folded sandwich in a single mouthful and knowingly looks around his museum, hearing the gunshot as he looks at the guns used in the duel. The history buff's phone rings, and he interrupts the announcer mid- question, answering correctly by naming Aaron Burr. However, because of the peanut butter sandwich in his mouth, his answer is unintelligible. He quickly tries to wash the sandwich down with some milk, but as he goes to pour a glass, he is horrified to discover that his milk carton has only a drop left. With only a few seconds left, he tries to say the answer again, but the announcer is unable to understand him, and hangs up. The history buff stares sadly at his phone, whispering \\"Aaron Burr...!\\" The ad fades out with a baritone voiceover asking, in a near-mocking tone, \\"got milk?\\" as the tagline appears onscreen. Reception Entertainment Weekly, in a 1997 list, named \\"Aaron Burr\\" as the 11th best commercial of all time. The ad appeared in the 1999 Reader's Digest VHS compilation Laugh? I Thought I'd Die!. In 2002, it was named one of the ten best commercials of all time by a USA Today poll. In 2002, nine years after its initial run, the \\"Aaron Burr\\" ad ran again in a nationwide television campaign, which was considered a rarity in the advertising industry. At the 2009 Clio Awards ceremony, the ad was inducted into the Clio Awards Hall of Fame. The ad was praised by Fast Company in 2018 as \\"an ad-world cultural touchstone... bold, original, never before attempted, and never successfully remastered.\\"  In popular culture  In the years that followed the airing of the \\"Aaron Burr\\" advertisement, parodies appeared in several television series and other media: * In 2002, the ad's premise was parodied in The Simpsons episode \\"Jaws Wired Shut\\", where character Homer Simpson knows the answer to a trivia question that would win him free beer for life, but is unable to give the answer because his jaws are wired shut. * A parody of the ad was used as a bumper on the Sirius XM satellite radio station '90s on 9. * The Good Eats episode \\"Celeryman\\", which aired in June 2008 on the Food Network, included a parody in which Alton Brown used peanut butter on celery, rather than bread. * In a sketch on The Bozo Super Sunday Show parodying the ad, Bozo the Clown was unable to win a new bicycle from a radio station because his peanut butter and jelly sandwich rendered him unintelligible. * In 2015, the producers of the Broadway musical Hamilton recreated the commercial in a nearly shot-for-shot parody, with the history buff played by Leslie Odom Jr., who originated the role of Burr in Hamilton. *In the Season 10 Episode 46 of the Nostalgia Critic entitled \\"War of the Commercials\\" when the Nostalgia Critic discovers that the Aaron Burr milk commercial was directed by Michael Bay there was a cut to a sketch that makes a modern style version of the commercial except a parody of Michael Bay's modern directing style. Except the question is \\"Who wrote the legend of King Arthur\\" instead of \\"Who shot Alexander Hamilton.\\" * The commercial was a clue in the 2020 Jeopardy! special, Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time. When contestant Brad Rutter answered, he said the name \\"Aaron Burr\\" in a muffled, unintelligible tone similar to the commercial.http://www.j-archive.com/showgameresponses.php?game_id=6527 References American television commercials Clio Award winners 1993 in American television 1993 works Works by Michael Bay Milk in culture Advertisement ","title":"Aaron Burr (advertisement)"},{"id":"36547358","text":"Borroloola Airport is an airport located approximately south of Borroloola in the Northern Territory, Australia.

Originally a manor house which traces its history back to the 15th century, it now houses a folk high school. History Little is known about Engelsholm's earliest history. The estate was acquired from the crown by Timme Nielsen Rosenkrantz in 1452. It was owned by the Brahe family between 1590 and 1725. Knud Brahe, the brother of famous astronomer Tycho Brahe, constructed a new main building, in two storeys and with four corner towers, in 1592-93. The identity of the architect remains unclear but it may have been Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder or Hercules von Oberberg. Engelsholm on drawing from 1879 This Renaissance castle was adapted to the Baroque style for Gerhard de Lichtenberg with the assistance of Nicolaus Hinrich Rieman. By 1740 it was a white-washed building with a black-glazed tile roof and onion domes topping the four towers. Engelsholm's most famous former owner is Admiral Niels Juel who owned the estate from 1784 until 1786. Most of the land was sold off in lots in 1931 and the adjacent farm buildings were demolished. The folk high school Engelsholm was purchased and turned into a folk high school in 1939, from 1952 run as a self-owning institution.

The Norsemen appear to have been taken by surprise but a counterattack ensured Brittany was reconquered. * In 936 following the death of Rudolph and Louis IV's ascending the throne of West Francia, the Bretons attempted to divest themselves from Frankish hegemony this time and rose in revolt. Receiving support from the Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan, the Bretons spread their rebellion throughout the peninsula and this brought them into direct confrontation with Norsemen colonists living within the region.Haywood, J.

Order of Battle  On August 1 939, a united Breton army lead by Alan II, a Breton count Judicael Berengar of Rennes and elements from a Frankish count Hugh II of Maine decisively attacked and defeated the Norsemen stronghold, bringing a end to the occupation. The site of the battlefield is considered to be south of Mont St Michel over the Couesnon River along the a tributary within a kilometre from Trans-la-Fôret.Price, N. The Vikings in Brittany, Society for Northern Research, University College, London, 1989  Outcome  The Breton victory at Trans-la-Forêt freed Brittany of Viking/Norsemen occupation and led to the re-establishment of the Breton State as a Sovereign Duchy under Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Henri-Georges Gaignard.

Viking piracy affects the vibrant maritime trade between the Bretons and their Welsh cousins isolating the Bretons. Armorican texts protected by monks for centuries are lost after this period. The Breton capital is moved from Nantes to Rennes as it is regarded as more defensible. This will become a point of discord between the two cities.

It closed on September 3, 2012. History When Texas Chute Out opened in 1976, the ride was a major engineering innovation at the park dominating the entrance to the parking lot. The ride was derived from the famed Parachute Jump ride at the legendary Coney Island in New York. Ride engineers from Intamin developed the ride, and then Six Flags purchased three Parachute Drop rides with two built at Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Over Mid-America (now Six Flags St. Louis). Texas Chute Out was the world’s first and known as a “modern” parachute drop ride when it opened in 1976. During Holiday in the Park, Texas Chute Out was decorated as a giant Christmas tree. On August 2, 2012, Six Flags Over Texas announced the last chance to ride Texas Chute Out would be on September 3, 2012, before it closed along with the neighboring ride Flashback. Texas Chute Out was replaced by Texas SkyScreamer, a Funtime StarFlyer. Texas Chute Out was demolished on October 10, 2012 to make room for construction of the Texas SkyScreamer. Ride Texas Chute Out was located in Goodtimes Square, where riders of one to three, strap themselves onto to the bench where it then lifted riders to the top . Once up top, the ride pauses to give riders a Bird's-eye view of the park and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. After a couple of seconds the parachute then releases from the top and floats back down toward the ground. Each seat held two riders, and was equipped with a seat belt and restraint bar. Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute. During the years, the ride allowed riders to stand during the ride, but this later stopped.

Distribution The Baradla cave in north-eastern Hungary is home to a population of Mesoniscus graniger. Mesoniscus is restricted to Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula; the ranges of its two species do not overlap. M. alpicolus is found in Lombardy and the Northern Calcareous Alps. In Austria, its range extends from the near Innsbruck to the eastern edge of the , although it is also found in isolated pockets of Triassic and Silurian–Devonian limestone in Styria. M. graniger has a wider distribution than its congener; it is found in much of the Carpathians, including the Bihor and Banat mountains, and in the Dinaric Alps and Julian Alps. It is also found in the Caves of Aggtelek Karst in Hungary. Taxonomy The first description of a woodlouse now in the genus Mesoniscus was in 1858, when Camill Heller described \\"Titanethes alpicolus\\" in 1858. This was followed in 1865 by the description by János Frivaldszky (Ján Frivaldský) of the subspecies \\"Titanethes alpicolus graniger\\". Mesoniscus is the only genus in the family Mesoniscidae, and is considered so distinct from other woodlice that the family is placed in a separate section, named Microcheta.

It was announced in November 2006 as the discovery of a new species or subspecies. However, the existence of the parrot has not been confirmed and the claimed discovery has been questioned. Background Australia holds three fig parrot taxa, all of which are subspecies of the double-eyed fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma), which is also found in New Guinea. Inhabiting the rainforest canopy, they are tiny (14 cm in length), mostly green in colour, with various red and blue markings on and around the face. The three distinct and geographically discrete Australian subspecies are: * Marshall's fig parrot (C. d. marshalli), Cape York Peninsula, Queensland * Macleay's fig parrot or red-browed fig parrot (C. d. macleayana), north-east Queensland * Coxen's fig parrot (C. d. coxeni), border ranges of south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales; it is rare, highly endangered and possibly extinct. Description Examination of the only photograph of the new parrot that was made available shows that it closely resembles a Macleay's fig parrot, with the main difference being that the forehead is blue rather than red. The authenticity of the photograph is in doubt. History =Announcement= On 8 November 2006 it was reported prominently in the Brisbane Courier Mail that naturalist and cinematographer John Young had discovered a new fig parrot species in rugged forest country in southern Queensland after an exhaustive search. The exact site of the discovery was not disclosed, though Young claimed that he had known of the bird's existence for ten years. The range of the new parrot was said to overlap with that of Coxen's fig parrot. The Queensland Environment Minister Lindy Nelson-Carr said that the new fig parrot represented a fourth Australian fig parrot species or subspecies. The first public announcement had been made by Young the previous evening, 7 November 2006, at O'Reilly's Guesthouse in the Lamington National Park to an audience of birdwatchers, as well as to Minister Nelson-Carr and to Dr Ian Gynther, a Senior Conservation Officer with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The audience was shown a photograph by Young of the new parrot and informed that it was the subject of a scientific paper being written by Young and Gynther for the journal Emu that would examine the relationship between the blue-fronted fig parrot and the three hitherto known Australian fig parrot taxa. However, even Gynther had not been informed of the precise discovery location. =Doubts= Subsequently, questions were raised concerning Young's claim and the photograph of the new parrot that had been made available to the media. Ornithologists Penny Olsen and Richard Schodde expressed doubts, with Olsen finding the photograph unconvincing, and with Schodde saying that, until there was proper documentation and the claim confirmed by more than one independent qualified observer, the report should be disregarded. Schodde later said that the existence of two very closely related parrots living side by side in remnant patches of rainforest around the Queensland - New South Wales border was highly unlikely, concluding that, without further evidence such as DNA material, Young's claim should be treated with \\"utmost scepticism\\". The photograph was examined by Gale Spring, an associate professor in scientific photography at Melbourne's RMIT University, and expert in forensic photography, who expressed strong doubts about it, saying that the surface imaging was typical of pictures that had been altered. An offer by Spring to examine other claimed photographs at the offices of Young's company, John Young Wildlife Enterprises (JYWE), was not taken up. After senior departmental officers saw a presentation by Spring on the only photographic evidence, the Queensland Government began to distance itself from Young, with its Environmental Protection Agency issuing a statement saying that, following the failure of JYWE to fulfil an undertaking to provide further photographs to Spring, it would \\"not be undertaking further investigations into Mr Young's claim\\" without further evidence. An undertaking by Young to provide pin feathers, said to have been plucked from fig parrot chicks, for DNA analysis was also not fulfilled. In a 19 February 2007 media release by JYWE, it was stated that the parrot was difficult to find because its habitat lay above the high-altitude rainforest canopy. It also said that Young had collected a body of evidence, including recordings, photographs of several different birds, biological material and a nest site, which would, in due course, be made available to the scientific community. The release also expressed disappointment that “armchair experts” were prepared to question Young's integrity before he had had the chance to complete his fieldwork and have the evidence independently analysed prior to releasing all his information about the parrot to the community at large. The release ended with the statement that \\"It may take some considerable time for John to complete his work, but we have no doubt that when this happens it will prove a significant addition to our knowledge of Fig-Parrots\\".

The log flume replaced the 'Burro Ride', which operated from 1961 to 1962. From 1963 to 1968, El Aserradero only operated one flume. Then in 1968, due to the ride's popularity, Six Flags added a second flume to next to the original doubling the capacity of the attraction. The park billed the ride as \\"the most popular and exciting ride ever devised.\\" During the 1970s, Six Flags Over Texas added themed animations along the ride in which Lumberjacks could be seen sawing logs. Also added was a cover to the drop on flume 2, which later was removed along with the animations. El Aserradero's success inspired many amusement parks around the world to add a log flume of some type. Ride Experience One of the splash drops in El Aserradero El Aserradero's entrance is located in the Texas theme section of the park, but the ride is in the Spain section along with the exit. Once guests load into one of the fiberglass logs, the log then travels to the first lift hill. The log is carried up the lift hill on a conveyor belt, then drops down a slide into the flume, which is the highest part of the ride. The log then floats around the curving flume, carried forward by the water and traveling slightly downhill. The log then reaches a second lift hill, then drops down a much longer slide and splashes down at the end of the ride. El Aserradero operates from spring to the end of Fright Fest in October.

He was involved in politics as a member of the political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He served three times in the National Assembly of Pakistan and was an active proponent of the Khatme Nabuwwat movement. Abdul Haq completed his religious education in India at Darul Uloom Deoband. He taught at Deoband for four years until difficulties arose due to the independence of Pakistan. In 1947, he founded Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak, one of the first Islamic seminaries to be established in Pakistan. He taught hadith at the madrasah for the rest of his life and was well-known by the title \\"Shaykh al-Hadith\\". His son, Sami ul Haq, succeeded him as chancellor of Darul Uloom Haqqania. Abdul Haq's sermons have been published by his son in two volumes containing over 1,300 pages, entitled Da\`wat-i Haq. Education Abdul Haq was born in the city of Akora Khattak, Peshawar District, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), British India, the son of Haji Maruf Gul, a local landlord, businessman, and religious scholar. According to family belief, Abdul Haq was born in 1912 or 1914. Muhammad Akbar Shah Bukhari, however, writes in Akabir Ulama-i Deoband that he was born on \\"7 Muharram al-Haram 1327 AH, Sunday, corresponding to January 1910\\". This is an error since Sunday 7 Muharram 1327 corresponds to 31 January 1909, not 1910. Another source gives his date of birth as 7 Muharram 1330 AH (c. 29 December 1911). His nasab (patronymic) is given as follows: Shaykhul-Ḥadīs̱ Mawlānā ‘Abdul-Ḥaqq ibn Akhūnzādah al-Ḥājj Mawlānā Muḥammad Ma‘rūf Gul ibn Akhūnzādah al-Ḥājj Mawlānā Mīr Aftāb ibn Akhūnzādah Mawlānā ‘Abdul-Ḥamīd ibn Mawlānā ‘Abdur-Raḥīm Akhūnkhel ibn Mawlānā ‘Abdul-Wāḥid Akhūnkhel. Abdul Haq received his early education from his parents. Then for elementary religious studies, he was sent to nearby places in Peshawar, Mardan, and Chhachh. In Mardan, he studied with Maulana Inayatullah and Maulana Abdul Jamil. Until the age of 16, he had studied locally the books up to Mulla Hasan. For higher studies he traveled further, studying first in madrasahs in Meerut, Amroha, Gulavati, and Calcutta before gaining admission to the prestigious Darul Uloom Deoband in Shawwal 1347 (March 1929). Abdul Haq writes of the difficulty he faced in admission, \\"I arrived at Deoband at such a time when the Bengali and Swati students had quarreled and there was no flexibility in admission policy for Pathan students. I also had to face the problem of admission.\\" He completed daurah of hadith, the final stage of the Dars-i Nizami curriculum, under the supervision of Sayyid Husain Ahmad Madani, receiving his sanad-i faraghat (graduate degree) in 1352 AH (1933/1934). Some of his other teachers included Rasul Khan Hazarvi, Muhammad Ibrahim Baliyawi, and Muhammad Shafi Deobandi. Teaching career Abdul Haq returned to Akora Khattak and, on the instruction of his father, opened a small madrasah in a mosque adjacent to his house in order to provide a basic and religious education to the children in the area. In 1937, he began a primary school which was inaugurated by Husain Ahmad Madani. Soon, the number of students increased and other teachers were appointed. Abdul Haq was later offered a teaching post at Darul Uloom Deoband by Madani. After consulting with his father, he joined Darul Uloom Deoband in Shawwal 1362 AH (October 1943). In 1947, Abdul Haq had returned to Akora Khattak during the Ramadan vacation. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, his father did not agree to him returning to Deoband, despite Madani's persuasion and promise of security. Consequently, Abdul Haq founded Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak on 23 September 1947. In the first year, many madrasah students who were unable to return to India came to Darul Uloom Haqqania to complete daurah of hadith with Maulana Abdul Haq. At first he was the sole teacher and had to teach all the books of the Dars-i Nizami curriculum himself, but over time the number of students grew and other teachers joined. Abdul Haq continued to teach hadith at the school until his death in 1988. Abdul Haq also served as the convener of Wifaq al-Madaris al- Arabiya. Politics Abdul Haq joined other Islamic graduates in forming the Pakistani political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), which endeavored for the implementation of Islamic law in the country. Abdul Haq was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in three consecutive elections, his election campaigns being led by his son, Sami ul Haq. In 1970, running on the JUI ticket, Abdul Haq was elected to the 5th National Assembly, defeating Ajmal Khattak of the National Awami Party and Nasrullah Khan Khattak of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). In the 1977 general election, he was elected to the 6th National Assembly, running on the ticket of the Pakistan National Alliance, a nine-party alliance including JUI. He again defeated Nasrullah Khan Khattak, then Chief Minister of NWFP and provincial president of the PPP. He was elected to the 7th National Assembly in the 1985 general election, which was held on a non-party basis. Khatme Nabuwwat movement Abdul Haq was active in the Khatme Nabuwwat movement. In his lectures, he stressed the importance of the concept of finality of prophethood and argued against the interpretations of Quranic verses and hadiths used by Ahmadis to support their beliefs. He was one of the signatories of the resolution moved on 30 June 1974 in the National Assembly in support of declaring Ahmadis as non-Muslims in Pakistan. Soviet–Afghan War When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Abdul Haq declared the Afghan resistance to be a jihad and an ideological struggle between Islam and communism. The ruling stating this was issued by Darul Uloom Haqqania. Abdul Haq made monetary contributions in support of the Afghan Mujahideen and prayed for their success. On many occasions, he expressed his desire to fight, but he was unable to do so due to his old age and failing health. Sufism Abdul Haq was a disciple of Haji Sahib Turangzai. He gave bay'ah at the hands of other Sufis including Husain Ahmad Madani, Khawaja Abdul Malik Siddiqi, and the Faqir of Ipi. Awards and achievements *In October 1978, Abdul Haq was awarded an honorary PhD in Divinity from the University of Peshawar for services rendered in the cause of Islam. *Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Distinction) by the President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq, for his religious, educational, and scholarly achievements.

Nyakan Bakhan. Kathmandu: Himanchal Pustak Bhavan. Page 89. The story Once upon a time, there was a sparrow who was very neat and clean. Its nest was spotless and it always washed up before eating. One morning, the sparrow found a bean and was overjoyed that it didn't have to search the neighborhood for food. As was its habit, it went down to the river to wash up after putting the bean away safely on the bridge. When the sparrow returned expecting to eat a fine breakfast, alas, the bean was nowhere to be found. As it was looking everywhere for its food, it saw a carpenter walking up the bridge. The sparrow went up to the carpenter and said, \\"I have lost my bean. Please help me find it.\\" \\"Who's going to listen to you?\\" said the carpenter and continued on his way. Just then the sparrow saw a soldier walking up the bridge. It pleaded with him to help find the bean, but the soldier too was uncooperative. \\"Who's going to help a sparrow?\\" he said and walked away. Then a captain came up the bridge, but he wouldn't help the sparrow either. And then a minister, but no help from him too. He just laughed and kept walking. The hungry sparrow became desperate. Then the king came riding on an elephant. The sparrow was certain that it would get justice from the most powerful person in the country. But the king pretended not to hear the sparrow's pleas and said nothing. As the sparrow sat there dejected, an ant came up and asked, \\"What's the matter? Didn't you see the king pass by?\\" The sparrow then told the ant how everybody from the carpenter to the king had ignored its appeals to help it find the lost bean. \\"Don't worry,\\" said the ant. \\"We will find the bean somehow.\\" The ant then crawled up to the elephant's ear and said, \\"Tell the king to find the sparrow's bean or I will go inside your ear and bite you.\\" The terrified elephant turned to the king and said, \\"You better help the sparrow, oh king, or I will throw you off my back.\\" The king was startled. He immediately summoned the minister and ordered, \\"Help the sparrow or you are fired.\\" The minister called the captain right away and said, \\"Do whatever the sparrow says or you are in trouble.\\" The captain then called the soldier and gave him explicit orders. The soldier, in turn, found the carpenter and told him, \\"Find the sparrow's bean or I will hang you from this bridge itself.\\" The carpenter searched for half a day and finally found the lost bean, and the sparrow had a satisfying breakfast that day.

Background In 1995, Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo, a professor at the University of Botswana, founded the Kamanakao Association, an organization that aims \\"to develop and maintain the Shiyeyi language and culture.\\" The Wayeyi are a Bantu minority group under the Batawana umbrella. Due to feelings of oppression under the Batawana, the Wayeyi, with the help of the Kamanakao Association, installed their own paramount chief, Shikati Calvin Kamanakao, on 24 April 1999, which was in disagreement with the Chieftainship Act, the Tribal Land Territory Act, and sections 77-79 of the Constitution of Botswana. The Deputy Attorney General Ian Kirby responded by letter to the Wayeyi on 15 July 1999, writing that since the Wayeyi are not a recognized tribe, they could not have their own chief. Because of the Wayeyi conflict and a parliamentary motion by Olifant Mfa on 17 February 1995 to rewrite sections 77-79 of the Constitution to be \\"tribally neutral\\", President Festus Mogae appointed twenty-one people to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Section 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution of Botswana, otherwise known as the Balopi Commission after the chairman of the commission Patrick Balopi. The commission was charged with three tasks: \\"(a) To review sections 77, 78, and 79 of the constitution of Botswana and to seek a construction that would eliminate any interpretation that renders the sections discriminatory; (b) To review and propose the most effective method of selecting members of the House of Chiefs; and (c) To propose and recommend measures to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the House of Chiefs.\\" Methodology In order to collect public opinions, the members of the commission visited 41 villages and towns, held 43 public meetings, listened to 38 oral submissions, and received 10 group and 40 individual written submissions. The meetings were held in the traditional dikgotla of the tribes. Recommendations The commission made the following recommendations in the \\"White Paper No.1 of 2001\\": *Even if sections 77-79 are not unfair, they, and any other mention of a specific tribe, should be removed from the Constitution due to the citizens' perception that they are discriminatory. *The word \\"chief\\" in the Constitution, a remnant of the British monarchy, should be replaced with the word kgosi. *The House of Chiefs of Botswana should continue to exist as it represents the country's unity, and it should be renamed ', which the government did in 2008 with the Bogosi Act. *The members of the House of Chiefs should not be allowed to join political parties. *Members should be chosen based on tribal territorial claims, creating geographically based representation rather than the old method of specifying which tribes can have ex officio members in the House. Reactions The president was praised for his efforts by the minority Batswapong in eastern Botswana but was heavily criticised by the Bamangwato because they felt it would \\"place their paramount chief [and then Vice President of Botswana] Ian Khama on the same level as chiefs from inferior tribes.\\" The Bogosi Act was passed in 2008, replacing the Chieftainship Act. This act removed references of the word \\"chief\\" and changed them to kgosi. =Revision= A revision of the recommendations was made in April 2002 titled the \\"White Paper No.2 of 2002\\" which opted to let the selection process for the House remain the same: the eight dikgosi of the main tribes would retain their posts, a move that the House of Chiefs itself approved. President Mogae went on further visits around the country in May 2002 to hold debates about future changes to the constitution, but the consensus among the citizens remains dissatisfied. Minister of Health Joy Phumaphi said that the revision \\"is a compromise and it does not remove discrimination.\\" Other ministers felt that they did not have enough time to provide feedback to the revision process. A 2007 study by the University of Botswana found that \\"a significant number of respondents suggest that the Constitution should be reviewed so that it equally recognizes all cultures found in Botswana\\".

The act was written in response to the Balopi Commission recommendation that the Constitution of Botswana replace all references of the word \\"chief\\" to the Setswana word kgosi. The Bogosi Act replaces the earlier Chieftainship Act of 1987. History Outcry from minority tribes in Botswana such as the Wayeyi pushed President Festus Mogae to create the Balopi Commission on 28 July 2000 to investigate tribal discrimination. The commission found that the structure of the House of Chiefs of Botswana, later renamed Ntlo ya Dikgosi, \\"tended to be discriminatory\\". In response, the Bogosi Bill was passed, creating the Bogosi Act. Content The Bogosi Act defines the institution of bogosi or tribal chieftainship. A kgosi (plural: dikgosi) is the tribal leader and has the following functions: *to exercise his or her powers under this Act to promote the welfare of the members of his or her tribe; *to carry out any lawful instructions given to him or her by the Minister; *to convene kgotla meetings to obtain advice as to the exercise of his or her functions under this Act; *to arrange tribal ceremonies; *to preside over cases in terms of the warrant of his or her court issued under the Customary Courts Act; and *to perform such other functions as may be conferred on him or her by or under this Act or any other enactment. The dikgosi of the eight main Batswana tribes automatically become members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, an advisory body to the Parliament of Botswana. Reaction The act has been criticised by tribal leaders because of the limitations on the powers of a kgosi. In 2010, Kgosi Kgafela II of the Kgatla tribe was accused of flogging, but he argued that dikgosi have immunity to the state's jurisdiction. The Botswana High Court dismissed the case on 11 May 2011, claiming that \\"dikgosi cannot act outside the constitution and laws prescribed by Parliament when all other functionaries of the state act within the statutory limitations.\\" To avoid the legal costs of the case, Kgafela moved to Moruleng, South Africa.

The obligation came into force on 1 September 2009 and ran until 31 December 2012. CESP was designed as a pilot for an area based obligation, and the subsequent Energy Company Obligation includes a more flexible area-based component, the Carbon Saving Communities Obligation. Over 290,000 measures were delivered under CESP. Around half of these were forms of home insulation, and almost 40% were replacement boilers or heating controls provided with a new heating system. The programme delivered carbon savings of 16.31 million tons of CO2, 84.7% of the target. Progress was slow at first, and the majority of the savings were only achieved in the final six months of the three-year programme. Three energy suppliers complied with their obligations under CESP: EDF Energy, E.ON and RWE npower. Meanwhile, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power fell short, leaving Ofgem considering whether to impose a financial penalty.

The book took 15 years to write. It is an exploration of the many forms of corruption in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia and embeds historical events, such as the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague in 1942, among fictional stories concerning the holocaust, Nazi careerism and the rise of Nazism. It is set in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II. The book starts with a story about some municipal workmen who are tasked to remove a statue of the Jewish composer Mendelssohn from the roof of the Prague Academy of Music. The book continues with a collection of interlinked stories about Jewish life in Czechoslovakia during the war, including a tale similar to Anne Frank's. The stories of most of the characters end unhappily, with the exception of Richard Reisinger (effectively the protagonist) whose fate we do not explicitly or implicitly learn. The English translation of the novel was published with a foreword by Philip Roth which was originally written for and accompanies the translation of Weil's novel Life with a Star.

Olympic Games LaMothe competed in the 5000 metres at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the marathon at the 1984, 1988 and 1992 Games. He finished last in the 5000 metres in 1976 and last again in the 1984 marathon, although in that case he nevertheless beat the 29 athletes who did not complete the course. LaMothe was one of a number of Haitian runners sent to the Olympic Games by the \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier regime during the 1970s and 1980s - mostly picked from among Duvalier's personal friends - who gained notoriety by setting record worst times, many of which are still held. Other such athletes include Anilus Joseph, who started his 1972 10,000 metres qualifying heat too fast, leading the pack for two laps but dropping out with a mile still to run; Wilnor Joseph, whose 800 metres in 1976 took 2:15.26; and Charles Olemus, who ran for over 42 minutes to complete the 1976 10,000 metres race. In 1986, after the overthrow of Duvalier's government, LaMothe gave an interview in which he claimed to have feared for his life at the hands of the dictator's regime if he did not complete the 1984 marathon. According to LaMothe, he was told that he would take part in the Games only a fortnight before the team left for Los Angeles and received only $250 for his participation. He borrowed his running kit from two Americans and eventually completed the race in 2:52:18, in 78th and last place. Although he hoped to achieve a top ten placing, LaMothe's best result in the Summer Olympics was 20th place in the marathon at the 1988 Games in Seoul, in a time of 2h 16m 15s. He was 38 years and 15 days old when he competed in the 1992 Games in Barcelona, making him Haiti's oldest ever participant in the Olympics. Other competitions With funding from friends, LaMothe was able to take part in the 1985 New York City marathon, which he completed in 60th place. He won the bronze medal in the marathon at the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games and came sixth in the marathon at the 1987 Pan American Games. LaMothe still holds the Haitian record for the men's marathon of 2:14:22, achieved in France in April 1988. He won the 1996 Long Island Marathon by seven seconds. LaMothe again represented Haiti in the 5000 metres at the 1991 World Athletics Championship but failed to finish his qualifying heat.

Of these popular songs, \\"Ruk Ja O Jane Wali\\" became famous for its filming as it was sung for a bottle of local alcohol, with which a shot of Nutan roaming are also inserted to create an illusion as if it was sung for her. Raj Kapoor portrays a village drunk who does not care, until she comes looking for him. Plot Shanno (Nutan) is devoted to Lord Krishna, also known as Kanhaiya. Consequently, she often wanders off alone in the woods dancing and singing to the flute notes of her Kanhaiya. She accidentally meets Kanhaiya (Raj Kapoor), the village drunk and falls in his arms assuming him to be her \\"Kanhaiya,\\" the Lord Krishna. The gossip spreads that Kanhaiya and Shanno are having an affair, and in order to stay in the same village, they must get married. Shanno, still under the misconception regarding Kanhaiya, is thrilled and gives her consent. During the marriage, Shanno is shocked when she realises who \\"Kanhaiya\\" really is - the town drunk and idler who has taken advantage of her love for Lord Krishna, and now insists on marrying her. What the Village Panchayat does when Shanno refuses to marry Kanhaiya, and how she is even ready to light herself on the funeral pyre to prove her piety, and how they cope when the village is swamped with plague, forms the basis for the rest of the story.

He is a former Executive Vice President of Hong Kong Polytechnic University and was the inaugural Secretary for Innovation and Technology, a post he held for five years to 2020. Education and business career Yang lived in Jersey City, New Jersey before moving to Pasadena to attend the California Institute of Technology. He graduated in 1977 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He went on to obtain a master's degree at Stanford University in the same field, and worked as a senior design engineer at Intel. He returned to Stanford to earn an MBA, and worked briefly at Bain & Company before moving to Asia in 1983. He became a naturalized US citizen on 2 September 1977. On 15 December 1979 in Santa Clara, California, he married Winnie Sui-king Yung, daughter of the Chairman and founder of Hong Kong-based Shell Electric Manufacturing (蜆殼電器). She became a US citizen on 8 August 1984. Yang joined Shell Electric in 1983 and served as Executive Director until resigning on 30 September 2003. He was a director during its initial public offering and the sale of its fibre-optic business to JDSU. He moved to JDSU in 1999. Afterwards he became involved in venture capital and private equity. In 2003 he was appointed CEO of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company. In academia and government Yang became Executive Vice President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2010. After CY Leung won the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Yang was tipped to head the government's planned Technology and Communications Bureau, and in May he renounced his US citizenship, satisfying the Basic Law requirement that principal government officials have no right of abode in any foreign country. In July 2012 Yang became the target of an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption regarding a government contract which a foundation he directed, the eInclusion Foundation, had obtained in 2010. In March 2015, he was appointed Innovation & Technology Adviser to Chief Executive CY Leung and a non-official member of the Executive Council, to pave the way for the creation of the city's Innovation and Technology Bureau (ITB), of which he was duly appointed the first Secretary for Innovation and Technology on its formation in November 2015. He continued in the role in the administration of Carrie Lam but was removed from the post in a cabinet reshuffle in April 2020. In April 2016, leaks from the Panama Papers showed that Yang had created two questionable accounts into which he had transferred a large number of PolyU stocks for his own benefit. Yang defended setting up the BVI firms as proper.

He supported the Salic Law and in 1606 argued the case for Gallican ecclesiastical independence.Burns, pp. 681–2. Leschassier put forward proposals around 1597, intended to help Henry IV of France get better control of royal officeholders, by designating the posts as fiefs. At the time of the Venetian Interdict, the Venetian diplomat Pietro Priuli recruited Leschassier and Louis Servin to write in Venice's defence. These works argued that the position of the Church of Venice should be equated with that of the Gallican view of the situation of the Church of France.

It was released exclusively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.  Premise  The player takes on the role of a young adventurous man named Monobe who is searching for the past of his people. He is equipped with an arm-mounted device called an \\"e-rad\\" and what is believed to be magic armor. These devices allow Monobe to project energy bolts and create energy ropes to swing on, in addition to basic fighting skills, running, jumping, and rolling. The player must use his skills and his devices to traverse the many strange lands of the game. Designer Bruce Straley would subsequently describe the game as a clone of the (1993) X-Men game on Sega Genesis (which he and other Pacific Softscape employees had worked on), after Pacific Softscape were unable to secure the rights to the X-Men franchise to develop a sequel.Podcast Tone Control 22: Bruce Straley https://open.spotify.com/show/40dEpxpMhSjVBwAaCvJFdb  Plot  Monobe has always wanted to know the origins and destiny of his people. He is told by his tribal elder of the stories of old and given a set of technologically sophisticated armor and an arm-mounted gauntlet that projects a strange energy. He leaves his people behind and wanders through jungles and temple areas. His devices allow him to navigate hazards and stop dangerous foes. Along the way he must use the gauntlet device to open doors and to access different areas of the landscape which become increasingly futuristic and industrial. Monobe discovers that this \\"world\\" he and his people live on is not a planet but a generation ship sent from Earth (via Luna Colony) in May 2037. Its purpose was to colonize a world named \\"Hope\\", in an interstellar voyage that would put them in orbit around Hope in the year 2385. The ship, Heritage, was designed to support 20 generations of colonists. Monobe's discovery is made in August 2671; fortunately his ancestors built the ship to sustain life for at least 700 years. The breakdown of protocol on board the vessel throughout the many generations meant that key systems were not maintained and the automatic descent systems that would have brought the Heritage down safely on Hope were not engaged so that the ship stayed in orbit for more than 200 years after arrival, with its occupants unaware that they needed to disembark on shuttles to the planet below. Reception GamePro commented that \\"Fans of Flashback or Blackthorne will immediately recognize and breeze through this game. Generations Lost should have been called Imagination Lost.\\" They also complained of several minor issues, such as the player character's stiff movements, the generic music, and the lack of bosses. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 6.4 out of 10. Though they complained of somewhat imprecise controls and choppy scrolling, they concluded that \\"If you liked games like Out of This World and Black Thorne, then this will definitely appeal.\\"  See also  *Interstellar ark *The Sacred Armour of Antiriad *The Starlost *Pandorum References  External links  * Generations Lost at MobyGames * Generations Lost at Sega-16 1994 video games Action video games Generation ships in fiction Platform games Sega Genesis games Sega Genesis-only games Time Warner Interactive games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Generations Lost"},{"id":"36548888","text":"Chtaiba is a small town and rural commune in El Kelâat Es-Sraghna Province of the Marrakesh-Safi region of Morocco.

Career  In 1348 John de Echyngham graduated M.A. from the University of Oxford, and in June 1349 he was presented by John de Ore, of a gentry family neighbouring the Echynghams, to their benefice of Wodeton (Wotton), Sussex.J.B.

In this first year his Proctors were Richard Sutton of Merton College and Walter Wandesford of Oriel College: and in the second year Wandesford continued but Sutton was succeeded by Walter Remmesbury (who later became Cantor of Hereford Cathedral).

Augmented search tree implementation To turn a regular search tree into an order statistic tree, the nodes of the tree need to store one additional value, which is the size of the subtree rooted at that node (i.e., the number of nodes below it). All operations that modify the tree must adjust this information to preserve the invariant that size[x] = size[left[x + size[right[x + 1 where \`size[nil] = 0\` by definition. Select can then be implemented as function Select(t, i) // Returns the i'th element (zero- indexed) of the elements in t l ← size[left[t +1 if i = l return t else if i < l return Select(left[t], i) else return Select(right[t], i - l) Rank can be implemented as function Rank(T, x) // Returns the position of x (one-indexed) in the linear sorted list of elements of the tree T r ← size[left[x + 1 y ← x while y ≠ T.root if y = right[p[y r ← r + size[left[p[y ] + 1 y ← p[y] return r Order-statistic trees can be further amended with bookkeeping information to maintain balance (e.g., tree height can be added to get an order statistic AVL tree, or a color bit to get a red-black order statistic tree). Alternatively, the size field can be used in conjunction with a weight- balancing scheme at no additional storage cost.

The game offers complex and involved commerce, construction and team systems. The goal for players in Star Sonata is to bring their team to domination and claim the seat of Emperor. Star Sonata belongs to the space opera genre established in computer gaming by Galactic Empire and Elite. The game is free to download and play for an unlimited period of time with game-play restrictions. Gameplay Star Sonata is a space trading game, where players explore space and trade goods from one space station to another for economic gain. Players also control automated ships through programmed command sequences in order to patrol areas, assist in combat or engage in trade of commodities even while a player is offline. At higher levels, players build custom space stations on planets and moons to extract resources. Items can be manufactured on player-controlled space stations and bought from colonies on planets with ancient ruins. Unlike many MMORPGs, combat in Star Sonata is in real-time and requires manual aiming. This results in a wide variety of combat tactics, such as dodging to evade enemy fire, using combat aids to deploy drones, boost shields or overload weapons, and maneuvering around terrain elements such as planets and asteroids which block attacks. Star Sonata also has an open PvP system in which players can attack other players near their skill level. =Conquest= Teams of players may claim ownership of galaxies by building space stations on planets in order to control territory, exploit planetary resources and build colonies for trade and population expansion. By expanding their empires, teams compete to achieve a score in the top five with a sufficient percentage of the population of the universe, which enables them to make a claim for the Emperor's throne. If successful, their team leader will be crowned the Emperor of the Universe. =Universe resets= A unique feature of Star Sonata is that the game's universe is randomized every few months in a Universe reset. This allows for the game to remain fresh for long-time players and for new players to have a chance to claim a star system for themselves. A reset triggers economic changes as supply and demand shifts for different items and resources in the new procedurally-generated universe of star systems. =Character advancement= Character development is based on gaining levels through meeting fixed experience point requirements. Experience is earned by killing computer-controlled enemies and completing in-game missions. Players also earn skill points which can be spent on a variety of skills. Some skill sets are mutually exclusive, requiring the player to choose a particular focus for the character, such as a fighting style, space station management, or freight transport. Some other skills are also available to all players but require special commodities and/or prerequisite such as Hull Expansion. Development Developer Adam Miller said he designed Star Sonata \\"out of a nostalgic childhood dream of space adventure.\\" After three years in development and a public beta, Star Sonata was released in October 2004. Development continued from 2004 to 2011, with features and content zones being added every few months. In a January 2008 interview, Owner Jeff Landauer stated that 12,132 unique characters had logged in to play in the last 2 days and 11 hours. Landauer has also reported that the number of paying players increased from 300 in August 2005 to 854 in July 2008. After beta sign-ups in August 2011, Star Sonata 2 was released on November 12, 2011 with an upgraded client supporting 3D graphics and user interface improvements. In July 2012, Landauer Games announced a major increase in paid staff for continued development and additions to Star Sonata. Reception In 2004, Star Sonata was reviewed by GameZone which gave the game an overall rating of 7.7/10, noting that the game offered \\"interesting options for controlling your own AI fleets and space stations.\\" In 2005, the independent video game site Game Tunnel recommended the game for those who \\"enjoy exploring, conflict, and building a name for yourself\\" while noting that the game's PvP conflict \\"can badly affect new players\\" who are too weak to fight back. The updated Star Sonata 2, released in 2011, was one of 3 role-playing games listed on GameSpy’s 101 Free PC Games of 2012.

Arthur Lutze (June 1, 1813 – April 11, 1870), was a major figure in medicine and regimen in Germany because of his establishment of a major homeopathic clinic and spa in Köthen, Germany in the mid-1800s. He was also known for his advancement of a particular approach in the use of homeopathic medicines, known as dual remedy prescribing, after it was ostensibly dropped (though only publicly, not in private practice) by others, including Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of the homeopathic approach. His decision in 1865 to release a version of the much awaited, but long delayed publication of the last, 6th edition of Hahnemann's Organon der Heilkunst, which included a disputed paragraph created by Hahnemann for the 5th edition, but subsequently withdrawn for political reasons within the homeopathic medical community in Germany, resulted in a strong protest from more conventional homeopaths.  Early life  Born in Unter den Linden, he was raised on the family estate at Arthursberg near Stettin. Losing both parents early in his life, he then started work as a postal clerk in 1830. It was during this time that he became interested in homeopathy and decided after many years of private study to dedicate himself to this profession, and left the postal service in 1843. Lutze gave an impassioned eulogy in Mühlhausen on the occasion of the death of Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, that very same year. He started practicing homeopathic medicine in Potsdam, treating thousands of patients, mostly free of charge. In 1845 he moved to Köthen, where Hahnemann had earlier practiced, before moving to Paris in his final years, and became quite successful in healing, even attracting comments about being a \\"miracle healer\\". The famous portrait artist for Goethe, William of Kügelgen, commented on his appearance \\"a short, stocky figure with a large yet beautiful and intelligent head … and a tremendous prophet's beard\\" [\\"eine kurze gedrungene Gestalt mit einem großen aber schönen und intelligenten Kopf … und ein ungeheurer Prophetenbart … (aus: Jugenderinnerungen , Berlin 1870).] Lutze studied medicine more formally and received his doctorate in 1848 in Jena, based on a dissertation concerning cataract surgery, De cataractae extractione. In 1854 he decided to construct a homeopathic clinic, the largest ever at the time in the world, raising the money personally in such a short time that it was able to open its doors in 1855. The clinic, built in Renaissance style, is still standing. It contained several large wards and 72 private rooms for well-to-do patients, a park, various spas, library, art gallery and observatory. The poor were treated, as was Lutze's custom, for free. By 1864, some 26,690 patients had been handled, and the hospital received over 162,000 inquiries from around the world. The clinic remained in operation until 1914. It was recently restored. Part of Lutze's approach also involved dietary and regimenal aspects and he published a popular pamphlet called Lebensregeln der neuen, naturgemäßen Heilkunde (which went through 64 printings). Many of his ideas reflected ideas that Hahnemann had also developed early in his career, such as he published in Friend of Health in 1791. In his often innovative combining of regimen and medicine, his clinic was one of the first \\"wellness\\" clinics in the West. However, it is the use of homeopathic approach to medicine that was the most dominant in his clinic and which also became the most controversial, not so much from non-homeopathic medical circles, but from within the homeopathic ranks themselves. The success of his methods are on record, and his clinic was a widely recognized success, but he aroused opposition from contemporary homeopathic doctors. The main reason for the controversy had less to do with his success, and more to do with Lutze's development of an approach to prescribing that had been developed by Hahnemann and a few others, but which met fierce opposition initially when it was revealed, in the 1830s. Lutze's revival of the method of using two remedies at a time and also his restoration of a deleted section from the 5th edition of Hahnemann's Organon der Heilkunst on the method, created what is known as the \\"Dual Remedy Affair\\".  The Dual Remedy Affair  = Background = To understand the important role played by Lutze in homeopathy, it is important to understand the background of his decision to use a dual remedy approach in prescribing, seemingly counter to the principle laid down by Hahnemann regarding 'one remedy at a time'. In the Spring of 1833, Samuel Hahnemann received a letter (dated 15 May) from a Dr. Karl Julius Aegidi (1795–1874), one of his closest followers, setting out the positive clinical results (233 cured cases) using a new approach to the use of remedies, using two remedies at the same time, which was seemingly contrary to the advice Hahnemann had been giving in the past 4 editions of his Organon der Heilkunst, the main work on homeopathic medicine. Hahnemann replied on 15 June 1833 and stated that he was \\"delighted that such a happy idea has occurred to you\\" and based on the proviso that each remedy must be \\"homeopathically suitable, but each from a different side\\", Hahnemann further stated that \\"the procedure is so consonant with the requirements of our art that nothing can be urged against it\\". (Haehl, Vol II, p. 85). Here Hahnemann was referring to basic principles that he had laid down in his foundational work, On A New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs, 1796 concerning two 'sides' of disease, namely those of a fixed nature and those of a variable nature. Further, Hahnemann also had identified two sides to the life force (Lebenskraft) and two phases to the disease process: the initial (Erstwirkung) action of the disease agent impinging on the generative side (Lebens- Erzeugungskraft) of the life force, and the counter or after action (Gegenwirkung or Nachwirkung) of the sustentive side (Lebens-Erhaltungskraft) of that same life force (see Romantic Medicine: Details of Heilkunst). Thus, the concept of 'at a time' (auf einmal) meant for Hahnemann that one could not give a second remedy normally within the initial action of the first remedy. With crude doses, this initial action could be hours or minutes, but with higher potencies Hahnemann had discovered that the initial action was very short and almost instantaneous and thus could accept Aegidi's approach to the extent it also used remedies 'in smallest dose or by olfaction'. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85) Later, when Hahnemann continued use of the dual remedy approach, he decided to be more cautious and used one remedy in the morning and another in the afternoon as related in his case books from the last years of his life in Paris. Hahnemann also mentioned that von Bönninghausen (or Boenninghausen as he was Dutch), another very close follower, \\"is entirely of our opinion and acts accordingly\\". Indeed, Hahnemann went so far in his enthusiasm and praise, that he offered to present this discovery by adding a special section in the about to be published 5th edition of the Organon. In 15 June letter, Hahnemann also notes that Jahr, editor of the homeopathic medical journal, Archiv, in which Aegidi would also publish about the dual remedy approach, was in on the matter. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85) Two days later Hahnemann wrote to von Boenninghausen confirming that he had started to use the dual remedy approach and would add something on it to the 5th Edition. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253) Hahnemann had already been made aware of the use of dual remedies and wrote to Aegidi on 28 April 1833, to be cautious in their use. (Haehl, Vol I, p. 393) Further, in the paragraph Hahnemann wrote for the 5th Edition and had already sent to the printer, he notes that the use of dual remedies is similar in concept to his previous use of two remedies in quick alternation. (O.A. Julian1984, p. 42 quoted in an article by De Ruyter, Dr. Eddy, Homeopathic Drainage Treatment According to Vannier, Homeopathy Online, Vol. 6) Another homeopathic historian writes \\"Another extremely interesting feature of Hahnemann's practice at this time is his use of two remedies at once.\\" Boenninghausen later wrote of the origin of the idea, a certain Dr. Stoll in Cologne around 1832-33, who thought that \\"two kinds of medicine should be combined in a prescription in order to supplement each other.\\". However, around this time, Hahnemann was engaged in a dispute, often acrimonious, with most of the homeopaths in Leipzig, over the mixing of homeopathic and allopathic methods (\\"venesection, leeches, emetics, laxatives, etc.\\"). Hahnemann was concerned to fight any kind of co-option by the prevailing medical system. Indeed, one of his major opponents in German medicine more generally was Hufeland, a very influential figure at the time. Another point of dispute was his publication regarding the nature and origin of chronic diseases, which was seen by many as misguided and unfounded, though they praised the actual remedies for treatment. (Haehl, Vol II, p. 163) Hahnemann and the Leipzig homeopaths had agreed to meet on 10 August 1833 to try to resolve their differences. At this \\"peace\\" conference, Hahnemann decided, in light of its success, to raise Aegidi's proposal for dual remedy prescribing, but as the British Journal of Homoeopathy of July 1865 explains, \\"Hahnemann was persuaded that this would probably lead to the polypharmacy of the old school, and he decided to exclude this doctrine from the new edition of the 'Organon'\\". However, the matter itself was not seen as contravening any homeopathic principle laid down by Hahnemann, as it was not mentioned at all in the \\"peace agreement\\" of 11 August 1833. (Haehl, Vol. I, p. 200) On 19 August, Hahnemann wrote to Aegidi and repeated his approval of the use of dual remedies and confirmed that he had indeed written a new paragraph for insertion in the 5th edition as \\"my only wish is that the world should gain the best, the most useful truth.\\" (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85) However, scarcely a month later, concerns about the misunderstandings that his new paragraph might cause, as pressed on him by 10 August meeting with the Leipzig homeopaths, led him to decide to withdraw the disputed paragraph (as stated in a letter of 15 September 1833 to von Boenninghausen). He was mainly concerned that his main opponent, Hufeland, would use it against him, to discredit homeopathy. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253) While Hahnemann, in his correspondence with von Boenninghausen, still accepted \\"the possibility that two well-chosen remedies may be given together with advantage in some cases\\" he felt he had not had enough experience himself to yet endorse it publicly, particularly given its controversial nature. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253-4) Thus, instead of the new paragraph, Hahnemann withdrew it and altered the existing aphorism 272 of the 4th edition by adding a footnote to it. Far from being a condemnation of the double remedy approach, Hahnemann here repeats essentially what he had written to Boenninghausen. While for many, this was the end of the affair, the case book evidence shows that Hahnemann continued to experiment with dual remedies, though in a slightly different form. In writing to Aegidi on 9 January 1834, Hahnemann was at pains to ensure that only those who really understood the new insights continue the use of dual remedies in mixture, and then not in the full public glare. (Haehl, Vol. I, p. 393-4) It should not be surprising then that Lutze, when he heard of the use of dual remedies from Aegidi, and then knowing that this had been supported, publicly at first, then privately, by Hahnemann himself, as well as Boenninghausen, and learning of its efficacy, decided to apply the method as well in his large clinic. When his results were as successful as the others, the silence on this matter and the delay in the releasing of the final, 6th edition of Hahnemann's Organon, caused him to decide finally to make public the deleted portions regarding dual remedy prescribing in 1865. = Suppression of the historical record = Hahnemann died in Paris in July 1843, survived by his second wife, Melanie. He had been working on another revision of the Organon in his last two years, and had notified his German publisher of a new edition in February 1842. However, Hahnemann died before the new, 6th edition could be completed for publication. There was a great deal of anticipation around this new edition, but for various reasons, including a need for some editing of the annotations in Hahnemann’s handwriting and a reluctance by his widow to release the new edition unless it could be published in a form completely faithful to Hahnemann’s wishes, the 6th edition was held back. Monument dedicated to Hahnemann and Lutze Negotiations were underway in 1865 between Melanie Hahnemann and prominent American homeopaths for the publication of the much awaited 6th edition, when Dr. Arthur Lutze of Köthen, concerned that the true story might not emerge, published what he claimed was the intended 6th edition of the Organon. This edition contained, most importantly, the disputed paragraph on dual remedies intended for the 5th edition, which had been taken out of that edition for political reasons, as we have seen. Dr. Lutze, a key figure in the history of homeopathy, is the one about whom the least is known, or about whom the least has been written. Lutze informs us that in 1853 he first learned about the use of dual remedies in mixture from Aegidi himself. Sometime during the period 1854–57, Boenninghausen reported his successful use of dual remedies to Lutze. Whatever concerns there were about the negative political effects of publication (in terms of the fight against allopathy) must have been outweighed, in his mind, by the tremendous benefits for suffering humanity that Lutze experienced personally in his practice. The resultant publication by Lutze in 1865 of the missing chapter from the 5th edition of the Organon unleashed a storm of protest and a concerted effort to deny the facts of the historical record, or at least to bend them to the prevailing orthodoxy of the single remedy. Lutze had already published a book in 1857 on his experiences involving dual remedy prescribing in \\"many thousands\\" of cases. In 1897, a unique monument was erected in Köthen by sculptor Henry Pohlmann (1839–1917) to honor Hahnemann and Lutze. This is a monument that Haehl mentions as being particularly notable for its beauty and provides a picture for us to admire (Vol. 1, p. 368). It is located in the park opposite the clinic Lutze, corner of Spring Street / Theatre Street in Köthen. A photo taken by Ralph Lotys shows the monument today.

Definition The Universal Book of Mathematics defines \\"schizophrenic number\\" as: The sequence of numbers generated by the recurrence relation f(n) = 10 f(n − 1) + n described above is: :0, 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 1234567900, ... . :f(49) = 1234567901234567901234567901234567901234567901229 The integer parts of their square roots, :1, 3, 11, 35, 111, 351, 1111, 3513, 11111, 35136, 111111, 351364, 1111111, ... , alternate between numbers with irregular digits and numbers with repeating digits, in a similar way to the alternations appearing within the fractional part of each square root. Characteristics The schizophrenic number shown above is the special case of a more general phenomenon that appears in the b-ary expansions of square roots of the solutions of the recurrence f_b(n)=b f_b(n-1)+n, for all b\\\\geq2, with initial value f(0) = 0 taken at odd positive integers n. The case b=10 and n=49 corresponds to the example above. Indeed, Tóth showed that these irrational numbers present schizophrenic patterns within their b-ary expansion, composed of blocks that begin with a non-repeating digit block followed by a repeating digit block. When put together in base b, these blocks form the schizophrenic pattern. For instance, in base 8, the number \\\\sqrt{f_8(49)} begins: 1111111111111111111111111.1111111111111111111111 0600 444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444 02144 333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 175124422 666666666666666666666666666666666666666 .... The pattern is due to the Taylor expansion of the square root of the recurrence's solution taken at odd positive integers. The various digit contributions of the Taylor expansion yield the non-repeating and repeating digit blocks that form the schizophrenic pattern. Other properties In some cases, instead of repeating digit sequences we find repeating digit patterns. For instance, the number \\\\sqrt{f_3(49)}: 1111111111111111111111111.1111111111111111111111111111111 01200 202020202020202020202020202020202020202020 11010102 00120012000012001200120012001200120012 0010 21120020211210002112100021121000211210 ... shows repeating digit patterns in base 3. Numbers that are schizophrenic in base b are also schizophrenic in base b^m (up to a certain limit, see Tóth). An example is \\\\sqrt{f_3(49)} above, which is still schizophrenic in base 9: 1444444444444.4444444444 350 666666666666666666666 4112 0505050505050505050 337506 75307530753075307 40552382 ...

History The history of cerdd dafod can be traced to 6th century Welsh poets such as Aneirin and Taliesin, but is probably much older. Studies also suggest that features of this form of poetry are comparable to the ancient Irish versifications and therefore point to an older shared Celtic inheritance. The composition of cerdd dafod requires strict observance of the rules of cynghanedd: an intricate system of sound-arrangement in respect of stress, alliteration, and internal rhyme within each line. One of the earliest texts on the subject is credited to Einion Offeiriad (fl c.1320-c.1349) a bard considered to have been under the patronage of Sir Rhys ap Gruffydd, a powerful nobleman of south-west Wales.Davies (2008), p.754 In it, he lists 24 canonical metres used for all poems in the writing of cerdd dafod. This was later revised by Dafydd ap Edmwnd who, in an eisteddfod held at Carmarthen circa 1450, changed two of the Offeiriad's metres to two more complicated versions of his own. These changes were adopted by future competitions as the preferred canon. In 1925 the Celtic linguist Sir John Morris-Jones published Cerdd Dafod, an in-depth study of the traditional metres of the cynghanedd and a text now seen as the definitive work on the topic.Davies (2008), p.574 This was brought about after his desire to see a return to traditional poetry and use of strict metre in eistedfoddau. The end of the twentieth century saw a renaissance in cerdd dafod, especially in the metres known as Englyn and Cywydd, attributed to the poet Alan Llwyd.

When production ceased in 1972, a total of 8017 instruments has been built, with 2102 of them being EB-2D's. Willie Moseley, in Vintage Guitar, referred to the bass guitar as possibly \\"Gibson's biggest bass invention\\"; the instrument, however, was not a great commercial success, and the Rivoli, the sister model made by Epiphone, may have been used more than the original Gibson. Description Introduced in 1958, the EB-2 was the bass guitar equivalent of the popular Gibson ES-335. It featured a 335-style semi-hollow body, a short 30.5\\" scale neck and one large \\"Sidewinder\\" humbucking pickup in the neck position. The electronics consisted of a single volume and tone knob. The EB-2N had natural finish, the EB-2 sunburst. The next year a \\"Baritone switch\\" was added, which enhanced or cut the bass frequencies, and later a string mute was added to the bridge. By 1961 the original banjo-style tuners (with the pegs pointing backwards) were replaced by regular tuners, and by 1965 cherry was a color option also. In 1966, the EB-2D was introduced, which added a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position (like the EB-3). Electronics included separate volume and tone controls and a 3-way switch to select the pickups, besides the \\"baritone\\" switch.  Variants In 2012 Gibson came out with a \\"Midtown Standard\\" bass, a semi-hollow bass loosely based on the EB-2D. Although cosmetically very alike, it supports a long-scale 34\\" neck, a solid mahogany body with routed tonechambers and a flat maple top, which is considerably smaller than the original 335-shape (somewhere between an ES-335 and a Les Paul shape) and different electronics.

It is located next to the palace of the former rulers of the then Manipur Kingdom. The temple is simple in design with two gold plated domes, a paved court and a large, raised mantapa or congregation hall. The central chamber of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has the main deity of Govindaji, stated to be the incarnation of Lord Krishna, and his consort Radha. In the other two chambers of the sanctum, on either side of the main deity, images deified are of Balabhadra and Krishna on one side, and images of Jagannath, Subhadra and Balabhadra on the other side. The temple was originally built in 1846 during the reign of Maharaja Nara Singh and rebuilt by Maharaja Chandrakriti in 1876. The temple management was earlier with the former king as per Article II of the Manipur Merger Agreement of 1949 when Manipur became a part of India after independence. However, on popular demand by the public, it is now managed by a Board with members drawn from the priest community and important people of the city. The Chief Minister of the state is the Board's president. Location Shree Govindajee Temple is located in Imphal (in its East district), the capital of the Indian state of Manipur, in the precincts of the royal palace.Imphal is accessible by road and air services. National Highway 39 (India) connects with Dimapur (Nagaland) on the north and with Myanmar on the east. It is connected to Silchar in Assam by National Highway 53 (India). National Highway 150 (India) connects with Mizoram. The nearest rail link is at Dimapur, away, from where regular bus services operate to Imphal. Air services operate to Imphal from New Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati and Silchar. History Maharaja Nara Singh (1844-50 AD) of the Manipur kingdom commissioned the temple on 16 January 1846 and dedicated it to Shree Govindaji, which was their royal deity. The temple and the deities were substantially damaged during an earthquake of 1868. Consequently, the temple was rebuilt to its original design during the reign of Maharaja Chandrakriti (1859-1886) and was consecrated on 26 April 1876. However, during the Anglo Manipur war of 1891 the idols of the temple were moved to Kongma. In 1908, after the Maharaja Churchand Singh took up residence at his new palace the idols were also moved and reconsecrated in the present temple. It is also said that ( Ching-Thang KhombaMaharaja Jai Singh ) or Bhagya Chandra Karta (1763-1798), who was an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna, received an epiphany from the Lord to build a temple for him. Accordingly, he formally initiated the carving of the idol of the Lord Govindaji, in 1776, which was then completed and consecrated in November 1779 on the full moon day in a temple built by him in his palace. On this occasion Ras Lila was performed for five days at Raas Mandal Pukhri at Langthabal. Features The temple appears very elegant. It is built in an idyllic location with a well tended garden surrounding the premises. There is a small pond in the vicinity of the temple, and also a large open space where a row of tall trees are planted along the boundary. =Main temple= Bell tower of the Govindaji Temple The temple is built over a square plan on a high platform like a royal residence. The sanctum sanctorum is surrounded by a circumambulatory passage (Pradakshina path). The sanctum is compartmentalized with two short walls. The outer chamber and the porch are built with huge columns in an arcade system where the walls above the arches rise up to the cornice. The first row of railings is provided above the cornice, in front of the portico roof, over the Pradakshina path. At the four corners of the railings small shrines called \\"Salas\\" are built. Above the sanctum, the walls rise to the terrace and are then formed into two arched domes. The arched formation of the dome terminates in to a crown where an Amalaka Sila (a circular stone disc with ridges on the rim) is topped by a Kalasa (finial) on each of the domes. A white flag is hoisted above the Kalasa. The external surface of the two domes is gilded with gold. A second row of railing, at a higher level, is provided around the two domes. The temple entrance faces east. The temple is built with brick and mortar. In the sanctum sanctorum images of Govindaji with Radha are deified in the central chamber. In its adjoining northern chamber images of Jagannath, Subhadra and Balabhadra are installed while on the southern chamber images of Balabhadra and Krishna are deified. The arcade in front of the sanctum is covered with a curtain. The images of Govindaji and Radha are first carved out of special wood and with the remaining wood images of Jagannath, Subhadra and Balabhadra are made. Images of Krishna and Balarama are, however, made of Plaster of Paris in attractive colorful shades. On special festival days the images are adorned with Mukutas (Crowns). =Mandapa= Facing the facade of the temple to the east is an open colonnaded mandapa, an outdoor pavilion with arcades. It is an independent structure, but within the enclosed precincts of the temple. It is built with royal elegance and is built double storied. It is covered by a protective railing at the first floor level. At the cornice level on the first floor a row of elephant heads are provided which support the inclined roof slabs. A mini temple tower is built as an extension of the mandapa. Seating arrangements are built within the mandapa on its eastern and southern sides to accommodate to devotees who come to witness the cultural and religious programmes held in the mandapa. The roof covering is made of corrugated cement sheets. There is also another mandapa known as the Natyashala, which is also a colonnaded structure with arcades with idols fixed at the four corners of the roof. Worship The daily worship practice followed in the temple, in the morning and evening hours, is very ritualistic and highly disciplined with strict dress code observed by the devotees. The temple doors are opened with the ringing of the large temple bell fixed in a separate bell tower next to the temple, which resounds over a large area. With blowing of ritual conches the main curtained door in front of the sanctum is opened revealing the main images enshrined in the sanctum. Devotees line up on either side of the main shrine, with women queuing up one side and men on the other side. Men who come to offer worship here are to wear only a white shirt or a kurta in a light shade and a dhoti, while women are dressed in traditional Pungou phanek and Innafi, salwar kameez or sari. Women carry offerings to the deity in a brass plate with or without a bell. Live music by permanently stationed musicians is a regular feature in the temple during the main prayer hours. The Meitheis, an ethnic group of Manipur, are the ardent devotees of the Lord of this temple. Festivals Ras Lila dance in Manipur Important festivals held with much fanfare are the Janmashatami, during the month of August, and Kang (Rathayatra), during June–July, which are attended by a very large number of devotees. Another important activity held in the precincts of the temple is the Ras Lila, a dance form of Manipur, held with great enthusiasm during Halangkar (Holi festival), Basant Purnima in February, and Kartik Purnima in October. Ras Lila is a dance form which was started by Maharaja Jai Singh. In this dance form the typical skirt that the dancers wear was revealed to Jai Singh in a dream, when the Lord appeared before him wearing a similar dress, directing him to build a temple for Him. The Ras Lila is a grand visual treat when a large number of gopis in traditional attire dance around the temple's main deity, which is brought out for the occasion onto the grounds at the sacred Kaina. Kaina, which is 29 km from Imphal, is the location where Maharaja Jai Singh was directed by Lord Govindaji to carve out his image from a jackfruit tree and enshrine it in a temple. Renovations The temple and the mantapa are under renovation since November 2012. The gold plating of the domes which was removed for renovation has been redone during August 2013. The plating is said to weigh of gold. The mantapa is also undergoing renovation. The flooring in the temple was proposed to be changed to tiles. The total cost of the renovations was estimated at Rs 8 crore.

He held numerous benefices including Archdeacon of Meath and Rector of Youghal, and sat in the Irish House of Commons. After many years as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) served briefly as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He is buried in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 pp. 85-6 Background He took his family name from his birthplace, Carlisle, Cumbria.Ball p.85 John de Karlell (died 1393), Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was his brother; John also became a Baron of the Exchequer.Ball p.167 They were apparently of fairly humble origins, as suggested by the later complaint that William was not a fit person to arrest a member of the aristocratic Wellesley family. William himself seems to have been rather sensitive about his social origins. Career He came to Ireland as part of the entourage of Lionel of Antwerp, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in 1361, and was made Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1367.Ball p.86 He became a prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral the same year and later acquired numerous other prebendaries, including Ossory. His main residence was in Kilkenny; he was a burgess of the town and died there. In 1374 he and his brother John were summoned to the Parliament of Ireland in Dublin as two of the King's counsel.Graves, James The History, Architecture and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of St Canice Kilkenny Hodges Smith Dublin 1857 p 154 In 1383 the King appointed him Queen's Attorney;Graves p. 154 soon after he was made Chief Baron, but he died within a few months of his promotion. Duties James Graves remarks that since the Catholic Church in the fourteenth century was the only source of highly educated men, clerics like the Karlell brothers were as much civil servants as priests.Graves p.152 William's duties went far beyond his judicial tasks: he audited accounts, supervised sheriffs elections, inquired into the condition of Crown lands, and into the existence of buried treasure. His duties involved much labour and money, and in 1374 he received £20 for, among other expenses, the theft of his horse.Ball p.34 This was probably in connection with the lengthy inquiry into the Crown's property rights in County Wexford and County Waterford, with particular regard to the question of treasure trove, which was conducted by de Karlell and two colleagues, John Keppock and Walter Cotterell.Smyth, Constantine Joseph Chronicle of the Law Officers of Ireland London 1839 p.183 Character From the limited evidence available to us about his personality, he seems to have been a proud man with a keen sense of his own dignity. In 1372 Sir William Wellesley, ancestor of the 1st Duke of Wellington, was arrested for disobeying a summons to appear before Karlell, and in the following year one Richard Bateman was found guilty of contempt of court for saying that Karlell was not fit to arrest one of Wellesley's rank, presumably due to his lower social standing.Graves pp.152-3 Tomb James Graves in his history of St. Canice's Cathedrai, published in 1857, described William's tomb as a coffin-shaped slab, six feet by two, elevated about two feet from the floor of the cathedral, and completely unadorned except for an inscription giving William's name and clerical offices.Graves p.151 His brother John was also buried in St Canice's, but his tomb was largely destroyed in the seventeenth century.

Episode one: The Choice The first programme in the series tells how Winston Churchill came to write \\"Marlborough: His Life and Times\\", his four- volume biography of his ancestor John Churchill written over ten years when he was in the political wilderness as a back bench MP between 1929 and 1938. The first volume and this episode describes how John Churchill rose from obscurity to be the right-hand man of King James II when his sister Arabella became mistress to James. Religious difference between Catholic France and Protestant Holland and the tensions in England with a catholic King and a Protestant parliament John Churchill chose political principles over personal loyalty and betrayed James and joined William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution that set Britain on the course to democracy, and committed her to war with Louis XIV's France.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-churchills/episode- guide/series-1/episode-1 Channel 4 official episode 1 Episode two: The March to War Volume two of his book on Marlborough concentrates on events following the Treaty of Ryswick and the pacifism sweeping Britain just as it was in 1930's Britain following the Treaty of Versailles with no wish to fight more wars. Winston Churchill had visited Munich in 1932 and saw the rise of the Nazi Germany leading to a new war. William of Orange died and Queen Anne came to power and Marlborough previously sidelined, as was Winston Churchill, came to the fore to fight the French and its expansionist ideas culminating in the Battle of Blenheim. Volume two was published in October 1934 and a copy presented to Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister of a coalition government. Episode three: Grand Strategies Volume three of his book on Marlborough highlighted the Battle of Ramillies when Marlborough's use of concentrated cavalry routed the French army and destroyed the morale of the French nation. The tactics of concentrated German tanks on the same battlefield of Belgium in the second world war had the same effect leading Winston Churchill to abandon France. Needing his own Grand Alliance to defeat Hitler Churchill cultivated his friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and when America entered the war it was Churchill's strategy that prevailed over American generals who wanted to open a front in Northern France as early as 1942. Churchill recognised from his experiences as soldier that German forces were too strong in France and had to be weakened by supplying the Russians fighting on the Eastern Front, bombing German industry and attacking German forces in Africa and Italy. This strategy led to a weakening of German troops in Normandy and led to the success of D Day in 1944.

It replaced the Dash 7 Series in the mid-1980s, and was superseded by the Dash 9 Series for freight usage and the Genesis Series for passenger usage in the mid-1990s. All models of the Dash 8 Series are powered by a 16- or 12-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine.  Specifications  The design of the Dash 8 Series is based upon that of the Dash 7 Series. The biggest changes introduced during the production of the Dash 8 Series were the first use of a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit in a diesel locomotive, and the adoption of a modular system in the construction of the vehicle body. The Dash 8 locomotive bodies were assembled from several modules, creating a combination to fit the length of the chassis. On models with a traditional narrow short hood, the part of the equipment room immediately behind the cab is taller than the top of the rounded cab roof, giving those models a distinctive appearance. On all models, that part of the equipment room houses the cooling fans for the dynamic braking system. Traction motors of Dash 8 locomotives were powered by direct current.  Construction history  The Dash 8 prototype was completed in 1984. Manufacture of the improved production units started in earnest in 1987. Early versions of the Dash 8 were manufactured on the Dash 7 production line, but their general appearance was different. The Dash 8-40C, introduced in 1987, featured improved reliability.  Nomenclature  The naming of the Dash 8 Series, and that of its various models, corresponded initially with that of its predecessor, the Dash 7. So, for example, \\"B32-8\\" designated a B-B configured Dash 8 Series locomotive. After product improvements were made to the line in 1987, the official designations for models in this series changed to \\"Dash 8...\\", as shown below. However, for simplicity many railroads decided to use designations which follow the pattern of the Dash 7 line. For example, the Dash 8-40C is usually rendered as \\"C40-8\\". The \\"W\\" suffix used for some models indicates the then-optional wide-nose \\"North American\\" safety cab.  Four axle models  = Common features = Specifications common to all Dash 8 Series four axle models are as follows: * AAR wheel arrangement: B-B * Prime mover: GE 16-cylinder V-type 7FDL-16 four stroke diesel engine = Dash 8-32B (B32-8) = NS B32-8 at Hinman Yard. This model was manufactured between 1984 and 1989 49 examples of the model were built for North American railroads. All but 4 of these units were ordered by Norfolk Southern. The others were 3 units ordered by Burlington Northern Railroad, and a GE demonstrator unit. * Prime mover: GE 12-cylinder V-type 7FDL-12 four stroke diesel engine * Power output: = Dash 8-36B (B36-8) = This model, a one- off, was the original Dash 8 prototype, built in 1983. * Power output: = Dash 8-39B (B39-8) = SP B39-8 leads a westbound train through Eola, Illinois (just east of Aurora). A total of 145 examples of this model were manufactured from 1984. Its external appearance is almost the same as that of the later Dash 8-40B model, with the obvious exception of the trucks. The first three Dash 8-39Bs were built for Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF). A fourth example of the model, a GE demonstrator designated as a Dash 8-39BE (or B39-8E), was converted from the original Dash 8 prototype. There were also two much larger groups of this model: 102 Dash 8-39BEs were fabricated for Locomotive Management Services (LMSX) and placed on long term lease to Burlington Northern Railroad. The remaining 40 were built for the Southern Pacific Railroad. * Power output: = Dash 8-40B (B40-8) = UP B40-8B, #1869. In 1988 and 1989, a total of 150 units of this model were produced. Substantial orders for the model came from ATSF (40 units), Conrail (30 units), New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (24 units), and the model's biggest customer, St. Louis Southwestern Railway (54 units). There were also small orders from Providence and Worcester Railroad (4 units), the United States Department of Energy (Savannah River Site), and a GE demonstrator unit. * Power output: = Dash 8-40BW (B40-8W) = BNSF B40-8BW in former ATSF livery. Eighty three examples of this model were built for ATSF in the early 1990s. ATSF was the only railroad to order it. There was also one GE prototype and testbed, rebuilt from the prototype B39-8E. The \\"W\\" suffix to this model's name indicates that it differs from the B40-8 in having a \\"wide nose\\" safety cab. GE was almost commissioned by ATSF to make a B unit (cabless booster unit) version of this model, but because the price would have been the same for B40-8Ws with cabs or without, ATSF decided to order units with cabs only. All of ATSF's B40-8Ws became part of BNSF, and many were later reliveried into one of BNSF's liveries. Some have since been sold to other operators. * Power output: 7FDL-16 turbocharged diesel engine = Dash 8-32BWH (B32-8WH) = Amtrak 505 leading the Sunset Limited through Cade, Louisiana A total of 20 units of this type were built, with the last units being delivered in December of 1991. All were built specifically for Amtrak and numbered 500 through 519. They were nicknamed \\"Pepsi Cans\\" and Hockey Sticks\\" by many railfans, due to being originally painted in a wide-striped red, white, and blue livery. Since the most recent overhaul, however, the locomotives now have the current Phase V blue-silver livery with the current \\"wave\\" logo. They were also the first locomotives that Amtrak purchased to replace the EMD F40PH before the introduction of the GE Genesis series locomotives in 1993. Although the units have since been regulated to yard service, maintenance of way service and transfer service, they can still be seen on passenger trains. Two of the units, Amtrak numbers #501 and #502, were sold to the California Department of Transportation. (CDTX) In 1994. The locomotives were renumbered #2051 and #2052, and received the Amtrak California paint scheme. They are currently being used on the State-Supported San Joaquin and Capital Corridor trains. * Power output: 3,200 hp (2.4 MW)  Six axle models  = Common features = Specifications common to all Dash 8 Series six axle models, except where stated, are as follows: * AAR wheel arrangement: C-C * Prime mover: GE 16-cylinder V-type 7FDL-16 four stroke diesel engine * Maximum speed: = Dash 8-32C (C32-8) = BF C32-8, ex-Conrail, 2007. This was one of the earliest models in the Dash 8 Series. Only 10 of the model were built, in 1984. All of them were delivered to Conrail. Initially, these units were painted in Conrail's standard blue livery. In 1997, Conrail assigned all 10 of them to \\"Ballast Express\\" service, and they were repainted into a gray version of the Quality scheme. One C32-8 was eventually bought by Brasil Ferrovias (BF), after being retired by Conrail. However, this unit developed problems with its electronics, and was therefore decommissioned to supply parts for the mechanically similar C30-7As operated on the Cutralle–Quintela railroad. * Prime mover: GE 12-cylinder V-type 7FDL-12 four stroke diesel engine * Power output: = Dash 8-39C (C39-8) = NREC C39-8. Between 1984 and 1987, a total of 161 examples of this model were produced for two North American railroads: Norfolk Southern and Conrail. An initial batch of 114 of the standard version of this model was built for Norfolk Southern, which then ordered a batch of 25 examples of the C39-8E (Enhanced) model, with a carbody similar to that of the C40-8. Conrail ordered 22 of the standard version. After the Conrail split in 1999, 13 units of this order went to Norfolk Southern and the remaining 9 units went to CSX. * Power output: = Dash 8-40C (C40-8) = C&NW; C40-8 #8540. This was the first model of any locomotive series to be fitted with microprocessor-equipped engine control units. A total of 581 examples of the model were manufactured between 1987 and 1992. The C40-8 has a traditional narrow short hood, but otherwise its external appearance is almost the same as that of the later Dash 8-40CW model. The most important customer for this model was UP, which ordered 257 of them. Other large orders for the model came from Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (77 units), Conrail (25), CSX (147) and Norfolk Southern (75). The remaining four units were supplied to Estrada de Ferro Carajás of Brazil. * Power output: = Dash 8-40CM (C40-8M) = A BC Rail C40-8M. Mechanically identical to the Dash 8-40C (see above) and Dash 8-40CW (see below), this model was constructed between 1990 and 1994 only for Canadian railways, with a production total of 84 units. The model is distinguished from the Dash 8-40CW by the addition of a full-width cowl body and the use of a Canada-specific nose and windshield configuration. BC Rail ordered 26 examples of the model, Canadian National ordered 55, and Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway acquired the remaining three. * Power output: = Dash 8-40CW (C40-8W) = ATSF C40-8W, #805, in Los Angeles. Early versions of this model differ from the Dash 8-40C only in having a \\"wide\\" or \\"safety\\" cab. A total of 756 examples of the model were built, with the first being delivered to Union Pacific in 1990. The C40-8W was continuously upgraded over the course of its production. Later model Conrail units were built with split cooling systems for the turbocharger intercooler and engine cooling (previous Dash 8 series had both on the same cooling system). The units delivered to Conrail in 1993 and 1994 were equipped with GE's Integrated Function Displays (IFD). Some of the C40-8Ws operated by Conrail were lease units owned by LMSX. The other railroads that operated C40-8Ws as original owners were ATSF, CSX, and Union Pacific. * Power output: = Dash 8-41CW (C41-8W) = UP C41-8W, #9481. This model is a variation of the C40-8W with the same 16-cylinder engine upgraded to . A total of 154 C41-8Ws were produced between 1993 and 1994 for both UP and ATSF. Some Dash 8-40CW units were similarly uprated to Dash 8-41CW standard by the railroads. * Power output: = Dash 8-44CW (C44-8W) = A total of 53 examples of this model were built in 1993–1994, all of them for CSX numbered 9000-9052. This was the preproduction version of the Dash 9 series containing its innards but having an extended Dash 8 carbody (with the exception of the first three locomotives).

Biography Flora Garry was the daughter of Archie Campbell, a freelance writer who used the nom de plume of \\"The Buchan Farmer\\", and Helen Campbell, who wrote plays for radio. She was brought up at Mains of Auchmunziel, near to New Deer, Buchan in Abderdeenshire. She went to school in New Deer, then went on to the Peterhead Academy and the University of Aberdeen. She became a school teacher, and taught at Dumfries and Strichen. She married Robert Campbell Garry, who was the first to use insulin in Scotland while a house doctor at Western Infirmary, Glasgow and who became Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Glasgow. They had one son, Frank. Flora Garry did not start to write poetry until World War II, and did not publish anything until she was an old age pensioner. Explaining why she began writing poetry so late, she said that just as happiness has no history, neither does it write poetry. She corresponded with Edith Anne Robertson (1883–1973), another Aberdeenshire poet who wrote in the Scots tongue. Her verse collection Bennygoak was first published in 1974. She spent her last years in Comrie, Perthshire, dying there on 16 June 2000 after outliving her husband and her son.

Although she wrote fine English, her full talent emerged in her work in the local Buchan dialect. Most of the writers in Scots in the first half of the twentieth century were well educated and of middle-class background. They respected the Scots language but it was not their native tongue. Flora Garry was unusual in that as a child she probably spoke the language she later used in her poetry.

Enriched by a creative and enthusiastic group of young actors and playwrights including Luis Ruffinelli, Miguel Pecci Saavedra, Francisco Martín Barrios, Facundo Recalde, Benigno Villa and Arturo Alsina, Centurión Miranda is remembered as one of the true creators of the Paraguayan theatre. He began working as an actor. In 1926 he wrote his first play, Cupido sudando, a comedy in three acts, earning him critical acclaim after it was performed. Later, in 1932, in collaboration with Josefina Pla, he wrote Episodios chaqueños. His 1933 Guaraní-language drama Tuyú in three acts, which dealt with young Chaco blood spilled by Paraguayan soldiers, was a major success and is considered by critics to be the cornerstone of the Guaraní theatre.  His first steps  Centurión Miranda’s parents were J.C. Centurión and Francisca Miranda. He studied at the Colegio Nacional de Asunción. In 1926, he joined the first Paraguayan professional company: the Paraguayan Company of Comedy that had been created a decade before. This company was enriched by a creative and enthusiastic group of young actors and dramatists including Luis Ruffinelli, Miguel Pecci Saavedra, Francisco Martín Barrios, Facundo Recalde, Benigno Villa and Arturo Alsina. Theater in Guarani developed at the hands of the dramatists Francisco Martín Barrios, Benigno Villa, Rigoberto Fontao Meza and Félix Fernández.  Theatrical works  In 1939, radio theater emerged. Its driving forces were Centurión Miranda and Josefina Plá who founded Proal, a sublime on-air news program, according to Carlos R. Centurion. There they created, among other things, the work Desheredado, written by both authors. Soon after the signing of the peace treaty of the Guerra del Chaco, the group La Peña was born. Through radio, it promoted the theater with Centurión Miranda, Arturo Alsina, Hérib Campos Cervera, Clotilde Pinho, and Josefina Plá as the leading roles. In 1938–1939, this group of enthusiastic artists built the radio diary Proal. Through these dramatists, this program broadcast pieces of written works such as La hermana impaciente, La hora de Caín and Desheredado. Alternating the roles of actor and author, in 1942 he was working again with Josefina Pla, writing several works together such as La hora de Caín, María Inmaculada, Aquí no ha pasado nada, Un sobre en blanco o Paréntesis, La huella, Pater familias and Porasy. These continued to earn the respect of critics and the public. In 1950 he founded the Municipal School of Performing Arts (Escuela Municipal de Arte Escénico). Centurión Miranda also appeared in three major film productions alongside Argentine movie stars. He starred in films such as Codicia (1955), El trueno entre las hojas (1958) and La sangre y la semilla (1959). La sangre y la semilla was directed by Alberto Du Bois, co-starring Olga Zubarry and Ernesto Báez. Centurión Miranda died in Asunción on January 31, 1960. Currently, the municipal theatrical school which he founded is named after him in his honor.

Born to a rich businessman, The became interested in film while still a youth. After a period as an exporter, in 1930 he established Cino Motion Picture to produce films in the Dutch East Indies. In a little over a decade he and his company had released at least 31 films, including some of the country's first talkies. Although he experienced a brief resurgence during the 1950s, after Indonesia became independent, he spent the last years of his life as an English teacher. Biography Logo of The's Java Industrial Film He was born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia) on 18 June 1902 to a rich businessman name The Kim Ie. As a child he studied at a Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan school. The studied economics in the United States beginning in 1920. However, instead of following his father's footsteps The studied filmmaking at the Palmer Play Theater; one of his fellow film students was Fred Young, another peranakan Chinese from the Indies, who would collaborate with The. While in the US The worked towards convincing his father to become a film importer; the elder The initially refused, but eventually agreed to his son's proposal. After five years of studies he went to Shanghai and became involved in the country's cinema industry, working on exporting films from China to the Indies and trying his hand at filmmaking. He returned to the Indies in 1930, after Shanghai-produced films became less popular. In the Indies, The – despite his father insisting that importing films was more profitable – established Cino Motion Pictures. The nation's cinema was still in its infancy; the first locally produced feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, had been released in 1926, and there were only three other film production companies in the country. The studio's first release, Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang, was among the first talkies produced in the country, but a critical failure. The followed this with several further releases, including the commercial success Sam Pek Eng Tay. From 1933 until early 1935, all feature films from the Dutch East Indies were produced by The, partly because of the Great Depression and partly because of the difficulties and financial burdens caused by transitioning from silent films to talkies. These stories were based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. In 1935 the company's name changed to Java Industrial Film (JIF) and The brought his siblings into the business, which became increasingly active. Teng Gan became general assistant, Teng Liong was put in charge of sound, and Teng Hwi was tasked as a cameraman. By 1938 JIF had begun focusing on stories dealing with modern issues, possibly in response to Albert Balink's 1938 film Pareh. Java Industrial Film closed during the Japanese occupation, starting in 1942. During the occupation The worked for a period in a theatrical group, but he found it unfulfilling and left soon afterwards. After Indonesia's independence and the cease of the National Revolution, he and Fred Young established the Bintang Soerabaja film company, which continued production until 1962. After the studio closed, The became an English teacher and, in 1967, changed his name to Tahyar Idris. The died on 25 February 1977 in Jakarta. He received an award from the capital's governor shortly before his death.

The coordinates of Kampala Tower are:0° 20' 6.00\\"N, 32° 34' 57.00\\"E (Latitude:0.3350; Longitude:32.5825). Overview Kampala Tower will sit on a site that currently houses the Uganda National Museum and the headquarters of Uganda Wildlife Authority, both of which will be relocated. Other nearby structures, including Kitante Primary School, may have to temporarily relocate while construction is going on. The tower will serve as the headquarters of the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Trade & Industry. In addition, the building will provide upsclale rentable office and retail space in this rapidily- expanding neighborhood of Uganda's capital city. When completed, in 2020 as expected, the tower will become the tallest building on the African continent, surpassing the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, which, at , is the reigning height leader. Kampala Tower will contain over , of office and retail space, enough to accommodate up to 12,500 people. History The lead planning institution is the development of this project is the Uganda Ministry of Tourism, Trade & Industry. Working with those original cencepts, the London-based architectural firm Capita Symonds, assisted by the Ugandan firm Plan Systems Limited, drew several architectural designs for the Ugandan government to select from. In 2010, the architects presented their final drawings to the Ugandan Government for final approval. Construction costs , the estimated construction costs were US$750 million (UGX:1.83 trillion). This estimate is likely to go up, due to increased costs of building materials since that time. Government is currently sourcing for a private investor, who will fund the construction, own and operate the building for 30 years following commissioning. It is anticipated that by that time, the investor would have recouped his/her investment with reasonable profit. The building would revert to the Ugandan government following the thirty-year period. Construction was originally planned to start in 2011 and last 6 to 8 years. , the development is on hold, while a private investor is sought. Controversy The development of Kampala Tower has been strongly opposed by a wide section of society.

Vanishing spray used in the match between Achilles '29 and Sparta Rotterdam Vanishing spray in use at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Vanishing spray, also known as vanishing foam, is a substance applied to an association football pitch in order to provide a temporary visual marker. It is most often used by the referee to indicate the minimum distance that the defending team may position themselves from the ball during a direct free kick, as well as to indicate the spot from where the kick is taken. The spray appears similar to white paint or watered-down shaving foam when initially applied. It completely disappears within a minute, leaving no visible residue behind. Used mainly at the highest levels of competition, vanishing spray is said to help prevent unnecessary delays by preventing the defensive team from encroaching closer than the mandated from the ball during a free kick, and also by preventing the attacking team from illegally moving the ball from the spot where the referee awarded the kick. Its use in football is not regulated by the Laws of the Game, with authorisation being in the hands of the governing body of a match, league, or tournament. Overview Vanishing spray is applied from an aerosol can carried by the referee in a holster secured to their shorts. The referee has full discretion on whether or not to use vanishing spray, and opponents are required to retreat 10 yards from the spot of a free kick regardless of whether vanishing spray is used (unless the team awarded the kick elects to take a \\"quick\\" free kick with opponents still within 10 yards). It is generally only used when a free kick is awarded where a goal-scoring attempt is highly likely to develop (e.g. it is usually not used when a team is awarded a free kick in its own half of the pitch). When the referee chooses to use vanishing spray, they will usually mark the spot of the ball, then pace 10 yards in the direction of the attack, then spray a line marking that distance. Finally, the referee will indicate for the free kick to be taken, usually by blowing the whistle. The marks disappear after about one minute. Technical details The can contains water (~80%), butane gas (~17%), surfactant (~1%), and other ingredients including vegetable oil (~2%).BBC World Service Outlook 28'7/14 The story behind football’s magic foam The liquefied butane expands when the product is ejected from the can. The butane evaporates instantly, forming bubbles of gas in the water/surfactant mixture. The surfactant(s) cause the bubbles to have stability and hence a gas-in-liquid colloid (foam) forms. The bubbles eventually collapse and the foam disappears, leaving only water and surfactant residue on the ground. More technical details can be found in the US patent applications for two of the commercial products available: Spuni (2001) and 9-15 (2010). History Chris Foy uses the spray on the opening day of the 2014–15 Premier League season. In 2000, Brazilian inventor Heine Allemagne developed the spray under the name \\"Spuni\\" (pronounced SPOO-nee, from espuma, the Portuguese word for foam). Its first use in a professional level was in the 2001 Brazilian Championship, Copa João Havelange.Andre Rossi, \\"\\", A Brazilian wants to bring the revolutionary spray to the world\\", Terra - Portuguese, May 9, 2003 Referees unanimously approved its use and the spray was since adopted in Brazilian competitions. An international patent application for \\"Spuni\\" was filed by its inventor on March 31, 2000 and the patent granted on October 29, 2002.Heine Allemagne, BR Patent No: 0002743 \\"Composição espumosa em spray para demarcar e limitar distâncias regulamentares nos esportes\\" Since then, the spray has been used in many international football competitions. In June 2014 the spray's latest commercial version, \\"9-15\\", made its debut in the FIFA 2014 World Cup. \\"9-15\\" was developed by Argentinian entrepreneur Pablo Silva and its commercial production started in 2008.Pablo Silva, \\"History of the invention\\", La Nueva News - Spanish, December 3, 2013. Brazilian inventor Heine Allemagne in 2018 spoke to the media, alleging that FIFA have not paid him for the spray, instead continuing to produce and use the spray without paying royalties. Brazilian courts have ruled against FIFA but they continue to ignore the matter. The 2011 Copa América tournament was the first tournament for national teams to use the spray. Its success caused it to be adopted by several national leagues in 2011 in America, including Major League Soccer. It has also been used in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Malta and Gozo, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.  Modern use  The first World Cup match to feature the vanishing spray was the opening game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup between Brazil and Croatia on 12 June, used by referee Yuichi Nishimura. The spray is now authorised for use in top flight football for the Bundesliga in Germany, (though Germany's consumer protection agency, TÜV, initially banned it due to environmental concerns), Serie A in Italy, Ligue 1 in France, La Liga in Spain, the Premier League in England, Major League Soccer in the United States of America, the Iran Pro League, the Czech First League, the Hong Kong Premier League, the A-League in Australia, the Thai Premier League, the Primeira Liga in Portugal, the Ekstraklasa in Poland, the Danish Superliga, the Indian Super League, the J-League in Japan,http://footballchannel.asia/2015/02/24/post2313/ and the V.League 1 in Vietnam.

Pieces of mail carried by the riders were delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a ceremony held on the White House lawn. The National Pony Express Centennial Association was created in 1960 and worked with committees within each of the trail states to organize and conduct a 100th anniversary re-ride. This event attracted state and national attention with included the participation of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the issuing of a commemorative coin by the United States Department of Treasury and the United States Postal Service., In 1966, National Pony Express Association (NPEA) was organized and received official corporate on March 3, 1978. Its national headquarters is located in Pollock Pines, California. Annual re-ride Since 1980, the National Pony Express Association had held a re-ride every year in June. NPEA members ride across the 1,966 mile route non-stop over 10 days. Beginning in St. Joseph, Missouri and ending in Sacramento, California (alternating beginning and end destinations yearly), riders carry commemorative mail in mochillas.

The Slide Ride of 1983 Postal services were delayed following an avalanche that shut down U.S. Highway 50 between Whitehall and Kyburz, California on April 9, 1983. A contract was drawn up between the U.S. Postal Service and the National Pony Express Association in which riders agreed to carry the mail around the landslide for $2 a day. Riders from the California and Nevada NPEA divisions carried 60,000 pieces of mail (including tax returns) over six weeks. 1996 Olympic Torch Relay On May 13–16, 1996, 325 National Pony Express Association riders from all eight state divisions carried the Olympic Torch during the Torch Relay for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Each rider covered 1 to 2 miles across a 544-mile route from Julesburg, Colorado, to St. Joseph, Missouri. The NPEA was the only group of Torchbearers who carried the Torch by horseback and it was also one of a few groups to carry the Torch 24-hours a day. 150th anniversary Celebrations for the 150th anniversary of the Pony Express began April 1, 2010.

The ruins of the castle, built in the Middle Ages, are on a natural rocky spur at the place name Boutavent. The land, surrounded by the forest of Paimpont and the pond of Boutavent, stretches over more that 2 hectares. It has been confirmed that during the 13th and 14th century, the castle belonged to the Lords of Montfort. It was also part of the goods of the family of Montfort with the Comper, Montfort, Montauban and Gaël castles. The history of the site goes in pair with legends. It is said that during the 7th century, the castle was the residence of Judicaël, King of Domnonée, and that it had been the place where the King and saint Éloi met. This last was sent to bring peace in a fight for borders between Bretons and French. The castle is structured into two classical elements: a courtyard and a barnyard, separated by a deep gap. Four buildings which could be guesthouses, are on both sides of the barnyard. The fortification and elements of the barnyard can still be seen. During the 16th century, the castle was in ruin. The circumstances of the destruction of the fortified site of Boutavent remain mysterious. Maybe it has been dismantled during the War of succession (second half of the 14th century) or in 1373, during the campaign of Bertrand du Guesclin in Brittany, but nothing proves that the castle hasn't been inhabited then. Many local authors of the 19th century wrote about Boutavent, in particular writers like Poignand, Vigoland or Oresve. Even though these stories constitute rare stories about the site, it is impossible to retrace the entire history of the castle, as there are only a few sources. The castle has not been searched yet but many campaigns of consolidation of the relics took place since 2006. During these campaigns, archaeological material has been found (slate, ceramic, ground pavement and glazed tiles). The site, controlled by Montfort Community, is open to the public since 2005. Maintaining works, strengthening the relics and promoting Boutavent, all three are done in collaboration with the ecomuseum of the district of Montfort, the Regional Archaeology Service and the Eureka Emplois Services welfare-to-work program.

The town was founded in 1913. It lies approximately halfway between Fredericksburg and Comfort, near the border of Gillespie County. History and geography =Bankersmith Train Station= Bankersmith originated in 1913 as a train station along the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway which served nearby Grapetown, Texas, running between Fredericksburg and Comfort. The town and rail station drew its name of \\"Bankersmith\\" from Temple Doswell Smith, an important Fredericksburg bank president who financed the railroad. In the early 1940s, the railroad abandoned the line running through Bankersmith. = Old Route 9 / Old San Antonio Road= Old Route 9 / Old San Antonio Road is the first paved road running north into Fredericksburg, that ran through Bankersmith after the founding of the Bankersmith Train Station. However the much later U.S. Route 87 did not pass through Bankersmith, it later on became an important alternative route between Fredericksburg and Comfort. =Bankersmith Post Office= During the 1920s, Bankersmith reached its peak population of approximately 50. The post office was sometimes listed as being in Kendall County and sometimes listed in Gillespie County, depending on the abode of the current Postmaster. It was surrounded by a small business district which served the train station. By the 1940s, the town was all but abandoned and the post office was gone—although some residents persisted into the 1960s. =The Old Tunnel of the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway= As the town was located in the Texas Hill Country, it is near one of the few railroad tunnels in the state (the only railroad tunnel in Texas when it was constructed). The tunnel is 962 feet in length, took 6 months to dig, and cost $134,000 at the time. The tunnel is now part of Old Tunnel State Park and the home to thousands of bats.

Guller declared his intentions to turn the town into a tourist destination by creating a hall of fame for the bikini swimsuit, presenting its history beginning with its invention in 1946. Guller has said he had no plans to open a Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill restaurant at the location, but might start a bar inside an abandoned bus there. The bus resides at 30°8'24\\"N and 98°49'8\\"W. 'The Abandoned Bus' In 2015, Guller reverted to the name Bankersmith, wanting to mend fences with Fredericksburg. In 2018, Guller said he may add lodging to the event venue.

Khalilullah Ali III was born in 1740 in the city of Kirman. His upbringing in Mahallat began under the care of his uncle, Mirza Muhammad Bakir at the age of two years, and got rudiments of his formal education at home. In 1792 he succeeded his father Abū-l-Ḥasan ‘Alī ibn Qāsim ‘Alī, for whom he was his eldest son. He moved the seat of the Imamate from Kirman to Kahak, Qom, from where he led for 20 years. His name of Shah Khalil Allah was a Ni'matullāhī Sufi name, which reflected the close relationship between the Nizaris and Ni'matullāhīs. In 1815 Shāh Khalīlullāh moved to Yazd in order to be closer to his Indian followers.The Ismailis: Their History and Doctrines, by Farhad Daftary, page 462.  Death and succession  Shāh Khalīlullāh died at the age of 77 in 1817 (along with several followers) as a result of a fanatical Twelver Shia cleric called Mulla Husayn Yazdi inciting a Twelver mob to attack the Imam's house as a follow up to a dispute between some Nizaris and some Twelver shopkeepers. However, Yazdi’s real aim may have been to weaken the spreading influence of the Nizaris. The Imam's house was also plundered in the attack. Mulla Husayn Yazdi was punished for his actions by Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar (the second Qajar king of Iran), since the king and the Imam had been on good terms.The Ismailis: Their History and Doctrines, by Farhad Daftary, page 463. The Imam was buried in the holy city of Najaf, Iraq, in a mausoleum that also contains the bodies of some of his relatives and descendants. The Imam was the last to have spent his entire Imamate in Persia. He was succeeded by his eldest son Shāh Ḥassan ‘Alī, who was the first Nizari Imam to use the title Aga Khan- a trend which has continued to the present day. Following the Imams death, the Ismailis of Iran were in a strong enough position to finally come out publicly and cease their use of Taqiyya, which had been in force for over 500 years.  Western views  Scottish traveller and author James Baillie Fraser described the Imam as “a person of high respectability and great influence”, while French linguist and orientalist Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy quoted a description of the Imam as “This person, whom his people grace with the pompous title of caliph, enjoys a great reputation and is considered to have the gift of performing miracles”.

He was also a teacher and educationalist. Some of his poetry was written for children. Life John Milne was born at Memsie, near Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire in 1897 to a farming family. He attended the University of Aberdeen where he excelled academically, then became a teacher. In later years he was Master of Method at Aberdeen College of Education. His collection of verses, The Orra Loon was published in 1946 and his collected Poems in 1963. The northeastern poet and novelist Nan Shepherd helped prepare the latter edition of Milne's poetry, published after his death. In 2009 the Buchan Heritage Society launched a CD on which well- known local performers and artists had collaborated in recording samples of his work. The society hoped that through hearing Milne's unique poetry children would help preserve the Doric tongue, which many in the area have forgotten. Work According to Cuthbert Graham, \\"The imaginative literature of Aberdeen for the past century has been dominated by a single theme-a single myth if you like in the deep psychological sense-a passion for the land... In poetry Charles Murray, John C. Milne and Flora Garry have illuminated the same obsessive concern.\\" J.C. Milne's work was full of humorous irony, through which he could express his unique viewpoint while apparently reporting the speech of the characters he depicted. Milne had an extraordinary ability to exploit the potential for rhyming in the dialect. Rich in vocabulary, his poetry seemed simple and unaffected.

It was originally broadcast in the United States on ABC on 17 May 2011. The episode was directed by Nelson McCormick and written by Andrew Dettman. In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) stops the funeral of Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) after seeing irregularities in her death. Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), and siblings Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), all say that Nikki was suicidal, with evidence at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, the evidence suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Megan finds out from daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser) that her ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) is in a relationship with her boss Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan). The episode received mixed to positive reviews, and was watched by 10.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, on the Sunday night it aired in the United States. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic was unsure whether the episode was good enough to be the season finale, however she did praise this \\"solid\\" episode, saying it had an \\"intriguing murder, lots of suspects, and an interesting personal twist for Megan\\". This episode was nominated at the 21st Annual Environmental Media Awards, however lost out to the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode \\"Fracked\\". Plot Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) are called to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a terminal illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money. The two are arrested, and Nikki's funeral takes place. However, Samantha arrives to arrest Lillian, as Nikki's brother Billy (Eric Sheffer Stevens) found the pills Lillian wasn't giving Nikki, and Lillian is charged with interfering with her daughter's medical care. Bill assures Megan that Nikki's money in her will, will be put to a good use and thanks her and the team for investigating. Throughout the investigation Lacey thinks that Megan and Todd are getting back together, as Todd has made many calls to Megan's work. Lacey is shocked to find out that Todd is not phoning Megan, but Kate, and the two are in a relationship. Megan is angry at Kate, but tells Lacey to respect her, even if she does not like her yet. Production Jill Eikenberry (pictured) played Lillian Parkson, the mother of victim Nikki. \\"Broken Home\\" was written by Andrew Dettman and directed by Nelson McCormick, this being his third episode he directed, having directed the season premiere \\"Pilot\\" and the subsequent episode \\"Letting Go\\". McCormick has directed many television series such as Third Watch, Nip/Tuck, ER and more recently, Criminal Minds. Daniel Licht, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actress Jill Eikenberry – best known for her role in L.A. Law – and actor Eric Sheffer Stevens – best known for his role in As the World Turns – both guest starred in this episode, as Lillian and Bill Parkson, respectively. Sheffer Stevens later reprised his role as Bill in season two's fifth episode \\"Point of Origin\\". Recurring cast members Jeffrey Nordling and Mary Mouser returned in this episode, with this being both Mouser's and Nordling's first appearance since seasons one's seventh episode, \\"All in the Family\\". Regular cast member John Carroll Lynch who plays Detective Bud Morris, did not appear in this episode, although he was credited. \\"Broken Home\\", along with the eight episodes from Body of Proofs first season, were released on a two-disc DVD set in the United States on September 20, 2011. The sets included brief audio commentaries from various crew and cast members for several episode's, a preview of season 2 and a 10-minute \\"featurette\\" on the making of the show, with commentaries from the medical consultants who helped with the script, as well as a \\"Contaminated Evidence\\" blooper reel. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on May 17, 2011, \\"Broken Home\\" was seen by 10.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 2.1 rating/9 share. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This episode achieved a much higher number of viewers than the previous episode, \\"Buried Secrets\\", and a significant higher number than subsequent episode \\"Love Thy Neighbor\\", which is season two's premiere. Body of Proof came fifth in the ratings on Tuesday night, being outperformed by the season finales of CBS's NCIS and of The Good Wife as well as two airings of ABC's Dancing with the Stars. \\"Broken Home\\" was watched by 1.75 million viewers upon its airing on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom. =Critical response= This episode received mixed to positive reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said that the plot of the episode had a \\"nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder\\". She added that Nikki's family was a \\"nightmare\\". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he \\"came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode\\", adding that Nikki had a \\"short, sad life\\". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, \\"I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity\\". Orlando carried on saying, \\"Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of that by the end of the season\\". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it \\"justified\\", saying it was an \\"odd position to be in\\", but summarized; \\"she'll just have to get over it\\". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; \\"the jury is still out on Todd\\". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a \\"great bonding moment\\" between Megan and Lacey, saying she \\"liked\\" that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, \\"I like it when adults actually act like adults\\". This episode was nominated at the 21st Annual Environmental Media Awards, an \\"organization dedicated to harnessing the power of the entertainment industry and the media to educate the global public on environmental issues and motivate sustainable lifestyles\\". Under the category \\"Television Episodic Drama\\", \\"Broken Home\\" was nominated alongside The Good Wife episode \\"Real Deal\\" and the winner, the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode \\"Fracked\\".

Bordering on Strathclyde Park, the park contains four operating rollercoasters, two water rides, several fairground rides, an arcade, a theatre, ten-pin bowling and an indoor tropical house, Amazonia.\\"Theme park's pirates offer egg-stra treats\\". Evening Times, 3 April 2012 / Caroline Wilson In 2018, North Lanarkshire Council approved an expansion proposal from the park, including plans for a new rollercoaster, a new themed area, and an expansion to an existing hotel. The park currently closed on 23 April 2020 due to administration but seems that the owners are reopening under a new company name (Lakeview)  Attractions  M&D;'s Theme Park claimed to have over 40 rides and attractions, including four roller coasters, a log flume and several fairground type rides in addition to a number of rides designed for young children. Most were travelling rides owned by the parks operators, travelling showmen Matthew and Douglas Taylor. = Roller coasters = The Tornado, the park's largest roller coaster * Tornado: The park's largest roller coaster. Manufactured by Pinfari, with over 1 km of track. The track contains two 360-degree vertical loops in addition to several banked turns, pulling −2Gs at some points. This ride has a top speed of over 80 km/h.\\"Our Selection of the Top Theme Parks in the UK: M&D;’s\\". Weather- Whatever, by Shannon Harto Monday 15 July 2013 It formerly had a corkscrew which was removed after the 2005 season due to being exceptionally rough. * Mad Mouse: This spinning roller coaster was opened 2016. * Big Apple: A children's roller coaster, which used to travel through a large fibreglass apple. * Runaway Mine Train: Another children's roller coaster. Prior to 2007, the train had spinning cars and a tire-propelled lift, however these have been replaced with a traditional fixed train and chain lift. = Thrill rides = Ferris wheel * Wave Swinger: A 32-seater Swing ride. * Captain's Curse: The Captain's Curse is a pirate ship themed ride in M&D;'s. It was absent from the park during 2007–2008 season for refurbishment. * Magic Carpet: The Magic Carpet, also known as \\"Ali Baba's Carpet\\" seats up to 40 people. The ride reaches a height of 14m and a top speed of 14rpm. The seats are fixed facing forward while rising and falling, travelling round in a loop. It was replaced with a newer model of the ride in the 2017 season. * The Giant Condor: The only one of its kind in Europe. Riders go up 30 metres in 28 2-seater gondolas. Debuted in the 2015 season as a replacement to The Bomber Mark 2. = Water rides = A number of rides at the park are pictured: at the far left is Moby's Revenge, the water slides. * Moby's Revenge: Moby's Revenge is a three-in-one water slide. The rightmost slide is a steep, straight chute, whereas the leftmost one is a winding spiral slide. The path in the centre is a straight chute similar to the one on the left, however this slide is not quite as steep and features several 'waves'. * White Water: This is a log flume featuring two drops of up to 20m, and is the tallest water ride in the park. It reaches speeds of up to 70 km/h at points. Souvenir photographs are also available to purchase at the end of the ride. = Junior Rides and Attractions = * Trampolines: 10 trampoline beds. Roughly around 5 minutes per session * Mini Dodgems * Other smaller rides include \\"Taxis\\", \\"Sea Storm\\" and \\"Flying Jumbos\\" =Past rides= * Kamikaze which was replaced by The Runaway Mine Train * The Bomber Mark 2 which was replaced by the Giant Condor * Space Coaster (formerly called Cobra and then Express) left after the 2015 season and was set up at Oakwood Theme Park in July 2016 becoming The Flight of the Giant Peach however, this was later changed to Creepy Crawler due to a retheme. * Tsunami which was Scotland's only inverted rollercoaster. it was manufactured by Pinfari and it operated fine until 2016 when it derailed and fell 20 ft before crashing into a children's ride below. It was scrapped in 2017. = Other attractions = * Amazonia: The only indoor rainforest in the whole of Scotland, it contains exotic animals such as the poison dart frog, tarantula and python. * Devil's Island: An 18-hole miniature golf course, played over water and in caves. * Krazy Congo: Giant indoor soft play-area, for young children. * Gamezone: Giant amusement arcade, containing over 150 different games, including the most recently developed games. * Alona Hotel The on-site hotel for visitors staying for a period of time. It contains a glasshouse restaurant and bar and an atrium for views overlooking the Strathclyde Loch.  Food and drink  Cosmic Bowl is Scotland's first glow in the dark bowling alley. * The Family Restaurant: Formally Bizarre, is a family friendly restaurant with bar. * Downtown USA: A 1960s styled diner serves American food and drink, and is decorated with Harley Davidsons and an authentic Italian carousel. The diner is also home to a 'Wimpy Bar' and 'Pancake Palace'. * Cosmic Bowl: Cosmic Bowl is Scotlands first glow in the dark bowling alley. It contains a restaurant and 'inside out' bar. There is also arcade games such as Time Crisis, basketball & air hockey. * Inside Out: The theme parks sports bar. 'Inside Out' shows a variety of sports on 6 LCD widescreens. The bar also has its own beer garden, which overlooks strathclyde loch. * Diamond Lil's: An American Pool Bar. The bar contains 8 pool tables, 2 snooker tables and a bar that is open at peak times, Diamond Lils is now open to anyone over 18. * Guiseppi's: The parks Italian coffee shop and ice cream parlour. The bar looks out over Strathclyde Loch and serves a range of coffees, ice cream, milkshakes and sandwiches, made with traditional Italian ingredients.  Incidents and accidents  In June 2009, six people were stranded on the park's Tornado roller coaster when high winds caused safety systems to activate. On 4 July 2011, nine people, ranging in age from 9 to 49, had to be rescued from the Tsunami roller coaster, after a mechanical failure on the ride left them stranded 60 ft (18.2m) above the ground for up to eight hours. In 2013 approximately there was an incident on the White Water Log Flume in which a teenage girl's leg was trapped between a barrier and a splashback on the ride's structure, causing a serious injury.\\"M&D;'s left me scarred like a shark victim\\" .

Early career Levan began his career as the tea boy at Morgan Studios, London in 1971, rising to become an engineer and producer. His album credits include John Martyn's Grace and Danger, Ralph McTell's Water of Dreams, Iron Maiden's eponymous album, Neil Ardley's Kaleidoscope of Rainbows and Harmony of the Spheres, Colosseum II's Wardance, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Variations and Requiem, Gary Boyle's The Dancer and Electric Glide and Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia. Sound Design Levan's career developed in a different direction when, in 1982, Andrew Lloyd Webber contracted him to supervise the sound design for the original production of the musical Song and Dance at the Palace Theatre, London. He also produced a live recording of the first night performance. The impact of the sound production for the show led to him designing the sound for a number of musicals throughout the world over the next two decades, and regularly collaborating with Lloyd Webber. With Lloyd Webber, he worked on the original 1984 London and 1987 Broadway productions of Starlight Express, the 1985 original Broadway production of Song and Dance, the 1986 London and 1988 Broadway productions of The Phantom of the Opera. In all productions of the show, the overture is partially pre- recorded, with the orchestra playing along with a track originally created by Levan using a Yamaha DX5 keyboard, in his home studio. He also collaborated with Lloyd Webber on the original 1989 London production of Aspects of Love, the 1991 revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the London Palladium, the original 1993 London and 1994 Broadway productions of Sunset Boulevard, the original 1998 London production of Whistle Down the Wind, the original 2000 London production of The Beautiful Game and international productions of Cats. His other credits include Little Shop of Horrors, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Blondel, Carrie, The Baker's Wife, Show Boat and Lautrec.\\"Martin Levan\\", \\"Really Useful Group\\", Accessed 26 July 2012 In 1988, while preparing the design for Aspects of Love, he developed the 'A-B System' to combat problems associated with the conventional method of combining multiple radio microphones systems on stage. Phase related interference patterns resulting in coloration and distortion in the sound system had hitherto been unavoidable but the use of the 'A-B System' effectively eliminated this phenomenon providing the audience with a much more natural, clearer and more focussed sound. Awards His original Broadway cast recording of Cats won a Grammy Award. Other awards include a NAACP Theatre Award for Best Sound Director for The Phantom of the Opera, a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Sound Design for Sunset Boulevard and a Jessie Richardson Theatre Award for Outstanding Design Team Achievement for Show Boat. Return to the Recording Studio In 1998, Martin conceived and built the Red Kite Studio music recording facility in Carmarthenshire, Wales. He continues to produce and record there. During 2010, he worked with Leeds- based guitarist and vocalist Tristan Mackay on some demo recordings before collaborating on his debut album Out Along the Wire which was released in February 2012, reaching No.1 on the iTunes Blues chart.

She was named in the British team for the women's basketball tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London having been fast-tracked into the senior side from the under-20s. The event is scheduled to take place between 28 July and 11 August with group stage matches being held at the Basketball Arena in the Olympic park and knock-out round matches at the North Greenwich Arena (also known as The O2 Arena). Her selection for the Olympics came after a 12-month period in which she was unable to play for the Harvard Crimson women's basketball team due to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) declaring her ineligible. Fagbenle had taken the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exam whilst at school in the UK and NCAA rules say that an athlete must be enrolled in college within two years of sitting for the exam; Fagbenle took an additional year to graduate from high school because she repeated a year after moving to the United States.

The end groups can also be part of a heterocycle or the double bonds part of an aromatic system: The methine dye subclasses are based on the these structural differences. Methine dyes can futhermore be classified as cationic, anionic or neutral. If one or more methine groups are replaced by a heteroatom - usually nitrogen - one speaks of heteroanalogous (aza-analogous) methine dyes.  General properties and classification  Methine dyes can be characterized as polyene dyes with terminal electron donating and accepting groups. In the majority of cases, these terminal groups contain nitrogen or oxygen atoms. However, while the naturally occurring polyene dyes (such as carotenoids) are limited to yellow to yellow-red tones, almost all colours of the spectrum can be achieved with the predominantly synthetic methine dyes. = Cyanine dyes = Example: C.I. Basic Red 12 The most well-known group of methine dyes are the cationic cyanine dyes. Both terminal groups of the chromophore contain nitrogen atoms, whereas the amino or imino group is part of a heterocycle. > allgemeine Struktur der Cyaninfarbstoffe > general structure of cyanine dyes = Hemicyanine dyes = Example: C.I. Basic Yellow 11 In the case of hemicyanine dyes, one terminal amino group is part of a heterocycle, while the second terminal group is open-chain. > allgemeine Struktur der Hemicyaninfarbstoffe > general structure of hemicyanine dyes = Streptocyanine dyes = If both terminal amino and imino groups of the chromophore are open chain, one speaks of streptocyanine dyes. > allgemeine Struktur der Streptocyaninfarbstoffe > general structure of streptocyanine dyes = Merocyanine dyes = Merocyanine dyes have an amino and a carbonyl group as end groups of the polyene structural element. Both a neutral and a zwitterionic resonance structure can be described for this compound type. > allgemeine Struktur der Merocyaninfarbstoffe > general structure of merocyanine dyes = Oxonol dyes = Example: Oxonol Blau Members of the oxonol dyes, whose terminal groups contain oxygen as heteroatom, play a role in analogue colour photography. > allgemeine Struktur der Oxonolfarbstoffe > general structure of oxonol dyes = Styryl dyes = By condensing an active methylene compound (e.g. malonic acid dinitrile) with a benzaldehyde derivative, styryl dyes are obtained. By integrating a benzene ring into the polyene part, these compounds have a styrene partial structure. Styryl dyes are used as disperse dyes in the dyeing of polyester fibers. Example: Preparation of C.I. Disperse Yellow 31 (3) by condensation of ethyl cyanoacetate (1) with a p-aminobenzaldehyde derivative. > Synthese von C.I. Disperse Yellow 31 (3) > Synthesis of C.I. Disperse Yellow 31 (3) = Di- and triarylmethine dyes = Also amino- and hydroxy-substituted di- and triarylmethines comprise the structural element of a methine dye: > Triarylmethinfarbstoffe, mesomere Grenzstrukturen (R=H, Alkyl) > Triarylmethine dyes, resonance structure (R=H, alkyl) Triarylmethine dyes are derived from triphenylmethane, in which at least two of the aromatic rings have electron-donating substituents (e.g. amino groups, secondary and tertiary alkylamino groups or hydroxy groups). They are therefore also referred to in older literature as triarylmethane dyes. For the dyes, resonance structure can be described as a carbenium ion or with an iminocyclohexadiene or cyclohexadienone partial structure. The central carbon atom in the dyes is therefore not sp3\\\\- but sp2-hybridized. Triarylmethine dyes usually show intensive, luminous colourings with different light fastness. In addition to dyeing and printing textiles, leather and paper, they are also used for printing inks, inks, ballpoint pen pastes and as microscopic dyes. As functional dyes, some representatives of this dye class are used as indicators (phenolphthalein), as disinfectants, anthelmintics and antifungals (e.g. malachite green, crystal violet). Examples: > File:Michlers Hydrole.svgMichlers Hydrol File:Auramine O Formula > V.1.svgC.I. Solvent Yellow 34 File:Phenolphthalein > Dianion.svgPhenolphthalein (pH 8,2-12) File:Basic Violet 14.svgC.I.

Basic Violet 3 (crystal violet)  Aza-analog methine dyes  If a methine group in a methine dye is replaced by a nitrogen atom, a azamethine dye is obtained (example: C.I. Basic Yellow 28). Accordingly, diazamethine dyes are obtained by replacing two methine groups with nitrogen atoms. Diazahemicyanine dyes (examples: C.I. Basic Red 22 and C.I. Basic Blue 41) in particular are an important class of methine dyes and are used as cationic dyes in the dyeing of polyacrylonitrile fibers. Examples: > Basic Yellow 28.svgC.I.

He became a professional magician at the age of 26 and worked at Davenport's magic shop for fifteen years. In 1950, he married Margaret Manzie, who died in 2003. Pat was the youngest of six siblings. He left behind his daughter Janette, son Jeremy and Grandson Robert. He appeared on The Paul Daniels Magic Show and was an uncredited consultant to the film Casino Royale. He worked as an advisor to Derren Brown and contributed to the children's magic show Wizbit. He appeared in, or advised films and television shows: the 2007 film Magicians, Agatha Cristie Poirot:The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim (1990), Heroes of Magic (2000), Tales of the Unexpected: Season 5, Episode 5 Stranger in Town (23 May 1982), Derren Brown Presents the 3D Magic Spectacular (2009). On his death Jack Delvin, president of The Magic Circle described him as the \\"magician's magician\\". Magician Wayne Dobson described him as a \\"great friend, mentor and magical adviser\\". Other magicians affirm Page's skills and legacy. Pat Page is known for his work on numerous magic tricks, including the Topit, Easy Money, The Miser's Dream and The Kitson Miracle. Pat also did \\"master classes\\" at a local venue in Holbern London (it was recently found out from several Magic circle members) In addition to inventing magic tricks, he published books and DVDS and advised professional magicians. Many of his routines are used by professional magicians including Doug Henning, Fred Kaps and Rafael Benatar. He wrote various books, including The Big Book of Magic and published articles in the magician's magazine Pabular. Topit The Topit was popularised by Pat Page. It is a utility item (a type of hidden pouch) that is used by a magician to conceal items or make them appear to vanish. Easy money This trick was invented by Pat Page. The effect is that blank pieces of paper are shown, the blank paper then appears to turn into paper money. This is a type of Bill Switch published as a DVD and in the book Magic Page by Page. Easy Money has been re-released by Greg Wilson, in the DVD Wilson attributes his method to Page.

The professional career of its initiator, Albert Guspi (1943-1985), an important innovator and central figure within the new photographic scene of the seventies, culminated in the creation of the CIFB. Despite its brief five-year existence, the CIFB became a reference in the reformation of photographic culture during the Spanish transition to democracy.Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona (1978-1983) at MACBA in Barcelona  History  In the heart of the Raval, at Carrer Aurora 11 bis, we can still find the building that once housed the Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona, CIFB. On its façade, an icon of the renovation of the neighbourhood, we can still see the paintings by Arranz Bravo and Bartolozzi, restored in 1997. The CIFB was a short-lived experiment in the process of institutionalisation of photographic culture during Spain's democratic Transition. The current study of this experiment, little known and almost forgotten despite its nearness in time and space, should be understood from a double perspective: local and global. On the one hand, this is a local study of a process that was taking place at an international level during the seventies: the re-composition of the cultural field within the new cultural industries following a post-industrial economic model. This was a moment of great expansion for the art market, with photography becoming part of it to an unprecedented degree. The seventies marked the beginning of a great international resurgence of institutions, festivals, academic programmes, galleries and publications that laid down the conditions for the interpenetration of culture and economy as it is known today. On the other hand, this is a study of how such generalised historical conditions took on a specific, local and very concrete form in the field of photography in Barcelona during the Transition. In this sense, the study sheds a different light on the period, allowing us to understand how disparate photographic practices and traditions, which have since become separate, were able to coexist at the time. The multiplicity of the seventies eventually lost ground when faced with a visualist conception of creative photography, whose hegemony began to establish itself after the Jornades Catalanes de Fotografia, which took place at the Fundació Joan Miró in 1980, and which, in retrospect, are still regarded as photography's official entry into the new cultural policies. The CIFB declined to take part in the Jornades.Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona (1978-1983)  References   Further reading  * Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona (1978-1983).

The site was opened in 1993 and closed in 2006; it contains nearly 9,000,000 cubic yards of waste.Photo taken on 8/25/2010 prior to constructionHickory Ridge Landfill taken from airplane during landing into Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on 6/21/2011 - during constructionPhoto of Hickory Ridge Landfill taken on 6/21/2011 while driving north on I-675 The Hickory Ridge Landfill was capped in October 2011 with a dual-purpose landfill closure system referred to as an Exposed Geomembrane Solar Cover (EGSC). Developed by Carlisle Energy Services, the closure system provides renewable electricity via (photovoltaic) solar panels, The project is the second installation of an EGSC and is the world's largest installed system of its kind. At the time of commissioning it was the largest solar photovoltaic system in the state of Georgia. It also represents a $5,000,000 investment by Republic Services supported by a $2,000,000 grant from the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA).  System Details  The landfill closure system features a green, 60-mil scrim reinforced TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin) geomembrane cover 48 acres in total. A one-megawatt photovoltaic solar panel array is located on the southwest and southeast slopes of the landfill in an area approximately ten acres. The one- megawatt solar array features over 7,000 flexible solar laminates, composed of 36 laminates bonded one at a time to 12' wide by 120' long panels. Each photovoltaic roll was rated at 5,184 Wp DC. The closure system meets infiltration and erosion criteria as prescribed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, while also capturing the methane gas that is generated by the landfill, turning it into energy in a separate operation. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division approved the landfill closure system as a \\"Final\\" closure system. The photovoltaic system is actually composed of four separate arrays located on the 3H:1V slopes on the southeast and southwest areas of the landfill. Each photovoltaic array is rated for approximately 250kWp DC each; each with a 260kWp DC inverter. The photovoltaic array is expected to generate 1,300,000 kWh in its first year of production.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Cuthbert, Aldingham, St Matthew, Dendron, and St Michael, Rampside. These churches are part of a group known as the Low Furness Group of Parishes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History There is evidence that a church existed on the site before the Norman conquest, but the earliest parts of the present church are found in the lower part of the tower and in the chancel and date from the 13th century. The chancel was lengthened in the 14th century, and the nave and north vestry date from this period. The tower was also heightened around this time, and the interior of the roof is dated 1598. A west gallery was installed in 1828. Plaster was stripped from the internal walls in 1911. In 2011 the church was restored, and a new heating system installed. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone rubble with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a south porch, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is as wide as the nave, and has a west doorway with a pointed arch. Above the doorway is a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery and a niche containing a sculpture of the Pietà. The three-light bell openings have louvres and straight heads. At the top of the tower is an embattled parapet. The walls of the tower are very thick, and contain a stairway inside the north wall. On the south side of the nave is a gabled porch with a round- headed doorway, over which is a quatrefoil. To the right of the porch are two- light Decorated windows, and a two-light mullioned window. On the north side are two-light straight-headed windows. The east window of the chancel has three lights. On the south side of the chancel are a lancet window, and a two- light Decorated window, and on the north side is a two-light Perpendicular window. The vestry has two-light windows on the east and west sides. =Interior= The Last Supper. Altar piece by James Cranke. Inside the church is a west gallery carried on pairs of Doric columns. Many of the fittings were carved by Alec Miller in the 1910s. The choir stalls and the organ case are carved with angels playing a variety of instruments. On the vestry door is a carving of the Annunciation. The rood screen has depictions of saints, and carries a plain cross. The reredos includes a painting by James Cranke, and is flanked by carved figures of Virgin Mary and Saint Michael. The three-decker pulpit dates from the 18th century, and has a tester of 1912, which consists of a scallop carried by putti. The pews are decorated with roses and scallops. A larger pew, known as the Gale Pew, has carvings of putti and flowers. The font is medieval, and is in the shape of a large egg-cup. Its cover dates from 1921, and is carved with various items linked to the sea. Two of the windows on the south side of the chancel contain fragments of medieval stained glass. In the south wall of the nave is a window known as the Maiden's window, which was made in 1912–13, and a window of 1931 depicting Doubting Thomas, made by Powells. Also in the church is a 13th-century coffin lid inscribed with a foliated cross, and memorial wall tablets dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The two-manual pipe organ is located on the north side of the chancel, and was built by Wilkinson of Kendal in about 1910. There is a ring of six bells, the oldest of which dates from about 1460. The next was cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall II of Gloucester. The other bells were both cast by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough, one in 1907. and the other in 1955.Two further bells have been added, The Four Sisters and The Centenary Bell both cast by John Taylor & Co. =Carved stones= When the plaster was stripped from the internal walls in 1911, an ancient carved stone was found incorporated in the wall. It is known as the Tunwinni Cross, and is carved with a panel containing runes, below which are two figures. The stone was dated by the antiquarian W. G. Collingwood to the 9th century. In 1909 another stone had been found, this one being a fragment of the cross-shaft dating possibly from the 10th century. External features In the churchyard are two structures that are listed at Grade II. To the south of the church is a monument to the Gale family with dates between 1816 and 1903. It consists of a sarcophagus with an urn finial, in a square enclosure surrounded by railings. Nearer the church is a sundial dated 1729. This consists of an inscribed square pier on a four-stepped base, with a round plate and gnomon.

Career  Throughout the 1990s Green worked for Network, the Council of Churches in Greater Manchester. She was instrumental in setting up a leaders' forum and a citywide prayer event, Prayer Network, which involved over 200 churches of many denominations working and praying together for the city. She co-ordinated citywide meetings which focused on issues such as crime, education and healthcare, with up to 2500 people attending these events. Stories from this season are captured in Green's book, City-Changing Prayer, co-authored with her husband, Frank Green. From 1997 to 2003 Green was on the National Council of the Evangelical Alliance. She was part of the co-ordinating team for More Than Gold, an initiative which brought people together for various citywide events during the Commonwealth Games in Manchester 2002. From 2002 to 2004 Green worked for Festival:Manchester (a joint initiative of The Message Trust and the Luis Palau Organisation), a venture which launched the church into social transformation projects across Manchester. Many of the projects were done in partnership with the Greater Manchester Police. Green was responsible for coordinating collaboration among 500 churches across the North West region. In the summer of 2008 Green hosted a high-profile community prayer event at the Velodrome National Cycling Centre in Manchester, where over 2000 Christians gathered for an evening of prayer about the issue of gang violence. The event was attended by police chiefs, community leaders and politicians. Later in 2008 Green organised a regional event, The Game of Life,\\"6000 head for Velodrome Event\\" which was attended by 6000 people at the Manchester Velodrome. Charities = City Links = Green officially launched her first charity, City Links, in 2003 at the end of Festival: Manchester in the Apollo Manchester. The group's aim was to continue networking churches and organisations for the purpose of prayer and mission, with a focus on the North-West of England. Through City Links three projects were launched: the North West Leaders' Forum, Redeeming the Arts and Redeeming Our Communities. = Redeeming Our Communities = In 2004 Green founded the charity Redeeming Our Communities (ROC), of which she is the National Director. This group aims to bring about community transformation by creating strategic partnerships which open up opportunities for crime and disorder reduction and improved community cohesion. Over the following years, stories of community transformation emerged across the nation, some of which were collected together for Green's 2008 book Redeeming Our Communities: 21st Century Miracles of Social Transformation. In recognition of her work towards community cohesion, she was awarded an OBE in June 2012. Green wrote a book titled ROC your World; transforming communities for good,ROC your World; transforming communities for good published by River Publishing in March 2014.  Other leadership roles  Green is on the leadership team of Ivy Manchester Church, a large church in South Manchester. Her speaking engagements include Spring Harvest, New Wine, Focusfest CLAN,CLAN as well many other conferences and community gatherings across the UK.

He played the small forward position for a career that spanned between 1999 and 2006 in which he played in numerous countries and leagues. Webber was also a standout college player for the College of Charleston (CofC) between 1995 and 1999.  College  Webber played for the CofC Cougars under head coach John Kresse between 1995–96 and 1998–99. During his four-year career he scored 1,267 points and 694 rebounds. As a junior in 1997–98 he was named the Trans-America Athletic Conference (TAAC) Co-Player of the Year after averaging 15.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. The TAAC changed its name in 2001 to the Atlantic Sun Conference. During the summer after his junior year, Webber was ticketed for trespassing and disorderly conduct when he was playing pick-up basketball in CofC's arena, then refused to leave the premises. His defense attorney proved that they were let in and authorized to play, and the charges were thrown out by a judge. Also between his junior and senior years, the College of Charleston switched athletic conferences and became members of the Southern Conference beginning in the 1998–99 school year. As a senior, Webber claimed his second straight conference player of the year award after leading the Cougars to their second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. He averaged 13.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game, all of which led CofC. By winning back-to-back player of the year awards, and due to CofC's conference switch, Webber joined Granger Hall as the second Division I men's basketball player to have won conference player of the year in two different Division I conferences (in 2013–14, Creighton's Doug McDermott became the third).  Professional  Webber did not get selected in the 1999 NBA Draft. His professional career thus began in the United States Basketball League for the Kansas Cagerz. Over the next seven seasons, Webber was somewhat of a journeyman, spending time in various leagues in the United States as well as Australia, the Philippines, Sweden, and Venezuela. His greatest success came while playing in the NBA Development League. Between 2001–02 and 2003–04, while playing for the North Charleston Lowgators and Columbus Riverdragons, Webber was twice named to the All-NBA Development League Team (2002, 2003). In each of those seasons he finished in the top five in scoring. For the 2002–03 season, he finished fifth in field goal attempts and sixth in total field goals, fifth in free throw attempts, third in total steals and steals per game, fifth in minutes per game, ninth in points per game and fifth in total points, third in minutes played, sixth in total offensive rebounds, tenth in total assists, and was the overall number one player with 50 total games played. He was considered the Lowgators' \\"go-to guy\\" that season, according to head coach Doug Marty. In 2003–04, Webber earned the NBDL Player of the Month Award for March 2004.

The book was published on March 12, 2012 by Delacorte Press and has been published in German, Greek, Dutch, Italian, French, Portuguese, Turkish and Spanish. The sequel is a book entitled Enders, with screen rights to the series currently being shopped. Price stated that she came up with the idea for the novel after trying to receive a flu shot; she was turned away due to a lack of available vaccines. Plot Starters takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles, where a biological weapon has killed everyone not vaccinated against it. The only ones that survive the attack are either under 20 or over 60 years of age, due to being given priority for the vaccine before the war. The term \\"Starters\\" refers to those under the age of 20, while \\"Enders\\" is used to describe the survivors over the age of 60. Because Starters are underage and not allowed to work, many of them are starving and desperate, not having funds to afford necessities. Some Starters have heard of an illegal way to earn money by allowing Enders to temporarily inhabit their bodies via a neurochip implanted by the Body Bank. Sixteen-year- old Callie is one such Starter, who has lived in abandoned buildings with her brother Tyler and friend Michael thus far to survive. When her temporary home is smoked out and cleared of people, she resorts to the creepy Body Bank in order to provide for the three of them. She is startled to awaken in the life of a rich Ender after her neurochip malfunctions. Callie initially relishes the chance to live a lavish life where she wants for nothing and even finds herself dating the grandson of a senator, but soon discovers that the Ender she's linked to has big plans to bring down the Body Bank, and not everyone she meets is what they seem. Reception Reception for Starters has been positive, with the Los Angeles Times calling it \\"well executed\\".

At the same tournament, she achieved her best Grand Slam singles performance by reaching the semifinals, which she lost in three sets to eventual winner Kea Bouman. At the 1927 Wimbledon Championships, she was defeated in the third round of the singles event in three sets by Phoebe Holcroft. In doubles, she and Bowder Peacock reached the final, but lost to the American couple Helen Wills and Elizabeth Ryan in straight sets. In 1929, on her second European trip, Heine won the singles title at the Irish Open, defeating compatriot Billie Tapscott in three sets. In addition, she won the British Hard Court Championships, emerging victorious from a closely fought three-sets final against Joan Ridley that lasted two hours. At the 1929 French Championships, she was seeded second in the singles event and was beaten in the quarterfinal by Cilly Aussem in three sets. She and Alida Neave were runners-up in the doubles, losing the final to Kea Bouman and Lilí Álvarez in straight sets. At Wimbledon that year, she reached the singles quarterfinal, losing to world no. 1 and eventual champion Helen Wills in two sets. She missed the 1930 Wimbledon Championships due to a scheduling disagreement with the South African Lawn Tennis Union. In the summer of 1938, she toured Europe for the third and final time, captaining the South African women team. In June, she lost the final of the Weybridge tournament in straight sets to Alice Marble. She won the singles and doubles titles at the Dutch Championships in July, defeating Nancye Wynne in the singles final in two sets. Heine did not participate in the French Championships and lost in the fourth round of singles at Wimbledon, again to Wills, in a closely fought two-set match. In doubles, she teamed up with countrywoman Margaret Morphew to reach the semifinal, where eventual champions Sarah Fabyan and Alice Marble prevailed in two sets. Heine (Miller) won the South African Championships singles title on five occasions (1928, 1931, 1932, 1936 and 1937). Additionally, she won six doubles titles (1930, 1931, 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1947) and five mixed doubles titles (1930, 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939). A final scheduled visit to Wimbledon in 1947 ended prematurely when her plane crashed in Egypt. All passengers survived and Heine-Miller sustained only minor leg injuries, but her tennis gear was largely lost. Personal life On 6 April 1931, she married farmer Harry Miller (and took the surname Heine-Miller) in Pietermaritzburg and the couple had a son and a daughter. Her husband died at the end of World War II in northern Africa during a routine operation to have his tonsils removed. In 1978, she emigrated to Australia, where her children were living, and celebrated her 100th birthday in Canberra in 2009. In 2016, at age 106, she was one of Canberra's oldest citizens. Miller died on 31 July 2016 at the age of 106.

Esperanza married Bavarian diplomat, Friedrich Freiherr Truchseß von Wetzhausen. Esperanza's maternal grandparents, Prince Aleksei Lobanov-Rostovsky and his wife Countess Kucheleff. Family and childhood  Esperanza was a member of the Basque noble family of Sarachaga.Becke-Klüchtzner, Edwund von der, Stamtafeln des Adels des Grossherzogtums Baden, Baden Baden 1886, p 399 ,Russian genealogical collection volume 1-4, 1841 by Peter Dolgorukov While it is unclear whether family had a listing in the Almanach de Gotha's publications, when Esperanza married into a Gotha family she was referred to with one of her family's hereditary titles of Baroness. Her paternal grandmother, Maria Micaela de Uria y Alcedo, who married Florentino de Sarachaga, had been a courtier during the Spanish reign of Joseph Bonaparte.Euskomedia She left Spain for Karlsruhe in 1813 with a Baden general in French service, Carl von Lasollaye, and accompanied by her children, one of whom became Spera's father Jorge. After the death of her husband who had been left behind in Spain, she married Lasollaye.Congreso Internacional de las Ciencias Genealógica y Heráldica, Volume 2, pp 349-350 In 1833, Esperanza’s mother became a maid of honour to Empress Alexandra Fjodorovna. She was the eldest daughter of Russian Prince Aleksey Aleksandrovich Lobanov-Rostovsky and his wife Countess Alexandra Grigorievna Kucheleff. Doña Esperanza’s father and mother met in St. Petersburg as children, although he eventually joined the military service in Baden. Esperanza would later write that her childhood was happy, but that it was also very sad because by the time she was almost ten years old she had lost both her parents and her grandfather. When Esperanza was six years old, she and her brother inherited her father’s fortune upon his death in a duel with Moritz von Haber in 1843. Haber was a Jewish banker who, according to a group of aristocratic army officers to which Jorge belonged, had an undue influence on the Grand Ducal house. A series of duels followed, in the final one of which Jorge was a victim.Blick in die Geschichte Nr. 77 vom 21.

She was summoned to and joined the Russian imperial court at the age of sixteen. She and her brother spent their childhood apart between Russia, France, Norway, and Spain. Alexis, together with the Jesuit Victor Drevon, later became the founder of the Hiéron du Val d'Or, a Roman Catholic esoteric political cabal that sought to prepare the political landscape in Europe for the second coming and reign of Christ. They also founded the Musée du HiéronPolitica Hermetica, Les contrées secretes, pp 79 - 101 Marriage Doña Esperanza wed Bavarian diplomat Friedrich Freiherr Truchseß von Wetzhausen on 15 July 1862. Esperanza first met Wetzhausen when he was working as a diplomat at the Russian court, and they were married soon after. During their marriage she often took him back to Bilbao, Spain to visit her family. Once, when they were newly-wed, she took her new husband on a long hiking trip in Spain where they came upon a beautiful country palace. Her husband loved it and said that he wanted to know more about the owners because he was going to buy it for her. The gardener was the one to reveal to him that Esperanza was the owner all along. Prince Philipp zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld commented that Esperanza was considered, at age 44, to have beauty, generosity and intelligence. The couple remained childless. In 1885, Doña Esperanza and her brother became guardians of their recently orphaned family members, Don Ricardo de Sarachaga y Arribalzaga and Doña Gloria de Sarachaga y Arribalzaga. Esperanza died in Cannes, France on January 28, 1914.Archives Journaux Ville Cannes Diplomacy and politics As a courtier she had friends in many circles. Sometimes her friends had loyalties to governments in conflict with each other. Philipp zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld relays that when Esperanza found out that King Ludwig II of Bavaria was about to be institutionalized for mental illness, she attacked the commission that came to get him at the entrance to Neuschwanstein Castle, protesting and flailing at the men with her umbrella. She then rushed to the king’s apartments to identify the conspirators. Ludwig had the commissioners arrested, but after holding them captive for several hours, released them, and was taken into their custody.

Spector (born , in New York City) is a cell and molecular biologist best recognized for his research on gene expression and nuclear dynamics. He is currently a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and head of the Gene Regulation and Cell Proliferation program of the CSHL Cancer Center. Since 2007, he has served as director of research of CSHL. Education and faculty positions Spector received a Bachelor of Science degree from City College of New York in 1973, a master's degree from Herbert H. Lehman College in 1977, and a Ph.D.in cell biology from Rutgers University in 1980. After completing his Ph.D. he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. In 1985 he relocated to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and has been promoted through the ranks to his current position of professor. In 2007 he was appointed director of research. Professional activities Spector is a pioneer in unraveling our understanding of the inner workings of the cell nucleus. His early investigations centered on the unusual chromosome structure of dinoflagellates. Recent studies in his laboratory are focused on examining the organization and regulation of gene expression in living mammalian cells. His laboratory has developed approaches to elucidate the spatial and temporal aspects of gene expression and in identifying and characterizing the function of nuclear retained long non-coding RNAs. His most seminal research accomplishments include the direct visualization in living cells of the recruitment of factors involved in gene expression to active genes; the development of a biochemical fractionation approach to purify a sub-nuclear domain (nuclear speckles) and characterize its protein constituents; the development of a live cell imaging system to visualize a stably integrated genetic locus and follow in real-time its mRNA and protein products; the elucidation of a rapid-response mechanism of regulating gene expression through RNA nuclear retention; identification of a mechanism by which a single genetic locus can produce a long nuclear retained non-coding RNA and a small cytoplasmic tRNA-like transcript, the identification and characterization of a long nuclear retained non-coding RNA that is involved in organizing a sub- nuclear organelle (paraspeckles), and determining that knockout or knockdown of the lncRNA Malat1 results in the differentiation of mammary tumors and a significant reduction in metastasis. In addition, Spector has co-edited numerous microscopy techniques manuals (i.e. Basic Methods in Microscopy, Live Cell Imaging: A Laboratory Manual), and a treatise of The Nucleus, that are used in laboratories throughout the world.

Gustave Brisgand C.C. van Asch van Wijck became an active member of the 1920s Hague (Den Haag) artist community both as a model and as a sculptor. Cox modeled for the artists of her day such as the French painter and pastelist , the sculptor and her Professor Toon Dupuis, and Piet van der Hem. On 7 August 1930, Cox married Hendrik Gerard Johan \\"Henri\\" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag (Zutphen 16 October 1891, Utrecht 18 December 1955), Henri was the Lord Protector (heer beschermer) of the village of Zoelen a rural community in the Betuwe only accessible by river ferries.Groot, Marjan. \\"Vrouwen in de vormgeving in Nederland, 1880-1940\\" Uitgeverij 010, Rotterdam, 2007. p. 454. Neither the remoteness of her new home nor her married status stopped Cox from making regular trips to The Hague, to the beach at Scheveningen, to Leerdam, to Gouda etc. either with Henri or by herself. At Soelen she set up her atelier in the gatehouse. On 18 September 1932 C.C. van Asch van Wijck gave birth to a son, Johan Adolph \\"Dolph\\" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag, Oud and Niew Hinklenoord whom she named for her youngest sister. She did not survive the birth. She was laid to rest in the Church cemetery of the Reformed Church (Hervormde kerk) of Zoelen in presence of the whole village and all its notables, as well as many friends and relatives, two carriages were needed for the wreaths alone. After the benediction \\"The Lord Völcker van Soelen thanked all present for the extraordinary large turnout and, turning to the grave, he said the words: 'Farewell, darling treasure, who was my everything'\\".

Works As a sculptor, C.C. van Ash van Wijk's most widely known work is connected with the Glassworks at Leerdam (Leerdam Glasfabriek). In 1929 she proposed her sculpture of a Woman's Mask to Petrus Marinus Cochius director of the Glassworks. The design was approved and went into production. It came in two versions; clear and frosted, some of the glass masks were completed with a wooden base. It was groundbreaking for the Glassworks, they were adding pure art to their line of functional items, in addition to C. C. van Asch van Wijck, the Glassworks had engaged Lucienne Bloch - later well known for her Murals - who created her glass animals (a lioness, a duck etc.).Groot, Marjan. \\"Vrouwen in de vormgeving in Nederland, 1880-1940\\" Uitgeverij 010, Rotterdam, 2007. p. 461. Her work inspired by earlier Glassworks contributor Steph Uiterwaal's Madonna with Child(1928). There was a bit of a buzz in the Dutch art world over creating and in glass and with industrial means. C. C. van Asch van Wijck's mask was part of an exposition in \\"de Olde Munte\\" in Arnhem and was well received in de Arnhemsche Courant.Arnhemsche Courant, \\"Stadsniews\\" 3 August 1929 In 1930 it won a gold medal at the Wereldtentoonstelling voor Kolonien, Zeevaart en Vlaamse Kunst in Antwerpen (Belgium) (World Fair for Colonies, Navigation, and Flemish Art).F.

She created a flying maiden, \\"Anunciata\\", standing in a large round tassa in satinated cream. She signed it with her new monogram adding to her initials the V S of Völcker van Soelen.

It can be considered an interface between a mailer (MTA, Mail Transfer Agent) and one or more content filters. Amavis can be used to: * detect viruses, spam, banned content types or syntax errors in mail messages * block, tag, redirect (using sub-addressing), or forward mail depending on its content, origin or size * quarantine (and release), or archive mail messages to files, to mailboxes, or to a relational database * sanitize passed messages using an external sanitizer * generate DKIM signatures * verify DKIM signatures and provide DKIM-based whitelisting Notable features: * provides SNMP statistics and status monitoring using an extensive MIB with more than 300 variables * provides structured event log in JSON format * IPv6 protocol is supported in interfacing, and IPv6 address forms in mail header section * properly honors per-recipient settings even in multi-recipient messages, while scanning a message only once. * supports international email (RFC 6530, SMTPUTF8, EAI, IDN) A common mail filtering installation with Amavis consists of a Postfix as an MTA, SpamAssassin as a spam classifier, and ClamAV as an anti-virus protection, all running under a Unix-like operating system. Many other virus scanners (about 30) and some other spam scanners (CRM114, DSPAM, Bogofilter) are supported, too, as well as some other MTAs.  Interfacing topology  Three topologies for interfacing with an MTA are supported. The amavisd process can be sandwiched between two instances of an MTA, yielding a classical after-queue mail filtering setup, or amavisd can be used as an SMTP proxy filter in a before-queue filtering setup, or the amavisd process can be consulted to provide mail classification but not to forward a mail message by itself, in which case the consulting client remains in charge of mail forwarding. This last approach is used in a Milter setup (with some limitations), or with a historical client program amavisd-submit. Since version 2.7.0 a before-queue setup is preferred, as it allows for a mail message transfer to be rejected during an SMTP session with a sending client. In an after-queue setup filtering takes place after a mail message has already been received and enqueued by an MTA, in which case a mail filter can no longer reject a message, but can only deliver it (possibly tagged), or discard it, or generate a non-delivery notification, which can cause unwanted backscatter in case of bouncing a message with a fake sender address. A disadvantage of a before-queue setup is that it requires resources (CPU, memory) proportional to a current (peak) mail transfer rate, unlike an after- queue setup, where some delay is acceptable and resource usage corresponds to average mail transfer rate. With introduction of an option smtpd_proxy_options=speed_adjust in Postfix 2.7.0 the resource requirements for a before-queue content filter have been much reduced. In some countries the legislation does not permit mail filtering to discard a mail message once it has been accepted by an MTA, so this rules out an after-queue filtering setup with discarding or quarantining of messages, but leaves a possibility of delivering (possibly tagged) messages, or rejecting them in a before-queue setup (SMTP proxy or milter).  Interfacing protocols  Amavis can receive mail messages from an MTA over one or more sockets of protocol families PF_INET (IPv4), PF_INET6 (IPv6) or PF_LOCAL (Unix domain socket), using protocols ESMTP, LMTP, or a simple private protocol AM.PDP can be used with a helper program like amavisd-milter to interface with milters. On the output side protocols ESMTP or LMTP can be used to pass a message to a back-end MTA instance or to an LDA, or a message can be passed to a spawned process over a Unix pipe. When ESMTP or LMTP are used, a session can optionally be encrypted using a TLS STARTTLS (RFC 3207) extension to the protocol. SMTP Command Pipelining (RFC 2920) is supported in client and server code.  Interfacing with SpamAssassin  When spam scanning is enabled, a daemon process amavisd is conceptually very similar to a spamd process of a SpamAssassin project. In both cases forked child processes call SpamAssassin Perl modules directly, hence their performance is similar. The main difference is in protocols used: Amavis typically speaks a standard ESMTP protocol to an MTA, while in the spamc/spamd case an MTA typically spawns a spamc program passing a message to it over a Unix pipe, then the spamc process transfers the message to a spamd daemon using a private protocol, and spamd then calls SpamAssassin Perl modules.  Design priorities  Design priorities of the amavisd-new (from here on just called Amavis) are: reliability, security, adherence to standards, performance, and functionality. = Reliability = With the intention that no mail message could be lost due to unexpected events like I/O failures, resources depletion and unexpected program terminations, the amavisd program meticulously checks a completion status of every system call and I/O operation. Unexpected events are logged if at all possible, and handled with several layers of event handling. Amavis never takes a responsibility for a mail message delivery away from an MTA: the final success status is reported to an MTA only after the message has been passed on to the back-end MTA instance and reception was confirmed. In case of any fatal failures during processing or transferring of a message, the message being processed just stays in a queue of the front-end MTA instance, to be re-tried later. This approach also covers potential unexpected host failures, crashes of the amavisd process or one of its components. The use of program resources like memory size, file descriptors, disk usage and creation of subprocesses is controlled. Large mail messages are not kept in memory, so the available memory size does not impose a limit on the size of mail messages that can be processed, and memory resources are not wasted unnecessarily. = Security = A great deal of attention is given to security aspects, required by handling potentially malicious, nonstandard or just garbled data in mail messages coming from untrusted sources. The process which is handling mail messages runs with reduced privileges under a dedicated user ID. Optionally it can run chroot-ed. Risks of buffer overflows and memory allocation bugs is largely avoided by implementing all protocol handling and mail processing in Perl, which handles dynamic memory management transparently. Care is taken that content of processed messages does not inadvertently propagate to the system. Perl provides an additional security safety net with its marking of tainted data originating from the wild, and Amavis is careful to put this Perl feature to good use by avoiding automatic untainting of data (use re \\"taint\\") and only untainting it explicitly at strategic points, late in a data flow. Amavis can use several external programs to enhance its functionality. These are de- archivers, de-compressors, virus scanners and spam scanners. As these programs are often implemented in languages like C or C++, there is a potential risk that a mail message passed to one of these programs can cause its failure or even open a security hole. The risk is limited by running these programs as an unprivileged user ID, and possibly chroot-ed. Nevertheless, external programs like unmaintained de-archivers should be avoided. The use of these external programs is configurable, and they can be disabled selectively or as a group (like all decoders or all virus scanners). = Performance = Despite being implemented in an interpreted programming language Perl, Amavis itself is not slow. The good performance of the functionality implemented by Amavis itself (not speaking of external components) is achieved by dealing with data in large chunks (e.g. not line-by-line), by avoiding unnecessary data copying, by optimizing frequently traversed code paths, by using suitable data structures and algorithms, as well as by some low-level optimizations. Bottlenecks are detected during development by profiling code and by benchmarking. Detailed timing report in the log can help recognize bottlenecks in a particular installation. Certain external modules or programs like SpamAssassin or some command-line virus scanners can be very slow, and using these would constitute a vast majority of elapsed time and processing resources, making resources used by Amavis itself proportionally quite small. Components like external mail decoders, virus scanners and spam scanners can each be selectively disabled if they are not needed. What remains is functionality implemented by Amavis itself, like transferring mail message from and to an MTA using an SMTP or LMTP protocol, checking mail header section validity, checking for banned mail content types, verifying and generating DKIM signatures. As a consequence, mail processing tasks like DKIM signing and verification (with other mail checking disabled) can be exceptionally fast and can rival implementations in compiled languages. Even full checks using a fast virus scanner but with spam scanning disabled can be surprisingly fast. = Adherence to standards = Implementation of protocols and message structures closely follows a set of applicable standards such as RFC 5322, RFC 5321, RFC 2033, RFC 3207, RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3463, RFC 3464, RFC 4155, RFC 5965, RFC 6376, RFC 5451, RFC 6008, and RFC 4291. In several cases some functionality was re-implemented in the Amavis code even though a public (CPAN) Perl module exists, but lacks attention to detail in following a standard or lacks sufficient checking and handling of errors.  License  Amavis is licensed under a GPLv2 license. This applies to the current code, as well as to historical branches. An exception to this are some of the supporting programs (like monitoring and statistics reporting), which are covered by a New BSD License.  The project  The project started in 1997 as a Unix shell script to detect and block e-mail messages containing a virus. It was intended to block viruses at the MTA (mail transfer agent) or LDA (local delivery) stage, running on a Unix-like platform, complementing other virus protection mechanisms running on end-user personal computers. Next the tool was re-implemented as a Perl program, which later evolved into a daemonized process. A dozen of developers took turns during the first five years of the project, developing several variants while keeping a common goal, the project name and some of the development infrastructure. Since December 2008 (until 2018-10-09) the only active branch was officially amavisd-new, which was being developed and maintained by Mark Martinec since March 2002. This was agreed between the developers at the time in a private correspondence: Christian Bricart, Lars Hecking, Hilko Bengen, Rainer Link and Mark Martinec. The project name Amavis is largely interchangeable with the name of the amavisd-new branch. Much functionality has been added through the years, like adding protection against spam and other unwanted content, besides the original virus protection. The focus is kept on reliability, security, adherence to standards and performance. A domain amavis.org in use by the project was registered in 1998 by Christian Bricart, one of the early developers, who is still maintaining the domain name registration. The domain is now entirely dedicated to the only active branch. The project mailing list was moved from SourceForge to amavis.org in March 2011, and is hosted by Ralf Hildebrandt and Patrick Ben Koetter. The project web page and the main distribution site was located at the Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia (until the handover in 2018), where most of the development was taking place between years 2002 and 2018. = Change of Project Leaders Announcement = On October 9 of 2018 Mark Martinec announced at the general support and discussion mailing list his retirement from the project and also that Patrick Ben Koetter will continue as new project leader. After that Patrick notified the migration of the source code to a public GitLab repository and his plan for the next steps regarding the project development.  Branches and the project name  Through the history of the project the name of the project or its branches varied somewhat. Initially the spelling of the project name was AMaViS (A Mail Virus Scanner), introduced by Christian Bricart. With a rewrite to Perl the name of the program was Amavis-perl. Daemonized versions were initially distributed under a name amavisd-snapshot and then as amavisd. A modular rewrite by Hilko Bengen was called Amavis-ng. In March 2002 the amavisd-new branch was introduced by Mark Martinec, initially as a patch against amavisd-snapshot-20020300.

They married in 1959 and she set up residence in Madrid. They have three children, Maria, Ana and Patricia. In 1967 Helga de Alvear met Juana Mordó and began what would later turn into her art collection. She came into contact with artists from the Cuenca group and from the El Paso group and she became increasingly interested in the Spanish art scene. In January 1980 she started to work at the Juana Mordó gallery. Here, she was able to hone her knowledge about the international art scene. Galería Helga de Alvear  Helga de Alvear continued to be involved in the Juana Mordó gallery for the next 4 years, and in 1984, when Mordó died, she took the helm. Over the next 10 years she followed in the artistic and professional footsteps of her mentor. In 1995, she decided to take a turn in her career by opening a new gallery under her own name in a space measuring more than 900 square meters next to the Reina Sofía Museum. Many of her projects championed international contemporary art with a special emphasis on photography, video and installation – at a time when these mediums were practically unknown in Spain. Today, Helga de Alvear's project is one of the best-established and longest-running art galleries on the Spanish scene. and it has earned widespread international acclaim. Helga de Alvear was awarded the Medal of Extremadura in 2007, the Gold Medal for Merit in the category of Fine Arts (bestowed by the Spanish Ministry of Culture) in 2008, the Medal of Cáceres in 2011 and Fundación Arte y Mecenazgo Award in the category of Collector in 2012.

At the present time her Collection includes more than 2,500 pieces by Spanish and international artists. The Collection will be donated to the Regional Government of Extremadura and the Centre of Visual Arts is currently being built in the city of Cáceres to house it. The mission of the Collection is also to contribute to public awareness about art and it often loans out works to institutions around the world.

He wrote numerous works on many and varied topics and several books of his works were published. These include :- # Miscellaneous Poems by David Hobkirk, 1828, which was reprinted in 2011 #The Florentine Brothers and other poems, 1832. A review of which, published in The Athenæum Journal of 1832, suggested that \\"Some of his works are fuller of words than of meaning ... he be advised to lay the scene of his next poem near Newcastle, and make his characters out of the ladies and gentlemen around; he will find all he wants, without wetting his feet in long excursions ... but because we dislike his theme, we are not about to cut up his verses: we have no such intentions, in truth we think many of his strains very sweet and beautiful….\\".

She is the co-founder of 3D software development company Geomagic, and was its chief executive officer until February 2013 when the company was acquired by 3D Systems Inc. , she is the Vice President and Chief Entrepreneur Officer at 3D Systems. Fu grew up in China during the Cultural Revolution and moved to the United States in 1984. She co-founded Geomagic in 1997 with her then-husband Herbert Edelsbrunner, and has been recognized for her achievements with the company through a number of awards, including being named Inc. magazine's 2005 \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\". In 2013, she published her memoir, Bend, Not Break, co-authored with MeiMei Fox.https://www.amazon.com/Bend-Not-Break-Life- Worlds/dp/1591846811  Early life and education Ping Fu was born in 1958 in Nanjing, China, where her father was a professor at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). Fu spent her childhood and early adulthood in China. She grew up during the Cultural Revolution, during which she was separated from both her parents for several years. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, she attended the college that later became the Suzhou University studying Chinese literature. Fu has related in interviews and in her memoir that she chose to research China's one-child policy for her thesis and traveled to the countryside, where she found that infanticide of female infants was common, as was abortion, even late into pregnancy. Fu said that, after turning in her research, she believes it was passed to a newspaper editor who wrote an editorial on the infanticide of female children. Fu has stated that she was later briefly imprisoned by government officials and was told to leave the country. After this event, she left school, without graduating. Fu left China and arrived in the United States in January 1984. She initially enrolled at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque but later moved to San Diego to study computer science as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. During her time in San Diego, Fu worked part-time at a software company called Resource Systems Group as a programmer and database software consultant. Following her graduation from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in computer science, she moved to Illinois, where she took a job with Bell Labs. The company offered a Ph.D assistance program, through which Fu enrolled in the computer science Ph.D program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). At UIUC she completed a master's degree in computer science. Career =National Center for Supercomputing Applications= In the early 1990s, Fu began working at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at UIUC. Her focus was on computer graphics and visualization, including projects such as developing the morphing software for animation of the liquid metal T-1000 robot in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. While at NCSA, she hired student researcher Marc Andreessen and was his supervisor on the project developing NCSA's Mosaic, an early multimedia web browser credited with popularizing the World Wide Web. According to her supervisor, Joseph Hardin, Fu was one of the managers involved in the discussions from which the idea for the browser was developed. In 1994 Ping took a temporary position at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, returning to NCSA in 1995. =Geomagic= In 1996, Marc Andreessen's success with his own company, Netscape, inspired UIUC to encourage entrepreneurship and Fu developed the idea for a company that would combine manufacturing and digital technology, including 3D modeling software, the concept of which she called the \\"Personal Factory\\". She founded Geomagic with her then-husband, Herbert Edelsbrunner, whose research formed the basis for the initial software to be developed by the company. In 1997, she left the NCSA to begin operations at Geomagic, taking on the role of CEO. The company was originally named Raindrop Geomagic and was based in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. It was founded with the aim of developing 3D imaging software that could enable customized manufacturing using 3D printers. Initially, Fu and Edelsbrunner funded Geomagic themselves, along with investment from Fu's sister Hong and her husband, and later from a group of angel investors. In 1999, Fu relocated Geomagic from Illinois to the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. That year, Franklin Street Partners committed to invest $6.5 million in Geomagic. Fu then hired an experienced executive as CEO who ran Geomagic for two years before stepping down when the company was close to bankruptcy. Fu returned to the role of CEO in 2001, investing her own money into Geomagic and working without a salary in order to continue paying the company's employees. She was able to lead Geomagic back to stability, gaining a significant contract with Align Technology, and Geomagic returned to profitability over the following two years. From 2001 to 2003, Geomagic's sales tripled under Fu's leadership. The company became known as a leader in digital shape sampling and processing. After she and Edelsbrunner divorced, he continued to serve as an advisor at Geomagic. In February 2013, Fu sold Geomagic to 3D Systems Corporation, a 3D printing company. She became the Chief Strategy Officer and Vice-President of 3D Systems. =Other roles= In addition to leading Geomagic, Fu has held a number of advisory roles relating to technology and entrepreneurship and with charitable organizations. She has served on the U.S. National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship since 2010 and is also a member of the National Council on Women in Technology. In 2012, she was appointed to the board of the Long Now Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on long-term thinking and enduring technology. She also serves on the board of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina, the board of Live Nation Entertainment and is an advisor at Modern Meadow, an organization focused on tissue engineering. Memoir On December 31, 2012, Fu published a memoir, Bend, Not Break: A Life in Two Worlds. Co-authored with MeiMei Fox, the book told the stories of her life, from her early childhood in China to her experiences as an entrepreneur, including founding and leading Geomagic. The book received positive reviews from outlets including The Wall Street Journal and Oprah.com. Beginning in January 2013, commentors in the Amazon.com reviews for the memoir began posting critical reviews, accusing Fu of lying about events in her past. Around the same time, first in English, then in Chinese on Forbes China, Forbes published an interview with Fu that discussed Fu's memoir and her early life, which contained an inaccurate interpretation of where Ping Fu lived during the cultural revolution. Chinese netizens responded to the piece with criticisms regarding alleged fabrication of events and inconsistencies in media coverage of Fu, which raised questions in the media about the veracity of details included in the memoir. Chinese blogger Fang Zhouzi was among the critics and he later raised further questions and criticisms based on earlier media coverage of Fu. Following the initial criticisms from Fang Zhouzi and other critics, commentors appearing to be non-native English speakers knowledgeable about Chinese history posted hundreds of negative comments in the memoir's Amazon.com reviews, leading The Daily Beast and New York Times to conclude that Ping was the subject of an online attack. Fu responded to the criticisms through a public statement, and a post on the Huffington Post website answering questions that were raised about her childhood, education and being forced to leave China. She acknowledged that there were some inaccuracies in the book. She also acknowledged that the Red Guard atrocity she related in the memoir and media interviews regarding a teacher being pulled apart by four horses may have been an emotional memory, the result of hearing tales of such barbarity in old China as a child and having nightmares about it, or seeing it in a movie, rather than actually seeing it. In response to questions about accuracy of details in the book, her publisher stated that the book is a memoir, rather than a journalistic account of the Cultural Revolution. Fu has said that a second print of the memoir will correct inaccuracies that have been pointed out.  Awards and recognitions  For her work with Geomagic, Fu has received a number of awards. In 2003 she was named the Ernst & Young \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" for the Carolinas and received the Entrepreneurial Inspiration Award from North Carolina's Council for Entrepreneurial Development. The following year, Fast Company named her a 2004 \\"Fast 50\\" winner. In 2005, Inc. magazine named Ping its \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\". The America China Business Women’s Alliance awarded Fu its \\"Business Innovation Award\\" in 2008 and she received the 2010 \\"Leadership Award\\" from the CAD Society. The next year, she was given a \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" award by the Triangle Business Journal. In 2011 she was given the William C. Friday Award at North Carolina State University, and in 2012, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services named Fu as an \\"Outstanding American by Choice\\".

Life He was born in 1642 and died in 1699. He was a professor of morals and eloquence for twenty-four years. Works Illustration from De arte excerpendi (\\"Art of Excerpting\\"), 1689 He is chiefly remembered for his work \\"The Art of Excerpting\\" which in its day could be considered to be a precursor to the computer hard disk. Cf. Alberto Cevolini, De arte excerpendi. Imparare a dimenticare nella prima modernità. Florence, Leo S. Olschki, 2006. Several of his works have been auctioned for huge sums by Christie's. Excerpts John Gorton's General Biographical Dictionary provides the following information about Vincent Placcius: Vincent Placcius, a learned jurist, was born at Hamburg in 1642. He studied at Helmstadt, and after travelling in France and Italy, he returned to his native city, where he practiced at the bar, and was appointed professor of morals and eloquence, which post he held until his death in 1699. His principal work is a curious bibliographical piece respecting anonymous and pseudonymous writers, entitled \\"De Scriptis et Scriptoribus anonymis atque pseudonymis Syntagma\\". Alexander Chalmers' General Biographical Dictionary provides the following information about Vincent Placcius: Vincent Placcius was an eminent philologer of Hamburgh, where he was born in 1642, completed his studies at Helmstadt and Leipzig, and improved his talents by travelling in France and Italy. When he returned, he applied himself to the bar, and afterwards became professor of morals and eloquence, in which situation he continued twenty-four years. He was beloved by his pupils, and when he died, April 6, 1699, regretted by his countrymen in general, who had considered him as an oracle. His works are, 1. “A Dictionary of anonymous and pseudonymous Authors,” published in 1708, in 2 vols. folio, by the care of Fabricius a curious work, but abounding with faults, 2. “De jurisconsulto perito Liber,” 1693, 8vo. 3. “Carmina juvenilia,” Amst. 1667, 12mo. 4. “De arte excerpendi,” Hamburgh, 1689, 8vo, with several others, all testifying, and abundantly proving, his talents and erudition.

He made his MLB debut in 2015. Before signing with the Twins, he played for Buchbinder Legionäre Regensburg of Bundesliga. He is left- handed. He holds the record for home runs hit in a career by a German-born player. Early life Kepler was born in Berlin, Germany. His parents, Kathy Kepler and Marek Różycki, were both professional ballet dancers; they met when they performed in the same ballet company in Berlin. His mother is from San Antonio, Texas, while his father is from Poland. He has one sister. At the age of six, Kepler started baseball at the Little League level with the John F. Kennedy School in Berlin. Though he received a scholarship at age seven to the Steffi Graf Tennis Foundation, he decided he preferred baseball. Kepler attended John F. Kennedy School, and the St. Emmeram Academy in Regensburg in 2008, where he was able to train in baseball more than the average American teenager. He played association football with Hertha BSC, and played baseball for Buchbinder Legionäre Regensburg of Bundesliga, the highest baseball league in Germany. .  Minor Leagues  Andy Johnson, an international scout working for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB), first noticed Kepler when he played in a junior national tournament at the age of 14. At the age of 16, he signed with the Twins in 2009 for US$800,000, the largest signing bonus given by an MLB franchise to a European-born player. Kepler made his American debut in the Rookie-level in 2010 Gulf Coast League (GCL) with the GCL Twins. He was promoted to the Elizabethton Twins of the Rookie-Advanced Appalachian League in 2011. He was assigned to Elizabethton for the 2012 season. An elbow injury delayed the start of Kepler's 2013 season, when he was assigned to the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Class A Midwest League. Following the regular season, the Twins assigned Kepler to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League. After the 2013 season, the Twins added Kepler to their 40-man roster and he was invited to spring training. Kepler played for the Fort Myers Miracle of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2014, and opened the 2015 season with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class AA Southern League. Kepler was selected to represent the Twins at the 2015 All-Star Futures Game, though a sore shoulder prevented him from playing. Kepler finished the 2015 season with a .327 batting average, nine home runs and 18 stolen bases. He was named Southern League Player of the Year.  Major League Career  The Twins promoted Kepler to the major leagues on September 21, 2015 the night after the Lookouts won the Southern League championship. He made his major league debut on September 27, 2015 and recorded his first hit on October 4, 2015. After Donald Lutz, Kepler is the second German-developed player to play in the modern Major Leagues. The Twins assigned Kepler to the Rochester Red Wings of the Class AAA International League to start the 2016 season. After playing in two games for Rochester, the Twins promoted him to the major leagues to replace the injured Danny Santana on April 10, 2016. Fifteen days later, Kepler was optioned to Rochester. On June 1, 2016 Kepler was recalled to replace the injured Miguel Sanó, and he began getting regular starts for the Twins in right field. The next day, Kepler had his first multi-hit game, and on June 12, Kepler swatted his first major league home run, a walk-off three- run shot in the 10th inning off of Matt Barnes of the Boston Red Sox. On August 1 against the Cleveland Indians, Kepler became the first European-born MLB player to hit three home runs in one game and the 5th Twins player to do so after Bob Allison, Harmon Killebrew, Tony Oliva and Justin Morneau. On August 8, 2016 Kepler was named co-American League Player of the Week, his first time receiving that honor, alongside teammate Joe Mauer. Kepler started opening day against the Kansas City Royals, and collected a hit in his first at bat. In a game against the Chicago White Sox on August 31, Kepler came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded. Opposing pitcher Juan Minaya threw a slider inside and Kepler got hit by the pitch and became the second player in Twins history to have a walk off hit by pitch. It gave the Twins their 20th win in August. Kepler finished the year with career highs in games played, with 147, batting average of .243, home runs with 19, and 69 RBI. In 2018, Kepler had a batting average of .224, hit 20 home runs, with 58 RBI, in 156 games. His 20 home runs and 156 games played were both career highs. Kepler signed a 5 year, $35 million contract on February 14, 2019. He won his second American League Player of the Week award for the week of May 26th, he led the MLB that week in batting average, on base percentage and slugging percentage with a line of .571/.600/1.190. He had his second career three home run game against the Cleveland Indians on June 6, all three home runs came against starting pitcher Trevor Bauer. In a game against the Cleveland Indians on July 13, Kepler hit two home runs in his first two at bats against opposing starting pitcher Trevor Bauer, those two home runs were the fourth and fifth straight home runs hit against Trevor Bauer in consecutive at bats. This was the first time in MLB history that a batter hit a home run in 5 consecutive at bats against the same pitcher during a single season. On August 16, 2019 Kepler hit his 33rd home run of the season, setting a Major League record for home runs in a single season by a European born player, passing former Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson. He batted .252/.336/.519, and set career highs in home runs, runs and hits, he also led the major leagues in pull percentage (53.4%), and finished 20th in MVP voting. Kepler started 2020 by hitting a home run on the first pitch of the season against the Chicago White Sox, following that with another home run in his second at bat. Max Kepler is the second player to hit a home run in the first two innings in a season following Ted Kluszewski of the Angels (April 11, 1961). Personal life He was previously in a relationship with Abby Dahlkemper.

It stars Charlie Sheen, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Katheryn Winnick and Patricia Arquette. It premiered at the 2012 Rome Film Festival and had a limited release on February 8, 2013 in the United States, being the first release under the independent distributor, A24. Since release, it has garnered largely negative reviews. Plot In the 1970s, successful graphic designer and ladies' man Charles Swan III (Sheen) is dumped by his girlfriend Ivana (Winnick), and it throws his life into a tailspin. He does not know whether he loves her or hates her or wants her back or never wants to see her again. Along with his best friend, Kirby (Schwartzman) and his manager, Saul (Murray), Charles starts to suffer from nightmares, fever dreams of past relationships and hits rock bottom as he tries to recover from the recent breakup and tries to turn his life around.

The result of this appreciation was Hayes and Coppola making a soundtrack out of Hayes' music. \\"It evolved,\\" says Hayes. \\"When we met to discuss the project we talked about possible songs. We talked some more, added a few more songs, and I ended up doing the score.\\" Hayes also appears in the film performing the tune \\"So Much Music\\". It is not his first time onscreen: In 2000 he appeared in High Fidelity performing his song \\"Soaring and Boring\\". Release On January 8, 2013, the film was released through video on demand and was released in a limited release in the United States on February 8, 2013. Home media It was released on Blu-ray on May 14, 2013. Reception =Critical response= A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III received an overwhelmingly negative response from critics. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the movie an F, saying that \\"it isn't a movie so much as a feature-length perfume commercial for a Charlie Sheen signature cologne with gorgeous packaging and absolutely nothing inside.\\" The Dallas Observer said that the film \\"might generously be described as cut-and- paste – or more accurately as 'throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks'\\" and it was \\"a clunker\\". The New York Daily News gave Charles Swan III one star out of five, saying that \\"you want to swat it away\\" and that \\"maybe with this out of his [Coppola's] system, he'll think up something better.\\" TIME said that the film \\"does not lead to a deeper understanding of Charlie Sheen. It does, however, demonstrate his compulsion for poor judgment and bad choices. But weren't we already convinced of that?\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewer for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a C and a milder response, writing, \\"The idea of this home-movie-with-higher-production-values directed by Roman Coppola is no less sweet for being unoriginal ... The execution, on the other hand, is perilously self-absorbed, a private party involving friends, family, too many fantasy sequences, and an abundance of costume and set design to create a notion of a stylized L.A. spritzed with eau de Playboy.\\" The film holds a 16% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 56 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Tiresomely self-indulgent and lacking any storytelling cohesion, this Glimpse Inside the Mind finds little food for thought.\\" Metacritic gave the film a 28/100 \\"generally unfavorable\\" approval rating based on 22 reviews. = Box office = The film opened at #64 with US$12,000 in its limited release at two theaters the week of February 8. The following weekend, the weekend of February 15, Charles Swan III expanded to 18 theaters and gained an 81.6% increase. As of July 11, 2013, the domestic total of A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III is US$45,350, and in Russia the film has grossed $134,473, with an additional $26,999 in Mexico.

George Palliser, the firm's founder, was born around 1849 in Thirsk, Yorkshire, England. He emigrated to Newark, New Jersey in 1868. He worked as a carpenter and builder, later opening a millwork business.Wilkinson, Jeff. \\"Geo. Palliser\\". Old-House Journal Nov./Dec. 1990: 18. In search of new territory, Palliser moved to Bridgeport in 1873, opening an architectural office. He would specialize in residential work. In 1877 he made his brother, Charles Palliser, a partner in the firm, which became Palliser, Palliser & Company. They remained in Bridgeport until 1882, when increasing business necessitated a move to New York. The Pallisers kept the Bridgeport office open as a branch through the 1880s, but would eventually close it in favor of the New York office. By the 1890s, George Palliser was practicing alone, though the old firm-name of Palliser, Palliser & Company was often retained for publications. He died in 1903. The Pallisers published many books of architectural plans. The first was Model Homes for the People in 1876. Copies of the 23-page pattern book were sold for 25 cents a copy and \\"sent into every State and territory in the Union, and many to the provinces.\\" Other publications included American Cottage Homes (1878), Palliser's Model Homes (1883), Palliser's New Cottage Homes (1887), American Architecture; Or, Every Man a Complete Builder (1888), Palliser's Court Houses, Village, Town and City Halls, Jails and Plans of Other Public Buildings (1889), Palliser's Useful Details (1890), and Low Cost Houses Adapted for Florida (1892), and Late Victorian Architecture (1896). Palliser designs were built nationwide.

An extensive excerpt from the enhanced e-book edition was released online on July 25, 2012.http://files.harpercollins.com/Assets/HC/US/Features/telegraphavenue/telegraph.html The novel's setting is North Oakland and Berkeley, California. The title refers to Telegraph Avenue, which runs through both cities. Plot Set in 2004, Archy Stallings, who is black, and Nat Jaffe, who is Jewish, are proprietors of Brokeland Records, a record shop located in north Oakland for twelve years. Their used vinyl business is threatened by ex-NFL superstar Gibson Goode's planned construction of his second Dogpile Thang megastore two blocks away. They feel betrayed because their local city councilman, Chandler Flowers, has switched sides, and now supports Dogpile. A subplot concerns their wives, Gwen Shanks and Aviva Roth-Jaffe, who are partners in Berkeley Birth Partners, a midwifery business. A home birth goes wrong, the mother is rushed to the hospital, and the attending physician, after taking care of the mother, insults Gwen in a racially tinged manner. She blows up, and the doctor has the hospital start procedures to drop Gwen and Aviva's hospital privileges. Another storyline concerns Luther Stallings, Archy's father, an actor in blaxploitation films in the 70s. He was never a part of Archy's life, and Archy wants nothing to do with him. Luther has been in and out of jail and on and off drugs since his acting career ended, has been clean for over a year, and he keeps himself trim. He is involved with his former co-star Valetta Moore. Luther had been best friends with Chandler in the old days. Their friendship came to an end, after Luther abetted Chandler in the murder of a drug dealer. Luther is trying to exploit his knowledge in order to finance the making of a film. Another storyline concerns Julius Jaffe, Nat and Aviva's 14-year-old son, and his new best buddy, Titus Joyner, who has shown up from Texas after his grandmother died. Titus, it turns out, is Archy's long lost son. His arrival is the last straw in Gwen's relationship with Archy. Setting up a gig for a fundraiser for an Illinois politician, Barack Obama, running for U.S. Senate, Archy learns of the death of Cochise Jones, Archy's spiritual father, and Archy fills in. Obama is impressed with the performance, and tells Gwen he admires Archy's dedication to doing what he loves. Gwen takes those words to heart, and resolves to stand up for herself. The first stand she takes is to walk out on Archy. The funeral for Jones is held in the store. Plans are made, people get drunk, and the stage is set for the shaking up everyone's future.

The castle is one of 24 sites run by the state-owned State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony (Staatliche Schlösser, Burgen und Gärten Sachsen).  History  The original structure was built in 1250. It is suspected that the von Waldenburgs ordered its construction, but only its first owner occupant is known for certain. The von Waldenburgs had in their possession the estates of Waldenburg, Rabenstein, Scharfenstein, and Wolkenstein, which covered a contiguous area extending from the middle reaches of the River Pleiße to the Ore Mountain crest. Nine villages paid duties to the lord of the castle, including Grießbach, Großolbersdorf, Drebach and Herold. When, in the 15th century, Greifenstein Castle was destroyed, Scharfenstein also took over the guardianship of Thum, Ehrenfriedersdorf and Geyer. As a result, its value increased, so that in 1439 the Elector acquired the area from the Waldenburgs who were heavily indebted to him. On 26 January 1492 Henry of Einsiedel bought Scharfenstein Castle and its associated villages of Grießbach, Großolbersdorf, Grünau, Hohndorf Hopfgarten and Scharfenstein It remained in the family until 1931.c.f. Following a fire during the night of 1/2 June 1921 the entire residential wing and part of the domestic wing was destroyed. From 1921 to 1923 the damaged wings were partially rebuilt to plans by Bodo Ebhardt, based on the old design. In 1931, a factory owner, Captain Eulitz from Fährbrücke, acquired possession. By his efforts in 1932 in a bird observatory was established. Hundreds of nest boxes were put up throughout the 325 hectares of woodland on the estate; bird banding was carried out and scientific reports published, with the support of the Chemnitz Ornithological Society. In 1945 this forest was seized and made public property, the castle was initially used as the mining school for the state-owned Wismut mining company and, in 1951, a special children's home was established here for maladjusted boys. In 1967, it was converted into a detention centre for juvenile delinquents. Ornithological work was undertaken by the museum at Augustusburg Castle. In 1993 the castle was taken over by the Saxon Palace Department of the Free State of Saxony (Freistaat Sachsen – Sächsische Schlösserverwaltung). In the period that followed the castle was renovated as a historic monument and converted into a museum. In 1995, on the completion of the renovation work, various exhibitions were opened - and for the first time since 1945, the castle was again open to the public. The bergfried is still used today as an observation tower.

Like other edible crustaceans, only a small portion of the body of a crayfish is edible. In most prepared dishes, such as soups, bisques and étouffées, only the tail portion is served. At crawfish boils or other meals where the entire body of the crayfish is presented, other portions, such as the claw meat, may be eaten. Claws of larger boiled specimens are often pulled apart to access the meat inside. Another favorite is to suck the head of the crayfish, as seasoning and flavor can collect in the fat of the boiled interior. Like all crustaceans, crawfish are not kosher because they are aquatic animals that have neither fins nor scales. They are therefore not eaten by observant Jews. Australia Farmed marron (Cherax tenuimanus) on Kangaroo Island Australia is home to genus Cherax which is distinct from European, Asian and North and South American species. Two of the Australian edible crayfish are the common yabby (C. destructor) and the red claw (C. quadricarinatus). The common yabby is closest in size to the North American species, but is not considered to be commercially viable outside Australia because of its relatively slow growth and small size. The \\"red claw\\" crayfish are twice the size of North American crayfish and they contain 30% edible \\"meat\\" compared to 15% for P. clarkii. Other Australian species are fairly rare and thus usually are not used for food. Their slow growth generally makes them inefficient for aquaculture. China The culinary popularity of crayfish swept across mainland China in the late 1990s. Crayfish is generally served with Mala flavor (a combined flavor of Sichuan pepper and hot chili) or otherwise plainly steamed whole, to be eaten with a preferred sauce. In Beijing, the ma la flavored crayfish () is shortened to \\"ma xiao\\" () and is often enjoyed with beer in a hot mid-summer evening. France In France, dishes with a base or garnish of crayfish (') are frequently described as ' (in the style of Nantua). Crayfish tails and butter are also used to flavor the Nantua Sauce commonly served with Quenelles. Crayfish and fried eggs are the historically common garnish for chicken Marengo, although they are often omitted today. Mexico The Mexican crayfish locally named acocil was a very important nutrition source of the ancient Mexican Aztec culture. Other regional names for crayfish are chacales, chacalines and langostinos. Today, crayfish is consumed mainly boiled, similarly to crayfish dishes in other parts of the world, or prepared with typically Mexican sauces and condiments, particularly in central and southern Mexico. Traditional preparations include soups, tacos and \\"cocktails\\" similar to shrimp dishes. Nigeria Crayfish are usually smoked, and occasionally sun-dried, and they form an indispensable food item in the diet of the people of the entire southern states in particular and Nigeria as a whole. It is a core of Nigerian cooking. Nordic countries Crayfish served with dill Crayfish is a popular dish in Sweden and Finland, and is by tradition primarily consumed at a crayfish party, called kräftskiva, during the fishing season in August. The boil is typically flavored with salt, sugar, ale, and large quantities of stems and flowers of the dill plant. While most Americans eat them warm, the Swedes and Finns normally eat them cold. One traditional Swedish and Finnish practice is to eat crayfish with a vodka or akvavit chaser. The catch of domestic freshwater crayfish, Astacus astacus, and even of a transplanted American species, Pacifastacus leniusculus, is very limited, and to satisfy demand, the majority of what is consumed has to be imported. Sales depended on imports from Spain and Turkey for several decades, but after a decline in supply, China and the United States are today the biggest sources of import. Russia and Ukraine In Russia and Ukraine, crayfish (', sing. ') are a traditional seasonal appetizer that is used as an accompaniment to beer and liquor. Although native varieties tend to be larger (usually, Astacus astacus), rampant freshwater pollution and years of overfishing largely limit availability to imports—most from Armenia, Kazakhstan and China. Prior to cooking, the crustaceans are soaked in water or milk, then boiled live for 7–15 minutes in rapidly boiling salted water with additional ingredients, such as carrots, onion, dill, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns. More extravagant preparations include such ingredients as white wine, beer, sour cream, cloves, caraway seed, coriander seed, chili peppers, stinging nettle, etc. Russians rarely incorporate crayfish into complex dishes and, unlike other cultures, they usually consume the entire crayfish, short of the shell and the antennae. Russian and Ukrainian fascination with crayfish goes back quite far and generates considerable lore. An old proverb: \\"When there is no fish, even crayfish is a fish.\\" There are as many myth associated with picking the freshest live crayfish as there are for picking ripe watermelons. Russians and Ukrainians, generally, will not cook fresh crayfish if the crustaceans are dead or perceptibly lethargic. (But pre-boiled frozen specimens are acceptable.) Spain Procambarus clarkii Pacifastacus leniusculus In Spain, crayfish is called ' (lit. \\"river crab\\"). They used to be widely consumed, especially in Castile and León and Aragon, but over-fishing and the introduction of non-native crayfish species (e.g. Procambarus clarkii, commonly called ') led to a dramatic decline in crayfish population. Nowadays they remain as a seasonal delicacy, usually stewed in tomato sauce, although fishing the native crayfish is strictly forbidden since the species is nearly extinct. Instead of the native crayfish, it is common to fish Procambarus clarkii or Pacifastacus leniusculus, also present in most of the Spanish rivers. United States In the United States, crayfish are often referred to as crawfish, crawdads or mudbugs. As of 2005, Louisiana supplied 95% of the crayfish harvested in the United States.Robert P. Romaire, W. Ray McClain, Mark G. Shirley and C. Greg Lutz, Crawfish Aquaculture — Marketing (SRAC Publication No. 2402). October 2005. Southern Regional Aquaculture Center. In 1987, Louisiana produced 90% of the crayfish harvested in the world, 70% of which were consumed locally. In 2007, the Louisiana crayfish harvest was about 54,800 tons, almost all of it from aquaculture. About 70%–80% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are Procambarus clarkii (red swamp crawfish), with the remaining 20%–30% being Procambarus zonangulus (white river crawfish). Despite the large-scale production in Louisiana, most frozen crayfish available in supermarkets in other states are Chinese imports. In Louisiana, South Mississippi, and Southeast Texas, crayfish are generally served at a gathering known as a crawfish boil. The crayfish are usually boiled live in a large pot with heavy seasoning (salt, cayenne pepper, lemon, garlic, bay leaves, etc.) and other items such as potatoes, corn on the cob, onions, garlic, mushrooms, turkey necks, and sausage. There are many differing methods used to season a crawfish boil, and an equal number of opinions on which one is correct. Other popular dishes in the Cajun and Creole cuisines of Louisiana include crawfish étouffée, fried crawfish, crawfish pie, crawfish dressing, crawfish bread, crawfish bisque and crawfish beignets. In Houston, Texas, a regional style of Vietnamese-Cajun crawfish has developed. Cherokee people have a long tradition of catching crawdads by gigging. The crawdads are cleaned, then soaked, \\"in hot water with about one tablespoon of salt.\\" The crawdads are lightly breaded with cornmeal before frying, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

He was born in and lived his whole life in Dera Baba Nanak town of Gurdaspur district of Punjab, India. Columnist Joginder Singh Bedi stated, \\"Born in the holy town of Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district, the Sahit Shiromani Poet Jaswant Singh Rahi's contribution to Punjabi world of letters is no less than that of Dhani Ram Chatrik, Prof Mohan Singh (poet) and Prof Puran Singh. Rahi is popularly known for his slogan Jai Mitarta.  Early life  Rahi was born in a Rajput (Jaswal) family. His family had devoted itself to India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. He was very close to Baba Pyare Lal Bedi, a Punjabi Sikh, an author and a philosopher. He married Satwant Kaur, a Sikh from Fatehgarh Churian of Gurdaspur district in Punjab. They had eight children, including three sons – Rajwant Singh Rahi, Inderjeet Singh Rahi and Sarbjeet Singh Rahi; and five daughters – Late Ms Sukhbir Kaur (social activist and Punjabi writer), Santosh, Raj Kumari, Mohanjeet and Kanwaljeet. His daughters-in-law are Charanjeet Kaur, Ravinder Rahi and Kulwinder Kaur. His grandchildren include Dr. Baninder Rahi (journalist and media educator who has worked with the Indian Express, The Pioneer and Daily Post India). Other grandchildren are Kavita Rahi, Bikramjeet Singh Rahi, Natasha Rahi, Navkiran Rahi, Prateek Rahi and Sarvnoor Singh Rahi. He mentored writers including Rajwant Kaur Nagi and Shiv Kumar Batalvi during his early years. Batalvi spent weeks at Rahi's house in Dera Baba Nanak.  Works and recognition  Jaswant Singh Rahi was inspired by the freedom struggle. He joined the Communist movement and at that time changed his name to Rahi. He wrote novels, poetry, and three-part autobiography entitled 'Main Kiven Jivia'. He was awarded by the Punjabi Lekhari Sabha and was also conferred with the Punjabi Sahit Shiromani Award.  Writing style  Jaswant Singh Rahi is considered among the most honest and bold writers by his contemporaries and critics. Kulbir Singh Kang mentioned that Rahi has his own unique style of writing which is not influenced by any other prominent or popular author. While referring to Rahi's autobiography 'Main Kiven Jivia' Kang further mentioned that he did not make any attempt to hide or manipulate any incident irrespective of the consequences. Joginder Singh Bedi in his 1992 column entitled 'Jai Mitarta – Living up to his slogan' in The Tribune (Chandigarh) has written, \\"In the galaxy of progressive Punjabi bards of North India, Jaswant Singh Rahi excels in composing quatrains in an unparalleled style.\\" He further mentioned, \\"he has endeavoured to preach unity of godhead, brotherhood of man, secularism and above all international friendship in the context of his cherished slogan of Jai Mitarta.\\" As mentioned by Manpreet Kaur in her thesis, \\"Jaswant Singh Rahi is a writer with traditional proverbs and modern enlightenment. His poems do not represent opposition, rather revolution. (Noor, Navin Punjabi 67). He does not want replacement; he wants transformation so that the individuals may be made free from communalism, slavery and inhuman behaviour. Rahi begins his poems with the repugnancy existing between imagination and realism. The background of this repugnancy is based on the religion as corollary of social values and facing the capitalist who converts the production into capital.\\"  Books  The following are among the prominent works by Jaswant Singh Rahi: *Lishkan (1952) *Dojakh Di Agg (1966) *Aades Tise Aades (1983) *Noor Upaiya (1969) *Jassa Singh Ramgarhia (Poetic narrative)(1970) *Kaudian Khurmaniyan (1972) *Sachha Jhutha-Kahani Sangrah (1975) *Tutde Jurde Jism (1978) *Lahoo Bhiji Chanani (1981) *Pauna De Tarihaey (1981) *Kabran Da Gulab (1982) *Parchhavian da sach (1988) *Moye phulan da mandar (1990) *Adhoora Safar (1991) *Main Kiven Jeeveya I, II, III (Autobiography) (1991–95) *Dohre Rahi De (1996) *Lahoo De Timakane (1996)  Political Influence  Throughout his active life, Rahi was considered among the most influential figures of the region.

With the Association of Western Thrace Turks in the UK, the organisation adopted its current name. ABTTF is headquartered in Witten, Germany and since 2010, has maintained an office in Brussels, Belgium. The organization has 29 member associations in Germany and one in EnglandDie Mitgliedsvereine. In total, the ABTTF unites 6,000 affiliated members. It is the first organization to be granted special consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a representative body of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace.  History  The convention concerning the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations that was signed on 30 January 1923, in the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), exempted the Muslim Turkish population living in Western Thrace and the Greek Orthodox minority in Istanbul and on the islands of Imbros (Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada). Under the Treaty of Lausanne, a population of 150,000 Muslims of various ethnicities living in Western Thrace, such as Turks, Pomaks and Romas, were granted official minority status. The Muslim minority’s status in Western Thrace is explicitly defined within Articles 37-44 of the Lausanne Treaty. According to the officially granted minority status within Section III, Turks in Western Thrace were given equal rights to “establish, manage and control at their own expense any charitable, religious and social institutions, any schools and other establishments for instruction and education, with the right to use their own language and to exercise their own religion freely therein”. Beginning in the 1950s, Greek non-compliance with Treaty obligations extended to considerable human rights violations. Growing political instability due to the Greek civil war and Greek military junta of 1967-1974 that followed further instigated Greek nationalism and exacerbated the situation of minorities, including the Turks living in Western Thrace. In the 1960s and 1970s, increased tensions over Greece-Turkey relations were reflected as suppression and assimilation policies that targeted Turks. The policies put in place by Greek authorities to intimidate the Turkish minority manifested themselves as “dissolution” of the minority and eventually leaving territories by means of “forced migration”. Article 19 of Greek Nationality Code, which was in force from 1955 to 1998, stipulated that “a person of non-Greek ethic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality....” The Turkish minority was forced to migrate. While the vast majority of migration wave was towards Turkey, some groups chose to migrate to other European countries, in particular to Germany. Today, the population of Western Thrace Turks in Germany amounts to 30,000. A considerable number of Western Thrace Turks live in other EU Member States, such as the Netherlands, England, Sweden, France, Belgium and Austria. The need to keep alive their cultural values and maintain solidarity in their host countries led the Western Thrace Turks to create collectively created associations. In Germany, the first Western Thrace Turks Association was established on 1 January 1978 in Giessen of the state Hessen. This was followed by other Western Thrace Turks Associations including in Stuttgart, Homburg/Saar, Munich, Düsseldorf, Kelsterbach. The rise in the number of associations was a response to the assimilation policies Greece has pursued against the minority population. During the 1980s, successive Greek governments continued their suppression policy against minority groups. Initial objections were raised through the associations in Germany. These associations established Coordination Committees aimed at advancing cooperation between the various associations. These efforts yielded fruit on 28 February 1988, when seven member associations co-founded the Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Germany. These Turks thereby attained a larger sphere of representation, which gave a voice to the political, social, cultural, educational and other problems of the minority in the international arena. In 1996, when the UK association joined the rest, the Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Germany became the Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe.  Mission  ABTTF aims for a solution to the problems of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace in Greece and supports an inclusive minority policy, non-discrimination and recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms. ABTTF is independent of political parties, state authorities and governments. The Federation seeks to raise the awareness of politicians and representatives throughout Europe about human rights violations in Western Thrace. ABTTF tries to induce Greece to cease violations and reminds the signatory states of the Treaty of Lausanne to comply with the obligations laid out in the treaty's stipulations.  International recognition  In 2006, ABTTF was accredited as a non-governmental organization (NGO) by the United Nations. On May 10, 2006, the UN Committee on Non-governmental Organizations recommended the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) grant consultative status to ABTTF and 21 other NGOs, which led to ABTTF's accreditation in July 2006. This status allows the organization to participate in international meetings of the UN as a speaker and to set up a representative office at the UN's main sites in New York, Vienna and Geneva. Furthermore, ABTTF is a full member of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN). In 2008, ABTTF was a founding party of Fundamental Rights Platform (FRP) of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). In 2008 ABTTF became an active member of the European Dialogue Forum, which is the committee that contacts the European Parliament regarding issues concerning traditional national minorities, constitutional regions and regional languages. Moreover, ABTTF participates in conferences of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)Contribution of ABTTF at the OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting 2005 in working session I Democratic Institutions and working session III Fundamental Freedoms on September 19th, 2005OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting 2002 in Warschau, page 145 and of FUEN. In April 2005, the organization took part in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  Organization  The Federation is structured in five main units: General Assembly, Executive Board, Audit Board, Disciplinary Board and Board of Representatives. Gthe General Assembly is the highest decision-making body. Delegates of the member associations, ABTTF Executive Board and natural persons are members of ABTTF General Assembly. The Executive Board is composed of 11 members, including President, two Vice-Presidents, General Secretary, one accountant and six members in accordance with Article 26 of the German Civil Law. The Board s is elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years. Members of the Executive Board cannot assume duty in other organs, except their ipso facto membership to the Board of Representatives. Besides general managerial tasks, the Executive Board is liable for the execution of decisions taken by Board of Representatives and General Assembly as well as ABTTF’s recruitment policy. The President of the Federation has the competence of representing the organization alone, whereas two Vice-Presidents bear the right to representation together with General Secretary and Accountant. Staff may not serve on the Executive Board. The Audit Board is composed of three members and is elected by the ABTTF General Assembly, which is held every two years. The Audit Board inspects decisions and accounts of the Federation at least annually. The mid-term reports prepared following an audit are submitted to the Board of Representatives and Executive Board. The general audit report prepared at the end of term is presented at the General Assembly. The Disciplinary Board is composed of three members and is elected at the ABTTF General Assembly. Board members cannot serve in other organizational bodies of ABTTF, and they cannot be board members of any member association. The Board of Representatives is the highest decision-making body among other organizational entities. It is formed by two board members from each member association and ABTTF Executive Board. The Board of Representatives convenes at least once each year and with a presence of ¼ of its members has the right to make decision on any matter, except those made at the level of Executive Board.  Works and international cooperation  ABTTF has advocated on behalf of the Minority at the European Parliament (EP), Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE and the UN. The organization's progressive approach, especially since 2002, has broadened ABTTF’s involvement with international minority representatives. The organization has been a full member of FUEN since 2008. ABTTF President Halit Habip Oğlu to was elected to the FUEN Board in 2013. ABTFF is a regular participant at the OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting; the Supplementary Human Implementation Meetings; at the UN Forum on Minority Issues; and the Human Rights Council organised by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). ABTTF cooperates with Brussels- based civil society organisations. The fact-finding mission to the region in October 2012 was held in presence of FUEN President Hans-Heinrich Hansen, Member of the European Parliament François Alfonsi and Human Rights Without Frontiers Int’l (HRWF) Director Willy Fautre. The report Ethnic Turks in Greece, a Muslim Minority regarding human rights violations, based on the testimonies of the Minority, was drafted by HRWF Director Willy Fautre. In March 2013, ABTTF, the Party of Friendship, Equality and Peace (FEP, Minority's political party), and the Culture and Education Foundation of Western Thrace Minority (CEFOM) organised a visit to the region with participation of FUEN President Hans-Heinrich Hansen and European Association of Daily Newspapers in Minority and Regional Languages (MIDAS) board member Bojan Brezigar. The delegation attended the trial of minority publications Gundem and Millet as observers at Thrace Court of Appeal on 22 March 2013. Further, to the support to the Minority media, FUEN President and MIDAS board members visited FEP and held consultations with the Minority members. In June 2013, The “One million signatures for diversity in Europe” campaign was introduced, within the framework of European Citizens Initiative to the EC by FUEN and has been presented to Turkish Minority of Western Thrace through a mission organised by ABTTF and FEP to the Thracian cities of Komotini and Xanthi. In support of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace FUEN Director Jan Diedrichsen, Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (RDMSz) Vice-President László Borbély and RDMSz International Secretary Lorant Vincze joined the visit. Beyond the international engagement, entrusted with coordination of member associations for maintaining the social and cultural values of the Western Thrace Turks, ATTBF is the founding member of the Permanent Secretariat of International Council of Western Thrace Turks, an upper entity established for synchronization and cooperation of works among organizations created by the West Thracian Turkish diaspora.

The film, starring Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at both the Telluride Film Festival and the 2012 Toronto Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics purchased the film and it was released in the United States on April 24, 2013. Plot An ambitious farmer Henry Whipple (Dennis Quaid) discusses with his son Dean (Zac Efron) about the art of sales. Dean is reluctant to be a ruthless as his father as they offer condolences and also unscrupulously attempt to purchase land during a family funeral. After returning home they roll out the red carpet for their son who has left the farm and mentions returning via a postcard but appears unlikely to return. As the story progresses we see that Henry Whipple is having an affair with Meredith Crown (Heather Graham) and his ongoing selfish decisions will continue to derail his future. He has created enemies within the genetically modified (GMO) seed-selling business including Jim Johnson (Clancy Brown) -- his main competitor -- and fails to help those that have helped him by buying cheaper illegal “cleaned“ seeds in his search for more money and land. Dean desires to become a professional race car driver as a means to escape the generations of family farming and his father's neglect (and undesirable sales techniques). During yet another local racing competition which he wins, Dean's aggressive driving causes the crash of Jim Johnson's son, Brad. They fight after the race, further fueling the feud between Henry and Jim. Racing scouts give Dean an opportunity to race at a professional level. He needs $15,000 to compete and his mother Irene (Kim Dickens) supplies it. This causes tension with Henry who is worried about his illegal dealings catching up with him. Dean falters during his NASCAR opportunity by slowing when pressured by aggressive drivers during the race. He knows his opportunity to leave the farm is now gone and he spirals downwards, drinking and having sex with Meredith Crown damaging his relationship with his girlfriend Cadence Farrow (Maika Monroe). She appears to be a typical country girl but displays sales savvy to help Henry as well as being aware of the father and son attraction to pretty gals like Meredith. Dean purposely drives his car into a tree in a field which requires hospitalisation and a long recovery period. His father buys him another race car but he is not interested anymore. Henry is followed and confronted by Liberty investigators, the company he buys and sells his GMO seeds from. He has been \\"cleaning\\" seeds and reusing rather than buying from Liberty. If found guilty he will likely be bankrupt. Dean finds out about his father's crime from his now ex-girlfriend who is moving away. Dean searches for the informant who contacted Liberty. He wrongly believes it is their major sales opponent, Jim Johnson. He ends up in another altercation with Jim Johnson's son Brad on the side of the road and, after some fighting, he hits Brad with a hammer causing his death. Together with his father they bury Brad and the hammer in a deep well. Henry finds out the real informant is Byron (Chelcie Ross) who missed out on the land he purchased at the start of the movie. Henry offers Byron a very good deal to use the land he bought for free for life as long as he stops Liberty investigating further. Dean's mother is aware something is wrong with Dean and Henry and that they may have been involved in Brad's disappearance. When she confronts Henry, he informs her that he alone was responsible. Dean is listening, realizing his father does truly love him and that he is also permanently indebted to him. Life goes on with Dean becoming more like his father as they easily outsell their main opposition Jim Johnson, who is a shell of a man after his son's disappearance. Henry almost confesses to Jim, but then falls back into his capitalist persona, letting him know they have retaken some of his clients. Irene receives one of several postcards in an ongoing series from her overseas traveling son, suggesting once again he would be home soon. The movie ends with Henry, Dean and Irene Whipple putting on a party at their home for clients and friends with strained smiles on their faces.

The website's critical consensus states, \\"At Any Price features a terrific performance from Dennis Quaid, and it offers further evidence of Ramin Bahrani's unique eye for detail, but film is weighted down by an overly melodramatic story.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 61 out of 100 rating based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, praising Bahrani for delving deep into the plot with layers and themes that communicate effectively and singling out Dennis Quaid's performance as his best as \\"a flawed man with selfish values, a man for whom business success has seemed desirable no matter what its human cost.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that the performances of Quaid and Efron help deviate the film away from its credit straining plot twist, saying that they \\"drive them home in a movie that sticks to your ribs and stays in your head.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"C–\\", finding it a disappointment with its complex farmland plot being wasted with performances and dialogue \\"at the level of a Founders' Day pageant\\". Holden also noted that Bahrani's intention of making a mainstream film with substance will detract his usual audience, saying that \\"He’s treating them like dolts by making a film that holds to the corniest aspects of Hollywood storytelling, interrupted by bullet points.\\" References External links  * 2012 films 2012 drama films 2010s sports drama films 2012 thriller drama films American films American auto racing films American sports drama films American thriller drama films English- language films Films about dysfunctional families Films about farmers Films directed by Ramin Bahrani Films produced by Christine Vachon Films set in Iowa Films shot in Illinois Killer Films films Sony Pictures Classics films ","title":"At Any Price"},{"id":"36552046","text":"Walter Bernard (born May 3, 1978) is a former American college and professional football player who was a defensive back in the National Football League (NFL).

The family has been characterized by hundreds of well-preserved specimens from the Permo- Carboniferous of Middle Europe.Schoch, R.R. 2008. The intrarelationships and evolutionary history of the temnospondyl family branchiosauridae. Journal of Systematic Paleontology. 6(4):409-431. Specimens represent well defined ontogenetic stages and thus the taxon has been described to display paedomorphy (perennibranchiate). However, more recent work has revealed branchiosaurid taxa that display metamorphosing trajectories.Schoch, R.R. and Frobisch, N.B. 2006. Alternative Pathways in an Extinct Amphibian Clade. Evolution. 60(7):1467-1475 The name Branchiosauridae (“Branchio” in Ancient Greek denoting gills and “saurus” meaning lizard) refers to the retention of gills.  Geological/paleoenvironmental information  Branchiosaurids mostly inhabited Permo-Carboniferous freshwater mountain-lake habitats of Middle Europe at an altitude of up to 2000 meters. Large quantities of specimens have been collected from the grey shales and limestones of Rotliegend localities of the Variscan orogen. The branchiosaurid fossil record is exceptional due to Lagerstatten conditions of these localities and the preservation of specimens representing various ontogenetic stages.Frobisch, N.B. and Schoch, R.R. 2009. The largest specimen of Apateon and the life history pathway of neoteny in the Paleozoic temnospondyl family Branchiosauridae. Fossil Record.12(1):83-90. In the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, western Europe was subjected to annual and long-lasting changes between dry and monsoon periods which produced highly variable lake environments and thus rapid diversification and speciation of amphibian populations.Ronchi, A. and Schneider, J.W. 2007. The Early Permian Branchiosaurids (Amphibia) of Sardinia (Italy): systematic palaeontology, palaeoecology, biostratigraphy and palaeobiogeographic Problems. Palaeo geography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. 252:383-404 Smaller, shallow lakes especially would have experienced unstable environments due to these changing weather conditions whereas large and deep lakes, which yield most of the Branchiosaurid, specimens would have been more buffered. A fine lamination of C(org)-rich grey to black shales indicates a belt of lakes of tropical to subtropical climate and the existence of variable levels of oxygen for aquatic life in the Late Paleozoic. Permo-Carboniferous mass- mortality events are observed in several basins of Germany possibly caused by episodic mixing of the water column resulting in oxygen deficiency. Although the absolute ages of certain Rotliegend strata have yet to be elucidated the stratigraphically oldest branchiosaurid belonging to the genus Branchiosaurus occurs in Westphalian D. The earliest occurrence of Melanerpeton-clade is the Stephanian C and the first occurrence of the genus Apateon in Upper Carboniferus. The stratigraphic range of Branchiosauridae extends to the Sakmarian (Early Permian). Branchiosaurid gene flow enhanced by periods of wet climate led to successful colonization of roughly 15 basins (known so far). It has been hypothesized that Branchiosaurids originated in the Central Bohemian basin of Czech Republic (WestphalianD), from which they migrated to basins of the Massif Central in France (Stephanian B) and subsequently to several Central German basins including Thuringian Forest, Ilfeld and Saale (Stephanian C).  Historical information/discovery  Branchiosaurids were recognized as a distinct group and given the family name by Fritsch (1879). In 1939 Romer hypothesized that branchiosaurids were, instead, larval morphotypes of larger temnospondyl amphibians. However, Boy (1972) rejected this hypothesis by recognizing autapomorphic larval features of branchiosaurids distinguishing them from other temnospondyls. Boy argued for the neotenic state of Branchiosauridae and distinguished Micromelerpeton, another paedomorphic dissorophoid group, as distinct from Branchiosauridae. He concluded that branchiosaurids form a monophyletic clade closely related to other dissorophoids. Branchiosaurids have since been suggested as close, if not immediate, lissamphibian (extant amphibian) relatives.  Classification  Branchiosaurids form a clade within dissorophoid temnospondyls (one of the hypothesized origins of Lissamphibia). Dissorophoidea encompasses Micromelerpetidae and Xerodromes (all other taxa). Xerodromes includes the Olsoniformes and salamander-like Amphibamiformes. The latter includes four clades: Micropholidae, Amphibamidae, Branchiosauridae and Lissamphibia. R.R. Schoch. 2019. The putative lissamphibian stem-group: phylogeny and evolution of the dissorophoid temnospondyls. Journal of Paleontology 93(1):137-156 The amphibamids Amphibamus and Platyrhinops are the closest relatives of branchiosaurids and despite sharing homoplasies with amphibamids, Branchiosauridae forms a monophyletic group. Branchiosaurus amblystomus Credner  Family description  The synapomorphies of Branchiosauridae include a palatine with a prominent process which extends from the center of the bone to contact the maxilla; six rows of isolated, slender and multi-ended branchials; 21-22 presacral vertebrae (reversed in some forms). One skeleton of the branchiosaurid Melanerpton tenerum has been discovered with preserved skin pattern. The preservation shows a regular pattern of bright spots blurred by dark pigments on the dorsal skin. This is the first record of this mosaic- type pattern in an extinct amphibian.Werneburg, R. 2007. Timeless Design: colored pattern of skin in early Permian branchiosaurids (temnospondyli:Dissorophoidea). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 27(4):1047-1050  Genera descriptions  The family Branchiosauridae includes the genera Branchiosaurus, Apateon, Melanerpeton, Leptorophus and Schoenfelderpeton. The stratigraphically oldest genus is Branchiosaurus, with its only well-known species being B. salamandroides, and forms the most basal node of Branchiosauridae. The post-Branchiosaurus branchiosaurids fall into either the Melanerpeton-clade or the Apateon clade. Within the morphogenically more diverse Melanerpeton-clade, the genera Schoenfelderpeton and Leptorophus are sister groups. Within the Apateon-clade, A. kontheri forms the basal-most taxon followed by A. gracilis, A. pedestris, A. dracyiensis and the sister- taxa A. caducus and A. flagrifer. The genus Branchiosaurus is plesiomorphic with no autapomorphies. Branchiosaurus retains the prefrontal-postfrontal contact, the anteriorly extended jugal and ventral osteoderms. In the post- Branchiosaurus clade the prefrontal-postfrontal contact is lost (although reversed in A. dracyiensis), the maxilla sutures with quadratojugal in late development, the jugal is anteriorly shortened and ventral ossified osteoderms are lost. The diagnostic features of the genus Apateon are tabular horns separated from the skull table by a groove; tooth-bearing region of maxilla is broad and the dorsal osteoderms are smooth or with radiating striations. The diagnostic features of the Melanerpeton group are the palatine, the ectopterygoid and palatine ramus of pterygoid are extremely delicate, poorly ossified and have few or no denticles. The Melanerpeton genus has no autapomorphies and is paraphyletic with respect to the Leptorophus- Schoenfelderpeton group. The Leptorophus-Schoenfelderpeton group is characterized by a postorbital separated from supratemporal, a carotid foramina and grooves situated on sides of the cultriform process. The diagnostic features of the genus Leptorophus are a long triangular skull, anterior parts of nasal and vomer elongated, a very close prefrontal and postfrontal, elongated narial openings, a maxilla extended posteriorly, quadrate condyles posterior to occipital condyles, and a vomer with long posteromedial process. The autopamorphic features of the genus Schoenfelderpeton are an overall broad skull with an enlarged otic notch, a wider posterior skull table, supratemporal anteriorly pointed, possible subdivided postfrontal, very short humerus, represented only by midshaft ossification. These diagnostics of Schoenfelderpeton indicated it is the most neotenic of the branchiosaurids. There are several potential branchiosaurids that are as of yet too inadequately characterized to classify. However, in recent work one such species, Tungussogyriinus bergi has been further analyzed and shown to share clear synapomorphies with branchiosaurids including the Y-shaped palatine resulting in a gap between ectopterygoid and maxilla as well as brush-like branchial denticles. T. bergi differs from all other branchiosaurids in two autapomorphies: elongated process of ilium and tricuspid dentition. Thus, Tungussgyrinus is thought to represent a clade that is the closest relative to all other branchiosaurids and two new subfamilies, Tungussogyrininae and Branchiosaurinae fall under Branchiosauridae.Werneburg, R. 2009. The Permotriassic branchiosaurid Tungussogyrinus Efremov, 1939 (Temnospondyli, Dissorophoidea) from Siberia restudied. Fossil Record. 12(2):105-120  Paleobiology  The specialized pharyngeal denticles with brush-like branches of Branchiosauridae are indicative of gill clefts and suggest a filter-feeding mechanism focusing on plankton. In well preserved specimens of Branchiosaurus, six rows of tooth-bearing ossicles are present on each side of the hyobranchial skeleton in a 1-2-2-1 configuration. This is consistent with the denticles being attached to the epithelium surrounding four cartilaginous ceratobranchials bordering three external gill- slits.Milner, A.R. 1982. Small Temnospondyl Amphibians From the Middle Pennsylvanian of Illinois. Paleontology 25(3):635-664 The jaw-like apparatus may have served to hold back prey items leaving the pharyngeal cavity with the water current or to form a tight closure of gill cleft during feeding. Branchiosauridae diversified partly through adaptations that included the co- evolution of delayed development of the upper jaw and cheek which resulted in a kinetic maxilla and allowed for more efficient suction feeding. This mechanism would have been adaptive for suspension feeding and feeding on single prey. In the Apateon-clade different morphotypes evolved due to heterochronic changes. In some species (A. caducus and A. flagrifer), the maxilla consolidated early in development and the gape size and irregular dentition indicate an early transition in diet from suspension to carnivory. In other species (A. dracyiensis) the maxilla was never consolidated indicating a reinforced suction mechanism. Diagnostics of the Melanerpeton- clade indicate a combination of filter-feeding and occasional capture of larger prey. Although the Melanerpeton-Apateon dichotomy is not correlated with any significant adaptations, the Melanerpeton-clade generally had a larger body size which likely allowed them to occupy new niches in lake ecosystems. Most Apateon species did not appear to have competitors and thus were successful invaders. Branchiosaurus gracilis Credner - Smithsonian Institution  Ontogeny  Both neoteny (retention of larval somatic features into adulthood) and metamorphosis have been reported ontogenic pathways in branchiosaurids. Certain terrestrial branchiosaurid adaptations, such as the short trunk and long limbs, suggest that it was an initially terrestrial clade and thus reversals to aquatic life and metamorphosing trajectories occurred within the clade. The metamorphosis trajectory into terrestrial adults has been reported only in A. gracilis. Changes that distinguish the adult A. gracilis from its larval counterpart occurred during a rapid phase of development and include ossification of the braincase, palatoquadrate, intercentra and girdles, muscle attachment scars, and polygonal ridges and grooves decorating the dermal skull roof. The larval somatic features including ossified branchial denticles and larval-type sculpturing of the skull roof are lost. Postcranial features of transformed A. gracilis indicate that it was terrestrial and biting force had become a more important factor than suction. Despite this instance of metamorphosis, neoteny is nearly ubiquitous throughout branchiosaurids and most species remained in an aquatic environment throughout their life (however we should not rule out the possibility that this is a relic of terrestrial metamorphosed specimens not being well preserved). Neoteny is one of the major modes of heterochrony in which there is a modification in the timing or rate of development of certain features that is inherited. Neotenic branchiosaurids experienced isometric growth of cranial bones while retaining juvenile features noted above. Adult branchiosaurid neotenes are distinguished from larval neotenes by accentuated laval-type skull roof ornamentation, increased ossification (although not as extensively as in metamorphosed specimens), and development of uncinate process on the anterior trunk ribs. Such phenotypic plasticity in the form of facultative neoteny has been reported in modern lissamphibians and has been suggested to also be highly advantageous in the high altitude habitats of branchiosaurids where the harsh, continually changing conditions would have made aquatic life favorable.Schoch, R.R. 2004. Skeleton Formation in the Branchiosauridae: A Case Study in Comparing Ontogenetic Trajectories. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 24(2):309-319 Apateon gracilis-Skeleton on Slab  Histology  Histological observations confirm anatomical evidence of neoteny in branchiosaurids. Skeletochronological analysis allows for the identification of sexual maturity (i.e. when the distance between lines of arrested growth (LAGs) suddenly decreases). In Apateon specimens determined to be sexually mature, the cartilaginous Katschenko's line can be observed when perichondral ossification is complete. The diaphyseal and epiphyseal ossification patterns of Apateon specimens (i.e. persistence of histological larval features into adulthood) are suggestive of paedomorphy and similar to those of urodeles (extant neotenic amphibians).Sanchez, S. et al. 2010.

It is the most representative and perhaps beautiful street in Osijek, with its string of secession buildings.  History  Osijek is particularly famous for its Secessionist architecture, a style very popular throughout the former Austro- Hungarian Empire. The magnificent row of palaces on European Avenue—today mostly used as office spaces and local government buildings—were built at the beginning of the 20th century in the style of the so-called \\"Viennese secession.\\" However, the largest of these buildings, the Postanska palača, was built in the style of \\"the Hungarian secession.\\" In the same street there are a number of classicist buildings from the 19th century including the Municipal Court of Osijek. Of all the houses on this street, the most visited would probably be the Museum of Fine Arts, where there is a wealth of paintings and sculptures depicting the region. Some of the most interesting paintings are portraits of Slavonian noble families from the 18th and 19th centuries and the romantic landscapes of Slavonia and Baranja, as well as works of the founder of Osijek's drawing school Hugo Conrad Von Hötzendorff and Adolf Waldinger.

History and design The station opened along with the other stations on the Tommerup-Assens line in 1884. It was built to a design by Niels Peder Christian Holsøe who had become head architect of the Danish State Railways in 1880. Prior to his appointment, Holsøe had developed a standardized building, consisting of a high central section flanked by two lower shoulders, in a romanticizing Neo- Romanesque style. This design was introduced with the construction of Strib railway station in 1860. At Assens, it was expanded with two low towers in Italian style. Holsøe also designed a new post office which was built next to the station. The station came out of use when the Tommerup–Assens line was closed to passenger traffic in 1965.

The high school serves students in all of Jasper County and takes its name after the two major communities in the county, Ridgeland and Hardeeville. The school was formed in 2012 following the consolidation of Hardeeville High School and Ridgeland High School as part of the JCSD's overall reorganization of schools. RHHS utilizes the facilities of the former Ridgeland High School, whereas Hardeeville-Ridgeland Middle School utilizes the facilities of the former Hardeeville High School. History In the post-segregation era, Jasper County made efforts to control costs by consolidating educational facilities. Prior to 2007, all secondary students attended Jasper County High School which was located in close proximity to RHHS. In 2007, the Jasper County School District opened two K-12 facilities in both Hardeeville and Ridgeland, thus creating Hardeeville High School and Ridgeland High School in anticipation of future population growth. However, due to the economic slowdown beginning in 2008 and limited AP course offerings at both facilities, JCSD decided to merge the two middle schools and two high schools for the 2012–2013 school year. Critics of the merger have pointed to potentially long bus rides for students from various points of the county. Other critics suggested that the consolidation of the schools was prompted due to rumors that the State of South Carolina was about to take over the operation of the failing Ridgeland Middle School and the creation of Hardeeville-Ridgeland Middle School (by consolidation) would prevent the takeover. Academics According to data released by the South Carolina Department of Education, Ridgeland-Hardeeville High School earned a \\"F\\" letter grade for the 2012–2013 school year, substantially below academic expectations put forth by the state in standardized testing and graduation accomplishment.http://ed.sc.gov/data/esea/2013/school.cfm?SID=2701013 Athletics Ridgeland-Hardeeville's teams are known as the Jaguars, which was the previous mascot for Ridgeland High School.

Studies  Born in Dublin, Murphy graduated from the Ulster College of Art and Design, followed by a BA in fine art at Hornsey College of Art and an MA in film and television from the Royal College of Art in London where she studied under feminist theorist Laura Mulvey. Hoping to train as a cinematographer, in 1977 she was the first European to achieve a scholarship year at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, influencing her decision to become a director. She completed a short film, Rituals of Memory, before returning to Ireland to work on her first feature film.  Early career  Co-directed with John Davies but generally attributed to Murphy, Maeve (1981) was funded by the British Film Institute and later judged by Irish Times film critic Tara Brady to be \\"Ireland's first bona-fide feminist film.\\" In 2012, Murphy recalled her approach: \\"I didn't think about story. I'd think something like: representations of Northern Ireland are unsatisfactory: I'm going to make Maeve and sort it all out... Maeve was asking how does a woman position herself against the background of what was going on in the North and within the history of republicanism and memory and landscape... I was influenced by [Jean Luc] Godard and [Bertholt] Brecht.\\" The film's narrative and timeline meander far from the linear throughout. Murphy's second film, Anne Devlin, was a less cut-up affair, with the filmmaker working from the prison diaries of 19th Century Irish revolutionary Robert Emmet's housekeeper to rediscover her life and times. \\"I was amazed by how cinematic it was. Scenes were described in enough detail to construct shots for the movie. I think after making Maeve I became more interested in story. And with Anne Devlin's journal I wanted to tell a story that was like a ballad\\". It represented Ireland at international festivals such as Edinburgh, Moscow, Chicago, Toronto and London. In 1987, Murphy was a founder board member of the Filmbase facility in Dublin's Temple Bar. The following year saw her write and co-direct the two-part documentary Sean MacBride Remembers, an exploration of the Irish republican and Nobel Peace Prize winner. She then turned her hand to a mixture of artistic disciplines: in theatre, with The Parade of Innocence and The River Parade (1989), in fine art practice and curatorship with the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), in installation with a 1992 film for the Strokestown Famine Museum, and 1993 saw her co-direct Reflections from the Roof of the World.  Nora  Her most recent feature film was Nora (2000), a study of writer James Joyce's partner Nora Barnacle, with Susan Lynch in the lead role and Ewan McGregor as Joyce. After researching Joyce in the hope of filming an element of his life or work, Murphy found an appropriate point of entry through Brenda Maddox's biography of Barnacle, which \\"points out how the all-pervasiveness of Nora's voice in Joyce's writing has paradoxically rendered her invisible to the reader,\\" she explained. The film earned her the United International Pictures Director's Award and a slew of Irish Film and Television Awards. To date, the it is her only film that remains generally available. In 2002, Murphy made the short film What Mira Saw and the following year was elected a member of Irish artists' group Aosdána, at which point she taught film at Queen's University Belfast and sat on the board of the Screen Directors' Guild of Ireland. In 2012, Murphy's three major films were included in The Sunday Times' list of the top 100 Irish films of all time. That July, they were presented along with a public interview in a retrospective at the Irish Film Institute in Dublin. She is preparing a documentary on Muslim weavers and since the release of Nora was reported to have lectured in Singapore for three years and travelled around India for ten. She is an Associate Arts Professor at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Asia graduate film programme. Her latest work is an Irish language film entitled, \\"Ar lorg Sorcha\\" [Searching for Sorcha] about the sean-nos singer Sorcha Ni Ghuairim from Carna, Connemara. This was shown in 2006 on TG4, the Irish language television channel.

History The Squadron was formed on 16 October 1965, as an Air Defence unit, under Wing Commander E.R. Fernandes. It was to be equipped with Folland Gnats, but relied on Gnats borrowed from 2 Squadron, and 18 Squadron, until 14 May 1966, when it got its first batch of Gnats. In December 1968, the squadron was also allotted the role of Ground-Attack. =1971 Operations= Task During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, the task of Air Defence of the Barmer Sector was allotted to the squadron, for which the squadron operated from Uttarlai with eight Gnats, with three more Gnats and pilots at Amritsar. The squadron was commanded by Wing Commander S.S. Malik, who was also designated Air Defence Commander of the sector. The Station Commander at Uttarlai was Wing Commander V.K. Murthy. The men of the squadron were initially housed in tents. Subsequently, they were housed in the underground ATC. As word spread that Pakistani Commandos were seen in the sand, the men had to take turns doing night patrols. Soldiers could only have a bath every alternate day, and had six hundred rounds of ammunition with which they had to hunt goose for food. Operations On 3 December, a Pakistani Canberra, dropped eight bombs on the runway, making it unsuitable for use. However using civilian labour, the squadron cleared out the parallel taxi track. Thereafter only the track was used for take-off and landing. During the war, the squadron flew a total of 109 sorties, most of which were Combat Air patrols. The first bit of action it saw was on the morning of 10 December. Squadron Leader Kale, and Flying Officer P. Ajit were flying a CAP, when they spotted two F-104 Starfighters. they engaged the planes, but failed to do damage, and had their runway bombed. A little later, the base was given a P-12 Radar, causing the Pakistani Air Force to avoid Uttarlai. On 13 December six of their aircraft were moved to Ahmedabad to defend Ankleshwar Oil Refinery, and later four of these aircraft were to be moved to Srinagar. However they were informed of the ceasefire when they reached Pathankot, and flew back to Gorkhapur. =Post-War Era= The squadron won a number of trophies in gunnery meets, and was visited by the then Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh, and Air Vice Marshal H. Mulgavkar. In 1975, the squadron moved to Bakshi ka Talab, and operated there till 1 December 1976, when it was relocated to AFS Pune, and re-equipped with MiG 21 BIS. During this time three officers were awarded the Vayu Sena Medal. The squadron was tasked with helping other squadrons with the conversion to MiG 21 BIS, Within the first year, 46 pilots had been converted. On 24 September 1977, Air Chief Marshal Mulgavkar visited the squadron. In June 1978, the first accident with a MiG 21 in the IAF took place. The nose of an aircraft sheared off on landing during a night sortie. By June 1979, they had converted 11 more pilots. On 18 October, Wing Commander S.A.B. Naidu took over command of the squadron from Wing Commander D.N. Rathore (VrC, VM). Naidu was awarded Central Air Command Commendation on 26 January 1980. During this period the squadron took part in several exercises, Exercise Ranbheru, Exercise Agnivarsha, and the CAC Weapons Meet, alongside 4 Forward Base Support Unit, Exercise Ajinkya at 5 Wing, and Exercise Hamla conducted by South Western Air Command. In February 1980, the Squadron won the team event and R/P event for CAC. From 1981 to 1982, the squadron strived to achieve higher standards, and participated in several air-to-air missile and gun-firing exercises, such as Exercise Vajraghat-III, Exercise Chaukanna-III and IV. By 19 May 1982, the squadron had achieved 100% serviceability, and all the aircraft were flown that day.

The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. For this film Maya Sansa won the David di Donatello for Best Supporting Actress. Plot The film revolves around the true story of Eluana Englaro, a girl felt into an irreversible coma in 1992 following a car accident and deemed incurable. After long years of struggle, her parents opted to euthanize her, asking the authorization to the competent authority and obtaining it in 2009. The Catholic Church and some political parties during the Berlusconi IV Cabinet ruthlessly attacked them. Eluana is never shown in the film, but images of television programs and newspapers mentioning her case are constantly in the background reminding the audience about her presence. The plot features several stories chained to themselves and to the themes of life and death. Uliano is a Member of the Parliament elected for Forza Italia who refuses to align himself with the party and plans to vote against a bill that will make euthanasia illegal; his daughter Maria joins an anti-euthanasia Christian prayer group in front of Eluana's hospital, but then she falls in love with Roberto, an activist for the opposite pro-euthanasia group whose brother Pipino suffers from bipolar disorder. A great French actress referred as the \\"Divine Mother\\" is married to an Italian actor, but since when their daughter Rosa has felt into a coma she stopped caring about her husband, son and work, spending her whole time praying for her health.

It opened in 1893 and operated for 119 years, helping to introduce the hero sandwich to Americans. The family closed the business and put the property up for sale in 2012. The business was founded in 1893 by Ernest Petrucci as a wine and spirits store, Petrucci's Wines & Brandies, that also sold groceries. Its location at 488 Ninth Avenue near 37th Street was on a stretch of the avenue that remained lined with exotic food stores for decades. After the enactment of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1919, Petrucci's nephew James Manganaro, an immigrant from Naples, took over the store in the 1920s and changed the name; in 1927 he was able to buy the building. Manganaro may have invented the hero sandwich, and played a role in introducing it to Americans. On his death in 1953, Manganaro's passed to his brother Louis and sister Nina Manganaro Dell'Orto and their spouses; in 1955, with a publicity agent's help, they invented the six-foot \\"Hero-Boy\\" sandwich, which was successful enough for one of Dell'Orto's four sons to go on the original version of the TV quiz show I've Got a Secret, and for the family to open a sandwich shop next door at 492-494 Ninth Avenue the following year, while continuing to operate a deli and lunch counter in the rear of the grocery store. In 1962 Louis Manganaro retired and two of his four nephews took over the grocery store and the other two the sandwich shop, Manganaro's Hero-Boy, and the businesses were separated. Sal Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the grocery store, and James Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the sandwich shop, fell out over rights to the \\"Manganaro's Hero-Boy\\" name, trademarked by the sandwich shop in 1969, and advertising for party sandwich telephone hotlines, which led to two separate court cases. The business' neon sign installed in the early 1930s, which became blinking in the 1960s, was turned off in 2000 so that Manganaro's Hero- Boy could not benefit from it. The grocery store was repeatedly found at fault over the hotline and was ordered to pay damages to the sandwich shop, and the financial drain plus waning popularity, some of it due to the declining neighborhood, led to the decision to sell the building and close. This was first announced early in 2011, but the building was withdrawn from the market; the business then closed in late February 2012.Manganaro Foods website, archived at the Wayback Machine, March 9, 2012: \\"As of February 27, 2012, Manganaro Foods will no longer be open in New York City.\\" Anthony Bourdain featured the store (and its famously brusque service) in an episode of No Reservations in 2009.

The term is mostly used of incised characters that are intended to imitate runes. Pseudo-runes in this sense are difficult to distinguish from cipher runes, which are characters used as a replacement of standard runes but which do have an intended reading, while pseudo-runes have no linguistic content. The term \\"pseudo-runes\\" has also been used for runes \\"invented\\" after the end of the period of runic epigraphy, used only in medieval manuscripts but not in inscriptions. It has also been used for unrelated historical scripts with an appearance similar to runes, and of modern Latin alphabet variants intended to be reminiscent of runic script. Imitation runes Reverse of Ædwen's brooch, an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon silver disc brooch with seven pseudo-runes on a silver strip in the centre The main use of the term pseudo-rune is in reference to epigraphic inscriptions using letters that imitate the appearance of runes, but which cannot be read as runes. These are different from cryptic or magical runic inscriptions comprising a seemingly random jumble of runic letters, which cannot be interpreted by modern scholars, but can at least be read. In contrast, pseudo-runic inscriptions consist mostly of false letters (some pseudo-runes within a pseudo-runic inscription may coincidentally appear similar or identical to true runes), and so cannot be read at all, even nonsensically. It has been suggested that pseudo-runic inscriptions were not made by specialist 'rune masters' as is thought to have been the case when carving traditional runic inscriptions, but were made by artisans who were largely ignorant of runes. According to Nowell Myres, pseudo-runes may have been \\"intended to impress the illiterate as having some arcane significance\\". Manuscript-only runes The term pseudo-rune has also been used by R. I. Page to refer to runic letters that only occur in manuscripts and are not attested in any extant runic inscription. Such runes include cweorð ᛢ, stan ᛥ, and ior ᛡ. The main variant shape of the rune gér is identical to ᛡ (with ᛄ being a secondary variant of ger), and should not be confused for ior when found epigraphically. The age of these \\"manuscript-only\\" runes overlaps with the period of runic inscriptions, e.g. cweorth and stan are both found in the 9th-century Codex Vindobonensis 795. Of a different type are the \\"pseudo- runes\\" invented in the modern period, such as the unhistorical runes in the Armanen Futharkh created by Guido von List in 1902 and later authors of Germanic mysticism (e.g. Gibor, Hagal, Wendehorn).\\"List's Armanen runes thus represent only a pseudo-alphabet and the inclusion of his pseudo-runes is a telltale sign of the influence of List in the works of later runic enthusiasts.\\" Bernard Thomas Mees, The Science of the Swastika, 2008, p. 61. Other rune-like scripts The historical Old Turkic and Old Hungarian scripts, unrelated with the runes but similar in application (inscriptions etched in stone), have sometimes been referred to as pseudo-runes or pseudo- runic, or alternatively as \\"runiform\\".

Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Federal Power Act (FPA) as permitting the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to modify a rate specified in a contract between an electric utility and distribution company only upon a finding that the contract rate is unlawful because it adversely affects the public interest.. Sierra Pacific and its companion case United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp.. established the Mobile- Sierra doctrine, which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be \\"just and reasonable\\" and thus acceptable under the FPA or Natural Gas Act (NGA). In some literature, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine is described as being a presumption. Background The Federal Water Power Act was amended in 1935 and renamed the FPA and reorganized the FPC. It also regulated all interstate transmission of electricity. Under the FPA, a power company could establish a rate by either filing a new rate schedule thirty days prior to its effective date or by filing a contract with a wholesale customer. The FPC could suspend a newly filed rate and establish an administrative proceeding to investigate it for its reasonableness, and it could investigate filed contracts to determine if they were unlawful. The Sierra Pacific Power Company distributed electricity in northern Nevada and eastern California and purchased the majority of its power from a California electric utility, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;), which was subject to regulation under the FPA. In 1947, because of increased post-war power demand and consumer desire for less expensive electricity, Sierra Pacific began negotiating for new supplies, including with the Bureau of Reclamation, which had excess capacity available from the recently completed Shasta Dam. PG&E; then offered Sierra Pacific a fifteen-year power supply contract, which Sierra Pacific accepted in June 1948. In early 1953 after excess power from the Shasta Dam was no longer available, PG&E; without the consent of Sierra Pacific filed a new rate schedule with the FPC purporting to increase the rate to Sierra Pacific by 28%. The FPC suspended the rate until September 6, 1953, and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the new rate. Sierra Pacific intervened but its motion to reject the new rate because the contract could not be changed without its consent was rejected by the FPC. In 1954 the FPC issued an order upholding its decision not to reject the new rate and finding it to be not \\"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\\" On appeal by Sierra Pacific, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, holding that the contract rate could only be changed upon a finding that it was unreasonable, reversed the FPC order and remanded it without prejudice to the FPC initiating a new proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the contract rate. The Supreme Court granted certiorari because of the importance of the case to the administration of the FPA.. Opinion The availability of low cost power from the newly constructed Shasta Dam resulted in a 15-year power supply contract with a low rate in 1948, which the Supreme Court held could not later be unilaterally changed by the supplier. The unanimous opinion by Justice Harlan noted two issues in the case. First, since the relevant provisions of the FPA are substantially equivalent to those of the NGA, the Court held that, under the holding of Mobile Gas, the filing of a new rate schedule and the proceeding to review it was not effective to supersede the contract rate. Mobile Gas held that the NGA did not authorize a unilateral contract change, and that holding also applied to the FPA. Secondly, the FPA also allows the FPC to set aside a contract upon a determination that the rate is unlawful. The parties during the FPC proceeding had stipulated that a reasonable or fair rate of return (ROR) for PG&E; was 5.5%, and that the contract rate provided a ROR of 2.6% while the new filed rate schedule provided a ROR of 4.75%, which was the lowest that PG&E; stated it would accept. The FPC had in its order found that the 1948 contract rate to be unreasonably low and unlawful because of its low ROR. The Supreme Court, however, noted that while a regulatory agency such as the FPC may not normally impose upon a public utility a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, it did not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, or that if it does so, that it is entitled to regulatory relief of its improvident bargain.See (Holding that there is no government duty relieve a contracting utility company from the burdens of an improvident contract to provide gas.) Under the FPA, the proper standard for determining whether a contract rate is unlawful is whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest, such as having been unduly discriminatory to third parties, excessively burdensome to consumers, or a threat to continued service to the utility company. Subsequent events The Supreme Court in its companion case Mobile Gas found a similar result regarding contracts filed with the FPC involving electricity sales under the NGA. In later cases, the validity of rates set by contracts between gas and electric transmission companies became known as the Mobile- Sierra doctrine. Under this doctrine, an electricity or gas rate specified in a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be \\"just and reasonable\\" and thus acceptable under the FPA or NGA. On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.. In Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County (2008), the Supreme Court determined that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine also applied when the burden of the improvident contract was on the purchaser.. The case was remanded to determine if the contract negotiated during the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001 was the result of market manipulation, which would eliminate one premise on which the Mobile-Sierra doctrine rests: that the contract rates are the product of fair, arms-length negotiations.

It was released on May 27, 2014. The book once again follows the adventures of the teenage Shadowhunter, Clary Fray, and her allies in facing her brother Sebastian Morgenstern and his allies of Endarkened Shadowhunters. It also ties in with both The Infernal Devices and the upcoming The Dark Artifices series by having their main protagonists, Tessa Gray and Emma Carstairs, appear as supporting characters and connecting the worlds of The Infernal Devices and The Dark Artifices. Plot Shadowhunters of the Los Angeles Institute meet to discuss the army of Endarkened Shadowhunters when the army, led by Sebastian Morgenstern, ambush the Institute, endarken some shadowhunters, and kidnap Mark Blackthorn, leaving Mark's five half-siblings and Emma Carstairs to escape to Alicante. Maryse Lightwood announces to the New York Institute that an emergency meeting is due in Alicante to discuss the attack on five Institutes around the world. Clary Fray reluctantly leaves Simon Lewis to be guarded by Maia Roberts and Jordan Kyle for his safety. However, Simon is kidnapped by Maureen Brown and her vampire aides to be her groom, but Raphael Santiago frees and helps him to come to Alicante. Praetor Lupus, the brotherhood of werewolves, is soon attacked by the Endarkened with Jordan and Praetor Scott among the casualties, resulting in Bat Velasquez and Rufus Hastings battling for the position of pack leader. Rufus is about to deliver the death blow to Bat when Maia Roberts steps in and challenges Rufus. The vacuum of power is finally ended when Maia kills Rufus, becoming the new leader, and also tricks Maureen into drinking holy water so the latter's aide, Lily, can usurp her to become the leader of the vampire clan. At Alicante, Emma and Julian Blackthorn are interrogated using the Mortal Sword, Clary comforting the former when she breaks into tears. Choosing to accept her Morgenstern heritage, Clary claims Heosphoros, the twin of Sebastian's Phaesphoros, as her sword. The Seelie Queen, now allied with Sebastian, sends Meliorn to ask the Downworlder Representatives (Jocelyn Fray, Luke Garroway, Magnus Bane, and Raphael) to join them; when they refuse, he brings them to Edom, the realm of demons. Jace Herondale is injured during the ensuing conflict and burns Brother Zachariah back into his Shadowhunter persona. An Endarkened soon gives an ultimatum for the Clave to hand over Clary and Jace. Clary, Jace, Simon, and Isabelle and Alec Lightwood, force the Seelie Queen to send them to Edom. Confronting Sebastian, Clary pretends to agree to rule by his side, but then stabs him with Heosphoros, reverting him back momentarily to the brother she could have, Jonathan Morgenstern, who destroys the Infernal Cup before he dies, killing the Endarkened, including Luke's sister, Amatis. To escape Edom, Magnus summons his father, Asmodeus, who offers a way out in exchange for Magnus' immortality and life. Simon offers a lighter option: his immortality and memories of the Shadow World. The Clave punishes the faeries and sends Emma to live with the Blackthorns. Alec and Magnus reconcile and get back together. Meanwhile, Clary scatters Jonathan's ashes in Lake Lyn and mourns for Simon. Several months later, Jocelyn and Luke hold their wedding, attended by numerous Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike. Simon has remembered bits of the Shadow World as well as his relationship with Isabelle. Attending the wedding is also Tessa Gray and Brother Zachariah (whose identity is not revealed), both of them having formally introduced themselves to Clary. Characters * Clary Fairchild – A teenage Shadowhunter who possesses more angel blood than a normal Shadowhunter. Her unique circumstances provide her with the ability to cast extremely powerful runes and even create new runes that don't exist. * Jace Herondale – A Shadowhunter experimented upon with angel blood like his girlfriend, Clary. He was formerly controlled by a rune that bound him to Sebastian Morgenstern and is currently infused with heavenly fire during Clary's attempt to purify him, which ignites whenever he is excited or in pain. * Simon Lewis – Clary's formerly mundane best friend who was turned into a Daylighter; a vampire capable of walking in daylight.

She is a close associate to the Blackthorn family, particularly to her parabatai, Julian Blackthorn. Reception City of Heavenly Fire generally received mixed to positive reviews. Common Sense Media called the book 'an exciting send-off' giving the book a rating of 4/5, stating that \\"This YA fantasy is too long—but amid far too much of the characters' internal dialogue and remembrances of the good and bad times of the past five books, it's got a satisfying end for fans.\\" Booklist gave a positive review stating “sure to leave the faithful hooked yet again.” Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review that “few things in life more satisfying than a long-awaited happy ending, which is exactly what Clare delivers.” Kirkus gave the book a mixed review, stating that \\"the myriad magical, societal and romantic story threads of two series and nine books conclude without living up to the series’ purple promise,\\" with the School Library Journal also stating that “fans of the series will likely be satisfied with the conclusion.” The Guardian called the book 'a perfect ending' stating that, “I don’t know what else to say other than the book is a perfect ending to the series… one of those books that you hold in your heart long after finishing.” References 2014 American novels 2014 fantasy novels American fantasy novels American adventure novels  American young adult novels ","title":"City of Heavenly Fire"},{"id":"36552473","text":"The Pushkin estate in Mikhaylovskoye Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve (, officially The State museum-reserve of Alexander Pushkin «Mikhailovskoye») is a museum complex dedicated to Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, the founder of modern Russian literature. The museum is located in Pushkinogorsky District of Pskov Oblast in Northwestern Russia, in the areas around the settlement of Pushkinskiye Gory and in the surrounding villages including Mikhaylovskoye, where Pushkin had a family estate. History In 1742, the land around the village of Mikhaylovskoye was granted to Abram Petrovich Gannibal by empress Elizabeth. Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda Osipovna Pushkina (Gannibal), was a granddaughter of Abram Gannibal. Pushkin visited the estate on a regular basis, and was also exiled there between 1824 and 1826. He was killed on a duel in January 1837 in Saint Petersburg, and buried in Svyatogorsky Monastery in what is now Pushkinskiye Gory. The estate remained in the family until 1899, when the state bought it from the poet's son Grigory Pushkin. An unsuccessful attempt to open a small-scale museum was made in 1911, and subsequently during the October Revolution in 1917 the estate was burnt down. On March 17, 1922 Mikhaylovskoye, Trigorskoye, and the tomb of Pushkin in Svyatogorsky Monastery were declared a state monument and opened as a museum (the Pushkin Museum Reserve). In 1936, the whole Svyatogorsky Monastery was added, as well as the estate of Petrovskoye, which formerly belonged to Pushkin's uncle, and adjacent areas. The museum was looted and badly damaged during World War II; after the war, extensive restoration work was undertaken. In 1992, the monastery was transferred to the property of Russian Orthodox Church, and in 1995, the museum was expanded, and renamed Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve. Collections The museum includes several areas, * Mikhaylovskoye, the former estate by Pushkin, where the main house, several service buildings, and a landscape park were preserved. * Trigorskoye, the former estate by Praskovya Osipova, a close friend of Pushkin. The main estate house, the bath, and the park were preserved. * Petrovskoye was granted to Abram Gannibal together with Mikhaylovskoye. In Pushkin's times, it was owned by his mother's cousin, Veniamin Gannibal.

She was long and measured 7,147 gross register tons. Originally named Cromwell Park, she was built for the government of Canada to be used in World War II. In 1946 she was sold to Canadian Transportation Co. Ltd. which renamed her the Harmac Vancouver. In 1948, she was sold to Greek shipowner Kydoniefs, renamed the Amaryllis and registered in Panama.Florida East Coast Shipwrecks: Amaryllis In 1965, she ran aground during Hurricane Betsy off the coast of Florida and was later sunk offshore as an artificial reef at . Grounding As Hurricane Betsy approached the east coast of Florida on September 7, 1965, Amaryllis, bound from Manchester, England to Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a Greek crew of 30, sought refuge in the Port of Palm Beach in Riviera Beach, Florida. As she approached the Palm Beach Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean into the port, she suffered steering problems in addition to the high winds and seas, which resulted in her being forced into the shallow waters laced with coral reefs north of the inlet. Sometime during the night of September 7–8, she ran aground on the Singer Island beach in front of the Rutledge Motel, later known as the Rutledge Inn, in Riviera Beach. During the next day the winds and seas increased as Hurricane Betsy made her landfall to the south in Key Largo; this pounding wedged the ship farther onto the beach. The ship almost immediately became an attraction for sightseers and locals, who came to view her and listen to her Greek crew strum their musical instruments. She soon became a magnet for surfers. Since none of the Greek crewmen spoke English, a local interpreter was required for the Coast Guard to communicate with them. All of the crew except for two who jumped ship, and were later picked up in Memphis, remained on the ship until November when her owners made arrangements for them to leave the country. After several unsuccessful salvage attempts by the original owners and a Miami man who bought her from them, the ship was abandoned and became a menace to those people daring enough to board and wander through her, as well as a concern for the motel owner whose guests were annoyed by the sightseers and kept awake at night by clanging noises from the ship. Oil seepage fouled the water and beach and one fire broke out on the ship. Local residents and officials became concerned about the danger of further damage to the coral reef by the ship as well as the discharge of large quantities of bunker oil from the ship if she broke up. The Army Corps of Engineers became involved in dismantling the ship and removing the oil. On August 22, 1968, her remains were \\"towed three-fourths of a mile out to sea and sunk in of water\\" to create an artificial reef. Cleanup of the beach and removal of debris from the ship took over a year.Kleinberg, Eliot, Historic Palm Beach, July 23, 2003Singer Island Civic Association: The S.I.A.A. Story Status Only the ship's hull and lower deck remain at the artificial reef site. Amaryllis is part of a string of four wrecks, another of which is the Mizpah, and two rock piles north of the Palm Beach Inlet known today as The Corridors, all of which are classified as \\"advanced dive sites.\\" Local knowledge is required. In the media Amaryllis was used as a backdrop in the 1967–1968 daytime game show Treasure Isle hosted by John Bartholomew Tucker. The show was actually shot a mile or so south of the ship at John D.
