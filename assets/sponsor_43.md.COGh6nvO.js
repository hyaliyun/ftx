It is sometimes considered to be a family, the Elassomatidae, in a monotypic suborder, the Elassomatoidei of the Perciformes. The type species is E. zonatum, the banded pygmy sunfish. The Elassomatinae are known collectively as pygmy sunfishes, but are considered by some authorities not to be true sunfishes, which are members of family Centrarchidae. Some researchers believe they are related to sticklebacks and pipefishes (order Syngnathiformes) rather than Perciformes, though genetic research strongly implies a close relationship with the Centarchids. http://www.nanfa.org/ac/AC2012vol37no4_Elassoma%20zonatum%20E_okejenokee%20and%20E_evergladei- habitats%20and%20comparative%20observations_Bohlen_Nolte.pdf Currently the Integrated Taxonimic Information System classisfies them as belonging to the family Elassomatidae rather than Centrarchidae. https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search;_value=202000#null The pygmy sunfishes grow to a maximum overall length of . They occur mostly in temperate and subtropical swamps, marshes, and other shallow, slow-moving, and heavily vegetated waters, across an area of the American South stretching from the Coastal Plain of North Carolina to central Florida, west along the Gulf Coast to eastern Texas, and north up the Mississippi River Valley to southern Illinois. The bluebarred, Carolina, and spring pygmy sunfishes have small localized populations and are considered Vulnerable. The pygmy sunfishes are too small to be game fish, but are relatively popular as aquarium fish because of the males' iridescent colors and fascinating breeding behaviors. Eggs are laid on or beneath dense vegetation, and the male guards the nest area until the fry hatch and scatter. They adapt well to small aquaria and are relatively adaptable to a range of conditions, but seldom take conventional prepared fish foods, instead requiring small live worms, insects, or crustaceans as food.  Etymology  The generic name Elassoma derives from the Greek ελάσσων (elasson) meaning smaller and σώμα (soma) meaning body, in reference to the fishes' diminutive size compared to the typical sunfishes. Species The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Elassoma alabamae Mayden, 1993 (spring pygmy sunfish) * Elassoma boehlkei Rohde & R. G.

The company is headquartered in Smith's hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. Early years Frederick Smith was born in Marks, Mississippi, the son of James Frederick \\"Fred\\" Smith, the founder of the Toddle House restaurant chain and the Smith Motor Coach Company (renamed the Dixie Greyhound Lines after The Greyhound Corporation bought a controlling interest in 1931). The elder Smith died when his son was only 4, and the boy was raised by his mother and uncles. Smith was crippled by bone disease as a small boy but regained his health by age 10. He attended elementary school at Presbyterian Day School in Memphis and high school at Memphis University School, and became an amateur pilot as a teen. In 1962, Smith entered Yale University. While attending Yale, he wrote a paper for an economics class, outlining overnight delivery service . Additionally, Smith became a member and eventually the president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity and the Skull and Bones secret society. \\"Frederick W.

In his college years, he was a friend and DKE fraternity brother of future U.S. president George W. Bush. Smith was also friends with future U.S. Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry; the two shared an enthusiasm for aviation and were flying partners. Marine Corps service After graduation, Smith was commissioned in the U.S. Marine Corps, serving for three years (from 1966 to 1969) as a platoon leader and a forward air controller (FAC), flying in the back seat of the OV-10. He served two tours of duty in Vietnam and was honorably discharged in 1969 with the rank of Captain, having received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts .

On June 18, 1971, Smith founded Federal Express with his $4 million inheritance (approximately $23 million in 2013 dollars),The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis . Minneapolisfed.org. Retrieved on 2009-02-01. and raised $91 million (approximately $525 million in 2013 dollars) in venture capital. In 1973, the company began offering service to 25 cities, and it began with small packages and documents and a fleet of 14 Falcon 20 (DA-20) jets. His focus was on developing an integrated air-ground system. Smith developed FedEx on the business idea of a shipment version of a bank clearing house where one bank clearing house was located in the middle of the representative banks and all their representatives would be sent to the central location to exchange materials. In the early days of FedEx, Smith had to go to great lengths to keep the company afloat. In one instance, after a crucial business loan was denied, he took the company's last $5,000 to Las Vegas and won $27,000 gambling on blackjack to cover the company's $24,000 fuel bill. It kept FedEx alive for one more week. In addition to FedEx, Smith is also a minority owner of the Washington Football Team of the National Football League (NFL). His son, Arthur Smith is the offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans. This partnership resulted in FedEx sponsorship of the Joe Gibbs NASCAR racing team. Smith also owns or co-owns several other entertainment companies, such as Alcon Entertainment. In 2000, Smith made an appearance as himself in the Tom Hanks movie Cast Away, when Tom's character is welcomed back, which was filmed on location at FedEx's home facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. A DKE Fraternity Brother of George W. Bush while at Yale, after Bush's 2000 election, there was some speculation that Smith might be appointed to the Bush Cabinet as Defense Secretary. While Smith was Bush's first choice for the position, he declined for medical reasons -- Donald Rumsfeld was named instead. Although Smith was friends with both 2004 major candidates, John Kerry and George W. Bush, Smith chose to endorse Bush's re- election in 2004. When Bush decided to replace Rumsfeld, Smith was offered the position again, but he declined in order to spend time with his terminally ill daughter. Smith was a supporter of Senator John McCain's 2008 Presidential bid, and had been named McCain's National Co-Chairman of his campaign committee. Smith was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame and also awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1998. He was inducted into the SMEI Sales & Marketing Hall of Fame in 2000. His other awards include \\"CEO of the Year 2004\\" by Chief Executive Magazine and the 2008 Kellogg Award for Distinguished Leadership, presented by the Kellogg School of Management on May 29, 2008.

There are three types of biquaternions corresponding to complex numbers and the variations thereof: * Biquaternions when the coefficients are complex numbers. * Split-biquaternions when the coefficients are split-complex numbers. * Dual quaternions when the coefficients are dual numbers. This article is about the ordinary biquaternions named by William Rowan Hamilton in 1844 (see Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1844 & 1850 page 388Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy November 1844 (NA) and 1850 page 388 from Google Books ). Some of the more prominent proponents of these biquaternions include Alexander Macfarlane, Arthur W. Conway, Ludwik Silberstein, and Cornelius Lanczos. As developed below, the unit quasi-sphere of the biquaternions provides a representation of the Lorentz group, which is the foundation of special relativity. The algebra of biquaternions can be considered as a tensor product (taken over the reals) where is the field of complex numbers and is the division algebra of (real) quaternions. In other words, the biquaternions are just the complexification of the quaternions. Viewed as a complex algebra, the biquaternions are isomorphic to the algebra of complex matrices . They are also isomorphic to several Clifford algebras including ,D. J. H.

Definition Let be the basis for the (real) quaternions , and let be complex numbers, then :q = u mathbf 1 + v mathbf i + w mathbf j + x mathbf k is a biquaternion.William Rowan Hamilton (1853) Lectures on Quaternions, Article 669. This historical mathematical text is available on- line courtesy of Cornell University To distinguish square roots of minus one in the biquaternions, HamiltonHamilton (1899) Elements of Quaternions, 2nd edition, page 289 and Arthur W. Conway used the convention of representing the square root of minus one in the scalar field ℂ by h to avoid confusion with the in the quaternion group. Commutativity of the scalar field with the quaternion group is assumed: : h mathbf i = mathbf i h,  h mathbf j = mathbf j h,  h mathbf k = mathbf k h . Hamilton introduced the terms bivector, biconjugate, bitensor, and biversor to extend notions used with real quaternions . Hamilton's primary exposition on biquaternions came in 1853 in his Lectures on Quaternions. The editions of Elements of Quaternions, in 1866 by William Edwin Hamilton (son of Rowan), and in 1899, 1901 by Charles Jasper Joly, reduced the biquaternion coverage in favor of the real quaternions. Considered with the operations of component-wise addition, and multiplication according to the quaternion group, this collection forms a 4-dimensional algebra over the complex numbers ℂ. The algebra of biquaternions is associative, but not commutative. A biquaternion is either a unit or a zero divisor. The algebra of biquaternions forms a composition algebra and can be constructed from bicomplex numbers. See ' below. Place in ring theory =Linear representation= Note the matrix product :begin{pmatrix}h & 00 & -hend{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix}0 & 1-1 & 0end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix}0 & hh & 0end{pmatrix}. Because h is the imaginary unit, each of these three arrays has a square equal to the negative of the identity matrix. When this matrix product is interpreted as i j = k, then one obtains a subgroup of matrices that is isomorphic to the quaternion group. Consequently, :begin{pmatrix}u+hv & w+hx-w+hx & u-hvend{pmatrix} represents biquaternion q = u 1 + v i + w j + x k. Given any 2 × 2 complex matrix, there are complex values u, v, w, and x to put it in this form so that the matrix ring M(2,C) is isomorphicLeonard Dickson (1914) Linear Algebras, §13 \\"Equivalence of the complex quaternion and matric algebras\\", page 13, via HathiTrust to the biquaternion ring. =Subalgebras= Considering the biquaternion algebra over the scalar field of real numbers , the set :{mathbf 1, h, mathbf i, hmathbf i, mathbf j, hmathbf j, mathbf k, hmathbf k } forms a basis so the algebra has eight real dimensions. The squares of the elements , and are all positive one, for example, . The subalgebra given by :lbrace x + y(hmathbf i) : x, y in mathbb R rbrace is ring isomorphic to the plane of split-complex numbers, which has an algebraic structure built upon the unit hyperbola. The elements and also determine such subalgebras. Furthermore, :lbrace x + ymathbf j : x,y in mathbb C rbrace is a subalgebra isomorphic to the tessarines. A third subalgebra called coquaternions is generated by and . It is seen that , and that the square of this element is . These elements generate the dihedral group of the square. The linear subspace with basis thus is closed under multiplication, and forms the coquaternion algebra. In the context of quantum mechanics and spinor algebra, the biquaternions , and (or their negatives), viewed in the representation, are called Pauli matrices. Algebraic properties The biquaternions have two conjugations: * the biconjugate or biscalar minus bivector is q^* = w - xmathbf i - ymathbf j - zmathbf k ! , and * the complex conjugation of biquaternion coefficients q^{star} = w^{star} + x^{star}mathbf i + y^{star}mathbf j + z^{star}mathbf k where z^{star} = a - bh when z = a + bh,quad a,b in mathbb R,quad h^2 = -mathbf 1. Note that (pq)^* = q^* p^*, quad (pq)^{star} = p^{star} q^{star} , quad (q^*)^{star} = (q^{star})^*. Clearly, if q q^* = 0 then is a zero divisor. Otherwise lbrace q q^* rbrace^{-mathbf 1} is defined over the complex numbers. Further, q q^* = q^* q is easily verified. This allows an inverse to be defined by * q^{-mathbf 1} = q^* lbrace q q^* rbrace^{-mathbf 1}, if qq^* eq 0. =Relation to Lorentz transformations= Consider now the linear subspace See equation 94.16, page 305. The following algebra compares to Lanczos, except he uses ~ to signify quaternion conjugation and * for complex conjugation :M = lbrace q : q^* = q^{star} rbrace = lbrace t + x(hmathbf i) + y(h mathbf j) + z(h mathbf k) : t, x, y, z in mathbb R rbrace . is not a subalgebra since it is not closed under products; for example (hmathbf i)(hmathbf j) = h^2 mathbf{ij} = -mathbf k otin M.. Indeed, cannot form an algebra if it is not even a magma. Proposition: If is in , then q q^* = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2. Proof: From the definitions, :begin{align}q q^* &= (t+xhmathbf i+yhmathbf j+zhmathbf k)(t-xhmathbf i-yhmathbf j-zhmathbf k) &= t^2 - x^2(hmathbf i)^2 - y^2(hmathbf j)^2 - z^2(hmathbf k)^2 = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2.end{align} Definition: Let biquaternion satisfy g g^* = mathbf 1. Then the Lorentz transformation associated with is given by :T(q) = g^* q g^{star}. Proposition: If is in , then is also in . Proof: (g^* q g^{star})^* = (g^{star})^* q^* g = (g^*)^{star} q^{star} g = (g^* q g^{star})^{star}. Proposition: quad T(q) (T(q))^* = q q^* Proof: Note first that means that the sum of the squares of its four complex components is one. Then the sum of the squares of the complex conjugates of these components is also one. Therefore, g^{star} (g^{star})^* = mathbf 1. Now :(g^* q g^{star})(g^* q g^{star})^* = g^* q g^{star} (g^{star})^* q^* g = g^* q q^* g = q q^*. Associated terminology As the biquaternions have been a fixture of linear algebra since the beginnings of mathematical physics, there is an array of concepts that are illustrated or represented by biquaternion algebra. The transformation group G = lbrace g : g g^* = 1 rbrace has two parts, G cap H and G cap M. The first part is characterized by g = g^{star} ; then the Lorentz transformation corresponding to is given by T(q) = g^{-1} q g since g^* = g^{-1}. Such a transformation is a rotation by quaternion multiplication, and the collection of them is O(3) cong G cap H . But this subgroup of is not a normal subgroup, so no quotient group can be formed. To view G cap M it is necessary to show some subalgebra structure in the biquaternions. Let represent an element of the sphere of square roots of minus one in the real quaternion subalgebra . Then and the plane of biquaternions given by D_r = lbrace z = x + yhr : x, y in mathbb R rbrace is a commutative subalgebra isomorphic to the plane of split-complex numbers. Just as the ordinary complex plane has a unit circle, D_r has a unit hyperbola given by :exp(ahr) = cosh(a) + hr sinh(a),quad a in R. Just as the unit circle turns by multiplication through one of its elements, so the hyperbola turns because exp(ahr) exp(bhr) = exp((a+b)hr). Hence these algebraic operators on the hyperbola are called hyperbolic versors. The unit circle in and unit hyperbola in are examples of one-parameter groups. For every square root of minus one in , there is a one-parameter group in the biquaternions given by G cap D_r. The space of biquaternions has a natural topology through the Euclidean metric on -space. With respect to this topology, is a topological group. Moreover, it has analytic structure making it a six- parameter Lie group. Consider the subspace of bivectors A = lbrace q : q^* = -q rbrace . Then the exponential map exp:A to G takes the real vectors to G cap H and the -vectors to G cap M. When equipped with the commutator, forms the Lie algebra of . Thus this study of a six-dimensional space serves to introduce the general concepts of Lie theory. When viewed in the matrix representation, is called the special linear group SL(2,C) in . Many of the concepts of special relativity are illustrated through the biquaternion structures laid out. The subspace corresponds to Minkowski space, with the four coordinates giving the time and space locations of events in a resting frame of reference. Any hyperbolic versor corresponds to a velocity in direction of speed where is the velocity of light. The inertial frame of reference of this velocity can be made the resting frame by applying the Lorentz boost given by since then g^{star} = exp(-0.5ahr) = g^* so that T(exp(ahr)) = 1 . Naturally the hyperboloid G cap M, which represents the range of velocities for sub-luminal motion, is of physical interest. There has been considerable work associating this \\"velocity space\\" with the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry. In special relativity, the hyperbolic angle parameter of a hyperbolic versor is called rapidity. Thus we see the biquaternion group provides a group representation for the Lorentz group. After the introduction of spinor theory, particularly in the hands of Wolfgang Pauli and Élie Cartan, the biquaternion representation of the Lorentz group was superseded. The new methods were founded on basis vectors in the set :lbrace q  : q q^* = 0 rbrace = lbrace w + xmathbf i + ymathbf j + zmathbf k  : w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0 rbrace which is called the complex light cone. The above representation of the Lorentz group coincides with what physicists refer to as four-vectors. Beyond four-vectors, the standard model of particle physics also includes other Lorentz representations, known as scalars, and the -representation associated with e.g. the electromagnetic field tensor. Furthermore, particle physics makes use of the representations (or projective representations of the Lorentz group) known as left- and right- handed Weyl spinors, Majorana spinors, and Dirac spinors. It is known that each of these seven representations can be constructed as invariant subspaces within the biquaternions. As a composition algebra Although W.R. Hamilton introduced biquaternions in the 19th century, its delineation of its mathematical structure as a special type of algebra over a field was accomplished in the 20th century: the biquaternions may be generated out of the bicomplex numbers in the same way that Adrian Albert generated the real quaternions out of complex numbers in the so-called Cayley–Dickson construction. In this construction, a bicomplex number (w,z) has conjugate (w,z)* = (w, – z). The biquaternion is then a pair of bicomplex numbers (a,b), where the product with a second biquaternion (c, d) is :(a,b)(c,d) = (a c - d^* b, d a + b c^* ). If a = (u, v), b = (w,z), then the biconjugate (a, b)^* = (a^*, -b). When (a,b)* is written as a 4-vector of ordinary complex numbers, :(u, v, w, z)^* = (u, -v, -w, -z). The biquaternions form an example of a quaternion algebra, and it has norm :N(u,v,w,z) = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + z^2 . Two biquaternions p and q satisfy N(p q) = N(p) N(q) indicating that N is a quadratic form admitting composition, so that the biquaternions form a composition algebra.

The term has pre-Conquest origins in Old English, deriving from the Old English bydel (\\"herald, messenger from an authority, preacher\\"), itself deriving from beodan (\\"to proclaim\\", which has a modern descendant in the English verb bid). In Old English it was a title given to an Anglo-Saxon officer who summoned householders to council. It is also known in Medieval Latin as bedellus. The Domesday Book refers to Beadles as bedelli or undersheriffs of manors.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge Vol III, (1846) Charles, Kinght, London, p.26  In religion  Mr. Bumble, a beadle in Oliver Twist, by 'Kyd' (Joseph Clayton Clarke) In England, the word came to refer to a parish constable of the Anglican Church, one often charged with duties of charity. A famous fictional constabulary beadle is Mr. Bumble from Charles Dickens's classic novel Oliver Twist, who oversees the parish workhouse and orphanage of a country town more than 75 miles from London.Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress (first book edition, Richard Bentley, London 1838): location, see Chapter VIII. The work of a real constabulary beadle of Whitechapel in that period may be exemplified by Richard Plunkett. In the Church of Scotland, the title is used for one who attends the minister during divine service as an assistant. In Judaism, the term beadle or sexton (in ) is sometimes used for the gabbai, the caretaker or \\"man of all work\\", in a synagogue. Moishe the Beadle, the caretaker of a synagogue in Sighet in the 1940s, is an important character in Night by Elie Wiesel.  In education  In the medieval universities, beadles were students chosen by instructors to act as assistants: carrying books, taking attendance, and assisting in classroom management. The Esquire Bedell of the University of Cambridge, carrying one of the university maces In the some universities in England the post of bedel or esquire bedell still exists as a ceremonial role. At the University of Oxford there are six bedels whose role is defined as being to \\"attend upon the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors and other participating dignitaries on such occasions, and assist them and other University members to carry out ceremonial duties\\" and to \\"deputise for the University Verger as necessary\\". At the University of Cambridge there are two esquire bedells who \\"have certain important responsibilities at congregations\\", including carrying the university's ceremonial maces, the senior esquire bedell also having \\"general responsibility for the correct formulation and wearing of academical dress\\". At Durham University there are two bedels; their role are to lead the graduand and academic processions carrying the university mace and Durham Cathedral's verge, and to direct students and honorary graduates at graduation and matriculation ceremonies. Bedels are also used at Newcastle University and the University of Bath, where they bear the university mace at graduation ceremonies, and at Keele University, where they bear a ceremonial baton and are accompanied by a mace bearer. The Ceremonial Bedellus of Glasgow Caledonian University carrying the university's ceremonial mace Some universities in Scotland, including the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow and the University of Dundee, have a ceremonial bedellus, who may also be the head janitor and be responsible for the maintenance of the university buildings. The bedellus traditionally carries or leads the mace in procession and may also be responsible for hooding graduates. Some Commonwealth and US universities also have beadles in ceremonial roles, under a variety of different spellings. These include the bedel at Emory University, who is traditionally the president of the Student Government Association, the esquire or madam bedel at the University of Canterbury, the bedel at McMaster University, the esquire bedel at the Australian National University, the esquire bedell at the University of New England, and the beadle at the University of Queensland. At some Dutch universities, including the University of Amsterdam and Utrecht University the Office of the Beadle manages doctoral and other ceremonies. Jesuit secondary schools formerly maintained the post of beadle—some still do. In each classroom, a student designated as beadle reports attendance to the teacher, acts as messenger, assists in distributing materials, and leads the class in activities. The position of Beadle also exists at the King's School, Canterbury, where the beadle's task is making sure that pupils are dressed correctly and arrive at lessons on time.  Other uses  Outside of religious and educational institutions, the designation of \\"Beadle\\" is most often held by officers of secular bodies of some antiquity. Sometimes the title is used by uniformed security guards. For example, security duties at the Burlington Arcade, an upmarket shopping mall in Piccadilly, London, are carried out by staff called Beadles wearing what appear to be nineteenth century uniforms.Burlington Arcade Beadles The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire employs a Beadle to perform ceremonial duties. = City of London = In the City of London the title is held by two distinct groups; both originated as \\"executors\\" or police for more senior persons. The first group are the Ward Beadles, who hold the oldest elected office in the City (as functionaries, not as representatives) in their Wards. Their duties today are largely ceremonial in that they accompany the Aldermen in the eight major ceremonies of the civic calendar and open and close the Wardmotes (the election meetings for members of the City's Courts of Aldermen and Common Council). The second group are paid employees of the Livery Companies of the City. These Beadles are usually assistants to the Company's Clerk, being responsible for attendance on the Court and Master of the Company, originally to enforce its trade policy and uphold discipline (especially among the Company's apprentices) but now to act as Masters of Ceremony at formal banquets and to accompany the Master on civic occasions. The title \\"Hall Beadle\\" is sometimes used by the Hall Manager of a Livery Hall responsible for the Company's treasure and the efficient running of the hall, especially if let on a commercial basis.

The city of Los Angeles owns the entire zoo, its land and facilities, and the animals. Animal care, grounds maintenance, construction, education, public information, and administrative staff are city employees. As of June 2019, Denise M. Verret serves as the zoo's director, the first female African American director of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited institution.https://www.dailynews.com/2019/07/07/meet- the-la-zoos-new-director/ History The first zoo, called the Griffith Park Zoo, opened in 1912 and was located about south of the current zoo site until it was closed in August 1966. Remnants of the original zoo remain. The site of the current zoo was formerly the location of Rodger Young Village, which was itself built on the land which had been used for the Griffith Park Aerodrome. The zoo opened in its present location on November 28, 1966. By the early 1990s, the zoo's infrastructure was deteriorating. In January 1992, a ten-inch water pipe burst, leaving half of the zoo without water. The next day, city officials passed a $300 million master plan that had been recently drafted to deal with the infrastructure problems and inadequate exhibits. The zoo nearly lost its accreditation in 1995 because of deplorable conditions; however it rebounded under a new director.L.A. Zoo Wrestles WIth Gorilla Escapes, ABC News, December 18, 2000, accessed April 13, 2013. In 1998, the zoo opened Chimpanzees of the Mahale Mountains, followed by Red Ape RainForest in 2000, the Komodo Dragon Exhibit, the Winnick Family Children Zoo in 2001, the Entry Plaza, Children's Discovery Center and Sea Lion Cliffs (now Sea Life Cliffs) in 2005, Campo Gorilla Reserve in November 2007, Elephants of Asia in the winter of 2010, and the LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles) in 2012. On June 26, 2012, a chimpanzee infant baby, born to Gracie, a member of a 15-chimpanzee tribe (one of the largest chimpanzee tribes of any North American zoo), was mauled to death by an adult male chimpanzee. The zoo said this event was totally unexpected, although it also stated that acts of aggression by male chimpanzees (toward humans, or toward a rival male chimpanzee over territory or a desired female) are always a possibility—indeed, there have been several well-known cases of male chimpanzee aggression in recent years. Gracie was allowed to keep her baby overnight to grieve, and counseling was being offered to staff (none had witnessed the event), and to the visitors who had seen the event. It is reexamining its policy of how it introduces baby chimpanzees to the tribe. =Escapes= The Los Angeles Zoo has had a number of notable escaped animals over the years. A particular spate of escapes took place during the late 1990s and early 2000s when, in half a decade, at least 35 animals escaped the zoo including zebras, chimps, kangaroos and antelopes.Josh Sanburn, Evelyn the Gorilla, Los Angeles, Time, March 30, 2011, accessed April 13, 2013. Evelyn, the gorilla, escaped her enclosure approximately five times. In one widely covered incident, she used some overgrown vines to pull herself out of her exhibit. She then had full run of the zoo for an hour as TV-news copters hovered overhead and visitors were evacuated before she was tranquilized. In a prior incident, she hopped on the back of another gorilla, Jim, to make her escape (Jim had also previously escaped). Part of the problem was the gorilla habitat was originally intended to house bears. The situation was relieved by the opening of the specially designed Campo Gorilla Reserve in 2007. In 1979, Virginia, the wolf, escaped the zoo multiple times by ascending trees, climbing fences, and walking along branches until she could escape. At one time she eluded capture for a month by hiding in Griffith Park. It is unclear whether Virginia was ever recaptured.Josh Sanburn, Virginia the Wolf, Los Angeles, Time, March 30, 2011, accessed April 13, 2013. In 2014, a bighorn sheep escaped from its enclosure, and ultimately the zoo itself. It was struck by a car approximately three hours later, and subsequently died. Exhibits and attractions =Botanical Gardens= In 2002, the zoo became a certified botanical gardens and the official name of the institution was changed to the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Spread throughout zoo grounds, there are 15 different collections, highlighting over 800 different plant species, with a total of over 7,400 individual plants. =Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains= Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains, a one-acre (0.4-ha) exhibit complex, opened in 1998 and houses chimpanzees. The hillside exhibit is dotted with boulders, palm trees, and an artificial termite mound, and features a waterfall next to a tall rock ledge where the troop's leader can survey much of the area. Guests can view the animals across various moats or through a glass viewing window. =Campo Gorilla Reserve= One of several viewing locations within the Campo Gorilla Reserve. Campo Gorilla Reserve opened in November 2007 and features western lowland gorillas in a complex. Guests can view the animals through two glass observation windows and three other locations. On January 18, 2020, the Los Angeles Zoo welcomed an endangered western lowland gorilla, the first to be born at the zoo in over two decades. Plants in the exhibit include palms, pomegranates, and ferns. =Elephants of Asia= This $42 million exhibit complex at the center of the zoo opened in 2010 and houses Asian elephants and other southeast Asian wildlife. The main elephant enclosure is and has a barn used for medical exams. The complex is divided into several areas, each based on a different country in the elephants' range. The Thai Pavilion teaches visitors about the role of elephant labor in Thailand's economy. Guests can find information about elephant conservation in India at Elephants of India Plaza, which also has a waterfall where the animals can bathe. The Elephants of China section houses sarus crane and Chinese water deer in a marsh habitat and has information about the history of the Dai people and their relationship with elephants. =The LAIR= The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), which opened in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and terrestrial arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases Gray's monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for Madagascar radiated tortoise, Madagascar spider tortoise, desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials. =Red Ape Rain Forest= Three Bornean orangutans rest amongst bamboo sway poles and a creek. Red Ape Rain Forest, a recreation of a Southeast Asian jungle, opened in 2000 and houses Bornean orangutans. The mesh enclosure, which has openings for the guest path to go through, is shaped like a horizontal donut and back-dropped by hibiscus, bamboo, and rubber trees. The apes can climb on artificial sway poles, branches, and vines placed throughout the exhibit or wade in a shallow stream. Visitors enter the exhibit through an Indonesian pagoda, continue over the stream on a deck bridge, and arrive at a small pavilion with a glass viewing window. The path next leads to a large central deck where guests can view the entirety of the surrounding exhibit. Afterwards, guests proceed to an interpretive area with traditional Indonesian folklore and exit the exhibit area through another pagoda. =Rainforest of the Americas= \\"Rainforest of the Americas\\" features animals who live in the tropical regions of North, Central, and South America. It opened in 2014 and houses the uakari, southern black howler monkey, red-bellied piranha, keel- billed toucan, harpy eagle, Goliath bird-eating spider, giant river otter, emerald tree boa, cotton-top tamarin, Baird's tapir, jaguar and other species.

It is one of the few zoos worldwide to have the mountain tapir, and is the only zoo outside of Peru and Brazil to house the red uakari. https://zooscape.lazoo.org/2019/09/01/remembering-inti/ It was one of the first zoos to successfully breed echidnas and gave birth to the first Coquerel's sifaka outside of Madagascar, the sifaka's native homeland. Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA) was created in 1963 and is a nonprofit corporation created to support the Los Angeles Zoo in its mission to nurture wildlife and enrich the human experience. GLAZA's primary responsibility is to seek and provide financial support for the zoo's programs and capital projects. GLAZA also provides support through membership, organizing special events and travel programs, producing award-winning publications, coordinating one of the largest zoo volunteer programs in the country, administering the contract for visitor services concessions within the zoo, and supporting community relations, and public relations. Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center Named after philanthropists Robert and Suzanne Gottlieb, the Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center is a facility situated in a restricted area in the upper reaches of the zoo. Among other features, it includes a state-of-the-art intensive care unit, an on-site commissary, a surgical suite with observation area, and research facilities. In 2007 the facility handled 853 medical cases. The smallest patient treated was a spider tortoise (0.08 kg) and the largest was an Asian elephant (4,826 kg). Shows and activities Daphne the hedgehog, part of the Animals & You Program California Condor Rescue Zone (CCRZ): The CCRZ is a play space designed for children ages 6 and up, where they can learn how California condors are protected. The area also features live webcam feeds of the California Condors, which are not currently exhibited because of the sensitive nature of the rescue work. World of Birds Show: Birds of prey and other endangered birds perform. Show times: 11:30am and 3:30pm, daily, except Tuesdays. The World of Birds Show is currently running but the birds are still in training. Animals & You Program: These 15-minute-long animal presentations take place at stations in the Winnick Family Children's Zoo. Winnick Family Children's Zoo: Located at the top of Winnick Family Children's Zoo, this petting zoo enables visitors to pet goats and sheep in an animal contact area known as Muriel's Ranch. Brushes are available at Muriel's Ranch for visitors to groom the domestic animals. Neil Papiano Play Park: The Neil Papiano Play Park (located in the upper zoo along the perimeter road) incorporates animal-themed climbing sculptures, large play structures, a toddler area, water misters, grassy landscaping, and a large picnic area. It was designed to be accessible to all children visiting the zoo, including those with medical and physical challenges. Los Angeles Zoo Magnet Center Zoo Magnet Center Campus The North Hollywood High School Zoo Magnet Center is located across the street from the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Griffith Park. The program was established in 1981 in the hopes of \\"a vision of providing a racially, ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse group of motivated students an enriched curriculum in animal and biological sciences.\\" The Zoo Magnet Center offers 300 Los Angeles high school students a college preparatory curriculum focused on animal studies and biological sciences. It is also run by the Los Angeles Unified School District. The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Garden's partnership with the Zoo Magnet Center provides high school students with opportunities to study and to practice wildlife conservation, animal care, biology, chemistry, and environmental stewardship in a hands-on environment.

Neihardt, an American poet and writer, who relates the story of Black Elk, an Oglala Lakota medicine man. Black Elk spoke in Lakota and Black Elk's son, Ben Black Elk, who was present during the talks, translated his father's words into English. Neihardt made notes during these talks which he later used as the basis for his book. The prominent psychologist Carl Jung read the book in the 1930s and urged its translation into German; in 1955, it was published as Ich rufe mein Volk (I Call My People). Reprinted in the US in 1961, with a 1988 edition named Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux, as told through John G. Neihardt (Flaming Rainbow) and a State University of New York Press 2008 Premier Edition annotated by Lakota scholar Raymond DeMallie, the book has found an international audience. However, the book has come under fire for what critics describe as inaccurate representations of Lakota culture and beliefs.  Background  In the summer of 1930, as part of his research into the Native American perspective on the Ghost Dance movement, the poet and writer John G. Neihardt, already the Nebraska poet laureate, received the necessary permission from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to go to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Accompanied by his two daughters, he went to meet an Oglala holy man named Black Elk. His intention was to talk to someone who had participated in the Ghost Dance. For the most part, the reservations were not then open to visitors. At age 13, Black Elk had also been part of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and he survived the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre. Neihardt recounts that Black Elk invited him back for interviews. Flying Hawk served as their translator. Neihardt writes that Black Elk told him of his visions, including one in which he saw himself as a \\"sixth grandfather\\" - the spiritual representative of the earth and of mankind. Neihardt also states that Black Elk shared some of the Oglala rituals which he had performed as a healer, and that two men developed a close friendship. Neihardt's daughter, Hilda Neihardt, says Black Elk adopted her, her sister, and their father as relatives, giving each of them Lakota names.  Controversy  Though Black Elk was Oglala Lakota, the book was written by Neihardt, a non-Native. While the book is lauded by non-Native audiences, and has been inspirational to many New Age groups, traditional Lakota people and Native American scholars do not consider the book to be representative of Lakota beliefs. They have debated the accuracy of the account, which has elements of a collaborative autobiography, spiritual text, and other genres. The Indiana University professor Raymond DeMallie, who has studied the Lakota by cultural and linguistic resources, published \\"The Sixth Grandfather\\" in 1985 including the original transcripts of the conversations with Black Elk, plus his own introduction, analysis and notes. He has questioned whether Neihardt's account is accurate and fully represents the views or words of Black Elk. The primary criticism made by DeMallie and similar scholars is that Neihardt, as the author and editor, may have exaggerated or altered some parts of the story to make it more accessible and marketable to the intended white audience of the 1930s, or because he did not fully understand the Lakota context. Late twentieth-century editions of the book by Nebraska University Press have addressed this issue by entitling the book as Black Elk Speaks, as told through John G. Neihardt (aka \\"Flaming Rainbow\\").  Ben Black Elk  After serving as translator for his father in 1931, and increasingly after his father's death in 1950, Ben Black Elk visited local schools on the Pine Ridge Reservation to tell the traditional stories of the Lakota history and culture.

In 2009, Lowry Park Zoo was voted the #1 Family Friendly Zoo in the US by Parents Magazine, and is recognized by the State of Florida as the center for Florida wildlife conservation and biodiversity (HB 457). The zoo is operated by the Lowry Park Zoological Society, an independent 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The zoo also exists as a center for conservation of endangered wildlife both locally and around the globe. Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) as well as a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG), the Florida Association of Zoos and Aquariums (FAZA) and the Florida Attractions Association (FAA). ZooTampa traces its origins to a small animal exhibit that was located on the grounds of the University of Tampa in downtown. It moved to its current location as the Lowry Park Zoo in 1957, and was completely rebuilt and reconfigured in 1989. The zoo rebranded itself as ZooTampa at Lowry Park in 2018 as part of another renovation and expansion project. Nearly 1 million people visit the 65-acre zoo a year to see its more than 1,300 animals. History Tampa's first zoo was a small collection of exotic animals in Plant Park on the grounds of the University of Tampa across the Hillsborough River from downtown. During the middle 1950s, Mayor Nick Nuccio led the push to move the zoo to a more spacious location. Land further up the river near the neighborhood of Seminole Heights was chosen. The park was created in 1925 and christened Lowry Park for Sumter de Leon Lowry Sr., a Tampa city commissioner and civic leader who was also active in the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Lowry's son, Sumter de Leon Lowry Jr., later made significant contributions to improve the park, including donating money to construct a bandstand and paying the purchase price for an elephant which he then donated to the zoo. The old rainbow bridge to Fairyland, Lowry Park Zoo, c. 1980 Lowry Park Zoo opened in 1957. The zoo shared the park with Fairyland, where concrete statues depicting fairy tales and nursery rhymes were along a winding maze of paths beneath the limbs of sprawling oak trees. This whimsical area was accessible via a large rainbow bridge. As the wildlife collection grew, other attractions and rides were also added. By the early 1980s, the zoo featured a small roller coaster, a skyride, and a kid-sized train, among other kiddie rides. However, the zoo facilities were in need of repair and renovation, with the animals cramped concrete quarters so poor that the Humane Society called it \\"one of the worst zoos in America\\". After several years of fundraising and with the help and support of mayor Bob Martinez and the city of Tampa, the original Lowry Park Zoo closed on September 7, 1987 for a $20 million reconstruction in which nearly all traces of the original zoo (including Fairyland) were removed and replaced with more modern facilities. The first phase of the revamped zoo opened on March 5, 1988. Several additions and expansions since then have brought the zoo to its current configuration. In March 2018, Joseph Couceiro, the zoo's CEO, introduced a new logo and signage. Formerly Lowry Park Zoo, the name was changed to ZooTampa at Lowry Park to emphasize not only its connections to Tampa and the region, but the progress the area is undergoing as well. Over the next 10 years, Couceiro wants to continue to expand and redesign several zoo features. Exhibits =Asian Gardens= One of the zoos oldest sections, the Asian Domain, was renovated and renamed the Asian Gardens in 2007. Exhibits there include Indian rhinoceros, Malayan tigers, babirusa, Komodo dragon, clouded leopards, Anoas, sloth bears, and an Indonesian-themed aviary. The pagoda-like design is subtle but noticeable, giving an authentic Asian feel. The area also has a Sulawesi aviary, which includes bleeding-heart doves, mandarin ducks, giant Asian pond turtles and Reeve's muntjac deer. =Florida Wildlife Center= The Florida Wildlife Center is an American-based exhibit that stretches across nearly a half-mile, accessible through Asian Gardens. The exhibit includes many North American species and a few Central American species, including striped skunks, Orinoco crocodiles, North American black bears, a small pack of red wolves, West Indian manatees, and alligator snapping turtles. It also includes a manatee education show, an aquatic center with sharks, eels, seahorses, and a wide collection of snakes, including eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, copperheads, and eastern coral snakes. A Discovery Center highlights the amphibian residents of the zoo, showcasing various species of frogs, toads and other creatures. =Primate World= The primate section of the zoo is possibly the best designed portion of the zoo, with every exhibit seemingly being connected by a running system of rocky waterfalls and waterways that stretch across the entire section. There is an array of great apes in the siamang gibbons, chimpanzees and Bornean orangutans that swing and hoot around their exhibits. There is also a wide array of other primates, including Angolan black-and- white colobus monkeys, golden lion tamarins, ring-tailed lemurs and mandrills. =Wallaroo Station= The Wallaroo Station Children's Zoo re-opened on February 27, 2015 after its first renovation since opening in 2002. It is home to an array of Australian-native species including koalas, yellow-footed rock wallabies, Australian singing dogs and emus, along with a varying collection of cockatoo parrots, and flying fox bats. This section of the zoo is home to an interactive bat habitat, a \\"Flying Bananas\\" ride, a budgie encounter and a family rollercoaster. It also has splash play area for younger kids titled \\"The Billabong\\". =Safari Africa= The latest addition to Lowry, providing a completely authentic African experience. Shaded by acacia trees, the area is home to a safari tram ride that provides an in-depth look behind the scenes of the zoo. Martial eagles and Patas monkeys are visible only by this ride. This exhibit is home to many landmark African species, including meerkats, duikers, Reticulated giraffes, zebras, African bush elephants, East African crowned cranes, African penguins and southern white rhinoceroses. The Ituri Forest, a later addition to the Safari Africa section, brought in the concept of a washed-out African river bank. The area includes a wide array of species, including greater flamingos, pygmy hippopotamuses, saddle-billed storks and shoebill storks. In mid-to late 2014, the warthog exhibit was closed down and renovated to house Aldabra tortoises and juvenile Galapagos giant tortoises, who were previously behind-the-scenes exclusive animals. =Main Aviary= The main free-flight aviary, accessible nearly at the entrance, is almost hidden in overgrown brush and plants, giving the feel of a wild experience. Inside, the whole area is covered head-to-toe in free-flight birds and waterfowl, including great hornbills, red-legged seriemas, toco toucans, boat-billed herons,:File:Boat billed Heron at Lowry Park Zoo by Lee.webm, 13 April 2015, Boat billed Heron at Lowry Park Zoo by Lee.webm African openbill storks, scarlet ibises, white-faced whistling ducks, guineafowl, Raggiana Birds-of- paradise and an array of ducks and tanagers. Every so often, if you hang around, you can observe two-toed sloths lazily hanging in the trees. =Spirits of the Sky Raptor Show= This show, held twice a day at the Zooventures Theater, is a fun and interactive experience that provides kids and adults alike with fun facts of birds of prey and what we can do to protect them. Some of the exhibited species include the Eurasian eagle-owl, the bald eagle and the Andean condor. =Conservation= The zoo has 95 Species Survival Plan projects, which includes threatened and endangered species and species of special concern. These include chimpanzees, Bornean orangutans, mandrills, siamangs, black-and-white colobus monkeys, golden lion tamarins, Indian rhinoceroses, clouded leopards, sloth bears, babirusa, red wolves, African elephants, Bali mynah, Victoria crowned pigeon, great Indian hornbills, palm cockatoo, and Komodo dragon programs. The zoo hosts a hospital for Florida manatees in which injured animals are rehabilitated with the intent of returning them to the wild. It is the only non-profit hospital in the world specifically dedicated to critical care for injured, sick and orphaned wild manatees. The zoo works in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to rescue, rehabilitate and release Florida’s endangered manatees. In 2012, Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo was honored with a “Significant Achievement in North American Conservation Award” for its work with manatees, presented by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). = Rides = Starting with the Australia addition, Lowry Park Zoo has added several children's rides, including a merry go round, \\"Flying Bananas\\", a kiddie train ride, and a mini roller coaster called the Tasmanian Tiger Family Coaster. Roaring Springs, which opened in June 2018, is a shoot the chute ride manufactured by WhiteWater West. The ride features a single three-story drop that splashes riders and onlookers standing in the attraction's splash zone. Roaring Springs replaced the former log flume. Controversies =Tiger escape= In 2006, one of the zoo's two Sumatran tigers, a 14-year-old female named Enshala, slipped through an unlocked gate and into an area undergoing renovation. The zoo director, Lex Salisbury, defended his decision to shoot and kill the animal after attempts to tranquilize the tiger failed and the animal lurched toward the animal doctor that had shot the tranquilizer dart. Later in 2006, a group known as \\"Tampa's Zoo Advocates\\" formed. The organization seeks to improve the living conditions of the animals as well as working conditions of the employees of Lowry Park Zoo. =Salisbury scandal= In April 2008, 15 patas monkeys escaped from Safari Wild, a for-profit animal attraction under development east of Tampa in rural Polk County.Escape from Monkey Island sptimes.com This brought media attention to the venture, which is owned and operated by long-time Lowry Park Zoo director Lex Salisbury. Subsequent investigations revealed many questionable transactions between Safari Wild and Lowry Park Zoo, including the transfer of over 200 zoo animals to Safari Wild, zoo funds being used to build structures on Safari Wild property, and payments from the zoo to \\"board\\" animals at Safari Wild. The city of Tampa, which provides a portion of the zoo's annual budget, demanded an audit detailing the relationship between Lowry Park, Salisbury, and his outside business ventures. The audit was released in December 2008 and disclosed many questionable dealing between the zoo and Safari Wild. It also uncovered violations of zoo policies by Salisbury, including increasing his own bonus payments, charging the zoo for personal travel, and using zoo employees for his personal work. Auditors estimated that Salisbury owed the zoo more than $200,000 and suggested a criminal investigation. On December 19, 2008, Salisbury, under pressure from the zoo's board of directors and the city of Tampa, resigned from his position at the zoo. As a result of possible violations of animal transfer rules and species survival plans, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended the membership of Lowry Park Zoo and of Larry Killmar, the zoo's Director of Collections who had authorized many of Salisbury's questionable animal transfers. Under Killmar, the zoo reorganized its internal policies over several months, and on March 27, 2009, the AZA reinstated the membership of both Lowry Park Zoo and its director of collections. The saga came to a close in August 2009 when Salisbury and the Lowry Park Zoo board agreed to a settlement in which Salisbury paid $2,200 and agreed to return all the structures, fencing, and equipment that the zoo had built at Safari Wild but did not admit to any wrongdoing.Salisbury settles with Lowry Park Zoo - St. Petersburg Times Tampabay.com.

It is part of the Audubon Nature Institute which also manages the Aquarium of the Americas. The zoo covers and is home to 2,000 animals. It is located in a section of Audubon Park in Uptown New Orleans, on the Mississippi River side of Magazine Street. The zoo and park are named in honor of artist and naturalist John James Audubon who lived in New Orleans starting in 1821. Some of the exhibits include gorillas, orangutans, and the Louisiana swamp exhibit. It is also home to a rare white alligator with blue eyes. The zoo is open year-round Tuesday through Sunday and Monday through Sunday in the spring and summer, except Mardi Gras, the First Friday in May, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. History WPA work on Monkey Island, 1936 The site of the zoo has housed animal exhibits since the World Cotton Centennial 1884 Exhibition World's Fair. The current zoo was not built until the early 20th century. A flight cage has been in it since 1916. During the boom of the 1920s many additions were made; the sea lion pool with neo-classical columns from 1928 can still be seen today, as can a few art nouveau buildings later used as a reptile exhibit. Lemur During the Great Depression a $400,000 expansion of the zoo was conducted by the Works Progress Administration. Many new cages were constructed, along with an artificial hill known as \\"Monkey Hill\\", built to show the children of relatively flat New Orleans what a hill looks like. Locals claim Monkey Hill to be the highest point in New Orleans, although another artificial hill in City Park competes for that title. By the early 1970s, the zoo had fallen into a state of decay. The small prison-like brick and steel bar cages constructed by the WPA were no longer considered appropriate environments for many of the animals displayed within them. A study suggested that the zoo should be closed down unless the city could make a major commitment to upgrade it. City government, local businesses, and private citizens rallied in support of it, and in 1975 the city's voters approved a measure to finance its rebuilding. Zoo grounds were expanded from 14 to 50 acres (57,000 to 200,000 m2). By the end of the decade, the Audubon Zoo was already well on its way to becoming one of the finest in the United States. This is one of four Asian elephants at the zoo More improvements and expansions continued into the 21st century, making the Audubon Zoo popular not only with locals but also drawing substantial numbers of tourists visiting from other states and nations. In 1987, an alligator nest was discovered with 18 freshly hatched babies with white hides--an extraordinary natural mutation called leucism (they are not albino). They received much attention when they went on display and became a symbol of the zoo. In 1990, the Audubon Institute, which manages the zoo, opened the Aquarium of the Americas in the CBD at the edge of the French Quarter. Some of the white alligators were transferred to there, and a riverboat began service taking visitors between the facilities. The WPA-era Monkey Hill, a favorite landmark of generations of New Orleans children, underwent extensive renovation in the early 21st century, including the addition of a waterfall for young children to play in, a rope web that goes to the summit (which now has statues of lions), and a 20-foot (6 m) high \\"safari outpost\\" at the base of the hill. For posterity's sake, a portion of it was left as grass, so that children can still roll down it. Amur leopard In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, followed by severe consequences in the devastating aftermath of the storm. During the hurricane, zoo staff found refuge in the reptile house, which was apparently designed to withstand a major hurricane. Located on high ground atop an old natural river levee, it was not flooded. The majority of the animals survived --only three died--and the only major damage was downed trees. However, the zoo was short on food and other necessities in the days after the storm, and pumps were overheating. The fact that the zoo sustained only minor damage can be attributed to disaster planning and its location on high ground. Zoo curator Dan Maloney was quoted as saying, \\"The zoo had planned for years for the catastrophic storm that has long been predicted for New Orleans.\\" The zoo reopened for Thanksgiving weekend in November 2005 and initiated a weekends- only schedule due to financial constraints. On March 1, 2006, it began a Wednesday through Sunday schedule, and eventually expanded to Tuesday through Sunday. For a period around 2011 the Lycée Français de la Nouvelle-Orléans (LFNO) used three rooms at the zoo as classrooms on a temporary basis.Morris, Robert. \\"Lycee Francais nearing deal for new school building.\\" Uptown Messenger. November 14, 2011. Retrieved on August 3, 2012. On 14 July 2018, a jaguar escaped through the roof of its enclosure, killing six animals and injuring another three before being recaptured. The incident occurred before the zoo had opened. Notable attractions Swamp house after Hurricane Katrina, in 2007 =Swamp exhibit= This exhibit is primarily outdoors, housing many samples of animals native to southern Louisiana. These include black bears, raccoons, river otters, nutria, cottonmouth, copperhead, various colubrids, leucistic alligators, and a number of normal American ones. After Hurricane Katrina, it was thematically decorated to mimic the scenes seen around the city. There was a small refrigerator taped up outside of the front door, a blue tarp stretched over the roof, and a marking that indicated no casualties were found in it, rather, that the eight alligators that inhabit it were fed with the notion of the number 8 and \\"Gators Fed\\" =Reptile encounter= One of the newer and more famous residents of this exhibit is the Komodo dragon. Many other animals are also housed here, including the beaded lizard, Gila monster, green anaconda, reticulated python, gaboon viper, rattlesnake, caiman, and quite a few other reptiles and amphibians.

Druid Hill was opened in 1860 as the first major park purchase by the City under foreseeing Mayor Thomas Swann (1809-1883), (and later as 33rd Governor of Maryland, 1866-1869) and was later designed by famed nationally- known landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), with additional work on various park buildings contributed by future Baltimore City Hall architect George A. Frederick (1842-1924), and Park Commissioner John H.B. Latrobe (son of earlier famed British-American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe [1764-1820]), who also was an accomplished lawyer, author, artist, amateur architect and civic leader. Olmsted had earlier won a contest for the design of plans for New York City's famed Central Park in mid-town Manhattan in 1858, a year after it opened, and worked on the massive public works project during its construction from 1858 to 1873. The Maryland Zoo is now currently home to over 2,000 animals, and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). History The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is generally considered to be the third oldest (or by some other circumstances, the second oldest) zoological park in the United States, having opened in 1876, sixteen years after the historic Park itself was purchased and opened to the city public. For a number of decades in the 20th century, it was operated and supervised by the Baltimore City Board of Park Commissioners, and organized in 1860 with the first major city park at Druid Hill and later the city Department of Parks and Recreation, through their subordinate Bureau of the Zoo. It was later assisted by the organization of a group of supportive friends, animal and wildlife lovers in the Baltimore City Zoological Society, which performed a saving function in the late 1960s when changing demographic and historical populations in the surrounding communities around Druid Hill Park resulted in increased crime and some harassment incidents to the animal population, resulting in a few deaths and maimings, resulted in a protective fence erected around the Zoo campus, and entrance ticketing center and gates which previously had been open to the surrounding Park. In later decades, by 2004, a course of action between the City and the Society resulted in a semi-private and new independent operation arrangement with a separate board of trustees for the Zoo with increased private, state and suburban counties funding to supplement the restricting resources of the central City. This also resulted in a renaming of the old City Zoo as \\"The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.\\" For several decades from the 1950s to the 1970s, the City Zoo was made famous locally through the media-savvy and through the new medium of television with programs and promotions of Dr. Arthur Watson, the long-time zoo director. In 1980, when the famous iconic \\"Harborplace\\" festival marketplace pavilions at the Inner Harbor by developer James Rouse, opened by downtown Baltimore's waterfront business district and its Patapsco River and Harbor, one of the stalls/stores was of stuffed and children's play fiber animals called \\"Dr. Watson's Zoo,\\" owned and operated by the now retired Dr. Watson. In 2004, the zoo was struck by financial problems and was forced to reduce its collection size temporarily by closing parts of the zoo. The original Main Valley was closed due to its age, being incapable of holding animals comfortably with their older style of iron-barred cages and stone walls, and in addition, the Reptile House which is located some distance away from the main zoo in an adjacent section of the Park was closed. The reptiles, as well as gibbons, tigers, and snow leopards, were sent to other zoos and aquariums. By 2008, Baltimore's Maryland Zoo was featured in \\"America's Best Zoos 2008.\\" The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore has been always active in many conservation programs, notably \\"Polar Bears International,\\" \\"Project Golden Frog,\\" and their work with African black-footed penguins; it is the American zoo that has bred the greatest number of African black footed penguins. It also helps rehabilitate local wildlife, especially birds of prey, such as bald eagles. Exhibits Ara chloroptera at a keeper talk Samson with one of his keepers Giraffe ready for closeup The Stream at Maryland Wilderness Penguin Coast The zoo has five main areas: Schaefer Plaza, Zoo Central, Maryland Wilderness, Polar Bear Watch, and African Journey. Visitors enter the main ticketing gate of the zoo at Schaefer Plaza named in honor of former Baltimore Mayor and Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer (1921-2011). The plaza features a gift shop, a playground area known as \\"Celebration Hill\\", the zoo's original lion statues, and the Prairie dog exhibit. Prior to the zoo's redesign in the early 2000s, guests would continue down the historic \\"Main Valley\\", to access the exhibits. A tram now connects visitors to Zoo Central free of charge. Zoo Central features a concessions area, carousel, and children's train ride that traverses the north side of the African Journey exhibit. =African Journey= The largest area of the zoo, \\"The African Journey\\" displays a wide range of animals originating from the continent of Africa. The main exhibit areas are: * African Aviary: features an enclosed walk-through aviary home to the blue- bellied roller, hadada ibis, African spoonbill, Von der Decken's hornbill, hamerkop, fulvous whistling duck, Spur-winged lapwing, Waldrapp ibis, Red- crested pochard, Marbled duck, African pygmy goose and blue duiker * African Watering Hole: Features a watering hole environment with dama gazelle (Addra), lesser kudu, saddle-billed stork, white rhinoceros, plains zebra, and ostrich. The Caribbean flamingo, Black crowned crane, white stork, ground hornbill, Sitatunga, Leopard tortoise, Spur-thighed tortoise, Amur leopard, Cheetah, and Cape porcupine are located around the watering hole area along the boardwalk. * African Overlook: Features the lion exhibit area and giraffe viewing area. Warthog and Kirk's dik-dik are located nearby. * Chimpanzee Forest: Indoor and outdoor areas home to the chimpanzee, colobus monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, Panamanian golden frogs, East African black mud turtle and slender-snouted crocodile. * Elephant Savannah: Large observation area for the African elephant. * Giraffe Crossing: home to the Giraffe house, feeding station, and okapi. * Lemur Lane: Exhibit featuring the Red ruffed lemur and ring-tailed lemur. Renovations on the elephant exhibit facility began 2007. In March 2006, the Maryland Zoo announced it would be accepting three female African elephants from the Philadelphia Zoo in Pennsylvania as part of the expanded elephant exhibit, but construction was then indefinitely delayed and later the elephant loan was canceled. However, two new elephants came to the Maryland Zoo from Arkansas in 2007. On March 19, 2008, \\"Felix,\\" one of the Zoo's female elephants, gave birth to a 290-pound male calf, the first elephant born in the Zoo's history. The baby is named \\"Samson\\" and is now viewable, weather permitting. By In the spring of 2010, the Zoo's warthogs had two male offspring, which were viewable beginning in May of that year. On December 29, 2019, the Zoo welcomed a baby chimpanzee after an 8 month gestation period. In February 2017, the first giraffe calf was born at the Zoo in over 20 years. Willow was born to parents Juma and Caesar, and was 6'1\\", and 125 lbs at birth. In March 2018, the zoo announced plans to expand the zoo's elephant, giraffe and lion exhibits. This $20 million project was made to improve living standards for the animals and also to give a much better viewing experience for guests of the Maryland zoo. The details of this initiative include the expansion of the Elephant habitat from 0.92 acres (0.37 ha) to 2.1 acres (0.85 ha), The Expansion of the Giraffe habitat by 33%, the removal of what used to be \\"Rock Island\\" and several new viewing areas for the lions. The renovations finished in the Summer of 2019.

A small-model diesel train makes a one-mile circuit and over a 105-foot bridge through parts and scenery of the Zoo, remembering the heritage of the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the city and state, with its long-time decorated colors of blue and gray colors on the locomotive and cars of the old historic road, first railroad built in America since 1827. There has been a zoo train for many years, though the equipment and route has changed several times. The current zoo train from 2010 is pulled by a bright red new detailed scale replica of the 1863-era \\"C. P. Huntington\\" locomotive, named for a famous railroading tycoon and magnate in California and Virginia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. =Polar Bear Watch= The \\"Polar Bear Watch\\" features a polar bear named Anoki, as well as grizzly bears, ravens, bald eagles, snowy owls and Arctic foxes. Guests can view the polar bear from underwater viewing areas, or from the windows of an actual massive Tundra Buggy, purchased from the Canadian company that creates these one of kind vehicles for viewing the polar bear in its natural habitat. Beginning in January, 2016, the Polar Bear Watch also became home to two rescued orphaned grizzly bear cubs. They were named Nova and Nita after the names were chosen in a public contest. Magnet, another polar bear, won a contest put forth by Microsoft's Zoo Tycoon for best zoo animal. Magnet was available as a downloadable patch for the game and during the game, polar bears purchased via the Magnet icon would play with a red ball. The real Magnet was euthanized due to kidney disease in 2015. Penguin Coast The Zoo’s new state-of-the-art African penguin exhibit located between Polar Bear Watch and African Journey, opened on Saturday, September 27, 2014. It brings guests up-close to nearly 60 (and growing) African black-footed penguins, white-breasted cormorants and Pink-backed pelicans in a vivid re- creation of their natural habitat along the coasts and islands of South Africa. There is an underwater viewing window and view to a tidal pool that creates a wave-like effect for the birds. The Zoo gives guests an extra peek into the lives of the penguins with the opportunity to see them get their daily fill of fish with morning and afternoon feedings. Penguin Coast also includes an interpretive building which includes a multi-purpose room for education programs and animal demonstrations, restrooms, and indoor space for special events.

It was used as a munitions storage and disposal facility by the United States Army from 1941 until the 1990s. The Depot was listed in the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission and formally shut down in 2000. The property has since been transferred to the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency, which leases it to Seneca County Economic Development Corp. Home to the world's largest herd of white deer, the base is in the towns of Varick and Romulus. Adjacent to the storage facility is the now closed Seneca Army Airfield, whose long runway could handle large cargo aircraft.  History  During the 1940s, the Army stored radioactive materials in connection with the Manhattan Project in igloos E0801 through E0811, on the south end of the Depot. Despite no formal confirmation from the Department of Defense, it is known that during the cold war the depot held the largest stockpile of Army nuclear weapons in the country.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20090426/SPORTS0103/904260358/Old- fortress-yields-sightseers-Seneca-Army-Depot The Army RADCON team performed a survey on these igloos during the week of May 13, 1985. In 1978 the United States Coast Guard opened a Loran-C transmitter station on the base. It closed in 2010. The depot was a major employer in the region. It was linked to the outside world by the airfield, railroad lines and highways (NY-96 and NY-96A). The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closing the depot and it formally shut down on September 30, 2000. In August 2002, The Glen Region of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) began using the airfield for autocross racing competitions, but site availability after August 2011 is not yet determined. In early 2007, the Cornell 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge Team began using the depot's private roads to test its autonomous vehicles. Some warehouses are leased to The Advantage Group, which runs a storage and shipping business. Much of the housing at the depot has been sold to private developers and is now available as part of the area's civilian housing stock. Much of the railroad track and outer yards are being used for railroad car storage. As of 2008, no customers ship by rail. The depot's former airfield is slated for use as a New York State Police training center. In early 2007, Cilion announced plans to build an ethanol plant on a portion of the former depot, but the project languished and appears to have died in the face of rising costs for corn and public concern about the wisdom of the project. An article dated July 20, 2009 in the Watertown Daily Times stated that the Fort Drum-based 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) would soon start using the depot for combat training.http://www.nnyads.com/article/20090720/NEWS03/307209984/-1//NEWS03  Demonstrations to close the facility  Beginning on July 4, 1983, and running for several years, antiwar and anti-nuclear activists mounted major protests at the facility, staging civil disobedience protests and establishing the Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice. Major events in 1983 took place in August and October. During the October event, many people including Dr. Benjamin Spock climbed the fence surrounding the depot and were detained. Most fence climbers were released after being given \\"ban and bar letters\\" telling them they would be charged with trespass if they were apprehended inside the depot again. On three occasions — July 4, August 1, and November 3 — feminist artist Helene Aylon put pillowcases on the depot's fence that were filled with \\"rescued earth\\" from nuclear sites across the country during her 1982 \\"Earth Ambulance\\" voyage and sleep-out at the United Nations. Writer/activist Grace Paley was also among the demonstrators. Demonstrations continued for several years, mostly originating from within the Women's Peace Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, which operated from an old farmhouse on Route 96 in Romulus.  Current disposition of the depot land  The Seneca County Industrial Development Agency has been trying to market the land halfway between Rochester and Syracuse to manufacturers or other industry. Much of the land is dotted with large, concrete munitions storage bunkers known as 'igloos'. Discussions continue regarding land use. Development started on the depot's northeastern section, but much of it is non-taxable. the depot is home to a maximum-security state prison, the Five Points Correctional Facility and the Seneca County Law Enforcement Center, which includes the county jail. The non-profit, Hillside Family of Agencies that is headquartered in Rochester, NY. As of the fall of 2019 Hillside has closed it's Seneca County Campus. There are a few private businesses including First Light, which uses some of the ammunition bunkers.  Reuse plans  As of 2014, the towns of Varick and Romulus are discussing to bring the property back on the tax rolls by opening it up to residential, commercial and agricultural development with a new east-west road, cutting the property in half. One group dedicated to \\"preserving the unique wildlife and the military history of the depot through conservation, ecotourism and economic development\\" wants to turn the depot into a protected wildlife area, since DEC and state Parks Department cite lack of funds to do so.  The White Deer herd  Seneca White Deer inside the depot. The white deer, long the symbol for the depot, began appearing after the fence was erected in 1941. A handful of White-tailed deer that carried a recessive gene for all-white coats were isolated within the depot. The depot initially allowed only brown-coated deer to be killed, so the herd of white deer grew to more than 200, although hunters are occasionally allowed inside to kill a white deer. The white deer are naturally occurring, not albinos, and have not pink, but brown eyes. The white deer live alongside another 600 brown white-tailed deer. Seneca White Deer, a non-profit group, received clearance to run limited bus tours in 2006, 2009, and 2012. These tours \\"turned out to be hugely successful\\". A three- person crew from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had maintained the remaining undeveloped at the depot and the of fence that surrounds its entirety. In 2016, the property was sold to local businessman Earl Martin of Seneca Iron Works for $900,000 and established as Deer Haven Park, LLC.Deer Haven Park, LLC, Retrieved April 18, 2018Democrat & Chronicle, Seneca Army Depot buyer announced by Leo Roth, Sean Lahman and Steve Orr, June 16, 2016, Retrieved April 19, 2018.

The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).  History  Inside the aviary Constructed on the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair and opened in 1968, it is the first to be designed from the start as a cageless zoo. Robert Moses turned the first shovel full of earth for the new construction on August 20, 1966, and cut the ceremonial ribbon to the new \\"Flushing Meadows Zoo\\" a bit more than two years later on October 26, 1968. The zoo's aviary is a geodesic dome designed by Thomas C. Howard of Synergetics, Inc. and used during the 1964 Fair. The dome was originally designed as the fair's major indoor assembly hall, with no indoor supports blocking anyone's view, and repurposed for the 1965 season as a tribute to Winston Churchill after he died in 1964. The diameter dome was one of the largest single-layer structures of its time. It was dismantled and stored after the fair, and was later reassembled in its current location with a mesh netting covering instead of the solid tent of the original dome. The zoo was closed in 1988 and reopened in 1992 after a four- year, $16 million renovation, redesign, and reconceptualization. Animals The zoo is home to more than 75 species that are native to the Americas. It is the only one of five zoos in New York City that exhibits Andean bears. The zoo is also home to: Pumas, California sea lions, coyotes, burrowing owls, Canadian lynxes, Southern pudús, thick-billed parrots, American alligators, Roosevelt elk, American bison, trumpeter swans, king vultures, pronghorns, sandhill cranes, bald eagles, great horned owls, Chacoan peccaries, a walk- through aviary, and a farm with a variety of domestic animals.

It can be considered to be based on the conversion between Julian day and the calendar date.  Formula  For the Gregorian calendar, Zeller's congruence is :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + K + leftlfloorfrac{K}{4}rightrfloor + leftlfloorfrac{J}{4}rightrfloor - 2Jright) bmod 7, for the Julian calendar it is :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + K + leftlfloorfrac{K}{4}rightrfloor + 5 - Jright) bmod 7, where * h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday) * q is the day of the month * m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, 5 = May, ..., 14 = February) * K the year of the century (year bmod 100). * J is the zero- based century (actually lfloor year/100 rfloor) For example, the zero-based centuries for 1995 and 2000 are 19 and 20 respectively (not to be confused with the common ordinal century enumeration which indicates 20th for both cases). * lfloor...rfloor is the floor function or integer part * mod is the modulo operation or remainder after division NOTE: In this algorithm January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. E.g. if it is 2 February 2010, the algorithm counts the date as the second day of the fourteenth month of 2009 (02/14/2009 in DD/MM/YYYY format) For an ISO week date Day-of-Week d (1 = Monday to 7 = Sunday), use :d = ((h + 5) bmod 7) + 1 = Implementation in software = The formulas rely on the mathematician's definition of modulo division, which means that −2 mod 7 is equal to positive 5. Unfortunately, the way most computer languages implement the remainder function, −2 mod 7 returns a result of −2. So, to implement Zeller's congruence on a computer, the formulas should be altered slightly to ensure a positive numerator. The simplest way to do this is to replace by and by . So the formulas become: :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + K + leftlfloorfrac{K}{4}rightrfloor + leftlfloorfrac{J}{4}rightrfloor + 5Jright) bmod 7, for the Gregorian calendar, and :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + K + leftlfloorfrac{K}{4}rightrfloor + 5 + 6Jright) bmod 7, for the Julian calendar. One can readily see that, in a given year, March 1 (if that is a Saturday, then March 2) is a good test date; and that, in a given century, the best test year is that which is a multiple of 100. Zeller used decimal arithmetic, and found it convenient to use J and K in representing the year. But when using a computer, it is simpler to handle the modified year , which is during January and February: :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + Y + leftlfloorfrac{Y}{4}rightrfloor - leftlfloorfrac{Y}{100}rightrfloor + leftlfloorfrac{Y}{400}rightrfloorright) bmod 7, for the Gregorian calendar (in this case there is no possibility of overflow because leftlfloor Y/4rightrfloor ge leftlfloor Y/100rightrfloor), and :h = left(q + leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor + Y + leftlfloorfrac{Y}{4}rightrfloor + 5right) bmod 7, for the Julian calendar. Analysis These formulas are based on the observation that the day of the week progresses in a predictable manner based upon each subpart of that date. Each term within the formula is used to calculate the offset needed to obtain the correct day of the week. For the Gregorian calendar, the various parts of this formula can therefore be understood as follows: *q represents the progression of the day of the week based on the day of the month, since each successive day results in an additional offset of 1 in the day of the week. *K represents the progression of the day of the week based on the year. Assuming that each year is 365 days long, the same date on each succeeding year will be offset by a value of 365bmod 7 = 1. *Since there are 366 days in each leap year, this needs to be accounted for by adding another day to the day of the week offset value. This is accomplished by adding leftlfloorfrac{K}{4}rightrfloor to the offset. This term is calculated as an integer result. Any remainder is discarded. *Using similar logic, the progression of the day of the week for each century may be calculated by observing that there are 36524 days in a normal century and 36525 days in each century divisible by 400. Since 36525bmod 7 = 6 and 36524bmod 7 = 5, the term :leftlfloorfrac{J}{4}rightrfloor - 2J accounts for this (again using integer division and discarding any fractional remainder). To avoid negative numbers, this term can be replaced with :leftlfloorfrac{J}{4}rightrfloor + 5J with equivalent results. *The term leftlfloorfrac{13(m+1)}{5}rightrfloor which also can be replaced by leftlceilfrac{13(m-2)}{5}rightrceil adjusts for the variation in the days of the month. Starting from January, the days in a month are {31, 28/29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}. February's 28 or 29 days is a problem, so the formula rolls January and February around to the end so February's short count will not cause a problem. The formula is interested in days of the week, so the numbers in the sequence can be taken modulo 7. Then the number of days in a month modulo 7 (still starting with January) would be {3, 0/1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3}. Starting in March, the sequence basically alternates 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, but every five months there are two 31-day months in a row (July–August and December–January).The every five months rule only applies to the twelve months of a year commencing on 1 March and ending on the last day of the following February. The fraction 13/5 = 2.6 and the floor function have that effect; the denominator of 5 sets a period of 5 months. *The overall function, operatorname{mod},7, normalizes the result to reside in the range of 0 to 6, which yields the index of the correct day of the week for the date being analyzed. The reason that the formula differs for the Julian calendar is that this calendar does not have a separate rule for leap centuries and is offset from the Gregorian calendar by a fixed number of days each century. Since the Gregorian calendar was adopted at different times in different regions of the world, the location of an event is significant in determining the correct day of the week for a date that occurred during this transition period. This is only required through 1929, as this was the last year that the Julian calendar was still in use by any country on earth, and thus is not required for 1930 or later. The formulae can be used proleptically, but with care for years before year AD 1 because implementation of modulo operators and euclidean divisions may truncate integers to the wrong direction (ceiling instead of floor). To accommodate this, one can add a sufficient multiple of 400 Gregorian or 700 Julian years, and subtract 1 for BC year numbers (\\"Year 0\\" is in fact year 1 BC in the Julian calendar). They are in fact proleptic right up to 1 March AD 4 owing to mismanagement in Rome (but not Egypt) in the period since the calendar was put into effect on 1 January 45 BC (which was not a leap year).  Examples  For 1 January 2000, the date would be treated as the 13th month of 1999, so the values would be: :q = 1 :m = 13 :K = 99 :J = 19 So the formula evaluates as (1 + 36 + 99 + 24 + 4 - 38) bmod 7 = 126 bmod 7 = 0 = text{Saturday}. (The 36 comes from (13 + 1) times 13/5 = 182/5, truncated to an integer.) However, for 1 March 2000, the date is treated as the 3rd month of 2000, so the values become :q = 1 :m = 3 :K = 0 :J = 20 so the formula evaluates as (1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 5 - 40) bmod 7 = -24 bmod 7 = 4 = text{Wednesday}.

Biography =Early life and career= Philip Craig Russell was born October 30, 1951 in Wellsville, Ohio. He entered the comics industry in 1972 as an assistant to Dan Adkins. Russell first became well known with his 11–issue Amazing Adventures run and subsequent graphic novel featuring Killraven, hero of a future version of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, collaborating with writer Don McGregor. Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that, \\"McGregor's finest artistic collaborator on the series was P. Craig Russell, whose sensitive, elaborate artwork, evocative of Art Nouveau illustration, gave the landscape of Killraven's America a nostalgic, pastoral feel, and the Martian architecture the look of futuristic castles.\\" At DC Comics, Russell inked Batman stories in Batman Family and Detective Comics over the pencils of Michael Golden and Jim Starlin respectively. Withdrawing for a while from mainstream comics, Russell produced a number of experimental strips, many of which were later published in his Night Music series and in Epic Illustrated. = Elric (1982–1997) = Russell's first Elric story, the Roy Thomas scripted \\"The Dreaming City\\", was published by Marvel Comics in 1982 as Marvel Graphic Novel #2, following initial publication of the first half of the graphic novel in Epic Illustrated. For the next series, \\"Elric of Melnibone\\", also written by Roy Thomas, Russell shared art duties with Michael T. Gilbert. This story was published by Pacific Comics as Elric issues #1–6 in 1983–1984. Russell did not return to Elric until 1997 when he collaborated directly with Michael Moorcock on Elric: Stormbringer, co-published by Dark Horse Comics and Topps Comics. = Night Music (1984–1990) = In 1984, Russell began Night Music, an ongoing anthology series for Eclipse Comics featuring some of his most heralded literary and operatic adaptations. Russell has previously used the same title for a black and white collection of the earliest of these works, published by Eclipse Comics. Included in this series was \\"The King's Ankus\\", adapted from Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. Russell had previously inked a number of Jungle Book adaptations drawn by Gil Kane, published in Marvel Fanfare #8–11 (May–Nov. 1983). The series included \\"Pelleas & Melisande\\", adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck's play of the same name which had been turned into an opera by Claude Debussy, and \\"Salome\\" adapted from Oscar Wilde's play of the same name which was the basis for Richard Strauss's opera. Opera would continue to resurface in Russell's work, including a four-part adaptation of The Magic Flute, taken from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera. = Other work = Russell inked Mike Mignola's pencils on the Phantom Stranger limited series in 1987. Russell illustrated issue #50 of writer Neil Gaiman's comic book series The Sandman. The story was titled \\"Ramadan\\" and was later included in the collection The Sandman: Fables and Reflections. Russell drew the first story in Gaiman's later Sandman graphic novel, Endless Nights, and adapted both Gaiman's short story \\"Murder Mysteries\\" and his children's book Coraline into comics form. He has adapted another Gaiman Sandman work, Sandman: The Dream Hunters, and a Robert E. Howard Conan the Barbarian story, \\"The Jewels of Gwahlur\\". Russell got involved with a collaborative art project with the Web-based artist group Kaleidospace in 1994. Beginning in 2000, Dark Horse Comics published Russell's adaptation of Richard Wagner's operatic cycle, The Ring of the Nibelung as 14 comic books; in 2001, the series won two Eisner Awards: for Best Finite Series/Limited Series, and for Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team.

It is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). In conjunction with the Central Park Zoo's operations, the WCS offers children's educational programs, is engaged in restoration of endangered species populations, and reaches out to the local community through volunteer programs. Its precursor, a menagerie, was founded in 1864, becoming the first public zoo to open in New York. The present facility first opened as a city zoo on December 2, 1934, and was part of a larger revitalization program of city parks, playgrounds and zoos initiated in 1934 by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses. It was built, in large part, through Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor and funding. The Children's Zoo opened to the north of the main zoo in 1960, using funding from a donation by Senator Herbert Lehman and his wife Edith. After 49 years of operation as a city zoo run by NYC Parks, Central Park Zoo closed in 1983 for reconstruction. The closure was part of a five-year, $35 million renovation program, that completely replaced the zoo's cages with naturalistic environments. It was rededicated on August 8, 1988, as part of a system of five facilities managed by the WCS, all of which are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).  Areas  The Central Park Zoo is part of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), an integrated network of four zoos and an aquarium spread throughout New York City. Located at East 64th Street and Fifth Avenue, the zoo is situated on a plot in Central Park. Visitors may enter through the Fifth Avenue entrance or from within Central Park. The Central Park Zoo is a major tourist attraction within Central Park, drawing more than one million people every year. According to a 2011 study by the Central Park Conservancy, the zoo and its surroundings were visited by an estimated four million people each year. However, the WCS cites much lower figures since it only counts patrons with tickets. In 2007, it recorded that 1.01 million people visited the Central Park Zoo, and in 2006, 1.03 million people. , the Central Park Zoo had 1,487 animals representing 163 species. = Main zoo = Trellised, vine-clad, glass-roofed pergolas link the three major exhibit areas—tropic, temperate and polar—housed in discrete buildings of brick trimmed with granite, masked by vines. The exhibit areas are centered around a square central garden that contains a square sea lion pool in its center. The sea lion pool is surrounded by glass fencing to allow visitors to observe the sea lions and their daily feedings.  Exhibits and other buildings  The structure at the central garden's southwestern corner is the \\"Tropic Zone\\", which contains a two-story representation of a rain forest. The rain forest contains Rodrigues flying foxes, Seba's short-tailed bats, emerald tree boas, pythons, cotton-top tamarins, white-eared titis, toucans, black-and-white ruffed lemurs from the Bronx Zoo and a large variety of birds including scarlet ibis, emerald starlings, superb starlings, pied avocets, speckled mousebirds, sunbittern, troupials, Taveta golden weaver, blue-crowned motmots, crested couas, blue-gray tanagers, African pygmy goose, ochre-marked parakeets, white-fronted amazons, blue-headed macaws, plum-headed parakeets, Derbyan parakeets, Fischer's lovebirds, golden conures, red bird-of-paradise, superb bird-of-paradise, Nicobar pigeons, black-naped fruit doves, Victoria crowned-pigeons, coroneted fruit doves, kagus, blue-and-yellow- and green winged macaws. The zoo also keeps piranhas, pig-nosed turtles and red-footed tortoises. There is also a large free-flight area for birds. The elephant house of the original menagerie was formerly located at the site. The Temperate Zone, one of the three major exhibit areas at Central Park Zoo To the west of the garden is the \\"Temperate Territory\\", a landscaped series of paths surrounding a lake. It hosts animals such as red pandas, white-naped cranes, snow monkeys, and snow leopards. A snow leopard exhibit in the Temperate Territory opened in June 2009. The Temperate Territory is located on the site of the 1934 zoo's cafeteria. The northern side of the garden is adjacent to the \\"Penguins and Sea Birds\\" section. This multilevel structure contains a chilled penguin house that contains macaroni penguins, king penguins, chinstrap penguins, gentoo penguins, tufted puffins and an outdoor pool with harbor seals, as well as an outdoor grizzly bear exhibit. It is located on the site of a lion house that was built in 1934 along with the original menagerie. The eastern side of the central garden is next to the Arsenal, technically located outside the zoo. The structure was completed in 1851 and originally intended as a weapons and ammunition storehouse for the New York State Militia. It once served as an actual zoo building, but now contains NYC Parks Department offices. Central Park Zoo also includes a 4D theater, located to the north of the Arsenal, while a gift shop and ticket booth are located to the south of the Arsenal. The southern side of the garden contains the Intelligence Garden, located at the site of the original menagerie's horned animal/small mammal house. Its name is inspired by a rare- animal menagerie created by King Wen of Zhou in 1100 B.C. A cafeteria, the Dancing Crane Cafe, is located to the south of the Intelligence Garden.  Art and conservation programs  Several works of art are located in the Central Park Zoo. There are several structures preserved from the original zoo built in 1934, which still feature their original animal-themed limestone friezes from Frederick Roth. Roth also created a pair of bronze statues, Dancing Goat and Dancing Bear, which flank the southern entrance of the zoo and were retained from the original zoo. Additionally, the zoo includes Tigress and Cubs, one of the park's oldest statues. The pair was created by Auguste Cain in 1867 and moved from an outcropping near the Lake to the Central Park Zoo in 1934. The zoo coordinates breeding programs for some endangered species as part of the Species Survival Plan, such as thick-billed parrots and red pandas. In 2011, the WCS announced that the Central Park Zoo was the first North American zoo to hatch ducklings of critically endangered scaly-sided mergansers. In addition, the first example of whispering in non- human primates was observed at the Central Park Zoo in 2013, when tamarin monkeys were heard whispering around a staff member that they disliked. The zoo hosts educational venues as well as exhibits. The volunteer program at the Central Park Zoo engages members of the community; it is a combination outreach and educational program for adults. Volunteer guides conduct tours for visitors, while volunteer docents augment the educational program. Docents enroll in a four-month training program. The zoo also offers several programs for students. = Children's Zoo = The Children's Zoo is located north of the main zoo. It is officially named the Tisch Children's Zoo after businessman Laurence A. Tisch, whose donation funded the zoo's 1990s renovation. The Children's Zoo contains a petting zoo with mini nubian goats (a crossbreed between nigerian dwarfs and nubian goats), sheeps, pigs, alpacas, Patagonian cavies, and the only cow in Manhattan, as well as the Acorn Theatre, a performing arts theater. Admission to the Children's Zoo is included with the purchase of tickets to the main zoo. Lehman Gates The Lehman Gates by Paul Manship are a notable feature retained from the original Children's Zoo. They were donated by Herbert and Edith Lehman in 1960 in honor of their 50th anniversary, and as part of their donation toward the construction of the Children's Zoo itself. The gates were renovated in the 1980s. Additionally, the Delacorte Clock, a gift of George T. Delacorte dedicated in 1965, is mounted on a three-tiered tower above the arcade between the Wildlife Center and the Children's Zoo.  History  = Original menagerie = The zoo was not part of the original Greensward Plan for Central Park created by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. However, a menagerie near the Arsenal, on the edge of Central Park located at Fifth Avenue facing East 64th Street, spontaneously evolved from gifts of exotic pets and other animals informally given to the park. The first animal, a bear cub tied to a tree, was left in Central Park in 1859, followed by a monkey the next year. These animals were popular with the park's visitors even though there was no formal zoo at the time. Soon, people began donating other animals such as cranes, a peacock, and goldfish. Unsolicited donations came from a variety of people, from prominent figures to young boys. The donations also included dead animals. The Central Park planning commission recorded all of these donations in its annual reports. 1869, The Dovecote The American Zoological and Botanical Society, which sought to create a zoo somewhere in New York City, was created in early 1860. The group began discussing possible sites for a zoo, among them Central Park. By 1862, were set aside for the construction of a future \\"zoological and botanical garden\\", later the Central Park Zoo. However, since the zoo's site was not yet formally designated, the animals were kept in the Central Park Mall. Popular animals included three bald eagles and a bald-headed monkey. In 1864, a formal zoo received charter confirmation from New York's assembly, making it the United States' second publicly owned zoo, after the Philadelphia Zoo, which was founded in 1859. By then, the park had over 400 animals. More than 250 animals would be donated in 1864–1865 alone. Originally the zoo was supposed to be located in Manhattan Square, on the west side of Central Park where the American Museum of Natural History is now located, though this location was never used as a zoo. Up to twelve sites would eventually be considered for the zoo throughout the last three decades of the 19th century, including the North Meadow of Central Park. Some animals were moved to the Arsenal in 1865, and larger animals grazed there during summers. A \\"deer park\\" was established at the current site of the Metropolitan Museum of Art three years later. In 1870, when the Tammany Hall political organization took control of the Central Park commission, it mandated that the Central Park menagerie buy its own animals rather than accept donations, and it moved the animals to five structures behind the Arsenal. The same year, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins sculpted dinosaur figures for a proposed dinosaur exhibit at the zoo, but they were destroyed by Tammany Hall officials who did not appreciate these figures, and the pieces were rumored to be buried nearby. The menagerie became popular because of its free admission and proximity to working-class Lower Manhattan; by 1873, it saw 2.5 million annual visitors. The first permanent menagerie building was constructed behind the Arsenal in 1875. The menagerie reached peak popularity in the mid-1880s after a chimpanzee nicknamed \\"Mike Crowley\\" was imported from Liberia. Observers such as former president Ulysses S. Grant showed up at the Monkey House to see the chimpanzee, overfilling the building past capacity. However, Irish-American groups took offense to the chimpanzee's nickname, saying that the names given to animals in the Central Park menagerie were stereotypically Irish, and thus derogatory to that ethnic group. Frederick Law Olmsted also disapproved of the menagerie, believing Central Park to be better suited for scenic vistas than for entertainment, though he admitted that the zoo was the most popular part of the park. By the 1890s, wealthy residents of nearby neighborhoods were clamoring for the zoo to be relocated somewhere else, such as the North Meadow. However, these efforts met resistance, as the Central Park menagerie was popular among the general public and among the politicians that represented them. This subsequently led to the creation of the Bronx Zoo, a much larger, privately operated zoo in the Bronx in 1897. Though wealthy residents hoped that people would travel to the Bronx Zoo for its superior facilities, the Central Park Zoo continued to be popular even after the Bronx Zoo opened in 1899. The Central Park menagerie attracted over three million people annually by 1902, more than the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum combined, despite only receiving one-fifth as much money as either of the museums. Through the early 20th century, the quality of the menagerie declined through neglect from the city government, which administered the zoo. The zoo accepted creatures of all kinds, even those with health problems, but offered insufficient veterinary care. In 1919, some of the structures at the Central Park menagerie were modified to accommodate the addition of new animals. Subsequently, in 1932, a new concrete structure was built for the zoo's wolves because the previous steel enclosure was deemed insufficient to contain the wolves. By then, the zoo was extremely rundown, and its 22 cages were regarded as \\"flimsy and rat-ridden\\". The wooden sheds posed a fire hazard, and the enclosures were so ineffective that zookeepers guarded the lion house to prevent the lions from escaping. = New zoo = Sea lion pool, as seen looking south toward Midtown ManhattanAfter assuming office in January 1934, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia hired Robert Moses to head a newly unified Parks Department. Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city's parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year. Plans for the new Central Park Zoo were prepared by Aymar Embury II within a 16-day span in February 1934 and were announced the following month. Embury's plans called for nine terracotta and brick structures to replace the structures in the menagerie. These structures included seven new animal enclosures, as well as a comfort station and a garage. A sea lion pool, designed by Charles Schmieder, was to be located in the center of the new zoo, surrounded by the zoo enclosures on three sides. The new structures were designed in such a way that they could be maintained easily. The buildings, to cost $411,000, were designed in conjunction with new enclosures at the Prospect Park Zoo. The reconstruction of the zoo was initially criticized by individuals who thought that the money spent on building a zoo would be better utilized on the construction of new schools around the city. During the reconstruction, the previous structures were entirely demolished. While construction was ongoing, animals were temporarily moved to other zoos. The rebuilt zoo opened on December 2, 1934, at a ceremony where former governor Al Smith was given the honorary title of \\"night superintendent\\". By April 1936, the renovated zoo had seen six million visitors since its reopening. To prevent the recurrence of rat infestations, Moses also instituted a rat-elimination program in and around the zoo. In June 1960, U.S. senator Herbert Lehman and his wife Edith donated $500,000 toward the construction of a new children's zoo just north of the existing zoo. Work began that November, and the children's zoo was officially opened on June 27, 1961. The children's zoo featured attractions like a petting area with ducks, rabbits, and chickens; a large fiberglass whale statue dubbed \\"Whaley\\" (which acted as the entrance to the small zoo); a Noah's Ark feature; and a medieval castle feature. The animals were housed in small storybook-style structures bordering an irregular pond. = Decline = By 1967, the wooden railings around the main zoo's enclosures were rotting, and NYC Parks commissioner August Heckscher II had authorized repairs to these railings. The same year, the zoo cafeteria was renovated after a new concessionaire took control of the cafe. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the New York City Subway's 63rd Street lines, the present-day , were being built directly underneath the zoo. A graffiti wall was erected along the line's length through Central Park. The tunnel provided a subterranean gathering place for very early subway artists who hung around together in Central Park, and was named Zoo York by ALI, founder of the SOUL ARTISTS graffiti crew. The name came about because it was in a zoo in New York, hence \\"Zoo York\\". The construction of the subway line itself was controversial because it called for of cut-and-cover tunneling, which required digging an open trench through Central Park and then covering it over. One of the concerns was that the Central Park Zoo, and a bird sanctuary outside the zoo, were located very close to the boundary of the trench. Eventually, the New York City Transit Authority, which operated the New York City Subway, agreed to reduce disruption by halving the length of the cut. A nature kiosk at Central Park Zoo was added in 1972, and a $500,000 renovation for the Lion House was proposed the following year. By then, the Central Park Zoo was quite dilapidated: in November 1974, protesters gathered outside the zoo to protest the conditions there. NYC Parks commissioner Gordon Davis described the zoo as a \\"Rikers Island for animals\\". Even so, the zoo was one of the most popular attractions in Central Park through the 1980s, according to surveys taken during that era. Around the same time, there was a plan to shift control of the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Queens Zoos from the city government to the New York Zoological Society, a quasi-public conservation organization. At the time, none of the zoos had dedicated curatorial staff and all had only a skeletal zookeeping staff. The society proposed sending the larger animals to different zoos with more humane conditions, and animal-rights groups sued the city in an effort to close the two zoos and move the animals to the larger Bronx Zoo. A 1976 report by the World Federation for the Protection of Animals found that all three zoos were operating in \\"shameful conditions\\", and that the animals at the Central Park and Prospect Park Zoos were living in poorly maintained facilities. = Renovations = Children's Zoo After fifteen years of sporadic conversations, the administration of mayor Ed Koch and the New York Zoological Society (renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS, in 1993) signed a fifty-year agreement in April 1980, wherein the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Queens Zoos would be administered by the Society. They proposed renovation plans for all three zoos in 1981. The Central Park Zoo's renovation plan called for the demolition of five of the six structures around the sea lion pool (except for the Arsenal), as well as new classrooms and auditoriums for students, and a snack bar to replace the zoo's concessions. The New York Times reported that \\"the caging of these animals in inadequate spaces has long enraged animal lovers.\\" Starting in November 1982, the Central Park Zoo's animals were temporarily moved to other zoos while construction was ongoing. Most of the large animals were permanently rehoused in larger, more natural spaces at the Bronx Zoo. The zoo had three \\"problem animals\\" that few other zoos wanted to take, but even they found homes. The main zoo was closed in late 1983, though the children's zoo remained open. Demolition continued through 1984, though construction on the new zoo did not begin until the following year. The subsequent redesign was executed by Kevin Roche of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates. The facility's menagerie cages were replaced with three naturalistic habitats that blended with Central Park's scenery. Four of the original buildings were preserved in the redesigned zoo, though the cramped outdoor cages were demolished. The central feature of the original zoo, the sea lion pool, was retained. The renovation was originally budgeted at $8.3 million. The renovated zoo was then planned to reopen in 1985 at a cost of $14 million, but the project was delayed for three years. The zoo reopened to the public on August 8, 1988. The renovation ended up costing $35 million. Of this, the city contributed $22 million while the Society contributed the balance. In order to pay for the zoo construction, the Society started charging admission for zoo patrons for the first time in the zoo's history. With the reopening of the Central Park Zoo, the Society aimed to designate each of its three small zoos with a specific purpose. The Central Park Zoo would be focused toward conservation; the Prospect Park Zoo would be primarily a children's zoo; and the Queens Zoo would become a zoo with North American animals. By the early 1990s, some of the structures at the Children's Zoo had collapsed, and there were reports that the animals were being neglected. Under threat of closure by federal regulators, the city closed the zoo in 1991. Though the WCS had a plan to renovate the zoo, it languished for years because the restoration needed approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), which had designated several zoo buildings as landmarks. Furthermore, there were disputes over what the theme of the renovated Children's Zoo should be. The $6 million plan to renovate the Children's Zoo was approved by the LPC in 1996, though it was opposed by preservationists who wanted to prevent the zoo's structures from demolition. The renovation was initially supposed to be funded by $3 million from Henry and Edith Everett, but the Everetts withdrew their gift due to disputes over how the money should be spent. With the help of a $4.5 million grant from businessman Laurence A. Tisch, the Children's Zoo was renovated and renamed the Tisch Children's Zoo upon its reopening in September 1997. In June 2009, the Allison Maher Stern Snow Leopard Exhibit opened with three snow leopards, moved from the Bronx Zoo. The exhibit, costing $10.6 million, was the first new feature in the zoo since its 1988 renovation. Hoax alt=1874 Herald hoax headline A famous hoax regarding the zoo is known as the Central Park Zoo escape and the Central Park menagerie scare of 1874. It was a hoax perpetrated by James Gordon Bennett Jr. in his newspaper, the New York Herald. J.I.C. Clarke was the primary writer of the hoax, under the direction and inspiration of the Heralds managing editor, T.B. Connery, who often walked through the zoo, and had witnessed the near-escape of a leopard. The Heralds cover story of November 9, 1874, claimed that there had been a mass escape of animals from the Central Park Zoo and that several people had been killed by the free- roaming beasts. A rhinoceros was said to be the first escapee, goring his keeper to death and setting into motion the escape of other animals, including a polar bear, a panther, a Numidian lion, several hyenas, and a Bengal tiger. At the end of the lengthy article, which was divided across several pages of the newspaper, the following notice was the only indication that the story horrifying readers across the city was a hoax: \\"... of course, the entire story given above is a pure fabrication. Not one word of it is true.\\" That was not enough to assuage critics, however, who accused Bennett of inciting panic when the extent of the hoax became widely known. The authors later claimed their intent was merely to draw attention to inadequate safety precautions at the zoo, and claimed to be surprised at the extent of the reaction to their story Notable animals *In the early 20th century, Bill Snyder was hired at the zoo; he purchased Hattie, an Asian elephant, in 1920. Hattie died two years later. *Pattycake, a female western lowland gorilla, was born at the zoo in 1972 and was thus the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York. Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her \\"Sonny Jim\\". She moved to the Bronx Zoo in 1982, where she remained until her death in 2013. *Gus, a male polar bear, lived at the zoo from 1988 to 2013, when he had to be euthanized after being diagnosed with an inoperable tumor.

Two people were killed and 145 were injured in the event, mainly from falling trees, flying debris, and mobile homes and trailers being overturned. Western and central West Virginia were affected by hail and several roads were blocked. Most of the destructive damage occurred in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, western Maryland, and Western Pennsylvania. The fatalities associated with this storm occurred in Charleston, West Virginia and Huntington, West Virginia as a result of the high winds. Damage claims In West Virginia alone, there were 8,000 insurance damage claims for homes and businesses. Over 200,000 people lost power in the derecho. Many people experienced flickering lights and power surges. This derecho was the worst severe weather event for West Virginia since the 1974 Super Outbreak.The West Virginia Derecho of 1991  What is a Derecho?  There are several criteria for a mesoscale convective system (MCS) to be considered a derecho. The system needs to have sustained winds of 58 mph, and stretch along a boundary at least 250 miles long. There must also be isolated wind gusts of 75 mph or greater.  Formation of a Derecho  # There needs to be sufficient convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the atmosphere for several thunderstorm cells to form. # There needs to be sufficient inflow of air in the lower atmosphere, with strong upper level divergence in the upper atmosphere. # There needs to be an elevated mixed layer leading to a rapid decrease in temperature with height. # There needs to be high values of vertical wind shear (45 mph or greater) in the lowest 5 kilometers of the atmosphere. # The system usually has a bow echo type of shape. This is a rather simplified list of conditions needed to form a derecho. However, when all of these conditions occur simultaneously in the atmosphere, a derecho storm system has the potential to form.

Situated on in Tacoma's Point Defiance Park, the zoo and aquarium are home to over 9,000 specimens representing 367 animal species. The zoo was founded in 1905; the aquarium was founded in 1935 near Commencement Bay and relocated within the zoo in 1963. Both are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. History The Zoo was founded in 1905, and moved closer to its current location in 1914. The Point Defiance Park Aquarium opened on the waterfront in 1936 as an entity separate from the zoo. By the late 1940s, several Zoo buildings were in disrepair and had to be rebuilt. The 36-year-old animal house was demolished and a new one with sandstone walls and 3/4-inch- thick viewing windows was built in its place. It housed some big cats and white-cheeked gibbons. In the 1960s, the Point Defiance Park Aquarium had been incorporated into the Zoo. A new aquarium, now known as the North Pacific Aquarium, was built on Zoo grounds in 1963. The North Pacific Aquarium closed in 2018 with the opening of the Pacific Seas Aquarium. By the end of the decade, a breeding program was begun for red wolves, which had been declared an endangered species in 1967. Turn-of-the-century cages were deteriorating again in the early 1970s. After a $7 million bond measure was passed in 1977, the Zoo opened the Arctic Tundra complex in 1981 and the Rocky Shores area in 1982. With a smaller bond passed in 1986, the South Pacific Aquarium was built and then opened in 1989. The Zoo experienced financial trouble in the 1990s, culminating in the probation of its AZA accreditation in 1999. Another bond, passed in that year, and a local sales tax increase shored up funds for improvements. With over $35 million at its disposal, the Zoo built a new animal hospital, an outdoor animal theater, Asian Forest Sanctuary, much of the Kids' Zone children's zoo, and a renovated entrance. In 2008, an addition to Kids' Zone, Animal Avenue, was opened. The red wolf exhibit was renovated and re-opened in 2010, and a clouded leopard exhibit called Cats of the Canopy opened on August 27, 2011. Exhibits The exhibits reflect the zoo's theme of ecosystems from the Pacific rim: Southeast Asia, the Pacific Northwest, the tundra, and aquatic environments. A tiger at the top of a waterfall in Asian Forest Sanctuary ;Asian Forest Sanctuary This 5 acre (2.0 ha) exhibit complex which opened on July 1, 2004100 Years at Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium. 2005 simulates the forests of southeast Asia with a waterfall, streams, and plants native to the region such as bamboo. The complex is designed so that species are rotated to different parts of the exhibit after several days. Asian Forest Sanctuary includes Sumatran tigers, Malayan tigers, northern white-cheeked gibbons, siamangs, lowland anoas, Indian crested porcupines, Asian small-clawed otters, and Asian elephants. An expansion called Cats of the Canopy opened on August 27, 2011 and focuses on the clouded leopard. Viewing is provided by a wide glass window along a gravelly stream bed and into a heated den. The twenty-foot high enclosure also allows the cats to climb through the trees. An unnamed endangered male Malayan tapir was born on July 12, 2019.It’s a boy! Endangered tapir gives birth at Tacoma zoo by Siandhara Bonnet, The News Tribune, July 16, 2019 ;Rocky Shores Completed in 1982, this exhibit is based on the shoreline of Cape Flattery, Washington and serves as home to harbor seals, Pacific walruses, sea otters, common murres and tufted puffins in four separate pools. In the middle of the exhibit area is a building for underwater viewing. The exhibit formerly contained beluga whales until they were taken to a zoo in Texas in 2007. ;Arctic Tundra 1981 saw the opening of this exhibit area, which forms a semicircle at one end of the zoo. Muskoxen and reindeer are housed in separate meadows on the outside of the pathway's arc, while polar bears and Arctic foxes live on the inside of the arc. The polar bears have an eleven-foot-deep pool with above- and underwater viewing. ;The Aquariums The North Pacific Aquarium and South Pacific Aquarium each house species from different parts of the Pacific Ocean. The North Pacific Aquarium, opened in 1963, displays species from the nearby Puget Sound such as rockfish, bay pipefish, and the giant Pacific octopus. The 1989-era South Pacific Aquarium simulates tropical Pacific environments, with two coral reef tanks and a lagoon exhibit. The lagoon has small fish and eels, while the Outer Reef tank has nurse sharks, blacktip reef sharks, and four other shark species. In September 2018, the North Pacific aquarium was replaced by the new Pacific seas aquarium. This new exhibit displays species originating from the Pacific ocean in general. The centerpiece of the new aquarium will be a exhibit replicating \\"Baja Bay\\", featuring Scalloped hammerheads, Spotted eagle rays and green sea turtles. Other highlights include a Puget sound exhibit, a kelp forest exhibit, cold water invertebrate touch tank, jellyfish globe and kreisels, a schooling fish exhibit, Giant Pacific Octopus and Japanese spider crabs. The Pacific Seas Aquarium was built with the latest green life support system technology and includes a rainwater capture system for use in non potable water supplies. ;Red Wolf Woods The habitat was rebuilt in 2009 and opened again in the summer of 2010. The exhibit consists of two separate meadows with a rocky creek, hollow log, and other landscaping. The conservation center is designed to look like an abandoned farm building. ;Kids' Zone A number of animals are present including African pygmy goats, black-breasted leaf turtles, giant African millipedes, gopher snakes, green-crested basilisks, guinea pigs, sheep, Nigerian dwarf goats, northern pygmy owls, ocellated rays, Parma wallabies, poison dart frogs, rabbits, rats, and tiger rat snakes. There are also play structures and a petting zoo. Animal Avenue, a children's zoo expansion, includes meerkats, ring-tailed lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs, black lemurs, Damaraland mole rats, Antilles pink-toed tree spiders, emerald tree boas, green tree pythons, western Bell's hinge-back tortoises, pancake tortoises, ornate horned frogs, White's tree frogs, hourglass tree frogs, long-legged desert ants, emperor scorpions, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, African cichlids and budgies. Blooming Kniphofia with a monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana) Botanical Garden The certified Point Defiance Zoo Botanical Garden displays a collection of a variety of bamboos (over 50 species), massive meadows filled with Lobelia tupa, fragrant perennials to attract pollinators, and many varieties of trees and shrubs planted throughout the grounds. The collection boasts a variety of flora from the Baja Peninsula, the Southern Hemisphere, Alaskan landscape, plants from South Eastern United States, wildflowers, desert garden, Asian Forest Sanctuary, and the Native Northwest. The landscaping was developed in an effort to share how and why animals, plants, and people need to coexist. The Zoo is home to hundreds of varieties of plants from decorative to functional, and also provides botanical garden tours monthly by the Zoo Horticulturist. ;Other exhibits Unincorporated exhibits include an artificial tide pool and a Magellanic penguin habitat. Beluga whales The zoo used to house beluga whales. In March 2009 one of the two belugas, Qannik, died of a blood infection. Beethoven, Qannik's tankmate, was sent to SeaWorld, San Antonio, on 5 June 2009. Beethoven's brother, Turner, died three years earlier on 7 September 2006 of chronic liver failure, which resulted in Qannik being brought to the zoo in June 2007, soon after Beethoven had recovered from a severe infection. A previous couple of belugas, Millie and Christy, died almost in unison in 2000. Mauyak was sent to Shedd Aquarium in 1997 for breeding, where she gave birth not only to Qannik but also to Miki, who is now 2 years old. It's unknown yet if there will be new belugas since Beethoven's departure, and none are scheduled to arrive any time in the foreseeable future, and Rocky Shores now houses harbor seals where belugas used to swim. Conservation One focus of the zoo's conservation work is the red wolf. Beginning in 1969, the zoo collected wild red wolves and successfully bred them for the first time in 1977. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had removed the last fourteen wolves from the wild by 1980, and in 1984 the zoo received approval from the AZA to start a Species Survival Plan. By 1987 the number of red wolves in captivity was large enough to release some of them back into the wild. Reintroduced wolves continue to survive and breed in the wild, and by 2002 the world population was 175 in captivity and about 100 in the wild. One of the biggest threats to the wild population is coyote- wolf hybridization.

Maggin, starring the DC Comics superhero Superman. It was published in 1981. A revised edition was published in 2017. This is Elliot S. Maggin's second Superman novel, following Superman: Last Son of Krypton. As with Maggin's first novel, the original edition was published as a tie-in with the then-current Superman film series, with the first edition including a photograph of Christopher Reeve as the character; the novel is not, however, an adaptation of any of the films, nor does it take place in the same continuity as the movies. Miracle Monday tells the story of Superman trying to stop an entity of pure evil from causing universal chaos. The story introduces the time traveler Kristin Wells. The character later appeared in the Superman comics, both as herself and as Superwoman. The novel introduces the holiday Miracle Monday, which occurs annually on the third Monday of May. The holiday would also make an appearance in the Superman comics. Plot summary In the story, Samael, the ruler of Hell, sends his greatest agent of evil, C. W. Saturn, to Earth, to destroy Superman morally. Saturn is able to enter our dimension thanks to Lex Luthor having used a form of magic to escape prison, leaving a 'hole' between worlds. At the same time, Kristin Wells, a history graduate student from the far future, uses time travel technology to arrive in the present, for the purpose of finding out the origin of the holiday known as Miracle Monday, which is known only to be somehow connected to Superman. She infiltrates Clark Kent's circle of friends by becoming Lois Lane's assistant. Unfortunately, because she does not belong in the present, Saturn is able to possess her. Saturn then proceeds to cause worldwide havoc, taunting Superman that the only way for him to stop it would be by killing its host--thus making him break his vow against killing. Saturn even reveals Superman's secret identity to the world, to further drive him into desperation. Ultimately, however, Superman refuses to kill Kristin, even if it means he would have to spend the rest of his life battling Saturn. At that moment, because of the rules that bind demons, Saturn is defeated, and forced to grant Superman a wish. He asks that everything that happened since Saturn's arrival be undone, and it is granted, with Saturn then being banished back to Hell. However, a lingering memory of the events remained within the souls of humanity, causing them to begin celebrating the day every year, on the third Monday of May, starting the Miracle Monday tradition. Kristin then returns to the future to reveal this fact to the public.

Plot The miniseries begins in 1987. At the height of the Cold War, two US airmen monitor their radar screens at a quiet and remote NORAD facility in Alaska. Suddenly, one of the bored operators notices an unexpected blip on his radar screen. It appears to be an unidentified aircraft sneaking in on the leading edge of a weather front. He alerts his partner about the threat and begins to contact Elmendorf AFB. The other airman retrieves a silenced semiautomatic weapon from his desk and kills him. He then proceeds to shoot the remaining station personnel while they are sleeping in their bunks. Lighting a cigarette, the traitor notifies Elmendorf that the station will be out of commission for the next hour in order to repair a malfunctioning generator. The necessary blind spot has been created. Next, the Soviets launch a secret incursion into Alaska. The Soviets have inserted a cold weather special operations assault force of approximately 35-40 KGB desant ski troops led by Soviet Commander Alexander Vorashin (Jeroen Krabbé) into northern Alaska with a track-driven armored vehicle. Vorashin's orders are to seize control of a strategically located pumping station along the Trans-Alaska Pipeline so as to threaten placement of floating explosive devices in the stream of oil. This operation is being conducted in response to America's grain embargo of the Soviet Union, just as the 1980 grain embargo was in response to the 1979 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. The governments of Canada, Australia, and Argentina have joined the U.S. in the embargo. This has caused severe food shortages and domestic unrest inside the Soviet Union. A small company-sized force of lightly armed soldiers of the Alaska Army National Guard and Alaskan Scouts, who are on a training exercise, discover the presence of the Soviet invaders. At Fort Wainwright, Colonel Jake Caffey (David Soul), a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, is sent by his commanding officer to locate one of the groups of soldiers, who have already been ambushed and killed by the Soviet assault force. Colonel Caffey takes command of the Guardsmen when his senior officer, who did not believe the news of the invading Soviet troops, is killed in the first encounter with the Soviets. Caffey notifies his chain of command by radio. Upon learning of the situation, the U.S. President Thomas McKenna (Rock Hudson) orders Caffey's National Guard troops to be federalized and orders Caffey to do all he can to stop the Soviet troops. The President orders a media blackout on the emergency but then orders U.S. forces to be mobilized in response to the Soviet incursion, under the pretext of unscheduled training exercises. The President fears that the people of the United States will demand a declaration of war against the Russians for this attack. Fierce winter weather is preventing U.S. military units from bases and forts in southern Alaska from reinforcing Caffey's unit. Caffey deduces the Soviet assault unit's goal. He uses the few U.S. Army helicopters at his disposal to move his unit to a new pumping station ahead of the Soviets. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Soviet Premier Gorny (Brian Keith) has learned that the Soviet military and KGB leadership have executed this plan without his permission. He is informed of the U.S. mobilization and he orders Soviet forces to a similar posture. In Alaska, Colonel Caffey realizes that his men have an inadequate supply of ammunition, grenades and mines. Utilizing combat tactics that he learned in the Vietnam War, he sets up a defensive perimeter around the pumping station making use of surplus lengths of large-bore oil pipe to establish a position from which to ambush the enemy. The Soviet troops approach the pumping station, unaware of the American soldiers' presence until they trigger U.S. land mines buried in the snow. The Soviets suffer casualties and fall back, but continue to surround the buildings. The U.S. President and Soviet Premier secretly meet in Iceland to negotiate an end to the crisis. They are unable to reach an agreement and both return to their countries, but promise each other that talks will continue. America responds to the Soviets' continuing mobilizations, as officials recognize they are consistent with a fictional contingency plan called Красный Флаг or \\"Red Flag.\\" The U.S. President orders all American ballistic missile submarines, surface warships, B-1s, and B-52s to deploy in readiness for war. He directs U.S. bombers to fly continuous paths just outside Soviet airspace. Colonel Caffey and his soldiers continue to repel the Soviet attacks on the pumping station, but his soldiers are running low on ammunition and supplies. President McKenna contacts Caffey by radio and asks him and his soldiers to hold out at all costs, hoping that the weather will break so that reinforcements can be sent to relieve them. McKenna still holds out hope for a diplomatic solution. Premier Gorny also hopes for a negotiated settlement to the crisis. However, hardline, pro-Soviet members of the Communist Party and the KGB—who remain incensed by the food shortage—suddenly launch a coup d'etat. They use a car bomb to assassinate Gorny while he is visiting the school attended by his young son, Sasha. In the meantime, the Soviet troops in Alaska launch a final assault on the pumping station. Commander Vorashin, however, has become concerned about the rapidly-growing prospect of a nuclear war, and requests a parley with Caffey. After an emotional conversation, Vorashin and Caffey agree to discontinue the fighting. However, at that moment, one of the Soviet troops—perhaps an undercover KGB asset—suddenly hurls a grenade, which kills both men. The situation collapses in bloodshed, with a sergeant of the Alaskan Scouts managing to send one final message that the last American position is being overrun. Receiving this news, President McKenna calls the Soviet leadership and discovers that Gorny is unavailable to speak with him. The Soviet leadership claims Gorny has been felled by severe intestinal flu and that their forces will withdraw to pre-crisis positions, but McKenna does not believe them and realizes that pro-war elements of the KGB are seizing control of the Soviet Union. Once the telephone conference ends, McKenna submits to the National Security Council his belief that Gorny has been killed and that total war is imminent. He is correct, for at that moment, the coup leaders decide on an all-out nuclear strike, some of them mistakenly believing that U. S. law requires the President to obtain Congressional approval before an American nuclear attack. But President McKenna has already deduced the enemy strategy. Horrified and nearly in tears, he concludes the situation is unrecoverable, and orders a full nuclear counterstrike upon the Soviet Union. Cold War themes The film focuses on a number of Cold War themes, including brinksmanship, political loyalty and the mutual distrust of both sides as they attempt to resolve the issue diplomatically while escalating their military alert levels to force the other side to back down. Cast The cast included Rock Hudson as the president of the United States, Brian Keith as the Soviet premier, and Cathy Lee Crosby and David Soul as American military officers as well as Jeroen Krabbé, Robert Prosky, Katherine Helmond and James Hampton. Production notes Robert L. Joseph wrote the miniseries. Director Boris Sagal was killed in a helicopter accident in Oregon during the early stages of production. He was replaced by David Greene. According to Rock Hudson and other sources, prior to Sagal's death, the ending of the miniseries was left open-ended so that either a sequel miniseries or a full season series could be spun off if the first miniseries was a ratings success. However, it was not, and the miniseries concludes with the President releasing US nuclear forces against the Soviets, and vice versa as the Soviets feel that the US will not abandon the grain embargo. The miniseries ends with a rather Fail-Safe-type photo montage of large groups of people across the globe in various international settings looking up to the skies as the sound effects of missiles and jets escalate in tone and volume, concluding with a shot of a sunset and a quick cut to black. Novelization A novelization of the teleplay, but differing from the miniseries as aired in several key respects, was written by Harold King under the pen name Brian Harris. Its 1981 publication by Pocket Books anticipated the airing of the miniseries by several months. It is undocumented whether the changes were King's, or reflected an earlier draft of the script, but based on a comparison of text to broadcast teleplay, it seems likely that the liberties were mostly the novelist's deliberate variation.

Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier. They are characterized by a high peak intensity (or more correctly, irradiance) that usually leads to nonlinear interactions in various materials, including air. These processes are studied in the field of nonlinear optics. In the specialized literature, \\"ultrashort\\" refers to the femtosecond (fs) and picosecond (ps) range, although such pulses no longer hold the record for the shortest pulses artificially generated. Indeed, x-ray pulses with durations on the attosecond time scale have been reported. The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ahmed H. Zewail, for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur, opening up the field of femtochemistry. Definition A positively chirped ultrashort pulse of light in the time domain. There is no standard definition of ultrashort pulse. Usually the attribute 'ultrashort' applies to pulses with a temporal duration of a few tens of femtoseconds, but in a larger sense any pulse which lasts less than a few picoseconds can be considered ultrafast. A common example is a chirped Gaussian pulse, a wave whose field amplitude follows a Gaussian envelope and whose instantaneous phase has a frequency sweep. =Background= The real electric field corresponding to an ultrashort pulse is oscillating at an angular frequency ω0 corresponding to the central wavelength of the pulse. To facilitate calculations, a complex field E(t) is defined. Formally, it is defined as the analytic signal corresponding to the real field. The central angular frequency ω0 is usually explicitly written in the complex field, which may be separated as a temporal intensity function I(t) and a temporal phase function ψ(t): : E(t) = sqrt{I(t)}e^{iomega_0t}e^{ipsi(t)} The expression of the complex electric field in the frequency domain is obtained from the Fourier transform of E(t): : E(omega) = mathcal{F}(E(t)) Because of the presence of the e^{iomega_0t} term, E(ω) is centered around ω0, and it is a common practice to refer to E(ω-ω0) by writing just E(ω), which we will do in the rest of this article. Just as in the time domain, an intensity and a phase function can be defined in the frequency domain: : E(omega) = sqrt{S(omega)}e^{iphi(omega)} The quantity S(omega) is the intensity spectral density (or simply, the spectrum) of the pulse, and phi(omega) is the phase spectral density (or simply spectral phase). Example of spectral phase functions include the case where phi(omega) is a constant, in which case the pulse is called a bandwidth- limited pulse, or where phi(omega) is a quadratic function, in which case the pulse is called a chirped pulse because of the presence of an instantaneous frequency sweep. Such a chirp may be acquired as a pulse propagates through materials (like glass) and is due to their dispersion. It results in a temporal broadening of the pulse. The intensity functions—temporal I(t) and spectral S(omega) —determine the time duration and spectrum bandwidth of the pulse. As stated by the uncertainty principle, their product (sometimes called the time-bandwidth product) has a lower bound. This minimum value depends on the definition used for the duration and on the shape of the pulse. For a given spectrum, the minimum time-bandwidth product, and therefore the shortest pulse, is obtained by a transform-limited pulse, i.e., for a constant spectral phase phi(omega) . High values of the time- bandwidth product, on the other hand, indicate a more complex pulse. Pulse shape control Although optical devices also used for continuous light, like beam expanders and spatial filters, may be used for ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor,J. C. Diels, Femtosecond dye lasers, in Dye Laser Principles, F. J. Duarte and L. W. Hillman (Eds.) (Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 3. a device that can be used to control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase φ(ω) of the input pulse so that the output pulse is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses. To accurately control the pulse, a full characterization of the pulse spectral phase is a must in order to get certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG). Measurement techniques Several techniques are available to measure ultrashort optical pulses. Intensity autocorrelation gives the pulse width when a particular pulse shape is assumed. Spectral interferometry (SI) is a linear technique that can be used when a pre-characterized reference pulse is available. It gives the intensity and phase. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from the SI signal is direct. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric- field reconstruction (SPIDER) is a nonlinear self-referencing technique based on spectral shearing interferometry. The method is similar to SI, except that the reference pulse is a spectrally shifted replica of itself, allowing one to obtain the spectral intensity and phase of the probe pulse via a direct FFT filtering routine similar to SI, but which requires integration of the phase extracted from the interferogram to obtain the probe pulse phase. Frequency- resolved optical gating (FROG) is a nonlinear technique that yields the intensity and phase of a pulse. It is a spectrally resolved autocorrelation. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from a FROG trace is iterative. Grating-eliminated no-nonsense observation of ultrafast incident laser light e-fields (GRENOUILLE) is a simplified version of FROG. (Grenouille is French for \\"frog\\".) Chirp scan is a technique similar to MIIPS which measures the spectral phase of a pulse by applying a ramp of quadratic spectral phases and measuring second harmonic spectra. With respect to MIIPS, which requires many iterations to measure the spectral phase, only two chirp scans are needed to retrieve both the amplitude and the phase of the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a method to characterize and manipulate the ultrashort pulse. Wave packet propagation in nonisotropic media To partially reiterate the discussion above, the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) of the electric field of a wave with central wave vector textbf{K}_0 and central frequency omega_0 of the pulse, is given by: : textbf{E} ( textbf{x} , t) = textbf{ A } ( textbf{x} , t) exp ( i textbf{K}_0 textbf{x} - i omega_0 t ) We consider the propagation for the SVEA of the electric field in a homogeneous dispersive nonisotropic medium. Assuming the pulse is propagating in the direction of the z-axis, it can be shown that the envelope textbf{A} for one of the most general of cases, namely a biaxial crystal, is governed by the PDE: : frac{partial textbf{A} }{partial z } = ~-~ beta_1 frac{partial textbf{A} }{partial t} ~-~ frac{i}{2} beta_2 frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{partial t^2} ~+~ frac{1}{6} beta_3 frac{partial^3 textbf{A} }{partial t^3} ~+~ gamma_x frac{partial textbf{A} }{partial x} ~+~ gamma_y frac{partial textbf{A} }{partial y} :: ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~+~ i gamma_{tx} frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{partial t partial x} ~+~ i gamma_{ty} frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{partial t partial y} ~-~ frac{i}{2} gamma_{xx} frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{ partial x^2} ~-~ frac{i}{2} gamma_{yy} frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{ partial y^2} ~+~ i gamma_{xy} frac{partial^2 textbf{A} }{ partial x partial y} + cdots where the coefficients contains diffraction and dispersion effects which have been determined analytically with computer algebra and verified numerically to within third order for both isotropic and non-isotropic media, valid in the near-field and far-field. beta_1 is the inverse of the group velocity projection. The term in beta_2 is the group velocity dispersion (GVD) or second-order dispersion; it increases the pulse duration and chirps the pulse as it propagates through the medium. The term in beta_3 is a third-order dispersion term that can further increase the pulse duration, even if beta_2 vanishes. The terms in gamma_x and gamma_y describe the walk-off of the pulse; the coefficient gamma_x ~ (gamma_y ) is the ratio of the component of the group velocity x ~ (y) and the unit vector in the direction of propagation of the pulse (z-axis). The terms in gamma_{xx} and gamma_{yy} describe diffraction of the optical wave packet in the directions perpendicular to the axis of propagation. The terms in gamma_{tx} and gamma_{ty} containing mixed derivatives in time and space rotate the wave packet about the y and x axes, respectively, increase the temporal width of the wave packet (in addition to the increase due to the GVD), increase the dispersion in the x and y directions, respectively, and increase the chirp (in addition to that due to beta_2 ) when the latter and/or gamma_{xx} and gamma_{yy} are nonvanishing. The term gamma_{xy} rotates the wave packet in the x-y plane. Oddly enough, because of previously incomplete expansions, this rotation of the pulse was not realized until the late 1990s but it has been experimentally confirmed. To third order, the RHS of the above equation is found to have these additional terms for the uniaxial crystal case: :: cdots ~+~ frac{1}{3} gamma_{t x x } frac{partial^3 textbf{A} }{ partial x^2 partial t} ~+~ frac{1}{3} gamma_{t y y } frac{partial^3 textbf{A} }{ partial y^2 partial t} ~+~ frac{1}{3} gamma_{t t x } frac{partial^3 textbf{A} }{ partial t^2 partial x} + cdots The first and second terms are responsible for the curvature of the propagating front of the pulse. These terms, including the term in beta_3 are present in an isotropic medium and account for the spherical surface of a propagating front originating from a point source. The term gamma_{txx} can be expressed in terms of the index of refraction, the frequency omega and derivatives thereof and the term gamma_{ttx} also distorts the pulse but in a fashion that reverses the roles of t and x (see reference of Trippenbach, Scott and Band for details). So far, the treatment herein is linear, but nonlinear dispersive terms are ubiquitous to nature. Studies involving an additional nonlinear term gamma_{nl} A^2 A have shown that such terms have a profound effect on wave packet, including amongst other things, a self-steepening of the wave packet. The non-linear aspects eventually lead to optical solitons. Despite being rather common, the SVEA is not required to formulate a simple wave equation describing the propagation of optical pulses. In fact, as shown in, even a very general form of the electromagnetic second order wave equation can be factorized into directional components, providing access to a single first order wave equation for the field itself, rather than an envelope. This requires only an assumption that the field evolution is slow on the scale of a wavelength, and does not restrict the bandwidth of the pulse at all—as demonstrated vividly by. High harmonics High energy ultrashort pulses can be generated through high harmonic generation in a nonlinear medium. A high intensity ultrashort pulse will generate an array of harmonics in the medium; a particular harmonic of interest is then selected with a monochromator. This technique has been used to produce ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray regimes from near infrared Ti-sapphire laser pulses. Applications =Advanced material 3D micro-/nano-processing= The ability of femtosecond lasers to efficiently fabricate complex structures and devices for a wide variety of applications has been extensively studied during the last decade. State-of-the-art laser processing techniques with ultrashort light pulses can be used to structure materials with a sub-micrometer resolution. Direct laser writing (DLW) of suitable photoresists and other transparent media can create intricate three-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC), micro-optical components, gratings, tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds and optical waveguides. Such structures are potentially useful for empowering next-generation applications in telecommunications and bioengineering that rely on the creation of increasingly sophisticated miniature parts. The precision, fabrication speed and versatility of ultrafast laser processing make it well placed to become a vital industrial tool for manufacturing. =Micro-machining= Among the applications of femtosecond laser, the microtexturization of implant surfaces have been experimented for the enhancement of the bone formation around zirconia dental implants. The technique demonstrated to be precise with a very low thermal damage and with the reduction of the surface contaminants. Posterior animal studies demonstrated that the increase on the oxygen layer and the micro and nanofeatures created by the microtexturing with femtosecond laser resulted in higher rates of bone formation, higher bone density and improved mechanical stability.Calvo Guirado et al, 2013 and 2014Delgado-Ruiz et al, 2014) See also *Bandwidth-limited pulse *Femtochemistry *Frequency comb *Medical imaging: Ultrashort laser pulses are used in multiphoton fluorescence microscopes *Optical communication (Ultrashort pulses) Filtering and Pulse Shaping. *Terahertz (T-rays) generation and detection. *Ultrafast laser spectroscopy *Wave packet References Further reading  External links *The virtual femtosecond laboratory Lab2 *Animation on Short Pulse propagation in random medium (YouTube) *Ultrafast Lasers: An animated guide to the functioning of Ti:Sapphire lasers and amplifiers.

Signs and symptoms During these seizures, there is repetitive focal myoclonus or Jacksonian march. After a seizure has subsided, Todd's phenomenon may be observed, which includes transient unilateral weakness. Causes There are numerous causes for this kind of seizure and they differ depending somewhat on the age at which the seizures begin. Epilepsy most often occurs at the extremes of life – in childhood or in very old age – but can develop at any time throughout one's life. Although these seizures are usually due to large, acute brain lesions resulting from strokes in adults and focal cortical inflammatory processes in children (Rasmussen's encephalitis), possibly caused by chronic viral infections, edema, or autoimmune processes. They are very medication and therapy-resistant, and the primary therapeutic goal is to stop secondary generalization. There are also many other reasons why these seizures occur. For example, they could be due to genetics, infections, or problems with brain development. Commonly the cause is unknown. Genetic background determines such features as height, eye color, and potential to develop certain diseases like diabetes, but it also determines all the chemicals and structures that make up the brain, therefore playing a role in epilepsia partialis continua. The chemicals and structures that make up the brain have similarities across different people, but they vary in certain enzymes and receptors. These variations are not usually enough to cause a problem, but occasionally they do. For example, if a person has a mutation in a gene that creates the sodium channel (a part of the neuron required for firing) it makes it easier for neuronal firing to get out of control. An infection of the brain (encephalitis) can also be a contributing factor. Although this sort of infection is uncommon it can be due to a virus, bacterium, or (very rarely) fungus. If a seizure happens during the infection itself, the person most likely doesn't have epilepsy but has \\"symptomatic seizures\\" or seizures occurring because of a known injury to the brain. Once the infection is stopped the seizures will stop. Another more common infection is \\"meningitis\\", infection of the membranes surrounding the brain. Since this infection does not directly involve the brain it might not appear as a possible cause of epilepsy, but has been shown that meningitis can cause epilepsy, which would give rise to the possibility of developing epilepsy partialis continua. These infections are most likely to result in epilepsy when they occur at an early age. Problems with brain development can also be a factor. The brain undergoes a complicated process during development in which neurons are born and must travel to the surface of the brain. Here they wind up carefully placed in six distinct layers of the cerebral cortex. Throughout the brain, the placement of these neurons is normally quite precise. If this system doesn't work exactly right, neurons can develop outside their appropriate areas. If this happens then the firing or circuitry of the brain is not right, and an abnormal, epileptic circuit can result. Treatment Identification of the underlying cause plays an important role in treatment. Brain abscesses or tumors can be—at least temporarily or partially, if not fully and permanently—surgically treated and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is given to the patient. If seizures do continue, various anticonvulsant medication regimens that can be tolerated by the patient can be tested and if need be, administered, either orally, or in emergency conditions such as status epilepticus after tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, intravenously. If stroke or other similar, transient disorders occur (cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack, TIA), then neurological imaging of the affected lobes or hemispheres of the brain can be performed (CT, MRI, PET, etc.) and, if not absolutely contraindicated, antithrombolytic therapy might be given if it can be tolerated due to the seizures; if a hemorrhagic stroke has occurred and surgery can be performed to cauterize the vessel or otherwise stop the bleeding, it will be attempted if it can be done safely.

Commissioned in 1917 to supply much-needed student housing for Yale College, it was Yale's first Collegiate Gothic building and its first project by James Gamble Rogers, who later designed ten other major buildings for the university. The Quadrangle has been occupied by Saybrook College and Branford College, two of the original ten residential colleges at Yale. The collegiate system of Yale University was largely inspired by the Oxbridge model of residential and teaching colleges at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the UK. The building was donated by Anna M. Harkness to memorialize her son, Yale College graduate Charles W. Harkness, who died in 1916. Charles' brother, Edward Harkness, became the primary benefactor of Yale's residential college system fifteen years later, a scheme which required a partial reconfiguration of the Memorial Quadrangle to create its two residential colleges. Harkness Tower, a large masonry tower on the building's west side, was named in memory of Charles Harkness, a memorial to whom is found in the tower's chapel. Building Killingworth Court, now part of Saybrook College Construction began in 1917, the bicentennial of Yale's first building in New Haven, and was completed in 1921. As initially built, the Quadrangle contained dorm rooms for 630 students, a dining hall, and seven courtyards. Dry moats with low walls, a frequent architectural motif at Yale, were first used by this building and were planted with ivy, flowers, and trees by landscape architect Beatrix Jones Farrand with an eye to both increased privacy and street beautification. The Memorial Room in Harkness Tower contains the first fan vault ceiling built in the United States and it the first built since the 1200s. Harkness Tower, the most visible symbol of Yale on the New Haven skyscape, is placed on an axis unifying it with Yale's Old Campus. The building is divided into seven courtyards, which Rogers framed with materials and decorative elements giving each distinct character. Three—Killingworth Court, Saybrook Court, and the largest, Branford Court—commemorate Connecticut towns significant to the school's founding, and a fourth, Wrexham Court, the resting place of Elihu Yale. The other three, on the building's southern side and now part of Branford College, are named for early debating societies in Yale College: Brothers in Unity Court, Linonia Court, and Calliope Court after the Calliopean Society. Walls around these southward courtyards are several stories shorter than those on the north, allowing light to fill all of the quadrangle's open spaces more evenly. The building's masonry exterior is richly ornamented, and much of the decoration commemorates distinguished university graduates. The gate beneath Harkness Tower, crafted by Samuel Yellin, is the most ornate of his many works at Yale. G. Owen Bonawit designed unique stained glass windowpanes for each student room. Residential college integration Branford Court and Saybrook dining hall, at right, created during the quadrangle's conversion to residential colleges From 1921 to 1929 the building housed Yale College seniors. In 1928, a donation from Edward Harkness began Yale's residential college system, the buildings of which were also planned and designed by Rogers. Rogers split the Quadrangle into two residential colleges—Saybrook and Branford, so named for the courtyards they contain—and added mid-sized elements such as masters' houses, fellow's quarters, and dining halls. During the conversion, the \\"Gold Coast\\" of student rooms in the middle of the Quadrangle was hollowed out to make way for the Saybrook College dining hall. The colleges opened on September 25, 1933. Influence The Memorial Quadrangle became the template for Yale's residential college system. First announced as a \\"Quadrangle Plan,\\" the colleges were built around the same courtyard and dining hall design pioneered. In addition to the two colleges that were created within the Memorial Quadrangle, six others—Jonathan Edwards, Davenport, Calhoun, Trumbull, and Berkeley—followed the same Collegiate Gothic style. Because of his initial work on the Memorial Quadrangle, Rogers became the de facto architect of Yale's central campus through the 1920s and 1930s: eight of the ten early residential colleges were his design, as were Sterling Memorial Library, Sterling Law Building, and the Hall of Graduate Studies. Many of the artisans who worked on the Memorial Quadrangle with Rogers, including G. Owen Bonawit and blacksmith Samuel Yellin, were commissioned again for these later buildings. The quadrangle was an antecedent of the Collegiate Gothic style used throughout the United States, and of large residential campuses of the 20th century, including Harvard College and Rice University. In particular, plans for creating a residential undergraduate campus at the University of Chicago made heavy reference to the Memorial Quadrangle.

She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from September 1999 to November 2006, representing Geelong Province. A former teacher and community campaigner, Carbines was a prominent backbench member of the government, often raising issues of local concern. She was a member of the Labor Right faction. Early life Carbines was Elaine Cafferty born in Manchester, England, but moved to Australia in 1968 after completing her elementary schooling. She received her secondary education at Mitcham High School, and studied teaching (BA 1978, Dip Ed 1979) at Monash University. It was at university where she joined the Labor Party, in response to the controversial dismissal of Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam by Governor- General John Kerr. She worked as a secondary school teacher, mostly in underprivileged areas for the next twenty years. In 1988 she gained a Diploma of Humanities from La Trobe University. She is married to Shane Carbines, a former umpire and senior official with the Geelong Football Umpires League. They have two children, Hannah and Scott. Elaine is also stepmother to Anthony and Nick. Political life Throughout her working life, Carbines remained active in politics, having been a party member since university. She was the secretary of Labor's Belmont branch in 1994, and of the Portarlington branch from 1995 to 1997. In 1996, she made an unsuccessful bid for the seat of Bellarine in the Legislative Assembly. She was a delegate to the party's state conference, representing the federal electorate of Corangamite, from 1995 to 2009. Carbines was also actively involved in several environmental campaigns, most notably the attempt to stop the move of the Coode Island chemical plant to the environmentally sensitive Point Lillias, and a proposal to build a rowing course on the site of the Belmont Common, another environmentally sensitive area on the outskirts of Geelong. When Carbines won Labor pre- selection to make a second run for office - this time for the Legislative Council seat of Geelong Province in the lead-up to the 1999 state election, the campaign against both developments became a key part of her platform. On election day, she received a swing of nearly five percent, and defeated sitting Liberal member Bill Hartigan on preferences. Carbines was a member of the Road Safety and Library Committees in her first three years in office, but was initially overlooked for ministerial duties. She also led the Live Music Taskforce, which attempted to solve issues related to the future of the live music scene in Melbourne, which many perceived to be under threat as a result of venues closing due to noise complaints and development. In March 2002, in the leadup to the election due later that year, she was made Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Training. In December that year, after Labor's election victory, she was instead made Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment. Carbines was by far the most visible of the four Geelong MPs, and is regularly seen in the media engaging with local issues. A popular local member, she campaigned for improved roads in the region, improved facilities in some of its smaller towns and repeatedly voice concerns about environmental issues, including the fate of Corio Bay and the Otway Ranges. She also actively tried to engage with the community, frequently attending public meetings and raising community concerns in parliament. This earned her some prominent supporters in the Geelong community; despite her often left-wing views, the head of the city's Chamber of Commerce, in noting that the state's second-largest city had no members of the ministry, prominently singled out Carbines as the city's best hope of obtaining one. Carbines also been vocal on issues of broader social significance, such as the treatment of refugees, recognition of the Australian Aboriginal flag and the issue of Tibetan independence. As a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet Group, Carbines was among those who put their names to an advertisement taken out by the Australia-Tibet Council during a visit to Australia by Chinese President Hu Jintao during 2003. There was some controversy when it became public that the Chinese Consul-General, Junting Tian, had raised the matter of her involvement in the campaign with Premier Steve Bracks and had sent Carbines a letter warning her against becoming involved in Tibet-related issues, which she later described as \\"intimidatory\\". Despite Carbines' local popularity, rumors began circulating as early as 2004 that she would face a challenge to her preselection for the 2006 state election due to factional issues. The situation has been further complicated by major changes to the format of the Legislative Council due to be introduced at the election, which will see Carbines' two-member electorate be merged into a significantly larger five- member electorate. Local media reported in October 2005 that two factionally connected Melbourne unionists were being tipped for the first two easily winnable positions on the party's ticket, with Carbines likely to be faced with the choice of taking the third potentially winnable \\"death seat\\" or contesting Legislative Assembly preselection against lower-profile, but better-connected colleagues Ian Trezise or Michael Crutchfield. Carbines was apparently saved when Bracks personally intervened on her behalf in January 2006, asking factional chiefs to find her and four upper house MPs a safe seat. This did not happen and Carbines lost her seat to Peter Kavanagh of the Democratic Labor Party after a recount.

It is known as \\"queen of waxes\\" and in its pure state, usually comes in the form of hard yellow-brown flakes. It is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm by collecting and drying them, beating them to loosen the wax, then refining and bleaching the wax. As a food additive, its E number is E903. Composition Carnauba palm Carnauba consists mostly of aliphatic esters (40 wt%), diesters of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (21.0 wt%), ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids (13.0 wt%), and fatty alcohols (12 wt%). The compounds are predominantly derived from acids and alcohols in the C26-C30 range. Distinctive for carnauba wax is the high content of diesters as well as methoxycinnamic acid.Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber \\"Waxes\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . Carnauba wax is sold in several grades, labeled T1, T3, and T4, depending on the purity level. Purification is accomplished by filtration, centrifugation, and bleaching. Candy coated with carnauba wax Properties Carnauba wax can produce a glossy finish and as such is used in automobile waxes, shoe polishes, dental floss, food products such as sweets, instrument polishes, and floor and furniture waxes and polishes, especially when mixed with beeswax and with turpentine. Use for paper coatings is the most common application in the United States. It was commonly used in its purest form as a coating on speedboat hulls in the early 1960s to enhance speed and aid in handling in salt water environments. It is also the main ingredient in surfboard wax, combined with coconut oil. Because of its hypoallergenic and emollient properties as well as its gloss, carnauba wax appears as an ingredient in many cosmetics formulas where it is used to thicken lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, deodorant, various skin care preparations, sun care preparations, etc. It is also used to make cutler's resin. It is the finish of choice for most briar tobacco or smoking pipes. It produces a high gloss finish when buffed that dulls with time rather than flaking off (as is the case with most other finishes used). Although too brittle to be used by itself, carnauba wax is often combined with other waxes (principally beeswax) to treat and waterproof many leather products where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather's hardness and durability. It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a tablet-coating agent. Adding the carnauba wax aids in the swallowing of tablets for patients. A very small amount (less than a hundredth of one percent by weight, i.e., 30 grams for a 300 kg batch) is sprinkled onto a batch of tablets after they have been sprayed and dried. The wax and tablets are then tumbled together for a few minutes before being discharged from the tablet-coating machine. In 1890, Charles Tainter patented the use of carnauba wax on phonograph cylinders as a replacement for a mixture of paraffin and beeswax. Carnauba wax may be used as a mold release agent for manufacture of fibre-reinforced plastics. An aerosol mold release agent is formed by dissolving carnauba wax in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE, carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy, epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types and generally enhances their properties . Carnauba wax is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons. Carnauba is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B, which is a blend of RDX and TNT. Production and export In 2006, Brazil produced 22,409 tons of carnauba wax, of which 14% was solid wax, and 86% was in powder form. There are 20-25 exporters of carnauba wax in Brazil who buy the carnauba wax from middlemen or directly from farmers. The exporters refine the wax before exporting it to the rest of the world. The four largest exporters of carnauba wax are Pontes, Brasil Ceras, Foncepi, and Carnauba do Brasil, who together account for around €25 million of the export market. According to the German television program Markencheck, conditions for many carnauba production workers are quite poor; one Brazilian Labor Ministry official found conditions \\"that could be described as slavery.\\" According to the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, the major destinations for exported carnauba wax are: * USA (25%) * Japan (15–25%) * Germany (10–15%) * Netherlands (5%) * Italy (5%) * Other destinations (18%) In light of the challenges in the supply chains, the Initiative for Responsible Carnauba (IRC) was founded in 2018 as part of the Private Business Action for Biodiversity project and together with the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). The IRC’s aim is to foster a responsible Carnauba wax production that respects workers’ rights and preserves biodiversity in the Carnauba wax producing areas. In an established working group with 20 companies, among them local manufacturers and international distributors and brands, the IRC has set social, traceability and biodiversity standards for the sector and helped local wax companies to implement them, with support of UEBT. The initiative also participated to the creation of a manual of good practices for the sector and 12 short learning videos (available on YouTube and suitable to be shared via WhatsApp) to inform field workers about their rights and good biodiversity practices, developed in collaboration with the local NGO Associação Caatinga.

The explanation provided by Little and Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting Tc. Schematic image of the Little–Parks experiment The Little–Parks effect consists in a periodic variation of the Tc with the magnetic flux, which is the product of the magnetic field (coaxial) and the cross sectional area of the cylinder. Tc depends on the kinetic energy of the superconducting electrons. More precisely, the Tc is such temperature at which the free energies of normal and superconducting electrons are equal, for a given magnetic field. To understand the periodic oscillation of the Tc, which constitutes the Little–Parks effect, one needs to understand the periodic variation of the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy oscillates because the applied magnetic flux increases the kinetic energy while superconducting vortices, periodically entering the cylinder, compensate for the flux effect and reduce the kinetic energy. Thus, the periodic oscillation of the kinetic energy and the related periodic oscillation of the critical temperature occur together. The Little–Parks effect is a result of collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the fluxoid rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors. The Little–Parks effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics be invariant with respect to the gauge choice for the electromagnetic potential, of which the magnetic vector potential A forms part. Electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge q travelling along some path P in a region with zero magnetic field B, but non- zero A (by mathbf{B} = 0 = abla times mathbf{A}), acquires a phase shift varphi, given in SI units by :varphi = frac{q}{hbar} int_P mathbf{A} cdot dmathbf{x}, In a superconductor, the electrons form a quantum superconducting condensate, called a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) condensate. In the BCS condensate all electrons behave coherently, i.e. as one particle. Thus the phase of the collective BCS wavefunction behaves under the influence of the vector potential A in the same way as the phase of a single electron. Therefore the BCS condensate flowing around a closed path in a multiply connected superconducting sample acquires a phase difference Δφ determined by the magnetic flux ΦB through the area enclosed by the path (via Stokes' theorem and abla times mathbf{A} = mathbf{B}), and given by: :Deltavarphi = frac{qPhi_B}{hbar}. This phase effect is responsible for the quantized-flux requirement and the Little–Parks effect in superconducting loops and empty cylinders. The quantization occurs because the superconducting wave function must be single valued in a loop or an empty superconducting cylinder: its phase difference Δφ around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of 2π, with the charge for the BCS electronic superconducting pairs. If the period of the Little–Parks oscillations is 2π with respect to the superconducting phase variable, from the formula above it follows that the period with respect to the magnetic flux is the same as the magnetic flux quantum, namely :Delta Phi_B = 2pihbar/2e=h/2e. Applications Little–Parks oscillations is a widely used proof mechanism of Cooper pairing. One of the good example is the study of the Superconductor Insulator Transition. Scanning electron microscope image of the small ring (diameter ~200 nm). Typical Little–Parks oscillations for different temperatures The challenge here is to separate Little–Parks oscillations from weak (anti-)localization (Altshuler et al. results, where authors observed the Aharonov–Bohm effect in a dirty metallic films). History Fritz London predicted that the fluxoid is quantized in a multiply connected superconductor. Experimentally has been shown, that the trapped magnetic flux existed only in discrete quantum units h/2e. Deaver and Fairbank were able to achieve the accuracy 20–30% because of the wall thickness of the cylinder. Little and Parks examined a \\"thin-walled\\" (Materials: Al, In, Pb, Sn and Sn–In alloys) cylinder (diameter was about 1 micron) at T very close to the transition temperature in an applied magnetic field in the axial direction. They found magnetoresistance oscillations with the period consistent with h/2e. What they actually measured was an infinitely small changes of resistance versus temperature for (different) constant magnetic field, as it shown in Fig. References Condensed matter physics Superconductivity ","title":"Little–Parks effect"},{"id":"1207208","text":"Vira may refer to: Places *Vira, Ariège, a commune in the Ariège department, France *Vira (Gambarogno), a municipality in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland *Vira, Kutch, a village in Kutch district of Gujarat, India *Vira, Pyrénées-Orientales, a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department, France *Vira, Split-Dalmatia County, a village on Hvar Island, Croatia Other uses *Vira, plural of \\"virus\\" in some pluralizations **Phylum vira, part of the LHT Virus classification scheme *Vira (dance), a traditional dance from Portugal *Vira (card game), a Swedish three-handed plain trick game using an ordinary 52-card pack.

It is located in Mesker Park on Evansville's northwest side and is run by the City of Evansville. The Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. History The zoo was founded in 1928 by Gilmore M. Haynie and other business leaders. Karl Kae Knecht, a local cartoonist for the Evansville Courier & Press, helped popularize the idea of a zoo. It initially opened with two lion cubs, some antelope, and an elephant. In 2008 the zoo finished a major expansion including the $15 million tropical rainforest exhibit and a new entry complex. The new exhibit was credited with drawing more than 38,000 visitors in its first month. One of two existing lakes in the zoo was filled in to make the exhibit, which added more than 150 animals to the zoo. In 2017, the zoo added Engelbrecht Carousel, with an adjacent bird aviary added in 2018. A carousel used to be at the zoo. The total cost for this project is $3 million. Currently in the design stage as of 2018, is a new outdoor penguin exhibit. (As of September 2019 the penguin exhibit is slated to open in 2021 per information board inside the zoo.) Additionally, the zoo plans to revamp the African Rift area when funding becomes available. Exhibits The new Amazonia rainforest exhibit opened to the public in 2008. Mesker Park was one of the first zoos in the United States to use a moat system to display animals in more natural exhibits. A waterfall from the Amazonia exhibit. =Amazonia= Amazonia is a Central/South American focused rainforest exhibit that opened in 2008. While there are large structures within the exhibit designed to look like vegetation, many of the plants seen within are in fact living plants, maintained by the zoo's grounds crew. As such, the exhibit grows and changes in time as plants are added and occasionally trimmed so as to not completely block out the sunlight. The exhibit added more than 150 animals to the zoo and is currently highlighted by jaguars, Baird's tapir, capybara, keel-billed toucan, bats, black howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys, prehensile-tailed porcupines, Arrau turtles, Cuvier's dwarf caiman, and several fish species from the Amazonian River system. The open spaces of the exhibit also function as a free-flight bird aviary, and house over ten species of birds. =North America= North America includes a large Mexican gray wolf enclosure, as well as prairie dogs, and several birds of prey. =Discovery Center= The Discovery Center is an indoor/outdoor exhibit that focuses on conservation, education, and endangered species. It also houses the zoo's education department and many of the animal used in educational programs, though some of these might not always be visible to the public. This exhibit contains Francois' langur, red pandas, clouded leopard, hyacinth macaw, and several smaller reptile enclosures. Of particular note is the Hellbender exhibit, where the zoo holds juvenile eastern hellbenders as part of a statewide conservation program in association with Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. =Lemur Forest= Lemur Forest was opened in 1999 to house the zoo's lemurs. It currently holds three species: ring-tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs and Coquerel's sifaka. A giraffe from the African Rift exhibit. =African Rift= The African Rift exhibit includes reticulated giraffes, Grant's zebras, sitatunga, and white storks in a large open areas. In July 2018, the zoo welcomed a new 10-month-old giraffe named Clementine. =Kley Building= The Kley Building was built in the 1950s and houses several exhibits. The upper floor contains a nocturnal exhibit, a reptile exhibit hall featuring rhinoceros iguana and Komodo dragon, and an exhibit hall used for traveling exhibits or special events. The lower floor contains the indoor portion of the zoo's Indian rhinoceros exhibit. This floor was once home to Bunny, an asian elephant and the world's oldest living hippopotamus in captivity, Donna, who was euthanized at the age of 60 in 2012, because of her failing health. =Asia & Australia= This area reproduces habitats for Asian and Australian animals. It includes the outdoor exhibits for the zoo's Indian rhinoceros, as well as Bactrian camels, sarus crane, barasingha, Amur tigers, Malayan sun bear, takin, kookaburra, and emus. =Children's Enchanted Forest= This exhibit is geared towards children and contains several playground elements and a seasonal petting zoo in addition to traditional zoo exhibits. It is home to North American river otters colobus monkeys, binturong, DeBrazza's monkeys, African crested porcupine, and macaws. Nearby are the Engelbrecht Carousel a budgie aviary, a gibbon exhibit and seasonal exhibits for tortoises. =Lake Victoria= Lake Victoria is home to wild water birds and turtles. Visitors can walk all the way around this lake, or rent paddle boats to go out on the lake. This is the largest lake in the zoo, and is the feature around which the zoo was built. =African Panorama= African Panorama is a set of enclosures built around a large open African savanna exhibit, with overlooks for visitors. The main exhibit features Abyssinian ground-hornbills, ostriches, kudu, African crowned cranes, and springbok. Smaller exhibits feature a giant anteater, mara, and stanley crane.  Botanical features  In addition to the live plants inside Amazonia, the grounds of the Mesker Park Zoo feature several gardens designed for guest experience, as well as plants specifically cultivated for zoo animal consumption. Zookeepers harvest these plants throughout the year as part of their animals' diets. Each year, in February, a variety of orchids line the Amazonia exhibit as part of the Orchid Escape event. There is also a plant sale fundraiser in the spring, where guests can purchase young specimens of plants seen throughout the zoo.  Additional attractions and programs  In addition to the new carousel, the zoo also contains a playground, cafe, gift shop and tram. The zoo also provides a wide variety of programming, from birthday parties to summer camps to outreach programs, as well as teen and adult volunteer opportunities. Conservation Many of the animals at the zoo are part of breeding programs organized by the AZA and the zoo is therefore recommended to breed (or not breed) its animals in accordance with those programs. Some recent births include Francois' langur, sitatunga, takin, African crested porcupine, colobus monkey, and lesser tenrec. Mesker Park Zoo houses a pair of Mexican gray wolves, a critically endangered animal, and works with United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of their recovery plan for this species. The zoo is also involved in eastern hellbender conservation, and is partnered with Purdue University and Indiana's Department of Natural Resources in their efforts to repopulate this subspecies of salamander. The zoo currently has a public display of tanks holding juvenile hellbenders, which will be returned to their habitat once they have reached a certain, less predated size, and an off-display adult stream containing several adult salamanders that might hopefully breed.

A contemporary of Ralph Bakshi, Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's animated films Wizards and The Lord of the Rings. Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists, with his characters remaining a popular subject.Harmanci, Reyhan, \\"The Bay Citizen: In Finishing Comics, a Son Completes a Legacy,\\" New York Times (July 1, 2010). Bodē was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame for comics artists in 2006. Career In 1963, at age 21, and while living in Utica, New York, Bodē self-published Das Kämpf, considered one of the first underground comic books. Created after Bodē's stint in the U.S. Army, Das Kampf has been called \\"a war-themed spoof on Charles Schulz's 1962 book Happiness is a Warm Puppy.\\"Fox, M. Steven. \\"Das Kämpf\\", ComixJoint. Accessed Dec. 29, 2016. With money borrowed from his brother Vincent, Bodē photocopied about 100 copies of the 52-page book and (mostly unsuccessfully) attempted to sell it around the Utica area. In the mid 1960s Bodē was living in Syracuse, New York, attending classes at Syracuse University and contributing to The Sword of Damocles, a student-run, though not university- sanctioned, humor magazine similar to The Harvard Lampoon. It was here that Bodē's most famous comic creation, Cheech Wizard, first saw publication. Cheech Wizard (sometimes characterized as a \\"cartoon messiah\\") is a wizard whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet. Cheech Wizard is constantly in search of a good party, cold beer, and attractive women. Usually depicted without arms, it is never actually revealed what Cheech Wizard looks like under the hat, or exactly what kind of creature he is, although in the episode entitled \\"The Unmasking of Cheech Wizard\\", when he \\"doffs the hat\\", it is evident that underneath was a low-rent Oz man all along (in an interview, reference is made to the frontal lump in the hat caused by crossed arms). Characters pressing the issue generally are rewarded with a swift kick to the groin by Cheech. After an initial run in The Sword of Damocles, the strip continued for a few more years in The Daily Orange, the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University. In 1968, Bodē illustrated the cover & interior art for R. A. Lafferty's science fiction novel Space Chantey, published by Ace Double. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he illustrated covers and interior art for the science fiction digests Amazing Stories, Fantastic, Galaxy Science Fiction, Witzend and Worlds of If. Discovered by fellow cartoonist Trina Robbins, Bodē moved to Manhattan in 1969 and joined the staff of the underground newspaper the East Village Other. It was here that Bodē met Spain Rodriguez, Robert Crumb and other founders of the quickly expanding underground comics world. At the East Village Other, he helped found Gothic Blimp Works, an underground comics supplement to the magazine, which ran for eight issues, the first two edited by Bodē. Bodē's post-apocalyptic science fiction action series Cobalt 60 featured an antihero wandering a devastated post-nuclear land, seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. Cobalt-60 debuted as a ten-page black-and-white story in the science fiction fanzine Shangri L'Affaires (a.k.a. Shaggy) #73, published in 1968. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist largely on the strength of Cobalt 60, but he never did anything else with the character. (Cobalt-60 was later \\"completed\\" in the early 1980s by Bodē's son Mark Bodé, with stories by Larry Todd, who was Vaughn's friend and collaborator in the 1960s on projects for Eerie, Creepy, and Vampirella magazines.) Beginning in 1968 and continuing until his untimely death, Bodē entered a prolific period of creativity, introducing a number of strips and ongoing series, most of which ran in underground newspapers or erotic magazines: * Bodē's strip War Lizards, a look at the Vietnam War from the hostile stance of the period's counterculture, was told with anthropomorphic reptiles instead of people. It ran sporadically in the East Village Other, Witzend, Pig Society, and Bodē's own Junkwaffel from 1969–1972. * Bodē's comic strip Deadbone, about the adventures of the inhabitants of a solitary mountain a billion years in the past, ran in the men's magazine Cavalier from 1969–1975. Originally in black-and-white, when colored the strip changed its title to Deadbone Erotica and later simply to Erotica. * Episodes of Cheech Wizard ran in the \\"Funny Pages\\" of ;;National Lampoon;; magazine in almost every issue from 1971 to 1975. * Bodē's black- and-white science fiction parody Sunpot appeared in Galaxy Science Fiction in the early 1970s. (It was later republished, in color, in Heavy Metal.) * Bodē's monthly comic strip feature Purple Pictography ran in Swank magazine in 1971–1972. (Bernie Wrightson did the painted art for five of Purple Pictography episodes based on Bodē's scripts and rough layouts.) Print Mint published four issues of Bodē's solo series Junkwaffel from 1971–1974. Bodē's graphic novel The Man, published by Print Mint in 1972, is about a caveman who accidentally makes important observations about life. = Cartoon Concert tour= Beginning in 1972, Bodē toured with a show called the \\"Cartoon Concert\\", that featured him vocalizing his characters while their depictions were presented on a screen behind him via a slide projector (in a performance similar to a chalk talk). The first of these \\"Cartoon Concerts\\" was presented in October 1972 at the Detroit Triple Fan Fair in front of 80 people. He next did the Concert at Bowling Green State University, and eventually performed it at several comic book conventions, including the November 1972 Creation Con in New York City. Observing the crowd reaction, The Bantam Lecture Bureau immediately signed him on, and the show became very popular on the college lecture circuit. Bodē even performed it at the Louvre, in Paris.Bob Levin. \\"I See My Light Come Shining,\\" The Comics Journal vol. 5, (March 2005). Archived at The Official Bodē website. Accessed Feb. 18, 2016.  Personal life  = Early life = Bodē was born in Utica, New York, the son of Kenneth and Elsie Bodé. His surname suggests German heritage. Vaughn was one of four children, including his older brother Victor and younger siblings Vincent and Valerie. Vaughn's father was an alcoholic; he started drawing as a way of escaping a less-than-happy childhood. Bodē's parents divorced when he was around ten years old, and he was sent to live with an uncle near Washington, D.C. After joining the Army at age 19, Bodē went AWOL but later received an honorable discharge due to a psychiatric diagnosis.Zagria. \\"Vaughn Bodé (1941 - 1975),\\" A Gender Variance Who's Who (15 June 2009). Bodē married Barbara Hawkins at age 20 in 1961. Their son Mark was born in 1963. Barbara divorced Bodē in 1972, and he moved to San Francisco in 1973 (with some of his underground contemporaries, including Robbins and Spain). = Sexuality = Around 1970–1971, conversations with the guru Prem Rawat and fellow cartoonist Jeffrey Catherine Jones (with whom Bodē shared a studio in Woodstock, New York) led Bodē to cross-dressing, transvestism, and even a short-lived experiment with female hormones. Bodē described his sexuality as \\"auto-sexual, heterosexual, homosexual, mano-sexual, sado-sexual, trans-sexual, uni-sexual, omni-sexual.\\" = Death = Bodē's death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation. His last words were to his son: \\"Mark, I've seen God four times, and I'm going to see him again soon. That's No. 1 to me, and you're No. 2.\\" Thirty-three years old at the time of his death, Bodē's ashes were dropped from a Cessna airplane over the waters off the coast of Point Reyes. He left behind a library of sketchbooks, journals, finished and unfinished works, paintings, and comic strips. Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections, mostly from Fantagraphics.  Influence  Bodē was a friend of animator Ralph Bakshi, and warned him against working with Robert Crumb on the animated film adaptation of Crumb's strip Fritz the Cat. Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's films Wizards and The Lord of the Rings. Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists and his work can often be seen replicated in the world of street art. As the original New York graffiti train writers (such as DONDI) chose to replicate his characters, images from his work have remained popular throughout the history of graffiti. His son Mark Bodé is also an artist, producing works similar to the elder Bodē's style, and further cementing his father's legacy. In 2004, Mark completed one of his father's unfinished works, The Lizard of Oz, a send-up of The Wizard of Oz, starring Cheech Wizard one more time. Awards The Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist was bestowed upon him in 1969, and he was nominated for Best Professional Artist the following year. He also won the , awarded by the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators at the Italian Lucca comics festival, in 1974. He was a finalist for induction into the Eisner Hall of Fame in 1998 and 2002, before finally being inducted in 2006. He was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1975.[ https://www.comic-con.org/awards/inkpot Inkpot Award] Bibliography * Das Kämpf (self-published, 1963) — re-issued in 1977 by Walter Bachner and Bagginer Productions with paste-up, layout, and lettering by Larry Todd)Fox, M.

After military postings and an assignment to the British Embassy in Washington, he retired from the military in 1900. He entered politics, was first elected in 1900, and later served as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and First Lord of the Admiralty following the First World War. He donated his country house, Chequers, to the nation as a retreat for the Prime Minister, and co-founded the Courtauld Institute of Art. Early life and family Lee's former residence at the Royal Military College of Canada Lee's former residence in Washington, D.C. Arthur Hamilton Lee was born at The Rectory, Bridport, Dorset in 1868. His father was rector of the town's Anglican St. Mary's Church. He was a grandson of Sir John Theophilus Lee, who as a midshipman was present at the Battle of the Nile.Lord Lee of Fareham Professor of Strategy and Tactics, R.M.C., 1893–98 By No. 2141, T. L. Brock; Royal Military College of Canada Review yearbook 1962 p 189 Education and early military career After attending Cheltenham College, Lee entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 17 February 1888. He was posted to the Far East, China, as Adjutant of the Royal Hong Kong Regiment (the Volunteers). He was promoted lieutenant on 18 February 1891. He returned to England in 1891, and was stationed on the Isle of Wight for the next two years. Professor at Royal Military College of Canada On 18 August 1893, at the age of 24, Lee became a professor of Strategy and Tactics, at the Royal Military College of Canada, in Kingston, Ontario, with the local rank of captain. Since only 11 to 30 cadets annually entered the College in those days, Lee would have instructed only about 140 cadets in his five years at the college (1893–1898), consisting of cadet numbers 320 to 457. Cadet No. 433, future Major General Thomas Victor Anderson, D.S.O., a future Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, recalled that Lee was known around the Royal Military College as 'The Nipper', which the cadets christened him because he used to sing George Grossmith's songs with gusto. He enjoyed riding and walking in winter across the ice to Wolfe Island, and to town. He was a regular attendant at St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) to hear the dean Buxton Smith. When Colonel Gerald Kitson, K.R.R.C., became RMC Commandant in 1897, Captain Lee came to live with the Kitsons in the Commandant's residence. In 1894, Lee initiated a Military Survey of the Canadian Frontier, and supervised its progress until its completion in 1896. During the summer of 1897 he was a Special Correspondent for the London Daily Chronicle, covering the earlier stages of the Klondike Gold Rush, based on his travels to Alaska and the Yukon. In 1900, when Lee resigned as British Military Attaché in Washington, D.C., Colonel Kitson resigned as Commandant of RMC to take over the Washington post vacated by Lee. Diplomatic postings He did not receive substantive promotion until the completion of his RMC appointment on 18 April 1898. He became the British military attaché with the United States Army in Cuba during the Spanish–American War, later in 1898. He received the U.S. campaign medal, was made an honorary member of the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry—the famous Roosevelt's \\"Rough Riders\\"—and met Theodore Roosevelt. On 28 January 1899 Lee, who was still not 30 years old, was appointed military attaché at the British Embassy in Washington, with the temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel (for the duration of his appointment). Although he would have preferred to have been on active service in South Africa, since the Boer War had just started, Lee enjoyed the challenging diplomatic assignment. Marriage, retirement from military On 23 December 1899 Lee married Ruth Moore (died 1966), daughter of New York banker John Godfrey Moore. He had first met her at parties in Kingston and Gananoque, and had taken her to balls at the Royal Military College, Kingston. Ruth was left a substantial inheritance after her father's death shortly before the wedding. Lee was promoted brevet major on 8 August 1900, returned to regimental duty on 22 August 1900, and retired from the army on 12 December 1900. Politics In 1900, Lee returned to England and embarked upon a political career. He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the Hampshire constituency of Fareham in the 1900 general election while still a regular officer. He represented Fareham for the next 18 years until his elevation to the peerage.Lord Lee of Fareham Professor of Strategy and Tactics, R.M.C., 1893-98 By No. 2141, T. L. Brock; Royal Military College of Canada Review yearbook 1962 p 189 He served as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1903 to 1905 under William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne. He also continued military service during this period as a member of the Volunteer Force. The resignation of Arthur Balfour as Conservative Prime Minister in favour of Liberal Leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in 1905 and the defeat of the Conservative Party in the elections of 1906 and 1910 postponed Lee's further office for a decade. He was Chairman of the Parliamentary Aerial Defence Committee, from 1910 to 1914. He also introduced the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912. First World War At the beginning of the First World War Lee served as Lord Kitchener's personal commissioner to report on the Army Medical Services in France, with the rank of temporary colonel. From October 1915 he served David Lloyd George at the Ministry of Munitions, and followed him to the War Office in 1916. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 12 July 1916. On 8 June 1917, with Lloyd George now Prime Minister, Lee became Director-General of Food Production under Rowland Prothero as President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Having then left the army he was permitted to retain the honorary rank of colonel. He was recognised for his work on 1 January 1918, being appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. He was elevated to the peerage on 9 July that year as Baron Lee of Fareham, of Chequers in the County of Buckinghamshire, shortly before he resigned as Director-General of Food Production after disagreements with Prothero. He then became a member of the House of Lords. Joins Cabinet Lee joined the Cabinet and the Privy Council in August 1919 when he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, succeeding Prothero. He became First Lord of the Admiralty on 18 February 1921, and was selected as a second British delegate to attend the Washington Naval Conference, along with Arthur Balfour, later that year. He resigned from Lloyd George's government in 1922, and was promoted to Viscount Lee of Fareham, of Bridport in the County of Dorset, on 9 December that year. Productive from House of Lords Conservative Prime Ministers Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin, along with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, all benefited substantially from Viscount Lee's dedicated work during the decade of the 1920s, as Lee was not content to rest upon his laurels in the House of Lords. He went on to chair Royal Commissions on the civil service in India (1923–1924), London cross-river traffic (1926), and Police Powers and Procedure (1928). He was also Chair of the Radium Commission and of the Committee on Police Pay and Pensions (1925). He was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 1 January 1925, and he was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1929 King's Birthday Honours. He was also appointed Knight of Grace in the Venerable Order of Saint John on 20 June 1930. Chequers Lee's Chequers estate 1909-1921 Lee and his wife took on a long lease of Chequers, a country house and estate in Buckinghamshire, in 1909. The Lees bought the property in 1912 after the owner died, and began restoration. In 1917, they gave the estate, and the entire contents of the house which included a library, historical papers and manuscripts and a collection of Cromwellian portraits and artefacts, in trust to the nation to be used as the official residence and retreat of successive British Prime Ministers in perpetuity, enabled by the Chequers Estate Act 1917. The Lees left the property in January 1921, and Lloyd George was the first Prime Minister to use the property. Patron of the arts, and later life After furnishing Chequers, Lee began a second collection. He gained the financial backing of Samuel Courtauld and Joseph Duveen, and established the Courtauld Institute of Art with the University of London. The institute, the first to offer degrees in the history of art in Britain, opened in 1932 with William George Constable as its director at Lee's request. Also with Courtauld, he persuaded the University of London to accept the transfer of the Warburg Institute from Hamburg; it was loaned to him prior to its re- establishment in 1944. He also donated a silver collection and other objects to Hart House, at the University of Toronto in Canada in 1940. Additionally, in the 1920s Lee was a trustee of the Wallace Collection and of the National Gallery. He served as chairman of the latter in 1931–2, and was a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 26 May 1926 until his death. Between 1917 and 1939 Lee was President of Cheltenham College. Lee wrote his autobiography, entitled A Good Innings in 1941, and this was privately published in three volumes that year. It was later republished by his good friend Alan Clark, also a Conservative politician, for publishers J. Murray in 1974 (see below). Death Lord Lee died at Old Quarries, a grade II listed building in Avening, Gloucestershire, in 1947. Lee had no children and his viscountcy became extinct upon his death. His widow, Viscountess Lee, presented to the Royal Military College of Canada Museum a silver-headed walking stick of her late husband, which he had used daily at RMC fifty-four years earlier. The stick has two silver bands listing the places where Lee served, or visited, between 1888 and 1904, which include the Royal Military College of Canada. Lady Lee also presented the RMC Museum with three photographs of Lord Lee –- two of them taken in Kingston, one in uniform in 1893, and the other in 1896 wearing a checked suit, silver-topped stick in hand. The third is a photograph of the portrait by Herbert James Gunn in full regalia of a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath.Lord Lee of Fareham Professor of Strategy and Tactics, R.M.C., 1893-98 By No. 2141, T.

It houses around 450 species of animals in an area of . It opened on July 1, 1934, and quickly gained international recognition for using moats and ditches instead of cages to separate animals from visitors and from other animals. The zoo was also the first in America to exhibit giant pandas, one of which (Su Lin) has been taxidermied and put on display in Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. In 1960, Brookfield Zoo built the nation's first fully indoor dolphin exhibit, and in the 1980s, the zoo introduced Tropic World, the first fully indoor rain forest simulation and the then-largest indoor zoo exhibit in the world. The Brookfield Zoo is owned by the Cook County Forest Preserve District and managed by the Chicago Zoological Society. The society sponsors numerous research and conservation efforts globally. History WPA poster In 1919, Edith Rockefeller McCormick donated land she had received from her father as a wedding gift to the Cook County Forest Preserve District for development as a zoological garden. The district added to that plot and in 1921, the Chicago Zoological Society was established. Serious construction did not begin until 1926, after a zoo tax was approved. Construction slowed during the Great Depression, but regained momentum by late 1931. Construction went on at an increased pace and the zoo opened on July 1, 1934. By the end of September 1934, over one million people had visited the new zoo; the four millionth visitor was just two years later. The 1950s saw the addition of a veterinary hospital, a children's zoo, and the famous central fountain. The zoo went through a decline in the 1960s until a large bond issue from the Forest Preserve District, close attention to zoo governance, and visitor services saw the zoo recreate itself as one of the nation's best. Tropic World, the then- largest indoor zoo exhibit in the world, was designed by French architect Pierre Venoa and opened in three phases (Africa, Asia, and South America) between 1982 and 1984. During the zoo's early decades, a narrow-gauge railroad existed, which carried guests around the outer perimeter of the park from the North Gate to the old seven seas dolphin habitat on the park's south end. Bison lived on a small prairie on the west end of the park and could only been seen from the train, reminiscent of the Old West. The railroad was dismantled in the mid-1980s, although the pathways once used by the train still exist as roads for service vehicles, as does the North Gate station (since converted into a snack stand) North Gate In the early 21st century, the zoo has undergone significant capital upgrades, constructing the Regenstein Wolf Woods, the Hamill Family Play Zoo, butterfly tent, sheltered group catering pavilions, and the largest non-restored, hand-carved, wooden carousel in the United States. Great Bear Wilderness, a new, sprawling habitat, opened in 2010. The interiors of several existing buildings were reconfigured into immersion exhibits, based upon ecosystems rather than by clades; these include the Swamp, the Fragile Rain Forest, Fragile Desert (the Sahara of North Africa) the Living Coast (the shores of Chile and Peru), the African Savanna, and Australia House. The zoo's reptile house, the first building to open in 1934, was closed in December 2004 and is being converted into a conservation center which will not display live animals but will detail the zoo's larger conservation mission. The children's zoo was dismantled in early 2013, and a new family-based series of exhibits known as Wild Encounters opened on the site in 2015, which features red pandas, reindeer, a petting zoo for goats, a walk-through exhibit for wallabies and a free-flight parakeet aviary. Because of the expense of constructing Great Bear Wilderness and protests from In Defense of Animals over the deaths of the zoo's African elephants, the Pachyderm House was closed for a year in 2011 for modifications and no longer exhibits elephants or river hippopotamuses. The building dates back to 1934 and currently houses only rhinoceroses, tapirs, and pygmy hippos. The Brookfield Zoo is also known for its majestic fountain named after the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. On some days, the fountain's spouting water can reach up to 60 feet high. The zoo has been closed only five times in its history: On September 14, 2008, after damage from a weekend rainstorm; on February 2, 2011, after a major blizzard; on April 18–19, 2013, after flooding from a severe rainstorm; January 2019 due to below-freezing temperatures; and from March 19 to July 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Animals ;Dolphins: The Seven Seas at CZS or Brookfield Zoo currently has seven Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Allie (F), Tapeko (F), Spree (F), Noelani (F), Allison (F), Merlin (M), and Magic (M). ;Ziggy Ziggy was a 6.5 ton male elephant that was kept in an indoor enclosure for nearly thirty years after it attacked its trainer George 'Slim' Lewis in 1941. Ziggy was originally bought by theater empresario Florenz Ziegfeld as a birthday present for his daughter Patricia, but was given to the zoo when he outgrew his pen on the grounds of the Ziegfelds' manor in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. During the 1960s and 1970s, Ziggy attained a cult following in the Chicago area, and the elephant was finally released in 1970 amid much fanfare. Sadly, the elephant fell into his exhibit's moat in March 1975 and died seven months later. ;Olga Olga was an Atlantic walrus and a favorite to thousands of visitors between 1962 and 1988, entertaining them with her antics. She is remembered by a large bronze statue in the current sea mammal exhibit. ;Binti Jua Binti Jua is a female western lowland gorilla. On August 16, 1996, a very young boy, visiting the zoo with his parents, fell into the gorilla exhibit of Tropic World. Binti Jua ran over to the crying boy and carefully cradled him and kept other gorillas away from him. When rescue workers arrived she brought the boy to them. The incident received international attention in the media for Binti Jua, who also received special treats and attention from zoo staff for quite some time. It started a debate as to whether Binti Jua's actions were the result of the training she had received from her keepers (who had taught her to bring her own baby Koola to zoo curators for inspection) or an instinctive sense of animal altruism. ;Cookie Cookie, a Major Mitchell's cockatoo, had been part of the zoo's collection since the opening in 1934. He was given to Brookfield Zoo when he was one year old and was recognized as the oldest known member of his species in captivity as well as the oldest living parrot at the time and one of the longest-lived birds on record. He is now deceased, having been euthanized due to a sharp decline in health on August 27, 2016, at 83 years of age.

McCutcheon was the president of the Chicago Zoological Society from 1921 until 1948 and oversaw the zoo's construction, opening and its early years, including helping it through the war years, when the zoo saw a decrease in attendance. Grace Olive Wiley briefly worked as a reptile curator at the zoo in 1935. George B. Rabb was the director of Brookfield Zoo from 1976 until 2003, having originally worked as a researcher and an assistant to the director. Brookfield has had exceptional success in breeding the sitatunga, a type of antelope. It also bred the world’s first captive-born black rhinoceros (1941) and gray-headed kingfisher (1980), the first okapi born in the United States (1959), and the first wombat born outside Australia (1975). Brookfield Zoo is right next to the Riverside Brookfield High School and had a program for freshman with the zoo called SEE (School of Environmental Education) Team. The SEE Team and many other clubs, activities, and faculty members at RBHS were cut following a failed 2011 referendum. The SEE Team was resurrected due to its popularity from 2012-2014. It ended before the 2015 school year due to low student enrollment and hasn't been able to pick back up since then. Partnering with Miami University in Ohio, the Chicago Zoological Society has designed a master's degree program, the Advanced Inquiry Program. Adults in the program can take classes in person with specialists at the zoo and online with professors from the university. Starting in 2010, the AIP roughly costs $2,873 without fees and includes an opportunity to travel.\\"Chicago Zoological Society - Master's Degree Advanced Inquiry Program.\\" Chicago Zoological Society - Centers of Excellence. 2015.

Disney World partnered with zoo by giving a $25,000 grant assigned specifically to the work in Punta San Juan, Peru, which helped the Chicago Zoological Society conservationists gain clearance into the highly restricted and protected area. The CZS has hired multiple people that already worked for the reserve to help build a conservation research team. Samples are taken from wildlife such as Peruvian fur seals, South American sea lions, Inca terns, Peruvian boobies, Guanay cormorants, and the endangered Humboldt penguins. The team uses the information they gathered to research the environment, observe the species, and monitor populations. Project results further knowledge about the ocean and help save endangered species. Team members also continuously have groups of children, of varying ages, go out to clean up garbage that accumulates on the beaches of Punta San Juan from the Pacific Ocean.Gregory, Ted. \\"Brookfield Zoo's Quiet Crusade: Saving Wildlife on the Peruvian Coast.\\" Chicago Tribune, December 22, 2015.

Animal deaths *In March 1975, Ziggy, a male Indian elephant weighing over six tons, fell into an 8-foot compound when attempting to poke a zookeeper with his trunk. The elephant survived the fall but scraped his head and broke a tusk. A few months later, Ziggy laid down to rest in his indoor stall. He then rolled to his side and died. Zoo spokespeople claim Ziggy had died mainly because of old age. The zoo claims that the animal's health had been declining before he fell into the moat. *In July 2008, 16 stingrays died in the Stingray Bay! habitat when a heater unit malfunctioned, increasing water temperatures by about 10 degrees. *In July 2015, 54 stingrays were found dead in the zoo's Stingray Bay! habitat. The habitat's oxygen levels dropped, and its life support system malfunctioned.

Originally composed solely of a number of \\"core worlds,\\" several years prior to the show's time frame the Alliance fought the Unification War to bring all colonized worlds under its control. The Independent Faction or \\"Browncoats\\" wanted the outer worlds to remain autonomous and attempted to resist Alliance control. The war raged for several years, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides, until the Alliance emerged victorious. An armistice was signed between the Alliance and the Independent Faction, thus ending the war and securing Alliance control over the entirety of the system. Name Union of Allied Planets flag (episode \\"The Train Job\\"). Union of Allied Planets flag (episode \\"Bushwacked\\"). The scripts for the pilot, \\"Serenity,\\" and the first broadcast episode, \\"The Train Job,\\" refer to an \\"AngloSino\\" flag on the IAV spaceship Dortmunder and on the stolen boxes. The Alliance flag shown in the pilot is a blending of the American and Chinese flags, having the blue field and the red and white stripes of the United States flag and the red field and yellow stars of the Chinese flag. Two versions of this flag, one with 13 stripes and one with five stripes, appear in the series. The alliance is formally described as the Union of Allied Planets in the episode \\"Ariel.\\" Corporations The Blue Sun corporation is a powerful conglomerate with much influence within the Alliance. Joss Whedon compared it with \\"Coca-Cola or Microsoft\\" and said that \\"practically half the government was Blue Sun.\\" Their agents are \\"Hands of Blue.\\" The Weyland-Yutani corporation from Alien is also alluded to; its logo appears on Alliance weapons. In the movie Serenity, the Alliance also hires local security companies. Universe The two worlds that make up the \\"core planets\\" (the first worlds to be terraformed) are Sihnon, a mostly East Asia-themed planet, and Londinium, a world with mostly American and Western Europe influences. The alliance of the two worlds leads up to a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious universe. The Alliance may have some elements of a monarchy. In \\"Serenity,\\" Malcolm Reynolds (Serenity's captain) said \\"I'd like to be king of all Londinium\\" and many of Inara Serra's customers are Lords. However, \\"King of all Londinium\\" may just be an idiom (i.e., \\"king of the world\\" in modern usage) and Lord could merely be a political title.Similar to the courtesy-titles for judges and elected mayors of some cities in Britain (e.g., the “Lord Mayor of London”). There is also evidence that the Alliance may have some elements of a technocracy, as in a flashback within the episode \\"Safe\\", Simon Tam's parents chastised Simon's fear for River as potentially threatening his future, including the possibility of becoming the medical-elect, presumably the equivalent of an elected Technocrat representing the Medical sector. In Serenity, the movie set in the Firefly universe, it is revealed that the Alliance is run by a Parliament, as well as a Prime Minister. This invites the possibility that the Alliance is a constitutional monarchy and Westminster parliamentary system with the inclusion of technocratically elected members, where outside of the central planets, oligarchies through lordships represent local colonial governance. It appears that this Alliance was a melding of the People's Republic of China and the United States. The Alliance retains a mixture of American and Chinese culture. Generally, the Alliance is rather authoritarian, although Joss Whedon, the series' creator, has said this is at least partly because the show is seen from the viewpoint of those hostile to the Alliance. Whedon himself admits that sometimes, the Alliance is like the predominant U.S. view of the United States in World War II: doing very good things, helping people, spreading democracy. At other times the Alliance can tend towards black ops and power-grabbing, although rarely more so than any real- world democracy. Due to the melding of American and Chinese influences in the Alliance, most people in the Firefly universe are equally adept in speaking both English and Mandarin; some characters on the show speak Chinese at times (usually when using obscenities, so Whedon wouldn't have to bleep anything out and ruin the suspension of disbelief), and many signs are printed in both English and Chinese. Additionally, during the episode \\"Out of Gas,\\" Serenitys warning messages over the intercom are repeated in both English and Cantonese. The Chinese spoken is based on Mandarin (intermixed with Cantonese), but the pronunciation is heavily corrupted from the real-world language by the actors. Alliance military The Alliance operates a fleet of massive spaceships, resembling huge floating cities, that act as both military and police in the space between the various planets of the Firefly Universe. Alliance ships have the registry prefix IAV (Interstellar Alliance Vessel): e.g., IAV Dortmunder and IAV Magellan. The pilot episode of the series reveals that the large city- ships carry smaller gunships; these are never named nor described further. In the episode \\"Bushwhacked,\\" it is revealed that Alliance ships have nurseries. In the film Serenity, there appear a fleet of sleeker, more streamlined warships, suggesting that the film had a higher CGI budget. Uniforms worn by various characters Alliance ground troops are nicknamed \\"purple bellies\\" (in contrast to the Independent \\"browncoats\\"). Crewmembers on Alliance starships wear gray uniforms resembling those worn by Imperial German Army from World War I; officers and enlisted crew are identically dressed (except for headgear: officers wear hats, enlisted crew wear berets). In Serenity, Alliance crew members wear blue uniforms. The exact structure of the Alliance military, such as its rank system and branch organization, is not described. Some Alliance officers are seen with naval ranks, such as Commander, and others with ground force ranks such as Colonel and General.For example, a Lieutenant appears in the episode \\"The Message\\", and there is reference to a Colonel. Future During the events of the 2005 film, the crew of Serenity discover the truth behind River Tam's insanity; she had discovered the truth behind the Reavers, in which the Alliance had inadvertently created the first Reavers in an attempt to create peace on the planet Miranda. Malcolm Reynolds resolves to reveal this to the universe, and after a lengthy battle with the Operative, succeeds in doing so, ruining the Operative's faith in the Alliance's methods and revealing the existence of the Reavers (plus the true colors of the Alliance) to the system at large. Before he departs, the Operative tells Mal of how much trouble he had caused the Alliance (in the shooting script, he states that they had gotten multiple complaints from several worlds), and warns him that, although their regime is weakened, they will be after him in revenge.This occurs in the last ten minutes of Serenity Critical analyses Author Stanley C. Pelkey notes the marked influence of the Western genre on the Firefly franchise. He says that in contrast to most westerns, the central civilising force (The Alliance) is portrayed as evil. He goes on to say that little concrete evidence is given to support this, especially in the series as opposed to the movie. He notes an example where the Alliance gave medical aid to a Serenity crew member, and then let the ship go, and contrasts it with the implausibility of similar treatment being afforded to the rebels by an Imperial Star Destroyer from the Star Wars milieu.Note, however, that medical aid is given to Shepherd Book only after showing his ID badge to the Alliance crew, to which they react with surprise followed by deference — no other crew members received such treatment. Shepard Book receives free medical treatment for a very specific reason explained in the graphic novel The Shepherd's Tale. Pelkey says that even in the movie with its \\"dark revelation,\\" there is still some ambiguity about the Alliance's moral alignment. Whedon himself has said the Alliance sometimes represents a \\"beautiful shining light of democracy\\" but at other times reflects the American government as it was when it intervened in Vietnam, which Whedon sees as something the U.S. had no right to do, nor any ability to do successfully.

He is remembered for his solo piano music and, to a degree, his songs. Life =Early years= Mompou was born in Barcelona to the lawyer Frederic Mompou and his wife Josefina Dencausse, who was of French origin. His brother Josep Mompou (1888–1968) became a painter. His sketch of a simple farmhouse appeared on the covers of all of Frederic's published music.PRODigital Records – Program notes Mompou studied piano under Pedro Serra at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu before going to Paris, to study at the Conservatoire de Paris, which was headed by Gabriel Fauré. Mompou had heard Fauré perform in Barcelona when he was nine years old, and his music and performing style had made a powerful and lasting impression on him. He had a letter of introduction to Fauré from Enrique Granados, but it never reached its intended recipient. He entered the Conservatoire (with another Spaniard, José Iturbi), but studied with Isidor Philipp, head of the piano department. He also took private piano lessons with Ferdinand Motte-Lacroix and harmony and composition lessons with Marcel Samuel-Rousseau. His extreme shyness, introspection and self-effacement meant that he could not pursue a solo career, but chose to devote himself to composition instead. In 1917 he returned to Barcelona, fleeing the war. His first published work, Cants magics, appeared in 1920, mainly as a result of the advocacy of his friend Agustin Quintas. =1920s–1950s= Mompou returned to Paris in 1921, by which time his music was being regularly performed publicly, by his former teacher Motte-Lacroix and others, and he found himself the darling of Paris. In 1921, his Scènes d'enfants (1915–18), performed by Motte-Lacroix, inspired the French critic Émile Vuillermoz to proclaim Mompou \\"the only disciple and successor\\" to Claude Debussy. Mompou himself often performed his own compositions, but only at private soirees, never in public. However, his time in Paris was not easy. He published no music between 1931 and 1941, when he left for his native Catalonia, fleeing the German occupation of Paris. In that time, his father died and his brother became seriously ill. The Spanish Civil War troubled him greatly. His personal financial situation was often dire enough to lead him away from music and into various business ventures, including an attempt to revive the traditional family bell foundry. Kenneth MacMillan's ballet La Casa de los Pájaros (The House of Birds), set to orchestrations by John Lanchbery of various piano pieces by Mompou, was premiered at Sadler's Wells in London in 1955 and was also staged at the 4th Festival de Música y Danza at Granada. In 1956 appeared Don Perlimpin (also seen as Don Perlimpinada), a ballet written in collaboration between Mompou and Xavier Montsalvatge and based on a play by Lorca. Most of the music was by Mompou, but Montsalvatge helped with the orchestration and linking passages and added two numbers of his own.Naxos Naxos In 1957, aged 64, Mompou married the pianist Carmen Bravo (c.1923Answers.com29 April 2007Marcel Worms). She was 30 years his junior. It was the first marriage for both of them and they had no children. =Later years= Mompou's piano, at the Museu de la Música de Barcelona, Barcelona In 1974 Mompou recorded his piano works for the Spanish label Ensayo. These invaluable recordings have been issued on compact discs by both Ensayo and Brilliant Classics. During his career Mompou received numerous awards, including: Chevalier des arts et lettres (France), Premio Nacional de Música (Spain), Doctor honoris causa, Universitat de Barcelona (1979) and Medalla d'Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya (1980). An initial supporter of Franco's regime, in Barcelona he became a member of the Royal Academy of San Jorge, but otherwise lived quietly there until his death in 1987 at the age of 94 from respiratory failure. He is buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona. After the death of his widow in 2007 about 80 unpublished and hitherto unknown works were discovered in Mompou’s files at his home and also in the files of the National Library of Catalonia. Some of them were given performances in Barcelona in 2008 by Jordi Masó and Mac McClure. Many others were given their premiere performances in 2009 by Marcel Worms.Marcel Worms, Press Release, 11 September 2009 Style Mompou is best known as a miniaturist, writing short, relatively improvisatory music, often described as \\"delicate\\" or \\"intimate\\". His principal influences were French impressionism, Erik Satie and Gabriel Fauré, resulting in a style in which musical development is minimized and expression is concentrated into very small forms. He was fond of ostinato figures, bell imitations (his mother's family owned the Dencausse bell foundry and his grandfather was a bell maker), and a kind of incantatory, meditative sound, the most complete expression of which can be found in his masterpiece Musica Callada (or the Voice of Silence) based on the mystical poetry of Saint John of the Cross. He was also influenced by the sounds and smells of the maritime quarter of Barcelona, the cry of seagulls, the sound of children playing and popular Catalan culture. He often dispensed with bar lines and key signatures. His music is rooted in the chord G-C-E-A-D, which he named Barri de platja (the Beach Quarter). { tempo \\"Metallic chords\\" { 1 } { 1 } { 1 } { 1 } } Selected works =Piano solo= *Impresiones íntimas (Intimate impressions), 9 miniatures, written 1911–1914 *Pessebres (1914–1917) (Nativity Scenes) *Scènes d'enfants (1915–1918) (Scenes of children; later orchestrated by Alexandre Tansman) *Suburbis (1916–1917) (Suburbs; later orchestrated by Manuel Rosenthal) *Cants màgics (1920) (Magic Songs) *Fêtes lointaines (1920–1921) (Distant Celebrations) *Charmes (1920–1921) *Cançons i danses (1921–1979) (Songs and dances) *Dialogues (1923) *Préludes (1927–1960) *Variations on a Theme of Chopin (1938–1957) (based on Chopin's Prelude No. 7 in A major) *Paisatges (1942–1960) (Landscapes) *El Pont (1947) *Cançó de bressol (1951) (Lullaby) *Música callada (Silent music or Voices of silence) (Primer cuaderno – 1959, Segundo cuaderno – 1962, Tercer cuaderno – 1965, Cuarto cuaderno – 1967) =Voice and piano= *L'hora grisa (1916) (The grey hour) *Cuatro melodías (1925) (Four melodies) *Comptines (1926–1943) (Nursery Rhymes) *Combat del somni (1942–1948) (Dream combat) *Cantar del alma (1951) (Soul Song) *Canciones becquerianas (1971) (Songs after Bécquer) =Ballets= *Don Perlimpin (1956; written with Xavier Montsalvatge) =Choral= *Los Improperios (The Insults), for chorus and orchestra (1964; written in memory of Francis Poulenc) *L'Ocell daurat (The Golden Bird), cantata for children's choir (1970) =Guitar= *Suite Compostelana for guitar (1962; composed for Andrés Segovia) *Cançó i dansa No. 10 (Sobre dos Cantigas del Rei Alfonso X), originally for piano (1953), transcribed for guitar by the composer (undated manuscript)Published by Bèrben, Ancona, 2002. *Cançó i dansa No. 13 (Cançó: El cant dels ocells; Dansa (El bon caçador)) for guitar (1972)Published by EMEC, Madrid, 1986–1988. Recordings Mompou himself recorded a few of his piano pieces for EMI in 1950 and then a much larger portion of his piano output, including the Musica callada, for Ensayo in 1974, when he was over 80 years old. The later recordings have been released in a boxed set of 4 CDs by Brilliant Classics. For decades, other pianists rarely recorded his works, with major figures such as Arthur Rubinstein, Guiomar Novaes, Magda Tagliaferro, and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli recording just a handful of his pieces. In the late 1950s, Mompou's wife, Carmen Bravo, recorded some of his works for EMI. The Spanish specialist Alicia de Larrocha recorded a larger selection, and more recently, Mompou's works have received greater attention. Acclaimed contemporary pianists such as Stephen Hough in 1997 and Arcadi Volodos in 2013 have released full CDs devoted to his pieces, and Jordi Masó has recorded a cycle of Mompou's piano works for Naxos Records. Other contemporary pianists who have recorded Mompou's pieces include Daniil Trifonov, Alexandre Tharaud, Herbert Henck, Jenny Lin, Aaron Krister Johnson,Sonic Hermit Records, 2016 and Javier Perianes, among others. British pianist Martin Jones has recorded the complete piano works of Mompou for Nimbus, including those unpublished in Mompou's lifetime, many of which were discovered when his apartment was cleared out in 2008. The great Spanish soprano Victoria de los Ángeles recorded Mompou's haunting song cycle El combat del somni, and a video from 1971 survives of her singing one of these songs in her living room with the composer as her accompanist. Also, Spanish guitar great Andrés Segovia recorded Mompou's Suite Compostelana, which was dedicated to him.

Ice cream makers may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor. The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture. An ice cream maker has to simultaneously freeze the mixture while churning it so as to aerate the mixture and keep the ice crystals small (less than 50 μm). As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency.  History  Agnes Marshall's 1885 patented ice cream maker. Around 1832, Augustus Jackson achieved fame for creating multiple ice cream recipes and pioneering a superior ice cream preparation technique by adding salt to the ice. In 1843, Nancy M. (Donaldson) Johnson of Philadelphia received the first U.S. patent for a small-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezer. The ice cream freezer was a pewter cylinder. Dubbed the \\"Queen of Ices\\", Victorian English culinary entrepreneur Agnes Marshall was granted a patent for an ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five whole minutes.  Process  Ice cream makers may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor. The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture. An ice cream maker has to simultaneously freeze the mixture while churning it so as to aerate the mixture and keep the ice crystals small (less than 50 μm). As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency. Some machines—such as certain lower-priced countertop models—require the resulting mixture to be frozen for additional time after churning is complete.  Models  = Hand-cranked machines = Nancy Johnson patented the first hand-cranked model in 1843. William Young produced the machine as the \\"Johnson Patent Ice-Cream Freezer\\" in 1848. Hand-cranked machines' ice and salt mixture must be replenished to make a new batch of ice cream. Usually, rock salt is used. The salt causes the ice to melt and lowers the temperature in the process, below fresh water freezing, but the water does not freeze due to the salt content. The sub-freezing temperature helps slowly freeze and make the ice cream. Some small manual units comprise a bowl with coolant-filled hollow walls. These have a volume of approximately one pint (500 ml). The paddle is often built into a plastic top. The mixture is poured into the frozen bowl and placed in a freezer. The paddles are hand-turned every ten minutes or so for a few hours until reaching the desired consistency and flavor. = Electric machines = There are four types of electric ice cream machines. Each has an electric motor that drives the bowl or the paddle to stir the mixture. The major difference between the four is how the cooling is performed.  Counter-top machines  Counter-top machines use a double-walled bowl with a solution between the walls (typically distilled water and urea) that freezes below . In a domestic freezer, this requires up to 24 hours before the machine is ready. Once frozen, the bowl is put into the machine, the mixture is added to the bowl, and the machine started. The paddles rotate, stirring the mixture as it gradually freezes through contact with the frozen bowl. After twenty to thirty minutes, the solution between the double walls thaws, and the ice cream freezes. This type of machine has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive; however, a pre-frozen bowl makes only one batch at a time. The bowl must be refrozen to make another batch. Multi-batches require extra bowls for the machine, which require extra freezer space.  Small freezer-unit machines  An ice cream maker that has to be placed inside the freezer. Small freezer-unit machines sit inside the freezer (or the freezer part of the refrigerator) and operate similar to a food processor in slow-motion. Every few seconds, the paddles stir the mixture to prevent formation of large ice crystals. When the ice cream sufficiently freezes, the paddles automatically stop rotating and lift. Since the mixture is cooled in the freezer, it takes longer to freeze than other ice cream makers, which work by placing the ice cream bowl in direct contact with the cooling element. A disadvantage is that the freezer door has to be closed over the flat cord, which is plugged into the nearest power outlet. However, some modern refrigerators have a built-in ice-cream maker as an accessory or a specialized electrical outlet for freezer-unit machines. It is not necessary to ¨pre¨-freeze this type of ice cream maker. However, some people who feel that this type of machine produces a lower-quality ice cream because of its slow-motion method. Also available are cordless, battery-operated ice-cream makers that may be placed directly in the freezer, although these tend to require expensive non-rechargeable potassium batteries (most rechargeable batteries or regular alkaline cells perform very poorly at low temperature).  Built-in freezer machines  A table top left More expensive, and usually larger, machines have a freezing mechanism built in and do not require a bowl to be pre-chilled. A few minutes after starting the cooling system, the mixture can be poured in and the paddle started. As with coolant-bowl machines, ice cream is ready in twenty to thirty minutes depending on the quantity and recipe. These machines can be used immediately with no preparation, and they make any number of batches of ice cream without a delay between batches. Some of these machines cannot be moved without waiting twelve hours before use since moving the unit upsets coolant in the freezing system. These machines are normally kept permanently in one position ready for use making them impractical in smaller kitchens. Electrically-operated ice cream maker  Ice-salt coolant machines  The fourth type of electric ice cream maker uses an outer tub filled with ice and salt for chilling. An inner canister holds the ice cream mixture and churn and scraper assembly. A high- speed electric motor, geared at approximately 75RPM, drives a mechanism that simultaneously rotates the canister, counter-rotates the scraper, and holds the churn paddles stationary. As the canister turns, the ice cream mixture freezes against the inner wall of the canister. The counter-rotating scraper constantly removes the frozen product from the canister wall and returns it to the mixture. The continuing turning motion of the canister against the stationary churn paddles causes the mixture to become increasingly thick. Enough time, ice and salt produces a smooth \\"hard packed\\" ice cream.

Vang, a six-year veteran of the California National Guard, shot eight people while on a hunting trip in northern Wisconsin on November 21, 2004; six were killed and two were wounded. Vang, who lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota at the time of the shootings, is imprisoned at the Anamosa State Penitentiary, as of 2006. Biography Vang's father served in a secret war that was funded and organized by the CIA that recruited the Hmong in Laos to disrupt supply routes going from Laos to Vietnam during the Vietnam War. General Vang Pao was the leader of this army and was seen as a father figure to the Hmong. After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by Pathet Lao to \\"exterminate the Hmong down to the last root\\" in retaliation for the Hmong assisting the United States. Many Hmong were able to make it to the U.S. however thousands of the Hmong were left behind and were killed. Vang and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in California. Vang lived in Sacramento and eventually enlisted in the California National Guard. Sometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to the Twin Cities Capital City of St. Paul, neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota. Vang is the father of seven children. He is also a family shaman and was a hunting enthusiast.  Shootings  On the weekend of the shootings, Vang went out deer hunting with two friends and their two sons in northwest Wisconsin, a region where deer hunting is particularly popular, east of Birchwood, Wisconsin around the town of Meteor. Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area. The land in the area is a mix of public and private. It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private 400 acre (1.6 km²) tract of land. On Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a cabin on this private land. Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willers' testimony, \\"As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off.\\" At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck, a surviving victim, stated \\"Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on.

Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau \\"flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number\\". The events after the confrontation are disputed. A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds. Vang is believed to have fired about 20 rounds from a Saiga rifle chambered in 7.62×39mm, which was recovered by police. One of the wounded hunters died the next day, bringing the toll to six dead and two wounded. Vang fled the scene on foot and discarded his remaining ammunition, later stating that he did not want to shoot anyone else. Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give Vang a ride, eventually taking him to Vang's cabin. Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting. An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail. His bail was set at $2.5 million. = Victims = The victims were part of a group of about 15 people who made an annual opening-weekend trip to the Crotteau-Willers property. Among those killed were father and son Robert and Joey Crotteau and Willers' daughter Jessica Willers. Those who were killed: * Robert Crotteau, 42 * Joey Crotteau, 20 * Alan Laski, 43 * Mark Roidt, 28 * Jessica Willers, 27 * Denny Drew, 55 Those who were wounded: * Lauren Hesebeck, 48 * Terry Willers, 47  Investigation  There have been conflicting reports about what may have led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shot at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun even though during the trial Hesebeck admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. Vang stated that race was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as \\"chink\\" and \\"gook.\\" On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a \\"Hmong a--hole.\\" Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term \\"Mud Duck\\" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to \\"Cheesehead\\" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, due to the fact that Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota. The criminal complaint states that Vang shot four of the victims in the back, and Vang himself admits he shot one victim in the back. He also shot many of the victims multiple times. The prosecution made use of these facts in arguing against the claim of self-defense.  Trial  The trial of Chai Soua Vang began Saturday, September 10, 2005 in Sawyer County Courthouse. All fourteen jurors were selected from Dane County, Wisconsin, and bused about northwest to Sawyer County, where they were sequestered. Vang told the jury he feared for his life and began firing only after another hunter's shot nearly hit him. He detailed for the jurors how the other hunters approached him, and how he responded by shooting at each one. He says he shot two of the victims in the back because they were \\"disrespectful.\\" He recounted with clarity how he killed each victim. While saying on the stand, \\"(he wished) it wasn't happening,\\" Vang contended that three of the hunters deserved to die: \\"Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?\\" Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked. \\"Yes,\\" Chai Soua Vang replied. Vang further testified that Joseph Crotteau deserved to die \\"because he accused me of giving him the finger and tried to cut in front of me to stop me from leaving.\\" And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski \\"deserved to die,\\" his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths. = Conviction = On September 16, 2005, Chai Soua Vang was found guilty of all six charges of first degree intentional homicide and three charges of attempted homicide by a jury of eight women and four men. On November 8, 2005, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms plus seventy years (forty for two counts of attempted homicide plus five additional years for each count of homicide in the first degree); a sentence of life without parole. At the time, Wisconsin was one of 12 states in the United States that did not have the death penalty.

Examples of disorders treated with sexual medicine are erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, and prostate cancer. Sexual medicine often uses a multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, mental health professionals, social workers, and sex therapists. Sexual medicine physicians often approach treatment with medicine and surgery, while sex therapists often focus on behavioral treatments. While literature on the prevalence of sexual dysfunction is very limited especially in women, about 31% of women report at least one sexual dysfunction regardless of age. About 43% of men report at least one sexual dysfunction, and most increase with age except for premature ejaculation.  Scope  Sexual medicine addresses issues of sexual dysfunction, sex education, disorders of sex development, sexually transmitted infections, puberty, and diseases of the reproductive system. The field connects to multiple medical disciplines with varying degrees of overlap including reproductive medicine, urology, psychiatry, genetics, gynaecology, andrology, endocrinology, and primary care. However, sexual medicine differs from reproductive medicine in that sexual medicine addresses disorders of the sexual organs or psyche as it relates to sexual pleasure, mental health, and well-being, while reproductive medicine addresses disorders of organs that affect reproductive potential.  History  The concept of sexual medicine did not arise in North America until the latter half of the 20th century, specifically around the time of the sexual revolution during the 1960s and 70s where the baby boomer generation had an increase in birth control pill use. Prior to that, open discussion of sex was seen as taboo. Psychoanalytic theories about sexuality, such as those proposed by Sigmund Freud and Helene Deutsch, were considered highly controversial. It was not until the post-World War II baby boom era and the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s that sex, and subsequently sexual disorders, became a more accepted topic of discussion. In fact, urologists were the first medical specialty to practice sexual medicine. Not only does their practice focus on the urinary tract (the kidneys, urinary bladder, and urethra), there is a large emphasis on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Today, sexual medicine has reached a wider range of medical specialties, as well as psychologists and social workers, to name a few. What really opened the doors for societal normalcy of sexual medicine was the Massachusetts Male Aging Study performed in 1994 that clearly defined erectile dysfunction (ED) as a condition that affects a large population of American males. It also had reported that, if possible, men would be willing to improve their sexual performance if a medication was deemed to be safe. On March 27, 1998, sildenafil citrate was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of erectil ED. The approval of Sildenafil transformed the way America talked about a topic that was once very private before.  Diagnosis  Sexual medicine plays a role in a wide range of medical specialties, from a primary care provider to a sexual health physician to a sexologist. A physician's role in taking a sexual history is vital in diagnosing someone who presents with a sexual dysfunction. There is some anxiety that arises when sex comes up for discussion, especially between a healthcare provider and an individual. It's reported that only 35% of primary care physicians have taken a sexual history and, due to this, there is a gap in achieving holistic healthcare. Clinicians fear individuals are not willing to share information, but in reality, it may be that the provider is shying away from the discussion. This steering away can be a result of lack of training, lack of structured tools and knowledge to assess a sexual history, and fears of offending individuals they are treating. Thus, knowing how to take an objective sexual history can help a clinician narrow down the pathogenesis of an individual's sexual health problem. Issues related to sexual or reproductive medicine may be inhibited by a reluctance of an individual to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on an individual's mind, it is important that the physician initiates the subject. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for people to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some people, a very high degree of familiarity may make an individual reluctant to reveal such intimate issues.'The Cringe Report' By Susan Quilliam. Posted: 28 June 2011; J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care. 2011;37(2):110–112. When visiting a health care provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level. Taking a sexual history is an important component of sexual medicine when diagnosing an individual with a sexual dysfunction. A sexual history incorporates social, medical, and surgical information, and should touch on all factors that affect an individual's sexuality. Essentially, it is a conversation between a health care provider and an individual that is geared towards obtaining information about the person's sexual health status. If this is done properly, it will be easier for the physician to address concerns the individual may have. Some people may not be comfortable in sharing information, but it is the role of the physician to create a comfortable and non-judgemental, private environment for those they are working with to speak openly. Sexual dysfunctions in men are often associated with testosterone deficiency. Signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiencies vary in each individual. Therefore, physical examinations could be done for men who suspect testosterone deficiencies to identify physical signs of the disorder. Common physical signs include fatigue, increased body fat, weight gain, muscle weakness, and depressed mood. Laboratory tests may also be used to assist with diagnosis, such as blood glucose levels, lipid panel, and hormonal profile. Additionally, diagnostic categories of sexual disorders are listed in both the ICD-10 and DSM-5. ICD-10 categorizes the disorders by sexual desire, sexual arousal, orgasm, and sexual pain, while DSM-5 categorizes the dysfunctions by gender, substance/medication induced, paraphilic, or gender dysphoria.  Risk factors for sexual dysfunction  The risk of developing a sexual dysfunction increases with age in both men and women. There are several risk factors that are associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary disease, psychological/psychiatric disorders, and presence of a chronic disease are all common risk factors for developing a sexual dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor that is specifically associated with erectile dysfunction. Past family medical history of sexual dysfunction disorders are also a risk factor for development. Sociocultural factors may also contribute to sexual problems, such as personal, religious, or cultural beliefs about sex. Personal well- being may also impact an individual's sexual activity. Stress and fatigue may contribute to developing a decreased sexual response or interest. Fatigue may result from poor sleep or another underlying medical problem. Current or past sexual abuse, whether physical or emotional, is also a risk factor for developing sexual problems.  Disorders of sexual function  Sexual dysfunctions are sexual problems that are continuous in a person's life, adding stress and difficulty to personal relationships. Congenital or acquired, these conditions refer to any pathology which interferes with the perception of satisfactory sexual health. Varied conditions include absent sexual organs, hermaphrodite and other genetic malformations, or trauma such as amputation or lacerations. Examples of conditions which may be treated by specialists in this field include: Female * Vaginismus * Genito-pelvic pain- penetration disorder * Vulvodynia * Imperforate hymen * Vaginal septum * Vaginitis * Endometriosis * Atrophic vaginitis *Vaginal yeast infection * Pelvic floor dysfunction Male * Premature ejaculation * Delayed ejaculation * Erectile dysfunction * Retrograde ejaculation * Anejaculation Non-exclusive * Lack or loss of sexual desire (Libido) * Hypoactive sexual desire disorder * Lack of sexual enjoyment * Sexual arousal disorder * Failure of sexual response * Anorgasmia * Hypersexuality * Dyspareunia * Substance or medication induced sexual dysfunction * Painful orgasm * Chronic Pelvic pain * Sexually transmitted infection * Hypogonadism *Sexuality issues *Pelvic floor dysfunction  Treatment  Once a diagnosis of sexual dysfunction has been made, treatment is often integrative and individualized. Sexual medicine experts aim to discover both the physical and psychologic factors that are the cause of an individual's sexual dysfunction. =Male sexual dysfunction= The most common male sexual dysfunction disorders are erectile dysfunction (ED), low libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Once etiology and cardiovascular risk factors for ED have been identified, lifestyle or non-pharmacological therapy can be initiated to mitigate risk factors. As of 2018, the American Urological Association (AUA) ED guidelines recommend shared medical decision-making between patient and provider over first-, second-. and third-line therapies. However, phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis), are often recommended due to their favorable efficacy and side effect profile and work by increasing the lifespan of the vasodilator nitric oxide in the corpus cavernosum. Alternative treatments for ED are the use of vacuum-assisted erection devices, intracavernosal injection or intraurethral administration of alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), and surgery if necessary. Treatment for decreased libido is often directed towards the cause of the low libido. Low levels of hormones such as testosterone, serum prolactin, TSH, and estradiol can be associated with low libido, and thus hormone replacement therapy is often used to restore the levels of these hormones in the body. Low libido can also be secondary to use of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and so reduction of dose of the SSRI is used to improve libido. Additionally, low libido due to psychological causes is often approached with psychotherapy. Similarly, treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction such as premature ejaculation is dependent on the etiology. SSRIs, topical anesthetics, and psychotherapy are commonly used to treat premature ejaculation. = Female sexual dysfunction = Similar to male sexual dysfunctions, sexual problems in women are also prevalent; however, they differ in the kind of dysfunction. For example, males have more problems related to function of their reproductive organs, where as for women it is more common to experience psychological problems, like lack of a sexual desire and more pain related to sexual activity. In 2008, 40% of U.S. women reported they were experiencing low sexual desire. atment approach is very dependent on the type of dysfunction the women is experiencing. The treatment of female sexual dysfunction is varied as multiple causes are often identified. Following evaluation of symptoms and diagnosis, the woman's goals for treatment are determined and used to track progress. Health professionals are also trained to include the woman's sexual partner in the treatment plan, including noting any sexual dysfunction of the partner. Referral of the woman or couple to a sex therapist is also common to increase communication and expression of concerns and desires. Finally, conditions associated with the documented sexual dysfunction are simultaneously treated and included in the treatment plan. Non-pharmacologic treatment for female sexual dysfunction can include lifestyle modifications, biofeedback, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy can include topical treatments, hormone therapy, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants. In fact, low sexual desire is the most common sexual problem for women at any age. With this, sexual ideas and thoughts are also absent. Counseling sessions addressing changes the couple can make can improve a woman's sexual desire. Other ways to treat include: trying a new sex position, using a sexual toy or device, having sex in an unusual location. Also, a woman enjoying her time with her partner outside of the bedroom, on a \\"date night\\", can improve the relationship inside the bedroom. Sexual pain is another large factor for women, caused by Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), which includes hypoestrogenic vulvovaginal atrophy, provoked pelvic floor hypertonus, and vulvodynia. These can all be treated with lubricants and moisturizers, estrogen, and ospemifene. =Psychiatric barriers= Sexual disorders are common in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Depression and anxiety disorders are strongly connected with reduced sex drive and a lack of sexual enjoyment. These individuals experience a decreased sexual desire and sexual aversion. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and eating disorders, are all associated with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction of sexual activity. Many factors can induce sexual dysfunction in individuals with psychiatric disorders, such as the effects of antipsychotics and antidepressants. Treatment may include switching medications to one with less sexual dysfunction side effects, decreasing the dose of the medication to decrease these side effects, or psychiatric counseling therapy. =Lifestyle barriers= General health greatly relates to sexual health in both males and females. Sexual medicine specialists take into consideration unhealthy lifestyle habits that may contribute to the sexual quality of life of individuals who are experiencing sexual dysfunction. Obesity, tobacco smoking, alcohol, substance abuse, and chronic stress are all lifestyle factors that may have negative impacts on sexual health and can lead to the development of sexual dysfunctions. Both obesity and tobacco smoking have negative impacts on cardiovascular and metabolic function, which contributes to the development of sexual dysfunctions. Chronic smoking causes erectile dysfunction in men due to a decrease in vasodilation of vascular endothelial tissue. Alcohol dependence can lead to erectile dysfunction in mend and reduced vaginal lubrication in women. Long term substance abuse of multiple recreational drugs (MDMA, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine), leads to a decrease in sexual desire, inability to achieve orgasm, and a reduction of sexual satisfaction. Chronic stress may potentially contribute to sexual dysfunction, as it can induce high levels of cortisol, which may cause harmful effects in if it remains altered long term. High levels of cortisol have been shown to cause a reduction in gonadic steroids and adrenal androgens. Studies have shown that these steroids and adrenal androgens have effects on genital arousal as well as sexual desire. Sexual medicine experts are responsible for promoting healthy lifestyle habits in order to help prevent sexual dissatisfaction. Adoption of healthy lifestyle routines include: avoiding drugs, smoke, and excessive alcohol, as well as incorporating regular physical activity accompanied by a balanced diet and use of stress-management strategies. These habits can be proposed before trying to incorporate pharmacological therapies and/or psychiatric therapies.  Sexual dysfunction in transgender persons  Limited research has been performed on sexual dysfunction in those who are transgendered, but preliminary research suggests that initiating a sexual relationship is difficult for some. One recent study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine surveyed 518 transgender individuals about sexual dysfunction and disturbances and reported that difficulty initiating sexual encounters and difficulties achieving orgasm were the most prevalent sexual dysfunctions experienced in the study sample.  Challenges  While the awareness of sexual health importance has increased in regards to individuals' general health and well-being, there is still a taboo that follows sexual health. The perception of sexual health varies among different cultures, as the notion is tied with many cultural norms, religion, laws, traditions, and many more. Therefore, sexual medicine is a very unique component in the medicinal practice that holds its own pack of challenges. The main obstacle that stands between these discussions have been reported as the lack of education regarding sexual issues in individuals. The discussion of sexual health and taking a sexual history faces barriers as physicians infrequently address these topics in visits, and individuals are reluctant to discuss openly due to the perception that it is the physician's duty to initiate the topic and fears that the conversation will make the physician uncomfortable. Another challenge in sexual medicine is that in a standard process of drug discovery and development, human tissue and cells are not used in testing the candidate drug. Instead, animal models are often used to study sexual function, pathophysiology of diseases that cause sexual dysfunction, and new drugs. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships are studied in animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs. With animal models, there is a limitation to understanding sexual dysfunction and sexual medicine, as the results achieved can only mount to predictions. Identification and treatment of female sexual dysfunctions are also a challenge as women often encounter difficulty within multiple disorders and sexual phases. The various sexual phases that are encompassed within female sexual dysfunctions (FSD) include hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD) and female sexual pain disorders (FPD). Because many of these domains overlap, it is difficult to identify the target of treatment and many limitations are placed in the approach for research. Risk factors for female sexual dysfunctions were observed to be embedded with biopsychosocial aspects in epidemiological studies such as depression, urinary tract symptoms, cancer and cancer treatment, relationship problems, and menopausal transition. As a result, a multidimensional approach must be taken in the identification and treatment of female sexual dysfunctions. The issue of psychological dilemmas that are associated with sexual dysfunctions is another challenge that is faced in sexual medicine. There are many psychological aspects that are tied in with sexual dysfunctions. Despite much of sex therapy originating from psychological and cognitive-behavioral practices, many of the psychological dynamics have been lost in the sexual medicine protocols. Approaching from a psychological and existential perspective helps link the understanding between sexual function and sexual dysfunction in the individual. Because the psychological aspects underneath the sexual distress are not being addressed within sexual therapy and treatments are mostly focused on the specific symptoms in sexual medicine, there are many situations where individuals still experience disappointment and dissatisfaction within sexual activities despite the dysfunction being resolved.

First published in 1999, the novel is based on the Ukrainian version of Sleeping Beauty and other folk tales. Various forms of magic, potions, and immortal deities also play an important role in the story.  Plot  The protagonist and narrator is Ivan Smetski, a young Ukrainian-American linguist who specializes in Old Church Slavonic, a language from 10th-century Ruthenia. In 1992, Ivan returns to his native town of Kiev to pursue additional graduate studies. While there he re-discovers the body of a woman that he had seen as a child, apparently sleeping in the woods. He awakens her with a kiss, and she tells him, in Old Church Slavonic, that she is Katerina, a princess of the kingdom of Taina. Transported back to the 10th century, Ivan follows Katerina back to Taina where he finds the Christian kingdom terrorized by the traditional Russian arch-villainess Baba Yaga. Ivan and Katerina marry and escape back to the 20th century to avoid the machinations of Baba Yaga, who has enslaved a god and laid claim to Taina's throne, and the druzhinnik Dimitri who covets the throne. Baba Yaga's magical powers, however, allow her to follow Ivan and Katerina to modern times. Back in the Ukraine, Ivan discovers that his cousin is in reality the immortal god Mikola Mozhaiski. Returning to the United States, Ivan further discovers that his mother is a magic user, with the same powers as Katerina. After Katerina discovers Dimitri's plot through scrying, Ivan and Katerina return to Taina, deftly avoiding Baba Yaga who magically \\"skyjacks\\" their intended Boeing 747 back to the 10th century. Returning to Taina, Ivan and Katerina confront Dimitri, the enslaved god, and Baba Yaga. Though the Castle of Taina is destroyed, the two emerge victorious. They and their children split the rest of their days between the modern world and Taina.

It was established in 1955 and is currently equipped with the F/A-18F Super Hornet. The squadron is assigned to Carrier Air Wing Eight and uses the radio callsign Lion. History =1950s= F4D-1 Skyray Fighter Squadron Two Hundred Thirteen (VF-213) was established on June 22, 1955 at NAS Moffett Field, California. The first cruise was aboard flying the F2H Banshee. When they returned, they transitioned to the F4D Skyray which they flew for two deployments on . They then transitioned to the F3H Demon, which gave the squadron the capability to fire the newly deployed AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. VF-213 deployed next for a third cruise aboard USS Lexington. =1960s= F-4s on in 1968 In June 1961, VF-213 moved to NAS Miramar, which became their home for the next 36 years. Three years later, in February 1964, VF-213 accepting the first of their new F-4B Phantom IIs. =Vietnam War= In November 1965, VFA-213 joined Attack Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) and made 9 deployments to Vietnam and the Western Pacific aboard as follows: *From 17 October 1963 to 20 July 1964, equipped with F-4Bs. *From 19 October 1965 to 13 June 1966. On 28 April F-4B #150645 was hit by antiaircraft fire over North Vietnam, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. On 18 May F-4B #152257 was hit by antiaircraft fire near the Mu Gia Pass, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. *From 5 November 1966 to 19 June 1967. On 20 December a squadron aircraft and one from VF-114 shot down two Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) Antonov An-2 with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. On 4 February F-4B #153007 was hit by antiaircraft fire over North Vietnam, both crewmen LT Donald Thompson and LT Allan Collamore were killed, their remains were identified in February 2001. *From 18 November 1967 to 28 June 1968. *From 30 December 1968 to 4 September 1969.

On 18 June F-4J #157273 was hit by antiaircraft fire, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. *From 23 November 1973 to 9 July 1974. *From 21 May to 15 December 1975. =1970s= In September 1976, VF-213 began the transition to the F-14A Tomcat. The first cruise with the F-14 was with CVW-11 aboard USS Kitty Hawk in October 1977. After the Kitty Hawk cruise, the carrier air wing switched to and took part in two Mediterranean cruises in 1979 and 1981. =1980s= In December 1981, VF-213 added a new mission as they began training with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) and in September 1982, VF-213 deployed aboard . During Indian Ocean operations, the squadron achieved a new milestone by flying the longest Tomcat flight from a carrier on a TARPS mission. On 24 January 1986 they deployed with USS Enterprise to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, where VF-213 often intercepted Soviet and Indian aircraft. During this deployment, tensions between the U.S. and Libya escalated, necessitating the decision to move USS Enterprise through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. Upon arrival in the Gulf of Sidra CVW-11 aircraft flew patrols for two months, although encounters with Libyan aircraft were rare. The ship transited the Strait of Gibraltar and around the Cape of Good Hope before continuing onto Perth, Australia and across the Pacific to their home port. 1988 saw VF-213 flying cover over reflagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and participating in Operation Praying Mantis. In 1990 VF-213 and the rest of the air wing switched aircraft carriers to . The first cruise on USS Abraham Lincoln was a six-week transit from NAS Norfolk to NAS Alameda, via Cape Horn. The squadron won the \\"BOOLA BOOLA\\" award in March 1989 for their professional completion of all missile test firings. In late 1989, VF-213 and CVW-11 went around the world on USS Enterprise for a WESTPAC deployment ending at NAS Norfolk for refurbishment. =1990s= F-14D carrying a LANTIRN pod The squadron deployed to WestPac on USS Abraham Lincoln in May 1991 in support of UN sanctions against Iraq. VF-213 flew combat air patrol and TARPS missions, recording the devastation of Kuwait oil fields. In 1993, VF-213 became the sole F-14 squadron on Abraham Lincoln. That same year, VF-213 flew in support of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. Kara Hultgreen, the first qualified female F-14 pilot in the US Navy, was assigned to VF-213, and on 25 October 1994, her F-14 crashed while on approach to USS Abraham Lincoln. Both she and her RIO ejected, but only the RIO survived. The 1995 WestPac cruise again saw the squadron flying over the skies of southern Iraq. In 1996, VF-213 moved to USS Kitty Hawk for the 1996–1997 WESTPAC deployment. During this deployment VF-213 fired twenty six AIM-54 Phoenix and six AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, including one event where six planes launched twelve Phoenix missiles. These mass firings were conducted to reduce the numbers of older Phoenix missiles in inventory, as they were being removed from service. After the 1997 cruise, VF-213 moved from NAS Miramar to NAS Oceana and transitioned to the F-14D Super Tomcat, becoming the fourth F-14 squadron to receive the D model. In 1998 they moved to , and began work- ups for their next cruise. During the 1998-1999 deployment, VF-213 was the first squadron to fire an AIM-54C Phoenix with the aircrew on night vision goggles. Two months into the deployment, VF-213 participated in Operation Desert Fox, which was the Navy's largest combat evolution since the Gulf War. This successful deployment included the longest combat line period in over 25 years. F-14Ds from VF-213, as well as the rest of the embarked carrier air wing aboard USS Carl Vinson, joined other US air assets in the final strikes of that operation.Vinson/CVW-11 Report - Wings of Gold Highlights of the cruise included the execution of 19 strikes, dropping 20 laser-guided bombs, supporting 11 combined strikes, flying 70 missions, and logging 230 combat sorties, including 45 reconnaissance missions imaging more than 580 targets. VF-213 F-14 tail markings On 5 January 1999, two F-14Ds on patrol over Iraq were directed to intercept two Iraqi MiG-25s south of the \\"no fly zone\\". The Tomcats fired two AIM-54 missiles, the first ever Phoenix combat-launch by the US Navy. The Iraqi jets turned north and the missiles fell short of their targets.Vinson/CVW-11 Report - VF-213 Highlights Wings of Gold VF-213/CVW-11 returned home in the spring of 1999. =2000s= After the September 11 attacks, USS Carl Vinson with CVW-11 was the second carrier battle group after Enterprise on station in the North Arabian Sea, preparing for attacks against Afghanistan. On 7 October 2001 during a CVW-11 strike, VF-213 dropped the first bombs of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) on an SA-3 site near Kabul International Airport.Tony Holmes (2008), p. 27 VF-213 also conducted reconnaissance, utilizing their TARPS pods, and also provided laser weapon guidance for F/A-18 Hornets and GPS weapons coordinates for Hornets and USAF strike aircraft.VF-213: The Black Lions Wings of Gold During the ten weeks VF-213 were supporting OEF they flew over 500 combat sorties, over 2600 combat flight hours and expended 435,000 pounds of ordnanceTony Holmes (2008), p. 66 and provided reconnaissance with their TARPS pods. VF-213 was also the first F-14 unit to use its internal 20 mm cannon in combat during the Battle of Mazar e SharifTony Holmes (2008), pp. 56-57 VF-213 received the 2001 Commander Naval Air Pacific Fleet Battle \\"E\\", Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Safety \\"S\\", Clifton Award and the Commander Fighter Wing Atlantic Golden Wrench for their performance in 2001. After the 2001 cruise ended in 2002, VF-213 changed air wings from CVW-11 to CVW-8. On March 22, 2003, VF-213 deployed aboard to the Mediterranean Sea in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war VF-213 would fly 198 strike, combat air patrol and ground forces support missions, delivering 102 laser-guided bombs and 94 JDAM bombs. The last US F-14 to fly a combat mission lands at Naval Air Station Pensacola VF-213 was paired up with VF-31 for the 2005–2006 final F-14 Tomcat cruise on board USS Theodore Roosevelt. During the cruise, VF-213 and VF-31 received ROVER upgrades to their aircraft, enabling them to transmit real-time images from their LANTIRN sensor to ground operators. VF-31 and 213 collectively completed 1,163 combat sorties, and dropped 9,500 pounds of ordnance during reconnaissance, surveillance, and close air support missions in support of OIF. On 10 March 2006, VF-213 returned to NAS Oceana after the final F-14 cruise. All 22 Tomcats flew together in a wedge formation over NAS Oceana. VF-213 began their transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet in April 2006 and was re-designated VFA-213 on 2 April 2006. VFA-213 was the first Super Hornet squadron to fly AESA-equipped Super Hornets.Boeing F/A-18E/F Block 2 Super Hornets Flying at Naval Air Station Oceana VFA-213 became the first squadron to receive Dual-Cockpit Cueing System for both pilot and weapon systems officer, retrofitted with an aft cockpit Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), on May 18, 2007.Boeing Dual-Cockpit Cueing System Introduced to U.S. Navy Squadron F/A-18F over in 2008 On 13 May 2008 an F/A-18F from the squadron operating from USS Theodore Roosevelt accidentally dropped a 500-pound laser-guided bomb outside of the Pinecastle bombing range near the Ocala National Forest. The bomb explosion started a wildfire which burned of vegetation. No one was injured in the blaze, but the emergency response cost $342,946. A Navy investigation determined that technical misunderstandings and crew fatigue contributed to the mishap. The two crew members of the jet were later returned to flying status after a board review.Jones, Matthew, \\"Navy Report: Fatigue, Errors Led To Pilot's Bomb Accident\\", Norfolk Virginian- Pilot, May 1, 2009. VFA-213, along with CVW-8 and USS Theodore Roosevelt, participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 08-4 Operation Brimstone off the coast of North Carolina between 21 and 31 July 2008. The British carrier , the amphibious assault ship with associated units, the Brazilian Navy frigate Greenhalgh, and the French submarine also participated in the event.JTFEX 08-4 \\"Operation Brimstone\\" Flexes Allied Force Training On 8 September 2008, VFA-213 and the rest of CVW-8 deployed on board USS Theodore Roosevelt on a regularly scheduled deployment.USS Theodore Roosevelt Deploys in Support of Maritime Security Operations On 4 October the Roosevelt Carrier Group arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, the first visit by a US aircraft carrier since 1967 and three days later the carrier left Cape Town.TR Completes South African Port Visit CVW-8 and CVN-71 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and flew more than 3,100 sorties and dropped more than 59,500 pounds of ordnance while providing close air support for ISAF-forces in Afghanistan. =2010s= On 11 May 2011, the squadrons of CVW-8 embarked on 's maiden deployment, scheduled to conduct operations in the US 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operations.George H.W.

From 10 February 2017 to 9 March 2017, the command conducted OIR combat operations from the Mediterranean Sea. VFA-213 resumed combat operations on 23 March 2017 from the Persian Gulf until 22 May 2017. In January 2018, VFA-213 participated in the initial flight deck certification for the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier, . On 14 March 2018, a Super Hornet from VFA-213 crashed near Key West killing the pilot and WSO.https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/03/14/super-hornet-crashes- near-key-west/ During April and May 2018, the squadrons of CVW-8 conducted joint operations with French Naval Forces out of NAS Oceana. Following those operations, the air wing and French aircraft embarked on USS George H. W. Bush, conducting strike missions. In September 2018, VFA-213 attended the Naval Weapons Systems Evaluation Program (NWSEP) out of Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, with a five aircraft detachment. During the detachment, VFA-213 employed 19 air-to-air missiles, including nine AIM-7 Sparrows, seven AIM-9M Sidewinders, one AIM-9X Sidewinder, and two AIM-9X Block II Sidewinders. Subsequently, the command earned the 2018 Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Grand Slam award for demonstrating the highest capability to maintain and utilize air-to-air missile weapons systems.

It was inspired by aerodynamic design. Streamline architecture emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements. In industrial design, it was used in railroad locomotives, telephones, toasters, buses, appliances, and other devices to give the impression of sleekness and modernity. In France, it was called the Style paquebot, or \\"Ocean liner style\\", and was influenced by the design of the luxury ocean liner SS Normandie, launched in 1932. Influences and origins As the Great Depression of the 1930s progressed, Americans saw a new aspect of Art Deco, i.e., streamlining, a concept first conceived by industrial designers who stripped Art Deco design of its ornament in favor of the aerodynamic pure-line concept of motion and speed developed from scientific thinking. The cylindrical forms and long horizontal windowing in architecture may also have been influenced by constructivism, and by the New Objectivity artists, a movement connected to the German Werkbund. Examples of this style include the 1923 Mossehaus, the reconstruction of the corner of a Berlin office building in 1923 by Erich Mendelsohn and Richard Neutra. The Streamline Moderne was sometimes a reflection of austere economic times; sharp angles were replaced with simple, aerodynamic curves, and ornament was replaced with smooth concrete and glass. The style was the first to incorporate electric light into architectural structure. In the first-class dining room of the SS Normandie, fitted out 1933–35, twelve tall pillars of Lalique glass, and 38 columns lit from within illuminated the room. The Strand Palace Hotel foyer (1930), preserved from demolition by the Victoria and Albert Museum during 1969, was one of the first uses of internally lit architectural glass, and coincidentally was the first Moderne interior preserved in a museum. Architecture Streamline Moderne appeared most often in buildings related to transportation and movement, such as bus and train stations, airport terminals, roadside cafes, and port buildings. It had characteristics common with modern architecture, including a horizontal orientation, rounded corners, the use of glass brick walls or porthole windows, flat roofs, chrome-plated hardware, and horizontal grooves or lines in the walls. They were frequently white or in subdued pastel colors. An example of this style is the Aquatic Park Bathhouse in the Aquatic Park Historic District, in San Francisco. Built beginning in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration, it features the distinctive horizontal lines, classic rounded corners railing and windows of the style, resembling the elements of ship. The interior preserves much of the original decoration and detail, including murals by artist and color theoretician Hilaire Hiler. The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III. It is now the administrative center of Aquatic Park Historic District. The Normandie Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which opened during 1942, is built in the stylized shape of the ocean liner SS Normandie, and displays the ship's original sign. The Sterling Streamliner Diners in New England were diners designed like streamlined trains. Although Streamline Moderne houses are less common than streamline commercial buildings, residences do exist. The Lydecker House in Los Angeles, built by Howard Lydecker, is an example of Streamline Moderne design in residential architecture. In tract development, elements of the style were sometimes used as a variation in postwar row housing in San Francisco's Sunset District.

The French version was inspired by the launch of the ocean liner Normandie in 1935, which featured an Art Deco dining room with columns of Lalique crystal. Buildings using variants of the style appeared in Belgium and in Paris, notably in a building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, by the architect Pierre Patout. He was one of the founders of the Art Deco style. He designed the entrance to the Pavilion of a Collector at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, the birthplace of the style. He was also the designer of the interiors of three ocean liners, the Ile-de-France (1926), the l'Atlantique (1930), and the Normandie (1935).Oudin, Dictionnaire des Architectes, Sechiers, Paris, (1994), (in French), page 372. Patout's building on Avenue Victor lacked the curving lines of the American version of the style, but it had a narrow \\"bow\\" at one end, where the site was narrow, long balconies like the decks of a ship, and a row of projections like smokestacks on the roof. Another 1935 Paris apartment building at 1 Avenue Paul-Daumier in the 16 arrondissement had a series of terraces modeled after the decks of an ocean liner.Texier, Paris Panorama of Archicture, Parigramme, (2012). pg. 142.

The new automobiles adapted the smooth lines of ocean liners and airships, giving the impression of efficiency, dynamism, and speed. The grills and windshields tilted backwards, cars sat lower and wider, and they featured smooth curves and horizontal speed lines. Examples include the 1934 Chrysler Airflow and the 1934 Studebaker Land Cruiser. The cars also featured new materials, including bakelite plastic, formica, Vitrolight opaque glass, stainless steel, and enamel, which gave the appearance of newness and sleekness.McCourt, Mark, \\"When Art Deco is Really Streamline Moderne\\", Hemmings Daily, 29 May, 2014 In 1939 and 1941 respectively, both Chrysler and GM came out with pick-up and truck lines, that had both distinct and similar looking designs that submitted to the Art Deco and streamline styling en vogue in the day, under various brand names. Other later examples include the 1950 Nash Ambassador \\"Airflyte\\" sedan with its distinctive low fender lines, as well as Hudson's postwar cars, such as the Commodore, that \\"were distinctive streamliners—ponderous, massive automobiles with a style all their own\\".

One reason for the simple designs in functionalism was to lower the production costs of the items, making them affordable to the large European working class. Streamlining and functionalism represent two different schools in modernistic industrial design.

Identical twins, Vivian and Constance D'Aramis shared the role of Crimson Fox to allow each something of a normal life, although Vivian was much more enthusiastic about their superheroic life. Crimson Fox originally appeared as part of Justice League Europe. The unrevealed Crimson Fox first appeared in Green Lantern vol. 4 #11. Fictional character biography =Vivian and Constance D'Aramis= The sisters ran Revson, a major Parisian perfume company (which may perhaps explain the origin of their pheromone powers). In order to make their heroic actions easier, they faked Constance's death, so that one of them could operate as Crimson Fox while the other attended business functions. Readers of her/their comic book appearances could easily tell the difference between the two due to Vivian's more pronounced French accent. She was also always portrayed as a more carefree and outgoing woman than her sister. Both sisters (first Vivian, and later Constance) fell in love with fellow hero Metamorpho. The first two Crimson Foxes are deceased. Vivian D'Aramis met her fate at the hands of French supervillain Puanteur in Justice League International (#104, October 1995). Puanteur died in the same issue. When the Justice League Europe team was reformed as La Fraternité de Justice et Liberté, the team did not know that member Icemaiden had been surreptitiously replaced by the daughter of supervillain The Mist. This new Mist killed three members of the team, including slitting Constance D'Aramis' throat, in Starman (vol. 2, #38, January 1998). =Unrevealed= One Year Later in the pages of Green Lantern (vol. 4, #11, June 2006), it was revealed that a new woman has taken the mantle of the Crimson Fox, again operating as a French superhero in Paris. She was unwillingly pressed into service and membership by the Global Guardians, who intended to pursue Green Lantern. The new Crimson Fox told Hal Jordan that she is the heiress to the D'Aramis fortune, though her specific relationship to Vivian and Constance, as family or otherwise, remains unknown. Powers and abilities The original Crimson Fox twins had superhuman speed and agility and could emit pheromones that stimulated intense sexual attraction in men. Their gloves were equipped with deadly steel talons. After Vivian's death, Constance retreated into her animal persona and developed enhanced senses. The new Crimson Fox has a similarly equipped costume as the previous version and seems to possess identical pheromone powers. In other media =Television= * A Crimson Fox has made multiple background appearances in Justice League Unlimited. The TV series never specified which Crimson Fox it was. She is usually seen walking with another League member and talking to them, though her voice is never heard, although she also appeared fighting alongside other members of the Justice League, as in the episode \\"Dark Heart\\". On the six-pack toy release, it is stated that she is Vivian. * Crimson Fox appears in Powerless, portrayed first by Atlin Mitchell in the pilot episode \\"Wayne Or Lose\\" and later by Deanna Russo in subsequent episodes.IMDb character page for Crimson Fox =Toys= * Crimson Fox is an action figure from Mattel's Justice League Unlimited toyline and was released in a six pack but not widely distributed. She was planned to be re-released by Mattel as a single card figure but the line was cancelled before she could return to the shelves.

Established in 2001, it is one of the most recent additions to New York City's famed Museum Mile, which runs from 83rd to 105th streets on Fifth Avenue in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. History The museum was first conceived by two close friends: art dealer and museum exhibition organizer Serge Sabarsky, and entrepreneur, philanthropist, and art collector Ronald S. Lauder. The two men shared a passionate commitment to early twentieth-century German and Austrian art and design. They met in 1967, just before Sabarsky opened his Serge Sabarsky Gallery at 987 Madison Avenue. Almost immediately, the gallery earned a reputation as New York’s leading gallery for Austrian and German Expressionist art. Lauder was a frequent visitor and client. Over the years, the two men discussed opening a museum to showcase the very best work from the period. When Sabarsky died in 1996, Lauder chose to carry on the task of creating Neue Galerie New York, as a tribute to his friend. Collection The collection of the Neue Galerie is divided into two sections. The second floor of the museum houses works of fine art and decorative art from early twentieth-century Austria, including paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele and decorative objects by the artisans of the Wiener Werkstaette and their contemporaries. The third floor exhibits various German works from the same era, including art movements such as Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), Die Brücke (The Bridge), and the Bauhaus. Featured artists on this floor include Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Lyonel Feininger, Otto Dix, and George Grosz. In 2006, Lauder purchased Klimt's painting Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I from Maria Altmann on behalf of the Neue Galerie. Citing a confidentiality agreement, Lauder would only confirm that the purchase price was more than the last record price of US$104.2 million US for Picasso's 1905 Boy With a Pipe. The press reported the price for the Klimt at US$135 million, which would make it at that time the most expensive painting ever sold. It has been on display at the museum since July 2006. Facility The museum is housed in the former William Starr Miller House, a Louis XIII/Beaux-Arts structure located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. The Neue Galerie opened there on November 16, 2001. Selldorf Architects was responsible for the complete renovation and conversion into a museum. In addition to its gallery spaces, the museum also contains a bookstore, design shop, and two Viennese cafés, \\"Café Sabarsky\\" and \\"Café Fledermaus\\", both of which are operated by restaurateur Kurt Gutenbrunner.

Name  The meaning of the Old Norse name Býleistr is uncertain. The most popular propositions are compounds formed with the word bylr ('storm'), either as byl- leystr ('storm-relieving'), byl-leiptr ('storm-flasher'), or byl-heistr ('violent storm'). Various forms are attested in the manuscripts of the Prose Edda: 'Býleistr' (Codices Regius and Wormianus), 'Blýleistr' (Codex Trajectinus), or 'Býleiptr' (Codex Upsaliensis).  Attestations  Although there is no action involving Býleistr in the original sources, Loki is frequently called by the kenning 'Byleist's brother' (bróðir Býleists), like in Völuspá (51), Hyndluljóð, (40), or Skáldskaparmál (16). In both Gylfaginning (34) and Skáldskaparmál, Snorri Sturluson states directly that Byleist is, along with Helblindi, one of Loki's two brothers. Based on this relation, a number of scholars have considered Býleistr to be a son of Fárbauti and his consort Laufey.Rydberg (2003:24); Sykes (2002:85); Guelpa (2009:123-124).

Busch also represented the United States at both youth and senior level. Arguably his best season was in 2008 when he was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. As of the end of the 2015 season, Busch ranks fourth in MLS history in number of shutouts. Youth and College Busch played at Guilderland High School in Guilderland, New York, near Albany, where he was named a high school All-American. He was ranked within the top 25 best players in the nation as a senior. In college, Busch was a NSCAA First Team All- American in 1996, when he help lead UNC Charlotte to their first ever appearance in the College Cup and a school-record 19 wins. He recorded a career-high 12 shutouts that season, including two in the NCAA Tournament and a career-low 0.89 goals against average (GAA) en route to being named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year. Overall, he was a First Team All- Conference selection three times and was named to Soccer America’s First Team Freshman All-America team in 1994. In total, Busch spent 3 seasons with UNC Charlotte.Goal kick versus LA Galaxy in 2013  Club career  = A-League Years (1997–2001) = Busch was undrafted out of college and spent a number of years in the United Soccer Leagues. He was drafted in 1997 by Nashville Metros with the 2nd Overall pick in the A-League draft, but opted to split his first year with Worcester Wildfire and Carolina Dynamo. Busch then moved on to Hampton Roads Mariners, where he spent 3 seasons. He was named the team MVP in his second season. His breakout season came in 2001 with the Hershey Wildcats. He won 14 games and posted 13 shutouts while leading the team to the A-League National Championship match. Busch was named the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year and was selected the Division II circuit's first-team All-League keeper. = Columbus Crew (2002–2006) = Major League Soccer took note of his USL play and it resulted in Busch being drafted by Columbus Crew with the 23rd overall pick of the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Busch did not become a starter for the Crew immediately, sharing the duties in his first MLS season with incumbent Tom Presthus. He became a starter by 2003, but did not do very well as Columbus floundered in the standings. In contrast, both the Crew and Busch had terrific 2004 regular seasons, as the team, led by Busch's goaltending, embarked on a league-record 18-game undefeated streak. Busch was a finalist for the 2004 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award for his performance, and his impact on the team's season was cited as the third-highest impact of any MLS player on any MLS team in the history of the league by MLSnet writer Jeff Bradley.Bradley, Jeff. \\"First XI: Impact players\\" , From MLSnet.com, September 5, 2006, retrieved December 4, 2006.

He was subsequently traded to Chicago Fire in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2009 MLS Supplemental Draft. Busch was to serve primarily as a backup keeper in 2007 and only made it into three matches all season. However, with the departure of starter Matt Pickens to Queens Park Rangers of England's second- tier Football League Championship, Busch ultimately inherited the starter's role with the Fire to start the 2008 season. He was named Fire MVP for the 2008 season after being the only Fire player to start and play 90 minutes in every MLS match during the regular season (2700 minutes). Busch posted the best saves percentage in the league (78.2) after making 122 saves on 156 shots faced.

It is playable with one single player or cooperative for up to four players. However, with a Network Adapter, players can take the game online with others and kill others or join to form groups of adventurers. The game uses a re-worked and expanded Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance game engine. A sequel was created called Champions: Return to Arms which was released in February 2005. Story Champions of Norrath features a traditional role-playing video game storyline, in which the player acts as a hero who must save the world via a series of quests and battles. Divided into five acts, the game begins with a quest to assist the elves in their war against the orcs, who have formed an alliance with goblins (which is strange to the citizens of Norrath). However, in later acts, the player must eventually travel to the underworld and beyond thanks to the antics created by the strange orc leader and his contacts. The game takes place in the focal world of the EverQuest universe known as Norrath, prior to the events of the first EverQuest online RPG, which was itself prior to \\"The Shattering\\" of the moon Luclin. The game applies many elements of the EverQuest universe. There are three main antagonists in the storyline: Pelys, leader of the orcs, Vanarhost, a vampire in the Underworld who also narrates the entire game and Innoruuk, the God of Hatred. Gameplay The gameplay is a traditional hack and slash with several additional elements. During the opening sequence, the player selects a race, appearance, and skills. From there, the game continues to follow classic RPG standards, as the player fights monsters, explores forests, towns, godly domains and dungeons, obtains gold to purchase weapons, and so on. As the player gains experience, he or she will level up and increase character statistics and abilities. All characters have a series of spells and skills, which can be enhanced via the Ability Tree. The Ability Tree allows the player flexibility in choosing skills, chiefly because points may be invested in several choices at once. These abilities can increase damage, add new spells, etc. These choices are limited by several factors, including the character's level, the skill's prerequisites, and the total amount of ability points in the character's reserve. The points cannot be regained once used. Equipment is often dropped by enemies, though there is a shop to buy items. Sometimes, the items dropped by enemies are much better than anything for sale in the shop. Each item has a weight and each character has a weight limit (which is increased by strength). Together, this allows for a limited amount of equipment to be carried at any given time. However, items known as \\"Gate Scrolls\\" allow players to warp back to the nearest shop and sell excess inventory. Moreover, the armor and weapons are customizable through rare items, which allows players to fuse a weapon with statistical bonuses, elemental attack, and increased weapon attack speed. Dungeons in the game cover many forms of terrain. As with most RPGs, many dungeons in Champions of Norrath feature a boss or large group of enemies that must be defeated to advance or obtain a special item. Traps and secret passages are also common in dungeons (for instance, destructible walls). Furthermore, the game offers two advanced bonus dungeon levels upon completion of the game. The camera allows for 360 degree rotation and three levels of zoom. It is possible to import and export characters, which allows the player to save or load a character anywhere in the game while keeping the statistics and items of that character. This is important for scenarios which require a transfer of characters, such as online play, multiplayer games, and the sequel, Champions: Return to Arms. Savepoints and portals play a key role in the gameplay. First, savepoints also double as checkpoints, which may be accessed if a character dies. The Portals are activated when the player walks near the Portal. They allow the player to jump to key locations in each region. Players may import their character(s) for online play, which can be accessed from a save point. This mode of play allows for players to join parties or quests. Players can join anywhere in the game, despite completion in the one player mode. Up to four players can join in the same game. It is a cooperative type multiplayer game that disables damage a player can inflict upon a fellow player. Characters There are five types of playable characters that can be used throughout the game. Each come in male and female varieties, which have no impact on gameplay other than appearance. This choice cannot be changed after the character is made. =Barbarian Warriors= Barbarian Warriors have the highest initial health and attack rating in the game, and are able to use any weapon they desire, save class exclusive weapons. They are primarily tank characters that can endure superior amounts of damage. Barbarians have virtually no magic based attacks, however they excel at melee combat, specializing in weapons and armor. Unfortunately, barbarians do not recover mana automaticallythey need to slay enemies to recover mana. This can limit the use of their various skills. Their skills augment their mastery of weapons, buffer attributes, and deal massive close range damage. =Wood Elf Rangers= The ranger class is primarily a ranged fighter. They have a wide variety of ranged spells and can use bows more effectively compared to other classes. Though they are competent melee fighters, they cannot use two-handed weapons and lose the advantage of their superior bow abilities when forced to fight close ranged. The ranger's abilities allow him to imbue his arrows with various magics. The Ranger eventually gains the ability to dual-wield single handed weapons such as swords, axes or maces. =High Elf Clerics= A competent melee class, the Cleric is efficient in dealing damage with holy spells and blunt weapons. Clerics have strong healing abilities and can cause extreme damage to the undead. They also possess skills that allow them to convert their enemies. Clerics are restricted from using sharp weapons such as swords, axes, etc. A cleric must balance melee with long ranged spells. =Erudite Wizards= A primarily magical class with control over the elements, they exhibit intellectual prowess over the other classes. They cannot use shields, are limited to one-handed blunt weapons, and have a limited selection of armor, and are therefore poor melee fighters. The wizard's spells freeze, burn, and shock their enemies from a distance. Wizards must maintain a very large supply of mana potions to be effective fighters. =Dark Elf Shadowknights= Dark elves are a versatile magic-melee class. They can use every weapon type, except for some class exclusive rare weapons. Shadowknights use dark magic to spread disease through groups of enemies. Their spells weaken and maim large groups, but cost a greater percentage of mana. Later, they gain spells that allow them to summon undead warriors to assist them. Shadowknights do not falter or excel in any particular area, and can be used many different ways. Reception Champions of Norrath received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

It is written in a combination of prose, blank verse and heroic couplets. It has often been praised as Dryden's best comedic endeavour, and James Sutherland accounts for this by observing that \\"the comic scenes are beautifully written, and Dryden has taken care to connect them with the serious plot by a number of effective links. He writes with . . . one of the most thoughtful treatments of sex and marriage that Restoration comedy can show.\\" The play contains two songs, \\"Why Should a Foolish Marriage Vow\\" by Robert Smith and \\"Whilst Alexis Lay Pressed\\" by Nicholas Staggins, both set to Dryden's lyrics and printed in the 1673 book Choice Songs and Ayres for One Voyce to Sing to the Theorbo-Lute or Bass- Viol.\\"Choice Songs and Ayres for One Voyce to Sing to the Theorbo-Lute or Bass-Viol\\", London, 1673, printed by W.

Characters * Polydamas, Usurper of Sicily. * Leonidas, the rightful Prince, unknown. * Argaleon, favourite to Polydamas. * Hermogenes, foster-father to Leonidas. * Eubulus, his friend and companion. * Rhodphil, captain of the guards. * Palamede, a courtier. * Palmyra, daughter to the Usurper. * Amalthea, sister to Argaleon. * Doralice, wife to Rhodophil. * Melantha, an affected lady. * Philotis, woman to Melantha. * Beliza, woman to Doralice. * Artemis, a court lady. Plot synopsis The setting is in Sicily. The plot concerns two separate storylines, one a romance between Palmyra and Leonidas, who were separated from their parents as babies and who were raised together by Hermogenes, who has kept their past a secret. When Hermogenes is recognized by the usurper- king Polydamas, he declares that Leonidas is Polydamas's son. However, as Leonidas's new position of prince then forbids him to marry Palmyra, much misery is brought to the couple. When the lovers refuse to stop seeing each other, Palmyra is sentenced to death. Hermogenes then steps forward and reveals that he was lying before: in fact Leonidas is his own son, he says, and he had lied in the hopes of bettering the boy by making him prince, whereas Palmyra is the real child of Polydamas. After offering proof of this new claim, Palmyra is established as princess, but again this prevents her and Leonidas from marrying. Hermogenes eventually admits that he once again was withholding information, and reveals the whole truth to Leonidas—Leonidas is the son of the rightful king, whose throne was usurped by Polydamas. As soon as he learns this, Leonidas forms a rebellion against Polydamas, wins, and establishes himself the new king, finally allowing himself and Palmyra to be married. The second storyline, which intertwines with the first, concerns Rhodophil and his friend Palamede. Palamede has fallen in love with Rhodophil's wife Doralice, and Rhodophil is in love with Palamede's fiancée Melantha. Each of the women seem to find their pursuers agreeable, and great care is taken by all parties to keep their meetings secret from each other, with disastrous results as the two couples seem to always choose the same locations and tactics for meeting. When finally the actions of everyone are discovered, Palamede and Rhodophil decide that since their tastes in women are so similar, each would be best sticking to his rightful claim. Palamede then manages to win the heart of Melantha, and amicably break off his relationship with Doralice. Sources Dryden borrowed from two plays by John Fletcher and his collaborators for Marriage À-la-Mode. He adapted its main plot from Beggars' Bush and its subplot from Rule a Wife and Have a Wife.Nancy Klein Maguire, Regicide and Restoration: English Tragicomedy, 1660-1671, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; p. 57. Production history The King's Company first performed Marriage à la Mode in London in 1673. William Wintershall played Polydamas, Edward Kynaston was Leonidas, Michael Mohun was Rhodophil, and Nicholas Burt was Palamede; the role of Hermogenes was taken by William Cartwright the younger. Elizabeth Cox played Palmyra, Rebecca Marshall played Doralice, Elizabeth James was Amalthea, and Elizabeth Boutell was Melantha.John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, London 1708; Montague Summers, ed., Fortune Press [no date]; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1963; p. 13.

All Sigma products are produced in the company's own Aizu factory in Bandai, Fukushima, Japan. Although Sigma produces several camera models, the company is best known for producing high-quality lenses and other accessories that are compatible with the cameras produced by other companies. The company was founded in 1961 by Michihiro Yamaki, who was Sigma's CEO until his death at age 78 in 2012. Sigma products work with cameras from Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Panasonic, as well as their own cameras. Sigma has also made lenses under the Quantaray name, which have been sold exclusively by Ritz Camera. Similarly, Sigma lenses were sold exclusively by the former Wolf Camera, but following the merger of Wolf and Ritz, both brands can be purchased. Sigma's digital SLRs, the SD9, SD10, SD14 and SD15, plus the latest SD1 are unusual in their use of the Foveon X3 image sensor. The company's mirrorless cameras, the Sigma SD Quattro and SD Quattro H, use the Foveon Quattro sensor, an updated version of the Foveon X3. All use the SA lens mount. The Sigma DP series of high-end compact P&S; cameras also use the Foveon Quattro sensor, which gives them a much larger sensor than other cameras of this type. In September 2018 Sigma became one of the founding members of the L-Mount Alliance; it announced that it will cease to develop SA-mount cameras and instead use Leica's L-Mount. A new full-frame mirrorless camera, Sigma FP, was launched in 2019 along with a range of L-Mount lenses and adapters. Sigma is the world's largest independent lens manufacturer and is a family-owned business. Cameras Sigma has made a number of film SLR cameras, including the SA-300, SA-5, SA-7 and SA-9. Their latest consumer digital SLR is the SD15. During photokina 2010, Sigma announced a new flagship DSLR camera, the SD1. SD1 features a new 46MP Foveon X3 sensor with 1.5x crop, as opposed to the 1.7x crop of previous models. All Sigma SLR, DSLR, and mirrorless cameras use the Sigma SA mount, which is mechanically similar to the Pentax K mount and electrically an adaptation of the Canon EF lens mount lens control system. Sigma also produces the DP series of high-end compact digital cameras. The Foveon APS-C sized sensors are similar to those used in the DSLR line. The current line makes use of the Quattro sensor, a variant of the Foveon design that has a higher resolution top layer and lower resolution lower layers combined into a final image that is claimed to be equivalent to a 39 megapixel color filter array image. The four compact cameras are differentiated by their fixed prime lens, with the ultra wide DP0, the wide DP1, the normal DP2 and the telephoto DP3. In February 2016, Sigma announced two new mirrorless cameras—the SD Quattro and SD Quattro H. Both cameras use the full-depth Sigma SA mount, allowing the use of existing SA-mount lenses, and also use Foveon Quattro sensors. The SD Quattro uses an APS-C sensor with 19.6 MP in the top layer, while the SD Quattro H uses an APS-H (1.35x crop) sensor with 25.5 MP in the top layer. The company claims that the Foveon Quattro technology produces a level of detail equivalent to that of a Bayer sensor with twice the pixel count. Software Sigma produces the Sigma Photo Pro software for post-production of their camera's .X3F raw image format. It is available both for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. Lenses Sony NEX-5 with Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN lens. Sigma makes autofocus lenses for the Sigma SA, Canon EF, Nikon F, Minolta/Sony α, Pentax K and Four Thirds lens mounts. Each lens may not be available in all mounts, and may lack certain features (such as HSM) on certain mounts. In August 2013, Sigma announced that starting the following month, it would offer a mount conversion service for its newest \\"Global Vision\\" lenses—those with either an \\"A\\" (Art), \\"C\\" (Contemporary), or \\"S\\" (Sport) as part of their model name. For a cost that varies with lens and market—from $80 to $250 in the U.S., not including shipping costs—owners can send their lenses to their local Sigma company, which in turn sends them to Japan for mount replacement, including calibration and optimization for the new camera system. Lenses designed for DSLRs can be converted to Canon EF, Nikon F, Pentax K, Sigma SA, or Sony A mounts; those designed for MILCs can be converted to Micro Four Thirds or Sony E-mount. =Designations= 2008 photokina * ASP — Aspherical lens elements * APO — Apochromatic lens element(s), originally for \\"Advanced Performance Optics\\", not necessarily apochromatic * OS — In-lens \\"Optical Stabilization\\", analogous to Nikon VR or Canon IS * HSM — \\"Hyper-Sonic Motor\\", either in-lens ultrasonic motor or micro-motor, analogous to Nikon SWM (AF-S) (ultra-sonic or micro-motor), Canon USM (ultrasonic or micro-motor), Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony SSM (ultrasonic motor) or Sony SAM (micro-motor), etc. * A — \\"Art Series\\", large aperture prime and zoom lenses, high optical performance.

The basic design, made of hardened steel of circular cross section bent into a U-shape with a removable crossbar, has been emulated by numerous other manufacturers, and adapted with variations in size and shape for other applications, such as locking motorcycles. The product was named after kryptonite, the fictitious substance that can thwart the powerful comic- book hero Superman. The name is used under a limited trademark agreement with DC Comics dating back to 1983.  History  The Kryptonite u-lock was developed by Stanley Kaplan, in 1972 Michael Zane bought the lock and company from Kaplan . In the early 1970s, in the US, the only proven method to secure one's bicycle was by the use of case hardened security chains with hexagonal links, but some cyclists were making the mistake of using inexpensive chains or cables that could be breached by thieves using commonly available tools. Indeed, local hardware stores would often sell inexpensive chain cut to length using simple bolt cutters. The first Kryptonite lock model was made of sheet metal cut and bent to shape, but the company soon went to the now universal circular cross section. In an early test of the Kryptonite lock, a bicycle was locked to a signpost in Greenwich Village in New York City for thirty days. Thieves stripped the bicycle of every part that could be removed, but the lock resisted all attempts to break it. Ingersoll Rand acquired Kryptonite in 2001. In 2013 Ingersoll Rand's security products were placed in a spin-off company called Allegion.  Design  Until 2004, Kryptonite locks used the tubular pin tumbler locking mechanism. In 2005, after it was demonstrated that the tubular pin tumbler locks used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of a Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, Kryptonite changed their locks from the tubular to a disc mechanism, preventing the use of cylindrically-shaped objects to defeat the locking system. After this problem became public, Kryptonite offered a free exchange program for all owners of locks with tubular mechanisms.\\"Company History\\" (retrieved 24 August 2016) Kryptonite launched a Messenger Collection in 2015, created with input from actual bicycle messengers in New York City.

Examples of monogastric herbivores are horses, rabbits, gerbils, and hamsters. Examples of monogastric omnivores include humans, rats, dogs and pigs. Furthermore, carnivores such as cats. A monogastric organism is comparable to ruminant organisms (which has a four-chambered complex stomach), such as cows, goats, or sheep. Herbivores with monogastric digestion can digest cellulose in their diets by way of symbiotic gut bacteria. However, their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants. Herbivores digest cellulose by microbial fermentation. Monogastric herbivores which can digest cellulose nearly as well as ruminants are called hindgut fermenters, while ruminants are called foregut fermenters.Hindgut versus Foregut Fermenters These are subdivided into two groups based on the relative size of various digestive organs in relationship to the rest of the system: colonic fermenters tend to be larger species such as horses and rhinos, and cecal fermenters are smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents.Grant, Kerrin. Adaptations in Herbivore Nutrition, July 30, 2010 Great apes derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. Monogastrics cannot digest the fiber molecule cellulose as efficiently as ruminants, though the ability to digest cellulose varies amongst species. A monogastric digestive system works as soon as the food enters the mouth. Saliva moistens the food and begins the digestive process. (Note that horses have no (or negligible amounts of) amylase in their saliva). After being swallowed, the food passes from the esophagus into the stomach, where stomach acid and enzymes help to break down the food. Bile salts are stored in the gall bladder (note that horses do not have a gall bladder and bile is directly secreted into the small intestine) and secreted once the contents of the stomach have reached the small intestines where most fats are broken down. The pancreas secretes enzymes and alkali to neutralize the stomach acid.

The population was 4,435 at the 2010 census. Public schools in Bealeton include Grace Miller Elementary, Cedar Lee Middle, and Liberty High School. Bealeton is home to its own post office, with ZIP code 22712. Geography Bealeton is located in southwestern Fauquier County. U.S. Route 17 leads north to Warrenton, the county seat, and southeast to Fredericksburg. VA 28 leads northeast to Manassas and southwest to U.S. Routes 29 and 15, which lead an additional to Culpeper. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.23%, is water. The area drains south via Marsh Run to the Rappahannock River. History Bealeton was originally a stop on the former Orange and Alexandria Railroad (absorbed ultimately into the Southern Railway in 1894, now Norfolk Southern), and the old railroad station building can be seen in the Bealeton Station development in front of the Bealeton Library building. The building was previously located on County Road 805, Bealeton Road, which runs parallel and near the railway. The area was a major traveling point during the Civil War and saw many skirmishes related to nearby engagements. Despite the presence of Confederate troops during the early years of the war, Union troops succeeded in pushing the Confederate line south of the Rappahannock River and eventually into Fredericksburg. This move led to the control of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, thus allowing the Union army to transport supplies deep into southern Virginia. Bealeton lost importance with the decline of railroad travel and became a bedroom community of Warrenton and northern Virginia primarily. This was aided by the comprehensive plan that made authorized water and sewer availability in 1967. Bealeton retains many large farms and provides a unique blend of agriculture, commercial, and residential development. Local attractions Since 1970, Bealeton has been home to one of the last barnstorming air shows in America, simply called the \\"Flying Circus\\".The Bealeton Flying Circus Open every Sunday, May through October, activities include All-American barnstorming, wing walking, parachuting, aerobatic performances and open-cockpit biplane rides. Bealeton is also the home of the world's largest old-fashioned roller skate. It was originally created as a float for a fireman's parade and put in place in front of the rink by Hugo Stribling when he opened Hugo's Skateway in 1978. The skating rink has changed hands several times since Hugo's was sold in 2007. The most recent owners closed the doors in January 2017 after their lease was terminated.

No such proposal was ever adopted, but various schemes were popular in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other colonial territories. The project was championed by Unionists such as Joseph Chamberlain as an alternative to William Gladstone's proposals for home rule in Ireland. Many proposals were put forward, but none commanded majority support. The Imperial Federation League, the main advocacy group, split into two factions in 1893, with one group promoting imperial defense and the other encouraging imperial trade. Various proposals were put forward, with most of them calling for a single state with an imperial parliament headquartered in London. The new parliament would deal with internal trade, foreign relations, defense and other issues that affected the entire federation. The new parliament would rule India directly, while the dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa) would have internal self government. Ireland would also have self-government, which was expected to reduce demand for home rule in Ireland.Kenneth J. Panton, Historical Dictionary of the British Empire (2015 ) p. 238. Motivations By the 1880s the British Empire covered a quarter of the world's land area, and included a fifth of the world's population. There was no doubt about the vastness of the potential, and there was agreement that opportunities were largely wasted because politically and constitutionally there was no unity, no common policies, no agreed central direction, no \\"permanent binding force\\" said Alfred Milner. Associations were formed and discussions were held to come up with a solution. Bernard Porter, The Lion's Share: A Short History of British Imperialism 1850–1970 (1975) p 133 The British Empire consisted of many colonies, several of which were largely self-governing dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa). Most were ruled by colonial officials including India, Hong Kong, West Indies, Fiji. The future of the empire remained uncertain, as it was unclear what the end result would be if all colonies eventually became self-governing. Among other concerns, it would be very difficult for British interests to be maintained if every colony was essentially already sovereign.William Roy Smith, \\"British Imperial Federation.\\" Political Science Quarterly 36.2 (1921): 274-297. Online Creating an Imperial Federation thus became a popular alternative proposal to colonial imperialism. The plan was never firm, but the general proposal was to create a single federal state among all colonies of the British Empire. The federation would have a common parliament and would be governed as a superstate. Thus, Imperial unity could be maintained while still allowing for democratic government. The colonies would increase their influence while Britain would be able to share the costs of imperial defence. The best features of large states could be combined with the best features of small states. It was seen as a method of solving the Home Rule problem in Ireland, as England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (along with the other members of the Old Commonwealth) would have their own Parliaments. Westminster would become a purely Imperial body. Supporters of the Imperial Federation regarded the United Kingdom as having two possible futures: imperial union and continued long-term importance or imperial dissolution and the reduction of the status of the UK to a second- class nation. In response to claims that geography was against federation on such a large scale, it was said that scientific advancements would solve the difficulty. Edward Ellis Morris reminded listeners to his lecture in 1885 that it was now as easy to reach London from Melbourne as it had been to reach London from Orkney at the time of the Acts of Union 1707, or to reach Washington, D.C. from San Francisco before 1869.Smith, 1921.  Organisation  The Imperial Federation League was founded in London in 1884 and subsequent branches were established in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Barbados, and British Guiana. While the proposal was often associated with segments of the British Conservative Party, it was also popular among Liberal Imperialists (proponents of New Imperialism) such as William Edward Forster. The movement was also a vehicle for British race nationalism, inspired by such writers as Charles Dilke and John Robert Seeley and ideas of a greater Britain encompassing the largely white self-governing colonies and dominions. The League could not agree on its primary role of defense or trade, and was dissolved in 1893. Ewart. p. 163. Canadian advocates of imperial federation, are called \\"Canadian Imperialists\\" and their ideology \\"Canadian Imperialism\\" in Canadian historiography since Carl Berger 1970's book The Sense of Power identified this as a separate ideology from Canadian nationalism. Noted Canadian Imperialists included George Monro Grant, Sir George Robert Parkin, Stephen Leacock, and George Taylor Denison III.Imperialism. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2013-07-17. In 1900, Thomas Hedderwick, a Scottish Liberal Party MP, raised the issue in the British House of Commons. Recalling to the House the contributions of Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownagree, Indian MPs serving in the House of Commons, Hedderwick mooted the possibility that an autonomous India might one day be represented in an Imperial Parliament.Smith, 1921. Obstacles One of the main obstacles to the scheme was what one of its proponents, Richard Jebb, called colonial nationalism. The granting of authority to a super-parliament composed of many competing interests was seen by opponents as a compromise to the powers of the local parliaments. Leading colonial supporters of imperial federation, such as Australian prime minister Alfred Deakin, however saw the movement as a way to increase the influence of the dominions over imperial defence and foreign policy. The colonial branches of the Imperial Federation League in fact outlived the demise of the home branch in London, which collapsed in 1896 when it failed to resolve internal disputes over imperial trade policy. While Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1895 to 1903, was sympathetic to the idea, his proposals for a permanent Imperial Council or Council of the Empire which would be a kind of Imperial Parliament passing policies that would bind colonial governments, was rejected at the 1897 Colonial Conference and 1902 Colonial Conferences due to fears that such a scheme would undermine the autonomy of colonies. Similarly, proposals for centralising the Empire's armed forces were also rejected as were his proposals for an Empire customs union. At subsequent Imperial Conferences, proposals for Imperial preferential trade were rejected by the British Liberal governments due to their preference for international free trade. It would not be until the British Empire Economic Conference in 1932 that Imperial Preference would be implemented; however, the policy did not survive World War II. Decline Support for imperial federation waned with World War I which produced greater feelings of national identity in several dominions, Canada and Australia in particular. Defence concerns and problems of imperial cooperation were partially resolved through the system of colonial or Imperial Conferences and with growing sentiments by various dominion governments for greater independence resulting in the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931. It was last discussed seriously at the governmental level at the 1937 Imperial Conference where it was dismissed. The idea of Imperial unity was carried on after World War I by Lionel Curtis and the Round Table movement, which continues to this day as a forum and promoter of the Commonwealth of Nations and also by the Royal Commonwealth Society which continues to promote the Commonwealth. In recent years, following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, many of the concepts behind the Imperial Federation have found a new life within the CANZUK movement. Critics sceptical of the CANZUK movement make the argument that \\"distance and the size of trading partners matter more than historical links in determining trading relationships between countries\\". Conversely, advocates argue that technological advances now make it possible to fly from the United Kingdom to Australia in under 24 hours, seriously overcoming the limitation of distance which hampered the idea a century ago. They remark that internet and the ability to instant message/call the other side of the world has greatly increased the connectivity between these four countries. In August 2018 the Canadian Conservative Party proposed a CANZUK Treaty which aims to achieve free trade in goods and services, visa-free travel arrangements, reciprocal healthcare, increased consumer choice, increased travel protection and security co-ordination between the four countries. The CANZUK treaty already has political support in the other CANZUK countries, with the New Zealand ACT Party, the Union & Sovereignty Party UK, and the UK Libertarian Party all explicitly stating their support for CANZUK. The Australian Liberal Democrats have not referenced CANZUK directly but have stated support for policies which align with the aims of CANZUK.

Woodhens mate for life and are usually encountered in pairs. They are territorial and will appear from the forest's understory to investigate the source of any unusual noise. A mated pair will defend an area of approximately three hectares, with offspring being expelled from this area once grown. The population of birds is thus restricted by the amount of available territory.  Decline and recovery  Illustration by Joseph Smit (1869) A pair of woodhens with a chick When explorers first discovered Lord Howe Island in 1788, they identified 15 bird species including the then common woodhen. Being flightless, curious, and having never been hunted, they became a readily available source of food for visiting sailors and the island's early human population. Since its discovery and the arrival of settlers on the island in 1834, nine of these 15 species became extinct. The woodhen declined in numbers until the late 1970s, when surveys showed that the population had dropped to less than 30 birds, confined to the difficult to access summit regions of the island's two mountains, Mount Gower and Mount Lidgbird. The woodhen was at the very brink of extinction in 1980, with just 15 individuals found. A comprehensive study was carried out to determine the cause of the decline, which was eventually attributed to the introduction of feral pigs. The elimination of the pigs and other disruptive animals (goats), plus a programme of ex-situ conservation (captive breeding) which commenced in May 1980 (the first egg was laid in June 1980), allowed the Lord Howe woodhen to recover its numbers. The captive breeding program was funded with $150,000 from the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife, which was spent to construct the compound and to employ scientists involved in this project. In 2007-08 there are about 250 birds on the island, which may be the optimal population size for this area. The population of adult birds in 2016 was 232. The analysis of the threats to the Lord Howe woodhen, and the solution, is considered a model for conservation biology. A number of possible causes of the decline were on the island, from introduced rats to Tasmanian masked owls. However, only the elimination of the pigs would have saved the species from extinction, and identifying the cause and solution in a timely manner was crucial to the success of the programme. Following success with the woodhen, there have been recovery efforts for other endemic species on Lord Howe Island, including the Lord Howe flax snail (Placostylus bivaricosus) and the Lord Howe currawong (Strepera graculina crissalis). Gilbert rail A rail, known only from a single specimen in the form of an alcohol-preserved skin at Harvard, was originally believed to have been collected on one of the Gilbert Islands and named as the Gilbert rail, Gallirallus conditicius (Peters & Griscom, 1928). However, the island attributed to this holotype is low, rocky and sandy, and has no habitat suitable for a rail. It now appears that a curatorial error led to the specimen being labeled to the wrong collection, and the specimen is actually an immature female Lord Howe woodhen. It differs from that species only in a paler crown, throat and underparts, and browner head, but long immersion in alcohol could have changed the colour. The island to which the specimen was originally attributed is 4,500 km from Lord Howe Island, and it appears improbable that two flightless rails could evolve separately with no morphological differences.

View from Arabat Fortress The Arabat Spit (; ) or Arabat Arrow is a barrier spit which separates a large, shallow and very salty system of lagoons named Syvash from the Sea of Azov. The spit is located between the Henichesk Strait to the north and the north-eastern shores of Crimea to the south.Semenov, p.624 Name The spit is commonly called the Arabat Arrow (, Arabatska strilka; ; , Arabatskaya strelka) in Russia and Ukraine. The origin of this name is unknown, but dates back to the middle of the 19th century.Shutov, Introduction The Arabat part of the name presumably comes from the Arabat Fortress, a 17th-century Turkish fort at the southern end of the spit. \\"Arabat\\" derives from either Arabic \\"rabat\\" meaning a \\"military post\\" or Arabic \\"rabad\\" meaning a \\"suburb\\".Arabat Foretress (in Russian) Geography and geology The Arabat Arrow is long, and from wide; its surface area is and thus the average width is . The spit is low and straight on the Azov Sea side, whereas its Sivash side is more convoluted. It contains two areas which are wide and have brown-clay hills; they are located and from the Henichesk Strait. The top layers of other parts of the spit are formed by sand and shells washed by the flows of the Azov Sea. Its vegetation mostly consists of various weed grasses, thorn, festuce grasses, spear grass, crambe, salsola, salicornia, Carex colchica, tamarisk, rose hip, liquorice, etc.Shutov, Part 1 Semenov, p.111 Offshore water is shallow with the depth reaching only some from the shore.Арабатская стрелка (in Russian) Its temperature is around in winter (near freezing), in spring and autumn, and in summer; air temperature is almost the same.Shutov, Part 5 The spit is very young and was created by sedimentation processes around 1100–1200 AD.Shutov, Part 4 History The Arabat Arrow was wild until 1835 when a road and five stations at intervals were built along it for postal delivery. Later in the 19th century, 25 rural and 3 military settlements and one village named Arabat appeared on the spit. The rural population amounted to some 235 people whose occupation was mostly fishing, farming, and salt production. The latter activity is traditional for the region due to the vast areas of shallow and very saline water in the Sivash lagoons. Salt production in the 19th century was about on the Arabat Arrow alone. Nowadays, the spit is a health resort and its Azov Sea side is used as a beach. While the spit is geophysically a part of the Crimean Peninsula, politically its northern half belongs to Kherson Oblast, Ukraine, while its southern portion is, de facto since 2014, a part of the Russian Republic of Crimea. The entirety of the spit was occupied during the annexation, although Russia withdrew its forces from the northern Kherson side in December 2014. Populated places The rural communities of Henicheska Hirka, Shchaslyvtseve and Strilkove are located in the northern section of the spit, within the Kherson Oblast. The community of Solyane is located in the southern part of the spit, administered as part of the Republic of Crimea.

It is highly soluble in water, and (when anhydrous) it is soluble in ethanol and acetone.

A useful form of anhydrous CeCl3 can be prepared if care is taken to heat the heptahydrate gradually to over many hours under vacuum. This may or may not contain a little CeOCl from hydrolysis, but it is suitable for use with organolithium and Grignard reagents. Pure waterless CeCl3 can be made by dehydration of the hydrate either by slowly heating to with 4–6 equivalents of ammonium chloride under high vacuum, or by heating with an excess of thionyl chloride for three hours. The waterless halide may alternatively be prepared from cerium metal and hydrogen chloride. It is usually purified by high temperature sublimation under high vacuum. Uses 'Cerium(III) chloride' can be used as a starting point for the preparation of other cerium salts, such as the Lewis acid, cerium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate, used for Friedel-Crafts acylations. It is also used itself as a Lewis acid, for example as a catalyst in Friedel- Crafts alkylation reactions. Luche reduction of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has become a popular method in organic synthesis, where CeCl3·7H2O is used in conjunction with sodium borohydride. For example, carvone gives only the allylic alcohol 1 and none of the saturated alcohol 2. Without CeCl3, a mixture of 1 and 2 is formed. Luche reduction Another important use in organic synthesis is for alkylation of ketones, which would otherwise form enolates if simple organolithium reagents were to be used. For example, compound 3 would be expected to simply form an enolate without CeCl3 being present, but in the presence of CeCl3 smooth alkylation occurs: CeCl3 directed alkylation reaction It is reported that organolithium reagents work more effectively in this reaction than do Grignard reagents.

She was born in Berlin to American parents and raised in Buffalo, New York. Dubbed \\"The First Lady of the Theatre\\" by critic Alexander Woollcott, Cornell was the first performer to receive the Drama League Award, for Romeo and Juliet in 1935. Cornell is noted for her major Broadway roles in serious dramas, often directed by her husband, Guthrie McClintic. The couple formed C. & M.C. Productions, Inc., a company that gave them complete artistic freedom in choosing and producing plays. Their production company gave first or prominent Broadway roles to some of the more notable actors of the 20th century, including many British Shakespearean actors. Cornell is regarded as one of the great actresses of the American theatre. Her most famous role was that of English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the 1931 Broadway production of The Barretts of Wimpole Street. Other appearances on Broadway included in W. Somerset Maugham's The Letter (1927), Sidney Howard's The Alien Corn (1933), Juliet in Romeo and Juliet (1934), Maxwell Anderson's The Wingless Victory (1936), S. N. Behrman's No Time for Comedy (1939), a Tony Award-winning Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra (1947), and a revival of Maugham's The Constant Wife (1951). Cornell was noted for spurning screen roles, unlike other actresses of her day. She appeared in only one Hollywood film, the World War II morale booster Stage Door Canteen, in which she played herself. She did appear in television adaptations of The Barretts of Wimpole Street and Robert E. Sherwood's There Shall Be No Night. She also narrated the documentary Helen Keller in Her Story, which won an Oscar. Primarily regarded as a tragedienne, Cornell was admired for her refined, romantic presence. One reviewer observed, \\"Hers is not a robust romanticism, however. It tends toward dark but delicate tints, and the emotion she conveys most aptly is that of an aspiring girlishness which has always been subject to theatrical influences of a special sort.\\"Anon. \\"That Lady\\". Theatre Arts Monthly (February 1950). Her appearances in comedy were infrequent, and praised more widely for their warmth than their wit.

Family and childhood Katharine Cornell at age two Cornell was born into a prominent, wealthy Buffalo, New York society family. Her great-grandfather, Samuel Garretson Cornell, a descendant of pioneer ancestor Thomas Cornell, came to Buffalo in the 1850s, and founded Cornell Lead Works. One of his grandsons, Peter, married Alice Gardner Plimpton. The young couple lived in Berlin when Peter was studying medicine at the University of Berlin. Their first child, Katharine, was born there. Six months later, the family returned to Buffalo, where they lived at 174 Mariner Street. As a child, Katharine had a troubled relationship with her parents, due in part to her mother's alcoholism. She play-acted in her backyard with imaginary friends. Soon, she was performing in school pageants and plays, and she watched family productions in her grandfather's attic theater, still standing at 484 Delaware Avenue. Cornell played at the Buffalo Studio Club parlor theater, located at 508 Franklin Street. She loved athletics and was a runner-up for city championship at tennis, and an amateur swimming champion.Cornell, K. I Wanted to be an Actress She attended the University of Buffalo (later the State University of New York at Buffalo). . In 1913, she joined The Garret Club, a woman's only private club in Buffalo, and participated in club theatricals. After Cornell had become famous, she often brought her productions to her native Buffalo. Although she never returned to Buffalo to live, her enthusiasm for the city and its inhabitants was well known. Biographer Tad Mosel wrote: \\"To show her affection for her hometown, she always walked slowly when she left her hotel, turning her head to smile on everyone on the street, missing no one, so they could feel close to her and be able to say when they got home that night, 'Katharine Cornell smiled directly at me.'\\" For the rest of her career, on opening Broadway nights, she was greeted backstage by family and friends from Buffalo.Mosel, Tad. Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell Many of her productions were performed at the Erlanger Theater on Delaware Avenue, across from the Statler Hotel. The Erlanger was demolished in 2007.  Early career  In 1915, Cornell's mother died, leaving her enough money to be independent. The young woman moved to New York City to pursue her acting career. There she joined the Washington Square PlayersWashington Square Players – FREE Washington Square Players information  Encyclopedia.com: Find Washington Square Players research and was hailed as one of the most promising actresses of the season. After just two seasons, she joined Jessie Bonstelle's company,Bonstelle, Jessie – FREE Bonstelle, Jessie information  Encyclopedia.com: Find Bonstelle, Jessie research a leading New York repertory (\\"stock\\") company that divided its summers between Detroit and Buffalo. Now aged 25, Cornell was consistently receiving glowing reviews. Cornell joined various theater companies, including the Bonstelle, that toured around the East Coast. In 1919, she went with the Bonstelle company to London to play Jo March in Marian de Forest's stage adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women. Although the critics disparaged the play itself, they specifically noted Cornell as the one bright spot of the evening. The paper The Englishwomen wrote of Cornell: \\"London is unanimous in its praise, and London will flock to see her.\\" Upon her return to New York, she met Guthrie McClintic, a young theater director. She made her Broadway debut in the play Nice People by Rachel Crothers, in a small part alongside Tallulah Bankhead. Cornell's first major Broadway role was that of Sydney Fairfield in Clemence Dane's A Bill of Divorcement (1921). The New York Times wrote of her performance, \\"[she] has the central and significant role of the play and ... gives therein a performance of memorable understanding and beauty.\\" It played for 173 performances, well enough to be considered a hit. Afterward, Cornell played in a succession of now-forgotten plays. She married McClintic on September 8, 1921, in her aunt's summer home in Cobourg, Ontario, Canada. Cornell's family had often summered there among other wealthy Americans.Mosel, \\"Leading Lady\\" The couple eventually bought a townhouse at 23 Beekman Place in Manhattan. It is generally acknowledged that Cornell was a lesbian, and that McClintic was gay, and their union was a lavender marriage. She was a member of the \\"sewing circles\\" in New York, and had relationships with Nancy Hamilton, Tallulah Bankhead, Mercedes de Acosta, and others.  Stardom  Cornell photographed by Carl Van Vechten (1933) In 1924, Cornell and McClintic were part of The Actor's Theatre, a successor to the Washington Square Players. This was a group of actors that sought to be a democracy without any stars. As their first production, they selected Candida by George Bernard Shaw. At the time, the play was considered perfect for the group, as none of the characters was considered to outshine the others, because Shaw intended the play to be about ideas. Although the leading protagonist is Candida, she does not really come into her own until the third act. But, Cornell essentially re-envisioned the play. She made Candida the core of the play, a view adopted by directors and critics ever since. Reviews were ecstatic and audiences responded in kind. The Actor's Theatre changed its plans and decided that Cornell's name must appear above the play's title in all future productions of the troupe. Another acting troupe, the Theatre Guild, controlled the rights to all Shaw's plays, and thereafter allowed only Cornell to play the role of Candida so long as she was alive, a role which she reprised several more times in her career. Shaw later wrote her a note stating that she had created \\"an ideal British Candida in my imagination.\\"Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell, by Tad Mosel with Gertrude De Macy, Little, Brown and Company, 1978. Cornell's next role was to play Iris March in The Green Hat (1925), a romance by Michael Arlen. The play had themes of syphilis and loose morals, and Iris March was a strong sexual creature. Leslie Howard played the role of Napier. While the play was still in Chicago, it became an international hit, known all over the US and Europe. Ashton Stevens, senior drama critic in Chicago, wrote that The Green Hat \\"should die at every performance of its melodramatics, its rouge and rhinestones, its preposterous third act.... Already, I am beginning to forget its imperfections and remember only its charms.\\" Its chief charm, he conceded, was Cornell, who sent \\"tiny bells up and down my unpurchasable vertebrae.\\" Most other critics panned the play itself, but nonetheless found it irresistible because of Cornell's ability to mesmerise, despite the garish dialogue. Critic George Jean Nathan wrote that the play was \\"superbly acted in its leading role by that one young woman who stands head and shoulders above all the other young women of the American theater, Miss Katharine Cornell.\\" Cornell with Burton McEvilly in the Broadway production of The Letter (1927) The play had 231 performances in New York before going to Boston and then a cross-country tour. The play's success spawned a fashion in green hats of the type worn by Cornell in the play. Later, Tallulah Bankhead played the role of Iris March in a less successful London production, and Greta Garbo played the role in a 1928 film adaptation, A Woman of Affairs. She starred in 1927 in The Letter, by W. Somerset Maugham, as Leslie Crosbie, a woman who kills her lover. Maugham himself suggested Cornell for the part. Although the critics were not too excited about the play, Cornell by then had developed a loyal following. The opening night was such a sensation that the New York Sun wrote that the sidewalks were packed with people after the performance straining to catch a glimpse of her. Cornell in the Broadway production of The Age of Innocence (1928) In 1928, Cornell played the lead role of the countess Ellen Olenska in a dramatized version of Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence. Her performance received only positive reviews. After this success, Cornell was offered the lead in The Dishonored Lady. It was originally intended for Ethel Barrymore, who failed to accept the role. The play is a lurid melodrama about true-life murder in Glasgow, Scotland. Walter Winchell wrote, \\"Never in the history of the theatre has an actress of such distinction permitted such an exciting scene. She [Cornell] actually permits a man to crack her a powerful wallop in the face!\\" One critic complained about the \\"fifth rate claptrap\\" of a play, and chastised Cornell for selecting such lowbrow theater as a waste of her talents. Vogue wrote that Cornell does these types of plays because \\"she prefers... to be blunt, trash of a violent kind.\\" Biographer and playwright Tad Mosel counters that although this is meant as a reproof, when stripped of its condescension, > \\"it is a simple statement of the truth. There was a part of her that indeed > preferred trash of a violent kind. Her integrity as an artist was the only > defense such a preference needed. Every performance had to be as much a > revelation of herself as it was an interpretation of a role, and therefore > her choice of roles and the way she played them offer great insights into > her nature, greater perhaps than can be inferred from her gracious, smiling, > always agreeable, and increasingly guarded behavior offstage. One must look > at her performances as one looks at the output of a writer or a painter.\\"  The Barretts of Wimpole Street  Cornell as Elizabeth Barrett in the original Broadway production of The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1931) Katharine Cornell is perhaps best known in her role as poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Rudolf Besier's play The Barretts of Wimpole Street. The play is based on the life of the poet's family; the Barretts lived on Wimpole Street in London. The play opens with Elizabeth, the oldest child of a large and loving family. Their widowed father has become embittered and determined that none of his children should marry, lest they become slaves to the \\"brutal tyranny of passion\\" and \\"the lowest urge of the body.\\" As the play progresses, his smothering concern for his family and particularly for Elizabeth, who is an invalid, takes on a sinister character. Poet Robert Browning has read some of Elizabeth's poetry and comes to meet her, and they immediately are attracted to each other. When he leaves, Elizabeth struggles to her feet to watch him disappear down the lane. Elizabeth and Robert later elope, against her father's strict orders, and when he finds that she has married without his permission or knowledge, he orders that her beloved dog, Flush, be killed. But her sister had ensured that this cocker spaniel join the couple in their escape.Text of the play The play has several difficulties. The lead role of Elizabeth has to be played initially as submissive to her father, yet as the center of attention throughout. Although the ending is happy for Elizabeth and Robert, the rest of the family remains under the domination of the father, who is deranged in his obsession. Elizabeth must be played for the first half lying still on a sofa wearing heavy Victorian costume, and covered with a blanket, as befitting an invalid. Many, including Lionel Barrymore, who was asked to play the part of the father, thought it was too melodramatic and past its time. The play was turned down by 27 New York producers before McClintic read it and found it so moving, he cried whenever he read it. When McClintic was in London, he was able to secure Brian Aherne to play the part of Robert Browning. Afterwards, McClintic immediately went to a London jewelry store and bought a necklace, two bracelets and a garnet ring, all at least 100 years old. For every single performance that Cornell gave as Elizabeth Barrett, she wore this jewelry in the last act, when she leaves the family home for the last time. Katharine Hepburn was selected for the part of Henrietta, but since she was going to play in a summer stock company a few months later, she could not be signed to a contract. Casting the dog was troublesome because it had to lie still in its basket on stage for a great length of time, and then exit when called. McClintic selected an eight-month-old cocker spaniel, which played the role for the full run and many others afterward, to tremendous applause. McClintic directed the three-hour play with a meticulous attention to period detail. Cornell was listed as the producer, although it was produced by C. & M.C. Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by both McClintic and Cornell. The play opened first in Cleveland, then played in Buffalo before reaching New York in January 1931. Brooks Atkinson wrote of opening night: > \\"After a long succession of meretricious plays it introduces us to Katharine > Cornell as an actress of the first order. Here the disciplined fury that she > has been squandering on catch-penny plays becomes the vibrant beauty of > finely wrought character.... By the crescendo of her playing, by the wild > sensitivity that lurks behind her ardent gestures and her piercing stares > across the footlights, she charges the drama with a meaning beyond the facts > it records. Her acting is quite as remarkable for the carefulness of its > design as for the fire of her presence.... The Barretts of Wimpole Street is > a triumph for Miss Cornell and the splendid company with which she has > surrounded herself.\\" All other critics were uniform in praise of her acting: using adjectives such as superb, eloquent, exalted, dark, rhythmic, luminous, haunting, lyric, ravishing. Dorothy Parker, known for her caustic wit and unsentimental reviews, wrote that although she did not think it a good play, she \\"paid it the tribute of tears.\\" Further, \\"Miss Katharine Cornell is a completely lovely Elizabeth Barrett.... It is little wonder that Miss Cornell is so worshipped; she has romance, or, if you like better the word of the daily-paper critics, she has glamour.\\" The play ran for 370 performances. When it was announced that it was closing, the remaining performances sold out and hundreds were turned away. The play's success engendered a revival of Robert Browning's poetry, and cocker spaniels became the popular dog that year. Irving Thalberg wanted Cornell to play her part in an MGM adaptation, offering that if she was not completely satisfied with the result, the film would be destroyed.Brian Aherne, A Proper Job, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston 1969 She refused. The movie that was released had most of the original cast, and Thalberg's wife, actress Norma Shearer, played the part of Elizabeth. Cornell refused to act in movies because she had seen audiences laugh at the acting of old movies and did not want that to happen to her. According to biographer Tad Mosel, > \\"she did not feel that she was acting for historians or nostalgia fans of > the future but for audiences of the here and now, people who came into the > theatre tonight, sat in their seats and waited for the curtain to go up. Not > only were they the ones she wanted to reach, but she wanted to be there when > they responded, she did not want to be off in another part of the world > while they gazed at a second-hand image on a screen.

Additionally, Cornell had apparently written to film director George Cukor, suggesting that she would consider a film if he would direct her. Nothing came of this effort. She turned down many movie roles that earned Academy Awards wins and nominations for the actresses who did play those parts, from Olan in The Good Earth, to Pilar in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Additionally, many of her roles in hit plays were successfully played by other great actresses, or were adapted as movies. As audiences were deserting live theater for the movies, Cornell became even more determined to stay in the theater in order to help keep it vibrant. The 1933 tour Cornell on the cover of Time (December 26, 1932) After Barretts closed, Cornell played leading parts in two plays, Lucrece and Alien Corn. A considerable portion of her role in Lucrece was played in pantomime. Her success in Lucrece landed her on the cover of Time on December 26, 1932. In the article, she is quoted as saying, \\"To act, you have to burst out spontaneously and feel constantly and deeply. So if you're too accustomed to using your head instead of your feelings you won't be able to call on your feelings when you want them. I tell young women not to come on the stage, unless there is nothing else they can be happy in.\\" Her next production was Romeo and Juliet, with McClintic directing. Basil Rathbone was Romeo, and Cornell played Juliet. It was the first time she had performed in any Shakespearean play though Rathbone was more experienced having played leading roles in England at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and the Royal Court. Shakespeare was not fashionable in the US at that time, and his plays were rarely presented in live theater. The last had been Hamlet with John Barrymore twelve years earlier. The play opened in Buffalo and had a difficult time. Her friend, modern dance pioneer Martha Graham, choreographed the dance sequences. In Buffalo, Graham thought Juliet's costume was all wrong. She bought some soft white nun's veiling, from which she fashioned a flowing robe. The play was incorporated into a seven-month country-wide tour that rotated three plays: Romeo and Juliet, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and Candida. Planned during the height of the Great Depression, many theater experts and actors advised against such an ambitious tour. This was the first time anyone had tried to take a legitimate Broadway show on an all-country tour, let alone three. They toured to such cities as Milwaukee, Seattle, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Cheyenne, San Antonio, New Orleans, Houston, Savannah, and up the east coast to New England. As movies had taken over from live theater to a large degree, there were major areas of the U.S. closed off to the tour. Many stops at smaller cities had not seen live theater since the First World War, or ever. But box office records were set in most cities and towns. In New Orleans, women rioted when they found out that tickets has been sold out. Variety reported that the tour gave 225 performances and played to 500,000 people. People in less urban areas traveled from two days away to see a performance, and the presenting towns gained a small but welcome swell in revenues from restaurants and hotels as a result. The most famous story to arise out of the tour came when the troupe was to play Barretts on Christmas night in Seattle, McClintic's hometown. They planned to arrive in the morning, and as it normally takes six hours to set up the stage, do lighting and blocking checks and distribute costumes, they figured there would be plenty of time. However, it had been raining for 23 days, and roads and railroads were being washed out. The train moved very slowly, often stopping. The theater management telegraphed that the venue was completely sold out for the evening performance and wanted regular updates to assure the public that the production was on its way. The troupe kept up the telegrams, but eventually these lines gave out. By that evening, the troupe was still far from the city and gave up hope of doing any performance that night. The train finally arrived in Seattle at 11:30 pm. There was a lively crowd waiting for them at the train station, and the manager of the Metropolitan Theatre came up to Cornell and informed her that the audience was still waiting. McClintic asked, \\"how many?\\" \\"The entire house,\\" was the reply, \\"Twelve hundred people.\\" Cornell was shocked and asked, \\"Do you mean they want a performance at this hour?\\" \\"They're expecting it,\\" the manager replied. All 55 members of the cast and crew drove to the theater. Sets and props had to be protected in the downpour. As soon as the troupe arrived, the audience streamed back into their seats. Cornell decided that the audience could watch the sets for \\"Barretts\\" be unpacked and set up, and so raised the curtain. The stage hands, sound checks, and electricians worked to accomplish in one hour what normally took six. By 1 am, they were ready to begin the play. Biographer Tad Mosel writes: \\"The audience had paid the actors the supreme compliment of having the faith to wait for them, and the actors responded with the kind of performance actors wish they could give every day of their lives. When the final curtain fell at 4 am, they received more curtain calls than they ever had.\\"Cornell, I Wanted to be an Actress, Random House (1938) Ray Henderson, the troupe's publicist and manager, managed to get this story published the next day in every newspaper in America. Alexander Woollcott established a radio tradition on his program, The Town Crier. For years afterward, every Christmas, Woollcott told the story of the Seattle audience that waited until 1 am for to see Katharine Cornell \\"emerge from the flood\\" and give the performance of her life. Broadway successes and maturation of style =Romeo and Juliet= Although they had toured with this play, Cornell and McClintic decided to open Romeo and Juliet in New York with a completely new production. McClintic started over, with just a handful of the actors from the tour. Orson Welles was kept, but played Tybalt instead of Mercutio, making his Broadway debut. Basil Rathbone played Romeo, while Brian Aherne took the part of Mercutio, and Edith Evans played the Nurse. McClintic's idea was to keep the play \\"light, gay, hot sun, spacious\\" with no hint of the doom that concluded the play. Also, he coached Cornell to read for meaning, sense and emotion, in place of the poetics of iambic pentameter. This was a great break with past productions, which up until then had relied upon Victorian prudery and notions of how a classic play should be performed. McClintic reinstated the Prologue and believed that all twenty-three scenes were necessary, cutting only the comedy of the musicians and servants. For the first time, the carnal desires, the youthful romanticism, and the earthiness of language were given equal importance. The production opened in December 1934, and, as usual, the reviews were glowing. Burns Mantle called Cornell \\"the greatest Juliet of her time.\\" Taking note of the freshness of approach, Richard Lockridge of the New York Sun wrote that Cornell played Juliet as \\"an eager child, rushing toward love with arms stretched out.\\" Cornell herself said that her biggest secret of acting is to do away with all excesses and embellishments, to bring an interpretation to its utmost simplicity. Margot Stevenson from the original cast later said that Cornell was \\"just this big Italian girl in love!\\" Stark Young said in The New Republic: She makes you believe in love, that Juliet loves, and that the diapason and poetry of love are the reward for its torment. Of various [other] Juliets this must have been one of the last things to be said.\\" John Mason Brown wrote in the New York Post: \\"It is not often in our lifetime that we are privileged to enjoy the pleasant sensation of feeling that the present and the future have met for a few triumphant hours.... Yet it was this very sensation—this uncommon sensation of having the present and future meet; eye-witnessing the kind of event to which we will be looking back with pride in the years to come—that forced its warming way, I suspect, into the consciousness of many of us last night as we sat spellbound. Miss Cornell's Juliet is luscious and charming. It finds her at her mellowest and most glamorous. It burns with the intensity Miss Cornell brings to all her acting. It moves gracefully and lightly; it is endlessly haunting in its pictorial qualities; and reveals a Miss Cornell who equals the beauty of the lyric lines she speaks with a new-found lyric beauty of her own voice.... To add that it is by all odds the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present- day theatre has seen is only to toss it the kind of superlative it honestly deserves.\\" Later, the same critic determined that this role was a turning point in her career, as it meant that she could finally leave the \\"trifling scripts\\" of her earlier career and could meet the challenging demands of the greatest classic roles. =The Barretts revived= Romeo and Juliet closed on February 23, 1935, and two nights later, the production company revived The Barretts of Wimpole Street, with Burgess Meredith in his first prominent Broadway role. Critics found that this new production had grown richer and more satisfying, but it closed three weeks later because other plays were contracted. The next play, also starring Meredith, was Flowers of the Forest, an anti-war play by John van Druten that lasted only 40 performances and counts among Cornell's greatest failures. =St. Joan= Program describing Cornell's appearance in Saint Joan in Cleveland starting on February 20, 1936, a couple of weeks before she opened in New York. For the next season, Cornell and her husband decided to do St. Joan by George Bernard Shaw. McClintic cast Maurice Evans as the Dauphin, Brian Aherne as Warwick, Tyrone Power as Bertrand de Poulengey, and Arthur Byron as the Inquisitor. The play opened on March 9, 1936, and Burns Mantle wrote that the triumph belonged to two maids, \\"the Maid of Domrémy, France, and the Maid of Buffalo, N.Y.\\" John Anderson of the New York Journal wrote, \\"Before there is any haggling, let it be said that it is Shaw's greatest play and that Miss Cornell is superb in it. She is beautiful to look at and her performance is enkindled by the spiritual exaltation of a transcendent heroine.\\" It was in this play that Cornell's real artistry became apparent. Audience members talked of having been \\"changed\\" by her performance, and \\"mesmerized.\\" Writer S.N. Behrman said \\"it was something essential in herself, as a person, that the audiences sensed and reached out to.\\" Another said that she was like \\"radium, flashing its healing rays,\\" while others used an older phrase, \\"magnetic influence.\\" The play closed in the spring of 1936 only because the production company had already contracted to produce Maxwell Anderson's The Wingless Victory. Saint Joan finished with a seven-week tour of five major cities. Flush, the spaniel that played the part of Flush in Barretts, died in July 1937. He had played his role 709 times, and traveled over 25,000 miles on tours, never getting drunk or arriving late. At his death, the Associated Press sent the story out over its entire network worldwide. =The Wingless Victory= Jo Mielziner portrait of Cornell in The Wingless Victory, on the cover of Stage magazine (January 1937) In Maxwell Anderson's The Wingless Victory, McClintic decided to avoid the so-called \\"star entrance,\\" where the audience expects the star of the play to enter grandly to general applause. Instead, he had another character take the star entrance, and only then was it revealed that Cornell was onstage. The effect was startling. Opened in 1936, the play received mixed reviews, and many bad ones, but Cornell was nonetheless respected for taking any role and twisting it to make it her own. Gently disparaging the play itself, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Cornell is \\"Our Queen of tragedy, a thoughtful actress and a great one.\\" Alternating with Victory, Cornell revived Candida with Mildred Natwick as Prossy. After their conclusion, she took a year off and wrote her memoir (with the help of Ruth Woodbury Sedgewick) entitled I Wanted to Be an Actress. It was published by Random House in 1939. =No Time for Comedy= Cornell's assistant Gertrude Macy produced a musical revue One for the Money which starred unknown actors who later achieved fame, including Gene Kelly, Alfred Drake, Keenan Wynn and Nancy Hamilton. Immediately after that closed, Cornell starred in her second comedy, No Time for Comedy by S. N. Behrman. McClintic cast the young Laurence Olivier in the leading role of Gaylord. During rehearsals, Cornell had a difficult time with the comedic timing, and someone shook their head and said, \\"Poor old Kit!\\" Olivier shot back, \\"Poor old Kit is the most successful woman in the American theater! The richest, the most beautiful, the most sought after, the most distinguished, the most loved — Poor old Kit indeed!\\" In his memoir, Behrman wrote, \\"Miss Cornell had less [exhibitionism] than any actress or actor I have ever known. Her position in the theatre transcended technique.... It was something essential in herself, as a person, that the audiences sensed and reached out to.... The whole stage and the other actors took light from the radiance of her personality.\\"S.N. Behrman, \\"People in a Diary\\" The play opened on April 17, 1939, and became the third-biggest money-maker for Cornell, and the second production to gross over a million dollars. With a few cast changes, including that of Olivier, the play went on a nationwide tour. =The Doctor's Dilemma= Cornell next played in Shaw's play, The Doctor's Dilemma, and Raymond Massey starred opposite her. Her production company was running so smoothly that Massey said, \\"Whatever anyone tells you, Kit ran her own show. They will say everything was managed by those people around her, but it is absolutely not true. She knew everything that was going on and she made all the decisions. At the end of the day you could find her poring over the box office receipts. She was a shrewd and intelligent businesswoman.\\" The play opened in 1941 in San Francisco, just one week before Pearl Harbor, and was the only show not cancelled, despite numerous blackouts. Given the distraction of the war, the play was not well received. Gregory Peck was part of the tour as \\"the secretary.\\" The war years Shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, Cornell decided upon a revival of Candida to benefit the Army Emergency Fund and the Navy Relief Society. Of her five productions of this play, this fourth one is remembered for the star-studded cast of Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Mildred Natwick and Dudley Digges. Cornell was able to convince all actors, Shaw, the theater hands and the Schubert organization to donate their labor, services and venue so that almost all proceeds went directly to the fund. =The Three Sisters= A year later, Ruth Gordon urged McClintic to produce Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters. Judith Anderson played Olga, Gertrude Musgrove was selected for Irina, while Cornell had the role of Masha. Others included theater legend Edmund Gwenn, Dennis King and Kirk Douglas in his Broadway debut. The play opened in Washington in December 1942, and was not expected to be much of a financial success. The opening was attended by Eleanor Roosevelt and the Soviet ambassador. It played for 122 performances in New York before going on the road, exceeding the low expectations. It had the longest run of any Chekhov play in the U.S. and the longest run of this particular play anywhere up to that point. Cornell is said to have played Masha with a nobility of spirit without ostentation, and that she found the wit in her role. Time Magazine wrote, in anticipation of its opening, \\"Not for nothing is Katharine Cornell the top-ranking actress in the U.S. theater as well as a successful producer as well as the wife of able Director Guthrie McClintic. Over the years Cornell has performed many near-miracles. She has made the yearning soul as good box office as the fiery body. She has made an invalid lady on a couch the essence of glamor. She has turned Shakespeare and Shaw into rousing hits. And when, next week, she brings her revival of Chekhov's 'The Three Sisters' to Broadway, it will boast a dream production by anybody's reckoning — the most glittering cast the theater has seen, commercially, in this generation.\\" =Wartime service= Cornell, Aline MacMahon and Dorothy Fields serve soldiers played by Lon McCallister and Michael Harrison in Stage Door Canteen (1943) Cornell's only film role was speaking a few lines from Romeo and Juliet in the movie, Stage Door Canteen (1943), which starred many of Broadway's best actors, under the auspices of the American Theatre Wing for War Relief. This organization was created by playwright Rachel Crothers, and created the Stage Door Canteen to entertain troops during the war. Cornell donated time to work at the Canteen cleaning tables. General George C. Marshall asked Cornell to do a play to entertain the troops in Europe.Aherne, \\"A Proper Job\\" Cornell decided to take The Barretts of Wimpole Street to the troops in Europe as a touring production with the USO and the Special Services Division. However, the USO and the Division stated that no G.I. would sit for a three-hour costume drama about two middle-aged Victorian poets. They suggested an alternate, some sort of \\"ribald farce\\" in case Barretts proved a failure. Cornell prepared Blithe Spirit, but nonetheless insisted upon Barretts, saying that if she was going to entertain the soldiers, she must take them her very best, and her very best was Barretts. The Army then asked that they cut the love scenes, as the play was far too long at three hours, wanted someone to \\"explain\\" the play to the men beforehand, and prepared her for what they saw as rude, tasteless and ignorant troops. The entire company, backed by Cornell and McClintic, resisted all entreaties and played their roles with every degree of authenticity as the Broadway original. At the first production, the army's fears seemed to be validated. At the start of the play, which takes place in damp, chilly London, the doctor advises that Elizabeth go to Italy for rest. The audience, G.I.s fighting in war-torn Italy, exploded in laughter, hooting, yelling and stamping. According to actress Margalo Gillmore, \\"It was true, then, we thought, they would go on laughing and it would never stop and the Barretts would go under a tidal wave of derision. But we were wrong. Kit and Guthrie were holding the laugh, just as if they had heard it a hundred times, not showing any alarm, not even seeming to wait for it, but handling it, controlling it, ready to take over at the first sign of its getting out of hand. It rose and fell and before it could rise again, Kit spoke.\\" The play continued, and outbreaks of an occasional catcall, guffaw or heckling were quickly shushed by others. Gillmore continues: \\"Kit had a shining light in her. With that strange sixth sense of the actor that functions unexplainably in complete independence of lines spoken and emotions projected, she had been aware of the gradual change out front from a dubious indifference to the complete absorption of interest. At first they hung back, keeping themselves separate from us, a little self-consciously, a little defiantly, and then line by line, scene by scene, she had felt them relax and respond and give themselves up to the play and the story, til at last they were that magic indivisible thing, an audience. 'We must never forget this, never,' said Kit. 'We've seen an audience born.'\\" The tour opened in Santa Maria, a small town 15 miles north of Naples, in 1944. G.I.s lined up three hours ahead of time and profusely thanked the cast afterwards. Brian Aherne wrote that after one show in Italy, the manager overheard a tough burly paratrooper say to his buddy, \\"Well, what I tell ya? Told ya it would be better than going to a cat house.\\" Convinced of its success, the Army brass sanctioned two more weeks. The company eventually played for six months, from August 1944 to January 1945, throughout Italy, including stops in Rome, Florence and Siena. From there, the company was transferred under the aegis of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and played in France, including Dijon, Marseilles and Versailles. In Paris, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas wanted to see the play, but found that performances were strictly limited to enlisted personnel. They were nonetheless given disguises and were able to see the play. Additionally, the cast made a point of visiting hospitals every day throughout the entire tour.Ahern, \\"A Proper Job\\" Now aged 51, Cornell was then told by the Army that she had done enough for the effort and to remain in Paris. Her response was to be taken as close to the front as possible. The company performed in Maastricht and Heerlen in the Netherlands, just eight miles from the front. The tour concluded in London amid exploding German V-2 bombs. Upon her return to New York, Cornell found mail piled up from the G.I.s who had seen the show. They thanked her for \\"the most nerve-soothing remedy for a weary G.I.,\\" for having brought \\"yearned-for femininity,\\" reminding them that, unlike other USO shows, \\"a woman is not all leg,\\" and for \\"the awakening of something that I thought died with the passing of routine military life in the foreign service.\\" Long after the tour was finished, Cornell continued to receive letters, not just from servicemen who had seen the show, but from wives, mothers and even school teachers from the home front. Their letters say that the first letter they received from their boy came after he had seen her show, or it was the first time they had heard from them in two years. Fellow actors reported that G.I.s in the South Pacific were heard to talk about the show. After the war, Cornell co-chaired the Community Players, a successor to the American Theatre Wing, to assist war veterans and their families on their return home. Cornell was featured for the second time on the cover of Time magazine on December 21, 1942, with Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon. Post- war changes =Candida, revived= After the war, American theater was experiencing a change in style with the new generation. Cornell revived Candida for the fifth and last time in April 1946, with Marlon Brando playing the role of the young Marchbanks. Whereas Cornell represented an older, exuberant romantic style, Brando heralded the newer style of Method Acting, with its reliance upon psychological insights and personal experience. Although reviews were as good as ever, audiences and some critics had difficulty with the play itself, as the Edwardian drama had little relevance to post-war American life. Now in her mid-50s, appropriate roles became harder to find. The plays that had earned her such an exceptional reputation—young Elizabeth Barrett, Juliet, St. Joan, various sexually charged women—were no longer playable by her. The newer roles were simply not her style. =Shakespeare and Anouilh= In 1946, Cornell chose Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, which opened at the Hanna Theater in Cleveland, a difficult role for which she was ideally suited. Critic Ward Morrison praised Cornell's \\"beauty and power and grandeur and I do not hesitate to proclaim it one of the finest achievements of her career.\\" Again, Cornell's presence insured that this play had its longest run ever, at 251 performances. She followed that with Jean Anouilh's adaptation of the Greek tragedy Antigone. Sir Cedric Hardwicke played King Creon, and Marlon Brando was cast as The Messenger. After the opening, Cornell's friend Helen Keller told her, \\"This play is a parable of humanity. It has no time or space.\\" One critic said, \\"if the world and the theatre had more courageous spirits like [Cornell], our cumulative dreams would be greater, our thoughts, nobler.\\" Alternating with Antony, Cornell produced another revival of Barretts of Wimpole Street, for an eight- week tour to the West Coast, with Tony Randall in both plays, and Maureen Stapleton as Iras in Antony. Other cast members included Eli Wallach, Joseph Wiseman, Douglas Watson, Charles Nolte, and Charlton Heston. =Postwar theatre= Finding good roles became increasingly a concern. Kate O'Brien dramatized her historical novel For One Sweet Grape into That Lady, set in the Spain of Philip II. A swashbuckling romance, the play was not well received. In 1951, Cornell played the lead in Somerset Maugham's comedy, The Constant Wife for a summer festival in Colorado. The play, starring her longtime favorite Brian Aherne, was produced again in New York and grossed more money for the production company than any other play. In 1953, Cornell found a suitable role in The Prescott Proposals, about a United States Delegate to the United Nations. Christopher Fry wrote a verse drama The Dark is Light Enough, set 1848 Austria. The cast included Tyrone Power, who played the love interest, Lorne Greene, and Marian Winters. (Christopher Plummer was Power's understudy. In his memoir, Plummer states that Cornell was \\"the last of the great actress-managers,\\" and that she was his \\"sponsor.\\")Plummer, \\"In Spite of Myself: A Memoir\\", Alfred A. Knopf (2008) In 1957, Cornell staged There Shall Be No Night, the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert E. Sherwood, adapted to the events of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. This play was adapted for TV and broadcast on NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame with Charles Boyer, Bradford Dillman and Ray Walston. Another play by Fry, The Firstborn, was set in Biblical Egypt, with Anthony Quayle playing Moses. Leonard Bernstein, recently appointed musical director of the New York Philharmonic, wrote two songs for the production. The play toured in Tel Aviv in 1958. She continued with several other forgettable plays, and her last production was Dear Liar by Jerome Kilty. Although Cornell was constantly performing, she took a three- year absence from 1955 to 1958 while she recovered from a lung operation. Additionally, with the exception of The Constant Wife, box office receipts were lagging even when she received excellent reviews. Tours continued to sell out, but even those began to fail as the decade bore on. By the end of the 1950s, the C. & M.C production company was finished. She did find time in 1954 to be narrator for the film The Unconquered, the life story of her friend Helen Keller. Starting in the 1940s, however, she began to collect tributes from various theatrical organization and colleges and universities, which bestowed her with honorary degrees and awards. =Radio= Cornell made her radio debut May 6, 1951, on Theatre Guild on the Air. The program featured the first broadcast of George Bernard Shaw's Candida. On April 13, 1952, she appeared in Florence Nightingale, also on The Theatre Guild on the Air. =Retirement= McClintic died on October 29, 1961 of a lung haemorrhage, shortly after the couple had celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary. As he had always directed Cornell in every production since their marriage, she decided to retire from the stage altogether. She sold her residences and bought a house on East 51st Street in Manhattan, next door to Brian Aherne and down the street from Margalo Gillmore. Since all three were cast members of Barretts, East 51st Street became known as Wimpole Street. Cornell also bought an old building on Martha's Vineyard known as The Barn and made additions to it, and restored the 300-year-old Association Hall on the island. For her 80th birthday party in 1973, an assistant put together a tape of birthday greetings from Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, and Ralph Richardson, among many other actors whom she had known. The tape runs for seven and half hours. She died of pneumonia on June 9, 1974 at The Barn in Tisbury, Massachusetts. On acting and the theatre Cornell served on the Board of Directors of The Rehearsal Club. The club was a place for young actresses to stay while they looked for work, and offered support for their careers. Occasionally, she could be seen serving food to the women, and McClintic often found minor roles in his productions for them. In her memoir, Cornell states: \\"I do think that the rapid success achieved by some people in pictures has seriously hurt the chances of a lot of young men and women who are studying for the stage. The success stories that we read in the Hollywood magazines make it all sound too easy. A youngster was a chauffeur yesterday and today he owns four swimming pools! It doesn't work that way on the stage... Some young actresses haven't been inclined to listen to me when I told that there was no royal road to success on the stage. \\"Getting started in the theatre still has a great element of luck in it, of course. Some producer must see the right person at just the right time. To get that kind of break, a girl has got to keep pounding away and tramp the streets from one manager's office to another, no matter how discouraging it may be. At the same time, she must remember that when the break does come, she must have the equipment necessary to capitalise on it. I get the impression that most of the young girls who come to me for parts simply haven't worked hard enough. In New York they have every chance in the world to round out their education in their spare time. At the galleries along 57th Street they can see the best pictures in all the world. They can hear the finest music. They can get the best books in inexpensive editions. Best of all, they can listen to the finest actors and actresses of the day. When they tell me that they can't afford to go to the theatre very often, I usually find they think it beneath their dignity to sit in the top balcony! \\"I think the most important thing for young actresses to do is to learn to use their voices properly. I always found that reading French aloud helped me tremendously. I think that French makes you use your mouth more than any other language I know. I still occasionally read some French book aloud to myself before a performance.\\" Cornell, I Wanted to Be an Actress\\" Legacy Katharine Cornell was one of the most respected, versatile stage actresses of the early-mid 20th century, moving easily from comedy to melodrama, and from classics to contemporary plays. She was a particularly accomplished interpreter of romantic and character roles. =Theatres and research centers= The Tisbury Town Hall on Martha's Vineyard houses a theatre on its second floor. Originally known as Association Hall, it was renamed \\"The Katharine Cornell Theater\\" in her honor and later, her memory. A donation from her estate provided the funds for renovation (lighting, heating, elevator) as well as decoration of four large murals depicting Vineyard life and legend by local artist Stan Murphy. The Katharine Cornell Theater is a popular venue for plays, music, movies and more. Her gravesite and memorial are located next door to the Theater. There is another theater space at the State University of New York at Buffalo named in her honor. Many student productions are presented there year-round. The Katharine Cornell-Guthrie McClintic Special Collections Reading Room was dedicated in April 1974 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. The Billy Rose Theatre Division at the library holds extensive archival and special collections materials related to Cornell and McClintic. Smith College has a collection of Cornell's papers dating from 1938 to 1960, plus additional materials in the papers of Nancy Hamilton.link The New York Public Library contains correspondence between Russian dance critic Igor Stupnikov and Cornell's assistants Nancy Hamilton and Gertrude Macy in the Billy Rose Theater Archive. Cornell donated some of her costumes designed by famed Russian fashion designer Valentina to the Museum of the City of New York. They include costumes for her roles in Cleopatra and Antigone. Cornell and Quayle also recorded for LP a scene from Barretts, and Cornell recited a selection of poetry by Elizabeth Barrett from Sonnets from the Portuguese.Caedmon Publishers, TC 1071, 1957 Cornell's short scene in Stage Door Canteen can be viewed on YouTube. In it, she recites some lines from Romeo and Juliet.

He was well known among Sri Lankans due to the philosophical background of his music renditions and lyrics selected for his work. Kapuge's one man show called Kampana was a historical advent of the Sinhala music industry. Early life Kapuge was born on August 7, 1945 in the tiny village of Thanabaddegama in Elpitiya. Being the second of eight siblings, he attended Karandeniya Central College up to grade five and the latter part at Dharmasoka College in Ambalangoda, where he initially studied science before switching to music. In 1963, he left Haywood college of music (presently known as University of the Visual and Performing Arts), where he was studying at that time, to follow a degree course in India. In late 1960, Kapuge joined the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and in 1969, he worked as an operational assistant and in 1975 started out as a programme producer. In 1981, he was appointed in charge of the music section of the Rajarata Sevaya and later on promoted to the position of the controller of the station. Rajarata Sevaya is one of the provincial radio stations of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He later married Prema Withanage in 1978. Music career Kapuge's initial release was titled \\"Daesa Nilupul Thema\\" in 1973, which became an instant hit. After which, Kapuge was quoted as a 'Grade A' vocalist by the Radio Ceylon. Thus the three decade long music career of Visharada Kapuge began. The first stage drama for which he provided background music was \\"Thuranga Sanniya\\" by Sugathapala De Silva. Since then he provided background music for the highly popular musical \\"Tharawo Igilethi\\" by Lucien Bulathsinhala and several others. His first movie background music gig was for Stanley Perera's \\"Sandha.\\" In 1980, Kapuge released his first music compact cassette titled \\"Dhampatin Laa Sandha\\" featuring Malini Bulathsinhala. Now his son Mithra Kapuge, and his brother, Premawardhana Kapuge sing his songs to save Kapuge's memory as well.

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The gameplay of Uniracers involves racing riderless unicycles around a 2D track.Uniracers instruction booklet (Super Nintendo Entertainment System, US) Heavy emphasis is placed on performing stunts. Performing stunts causes the unicycle to go faster on race or circuit tracks and earn points on stunt tracks. The stunts that can be performed are relatively simple, mostly only involving jumping in the air and rotating about a given axis in 3D space. The idea is to be able to perform these stunts quickly in tight situations while landing the unicycle on its wheel to avoid wiping out, which results in the loss of accumulated speed. The game features nine tours of five tracks each (two race, two circuit, one stunt) for a total of 45. Beating each of the first eight tours requires defeating computer-controlled opponents for each of bronze, silver, and gold ranks. The last circuit features the Anti-Uni as the computer-controlled opponent. During that tour, touching the Anti-Uni causes several odd effects, such as the track becoming invisible, the controls reversing, and the background no longer moving in sync with the actions. Split-screen two-player modes are available as well, including a league mode that allows up to eight players to compete in one-on-one races. There are 16 different colored unicycles to choose from, each with a save file and customizable name. The track is made of bars with patterns on them which correspond to the track's properties at or near that point. For example, a solid yellow bar indicates a shortcut and orange/yellow bars indicates an upcoming hazard. There are also various obstacles like speed-ups, corkscrews, loops, twists, and jumps.  Development and release  Uniracers was known by the working title \\"1x1\\" during development. The developers practiced riding real unicycles through their office to aid their understanding. = Lawsuit = Shortly after the game's release, DMA Design was sued by Pixar for allegedly copying the unicycle design and concept from their 1987 short film Red's Dream. Mike Dailly, one of the developers at DMA Design, commented, \\"The problem with Pixar was that they seemed to think that any computer generated unicycle was owned by them.\\" DMA Design lost the lawsuit, and as a result, Nintendo had to terminate production of further Unirally cartridges. According to Dailly, \\"The deal was that Nintendo wouldn't make any more carts so Unirally only sold the 300k initial run\\". Fellow DMA Design developer Robbie Graham recalled, \\"They took footage from Red's Dream and compared it to Unirally and the unicycles were virtually the same; this isn't a big surprise as there’s not a lot of ways you can bring life to a unicycle without looking like the one Pixar did. The judge - being the moron that he was - agreed.\\"  Reception  GamePro gave the game a mixed review. They praised the fast pace and \\"hard-drivin' unicycle music\\", but criticized the sound effects and graphics, remarking that the backgrounds are clean but boring, and the unicycles \\"all look identical.\\" They concluded that players should \\"try this addictive game.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation similarly said that Uniracers is innovative and oddly compelling despite its surface dullness, but that the excitement and novelty of the game wear out before long. Ed Semrad of Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that \\"While it lacks the charm of most ... Nintendo titles, there is bound to be a cult following.\\" However, the other three members of the magazine's review crew all gave Uniracers a negative assessment, saying that while the graphics and controls are good, the game simply lacks excitement. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B-. Nintendo Power ranked it as the 8th best SNES game of 1994. In 2011, IGN called it the 98th best game for the system.

Krebs has headed three major United States railroads in succession, leading the Southern Pacific (SP) when it was acquired by Santa Fe Industries, rising to lead the resulting Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, and finally being chosen to head the new Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) when Santa Fe Pacific (the holding company for the Santa Fe railroad) merged with Burlington Northern. He started out working for SP subsidiary Cotton Belt in the early 1960s becoming the youngest Superintendent of Cotton Belt's Pine Bluff Division in 1971 at age 29. One of the things he had was absolute honesty and a temper when it came to running his railroad. According to Fred Frailey, one of Kreb's dilemmas was that Missouri Pacific's Dupo Tower operator held Cotton Belt's Blue Streak Merchandise with Krebs on board for an MP train to advance. Krebs called Missouri Pacific's Southern Region General Manager to complain. When the BSM was held again in 1972 at Dupo for 43 minutes by a Missouri Pacific coal train and two other trains, Krebs was informed the next day. Krebs acted shortly the day after in Pine Bluff by going to the Cotton Belt's dispatcher office and had the Missouri Pacific's hottest train the DE held for exactly 43 minutes at Dexter. This move by Krebs drew immediate attention when Missouri Pacific's General Manager in Little Rock called Krebs's General Manager in Houston to complain. This event and the fact that Krebs knew how to run a railroad with little delay helped him move up the ranks and eventually become president of the SP and later CEO of ATSF and BNSF. He retired as CEO of BNSF in 2000 and left the board when he retired as chairman on April 17, 2002. On May 13, 2005, Krebs joined the Board of Directors for Railpower Technologies, a position from which he subsequently resigned on September 9, 2005, citing personal reasons.

It lies west of the junction of the Flinders and Eyre Highways around 786 km northwest of the capital Adelaide. The port town/suburb of Thevenard lies 3 km to the west on Cape Thevenard. It is in the District Council of Ceduna, the federal Division of Grey, and the state electoral district of Flinders. The name Ceduna is a corruption of the local Aboriginal Wirangu word Chedoona and is said to mean a place to sit down and rest. The town has played an important but minor role in Australia's overall development due to it being a fishing port and a railway hub. History Murat Bay in Ceduna looking over to Thevenard during Oysterfest 2012 Ceduna is on land that was part of the traditional home of the Wirangu people. Matthew Flinders, on his voyage in the Investigator, anchored in Fowlers Bay on 28 January 1802. He went on to explore the coast and named Denial Bay, Smoky Bay and the islands of Nuyts Archipelago. He was disappointed to find no river and gave the name Denial Bay because they did not find fresh water. French expedition leader Nicolas Baudin visited Murat Bay after meeting with Flinders and named it after Joachim Murat. He also named the point of Thevenard after the Admiral and Minister of Marine Antoine-Jean-Marie Thevenard, and Decres Bay after Denis Decres, duke of the First French Empire. The first European exploration of the hinterland was during August–September 1839 by John Hill and Samuel Stephens, using the chartered brig Rapid as a base. Hill reported to Governor Gawler that although the bay was 'valuable', the hinterland was 'waterless', thereby stalling European interest.Register, 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17. There was a whaling station on nearby St Peter Island during the 1850s before settlement. The Commissioner of Crown Lands, faced with widespread agitation to open West Coast lands for agricultural settlement, invited three farmers in July 1887 to inspect the lands between Streaky Bay and Western Australia. They were optimistic about the area and recommended that the necessary surveys be started at once. In 1889 the Government in Adelaide formalised the Far West with survey lines. In June 1901, the town of Ceduna was proclaimed. For many years, locals called the township Murat Bay and it was not until the railways came and called the siding Ceduna in 1915 that locals adopted the name. The Ceduna Jetty was built in 1902. The Tod Water pipeline was officially opened by Mr M McIntosh, Commissioner of Public Works, June 1928. Ceduna was the site of a major satellite telecommunications facility operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. It was a major employer in the town until made redundant by technological change. It was built in 1969 and by 1984 almost half of Australia's International telecommunication traffic passed through Ceduna's Earth Station.Ceduna Business & Tourism Association > Places of interest > Ceduna OTC Earth Station Accessed 25 September 2015. On 4 December 2002, Ceduna received international attention when the path of totality of a solar eclipse passed directly over the town. Though the day had at times been partly cloudy, and although mere kilometres away in Thevenard the view was still clouded over, the southwestern sky where the Sun and Moon were located was clear from Ceduna itself at the time of the total solar eclipse, late in the afternoon. In the 2007/2008 State Budget, Premier Mike Rann (who had opened the new Ceduna TAFE campus in the early 1990s) announced a commitment of $36 million for Stage 1 of the Ceduna Hospital Redevelopment. It was opened in 2011.http://www.get farming.com.au, 29 March 2011 \\"More investment in country health.\\" In February 2010 Premier Rann opened the world's largest mineral sands mine, operated by Iluka Resources. The $390 million mine is located 200 km north west of Ceduna.Australian Mining 10 February 2010 Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 2,157 people in Ceduna. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 16.4% of the population. * 79.2% of people were born in Australia and 82.1% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common response for religion was No Religion at 33.7%. Description The town is the last major settlement before crossing the Nullarbor Plain from east to west. It is set on Murat Bay and the sandy coves, sheltered bays and offshore islands of the bay make it a popular base for a beach holiday. The foreshore at Ceduna is lined with Norfolk Island pine trees. There is a jetty for walking, fishing and small boats. =Demographics= In the the Ceduna urban area had a population of 2,289, and the Ceduna council area a population of 3,480. Ceduna has a number of Indigenous homelands situated within 20–30 minutes of the town. These are groupings of Indigenous families who have chosen to live together. The council area has the highest percentage of Aboriginal people of all local government areas in South Australia, with the population currently standing at 24.8% (911) of the population. A number of Aboriginal communities in adjacent unincorporated areas rely on the available services in Ceduna and use the town as a base for a variety of reasons. Very few of the indigenous inhabitants of Ceduna continue to speak the Wirangu language. As the regional service town, Ceduna attracts indigenous people from many language groups in western South Australia. The Far West Languages Centre (FWLC) was established in 2006 to maintain three local Endangered languages including Wirangu, along with Mirning and Kokatha. =Education= The two schools in Ceduna are Crossways Lutheran School and Ceduna Area School (CAS).Ceduna Area School Accessed 6 September 2011. Crossways has around 150 students from Reception to Year 10, approximately 80% of whom are Indigenous. CAS has approximately 600 students, from Reception to Year 12, with approximately 25% of Indigenous students. =Economic activity= Iluka Resources developed a mineral sands mine at Jacinth- Ambrosia which relies on Ceduna as a service town. A major residential development called Ceduna Waters was developed by Carramatta Holdings, a significant South Australian property developer in early 2010. Ceduna Waters is approximately 3 km from the town centre and is approximately 30% occupied as of May 2013. Prospectively, the development was projected to result in the growth of the population of Ceduna by over 10%. The development will allow for the provision of additional residential accommodation in Ceduna to meet the needs of workers at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine. The Thevenard port of Ceduna is a high-frequency deep sea port which exports grain, salt, mineral sand and gypsum, all which are found within the local region. Aquaculture remains a major industry in Ceduna with pacific oyster growing a key activity in the region. In recent years deep sea fishing and tuna fishing have attracted industries from Port Lincoln to the region.http://www.ceduna.net In 2012, BP commenced the ability to seek approval for oil drilling off the nearby Great Australian Bight.

Other local names include molly, redeye, goggle-eye, red-eyed bream, and strawberry perch. Description Adult warmouth from Kickapoo State Park, Illinois. a juvenile specimen of Lepomis gulosus from Kickapoo State Park, east-central Illinois The adult warmouth is dark, with a mottled brown coloration. Its belly is generally golden, and the male has a bright-orange spot at the base of the dorsal fin. Three to five reddish-brown streaks radiate from the eyes, and the gill flaps are often red. It has three spines in the anal fin, 10 spines in the dorsal fin, and small teeth are present on the tongue. These fish range in size from 4 to 10 inches (10.2 to 25 cm), but can grow to over 12 inches (31 cm) in length, and weigh up to 2.25 pounds (1 kg). The warmouth is occasionally confused with the rock bass or green sunfish, both of which share its relatively large mouth and heavy body. However, the green sunfish generally has a greenish-blue variegated pattern on its gill flaps, a black spot near the base of the dorsal fin, and its fins are bordered in yellowish- white. The rock bass has 5-7 spines in its anal fin as opposed to the three in the warmouth. The warmouth tends to be a bit larger in size than either of the other two species. Distribution Warmouth are found throughout much of the south in the Mississippi River drainage, from the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and northward to the Chesapeake Bay, and westward throughout Texas to the Rio Grande, and northward into the Great Lakes basin area.Larimore, Kenneth D. 1957. Ecological Life History of the Warmouth Centrarchidae. Illinois Natural History Survey, Bulletin 27(1):1-83 Warren, L. W., Jr., B. M. Burr, S. J. Walsh, H. L. Bart, Jr., R. C. Cashner, D. A.

Diversity, Distribution, and Conservation status of the native freshwater fishes of the southern United States. Fisheries 25(10):7-29. The warmouth is a highly aggressive and hardy fish, and they can live in ponds, lakes, rivers, and backwater streams and can often survive in streams with low oxygen levels where other species of sunfish cannot. The species exists with breeding populations in southern portions of Canada, and likely has existed there for many years prior to being detected.Crossman, EJ; Simpson, RC. 1984. Warmouth, Lepomis-gulosus, a fresh-water fish new to Canada. Canadian Field-Naturalist. 98 (4): 496-498 Ecology The primary diet of the warmouth consists of insects, crayfish, and other fish. They are sight feeders, and can survive in polluted, low-oxygenated waters where other sunfish cannot, like rock bass. The largest factor affecting warmouth density and biomass in Florida's lakes is the availability of aquatic macrophytes, which allows the fish to ambush prey and use as areas to spawn.Willis, D.J.; D.L. Watson; M.V. Hoyer; D.E. Canfield. 2009. Factors related to Warmouth Lepomis gulosus biomass and density in Florida lakes. Florida Scientist 72:3:218-226 The primary diet of young warmouth is microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae, whereas larger specimens tend to mainly consume crayfish, freshwater shrimp, and other small fish.Etnier, D. A., and W. C. Starnes. 1993. The fishes of Tennessee. University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, TN. Tumlison, Renn; Carroll, Christian; Greenwood, Matt. 2007. Summer food habits of young grass pickerel Esox amercanious, warmouth Lepomis gulosus, and log perch Percino caprodes from a cove in Lake Ouachita, Garland County, Arkansas. Journal of the Arkansas Academy of Science 61:134-136 Their predators include larger fish, snakes, turtles, alligators, and birds. The primary habitats the warmouth occupies are areas with ample vegetation as cover with slower-moving water, often around stumps, brush piles, and other dense entanglements that allow the warmouth the ability to ambush prey, yet escape larger predators that may threaten them. Life history A warmouth in Mississippi Spawning for the warmouth begins usually begins when water temperatures reach 21.1 °C.Ross, S. T. 2001. The Inland Fishes of Mississippi. University Press of Mississippi, Jackson. 624 pp. Their spawning often begins in May and lasts until July. Nests are primarily constructed on rock or gravel substrates, usually located in or near to some type of structure in the water column. Unlike most other Lepomis species, the warmouth does not nest in a colony unless ideal nesting habitat is limited. When in breeding condition, the males' eyes turn red. After the female lays her eggs, the male fertilizes the eggs and aggressively defends the nest, eggs and fry from any intruder-including other females. Males are most commonly found defending the nest for up to five days later until the fry have hatched. Young warmouth spend most of their time hiding under benthic substrate available to avoid predators. Most are considered sexually mature after one year, but often the size of a fish indicates its maturity rather than time. Males usually grow faster than females. Different habitat conditions also reflect the lifespan of the warmouth, which varies from three to eight years.Gatz, A.J., Jr.; S.M. Adams. 1994. Patterns of movements of centrachids in two warm-water streams in eastern Tennessee. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 3:1:35-48 The warmouth is an extremely adaptable species that can survive in many different conditions, in many river systems east of the Rocky Mountains. Often, the warmouth prefers habitats where slower-moving and polluted water. The most common cause of concern for the warmouth is hybridization with other Lepomis spp. that often inhabit the same areas as the warmouth. The species known to hybridize with it are L. cyanellus and L. macrochirus, as well as largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus.Merriner, J.V. 1971. Egg size as a factor in intergeneric hybrid success of centrarchids. Trans. Amer. Fish Soc. 100(1):29-32.Lee, D. S. 1980. Lepomis gulosus (Cuvier),Warmouth. pp. 595 in D. S. Lee, et al. Atlas of North American Freshwater Fishes. N. C. State Mus. Nat. Hist., Raleigh, i-r+854 pp This does not seem to affect the overall health or longevity of the species. Since warmouths are not migratory fish, their populations should be relatively easily monitored throughout much of their existing ranges. According to Warren, there is no threat or current concern for the warmouth.  Relationship with humans  The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at 1.10 kg (2 lb 7oz) caught in Holt, Florida in 1985.

The area towards the sea is not \\"The Arch\\" but a shallow bank called \\"The Saddle\\". The Blue Hole is a diving location on the southeast Sinai, a few kilometres north of Dahab, Egypt on the coast of the Red Sea. The Blue Hole is a submarine sinkhole, with a maximum depth within the hole of just over 100 m (328 feet). There is a shallow opening to the sea around 6 m (20 feet) deep, known as \\"the saddle\\", and a 26 m (85 feet) long tunnel, known as \\"the Arch\\", whose ceiling is at a depth of 55 m (181 feet), and whose bottom falls away as it reaches the seaward side to about 120 m (394 feet). On the seaward side the floor drops steeply to over . The hole and the surrounding area have an abundance of coral and reef fish. The Blue Hole is popular for freediving because of the depth directly accessible from shore and the lack of current. The dive site is reputed to have the highest diver fatality rate for any dive site in the world with estimates of between 130 and 200 fatalities of divers in recent years.Top diver’s death casts long shadow over deep beauty of the Blue Hole Edmund Bower, Sunday 27 August 2017, The GuardianMonty Halls and the Divers' Graveyard, Channel 5 (UK) television, 9pm to 10pm, Monday 2 December 2013 The reasons why this site is the most dangerous in the world are not clearly understood, with various explanations given for its high accident rate.  Diving history  Map The Blue Hole was historically avoided by Bedouin tribes people who inhabited the area. There was a local Bedouin legend that the Blue Hole is cursed by the ghost of a girl who drowned herself there to escape from an arranged marriage. The Sinai Peninsula was occupied by Israel from the Six-Day War of 1967 until Israel returned it to Egypt in 1982. During the Israeli occupation, the Blue Hole developed a significant international reputation as a dive site. In 1968 a group of Israeli divers led by Alex Shell were the first to dive the hole with modern scuba diving. During the dive, they noticed the underwater arch. . Since 1982 the Blue Hole has become very busy with recreational divers and is dived almost every day by recreational divers. Local dive centres take appropriately qualified divers to 30 m (AOW level or CMAS**) at the El Bells or Bells to Blue Hole sites. The Bells entry is from the shore further along from the Blue Hole. At 26 m at the bottom of the Bells is a mini arch that should not be confused with the arch in the Blue Hole itself. The dive is then a wall dive that finishes crossing the Blue Hole saddle at a depth of 7 m. Recreational divers do not get to see the Blue Hole arch when doing the Bells to Blue Hole dive. Fatalities Memorial plaques for divers killed in the hole, left by families and friends at the site The Blue Hole itself is no more dangerous than any other Red Sea dive site but diving through the Arch, a submerged tunnel, which lies within the Blue Hole site, is an extreme dive that has resulted in many accidents and fatalities. The number of Blue Hole fatalities is not recorded; one source estimates 130 divers died during the fifteen-year period from 1997 to 2012, averaging over eight per year, another claims as many as 200. This includes some snorkelling deaths at the surface unrelated to diving the Arch.FATAL ATTRACTION Theodora Sutcliffe The majority of diver fatalities were experienced, including highly trained technical divers and diving instructors. The Egyptian Chamber For Diving & Watersports (CDWS) now stations a policeman at the Blue Hole to ensure divers are diving with a certified guide who will make sure safety procedures are followed. The ceiling of the Arch is 55 m (170 ft) deep, which requires suitable training and equipment as 40 metres is generally considered the limit for recreational diving. The Arch presents little problem for suitably qualified technical divers. The main challenge is gas management because any lingering or errors at this depth, plus the time to negotiate the horizontal section, will need more than a single tank of breathing gas to do safely. If gas is not carefully planned the diver may lack sufficient air for the decompression stops or run out of air altogether. The main reasons suggested for the accident rate include that the: * Notoriety of the site attracts divers and presents a challenge that tempts many who lack the necessary experience or qualifications. * Accessibility of the site and the clear, warm waters of the Red Sea makes the dive look more benign than it is. At over 55 m, and with an overhead environment, the dive requires advanced technical certification, the Tech 60 as a minimum. * Deceptive entry to the Arch is not easy to find because of the indirect line between the Blue Hole and open water. Divers who miss the entry may inadvertently continue to descend past it, while the floor continues on down to well over 100 m providing no visual depth reference. * Time taken to pass through the Arch may be underestimated. The tunnel appears shorter than it actually is because of the clarity of the water, the light at the outside end and the lack of reference points; divers report that the tunnel appears to be less than 10 m long but has been measured as 26 m. Moreover, there is frequently a current flowing inward through the arch into the Blue Hole, increasing the time it takes to swim through and increasing gas consumption. * Depth and the time taken to find and navigate the tunnel inevitably makes this dive a decompression dive requiring possibly lengthy decompression stops on ascent in order to avoid decompression sickness (DCS). Also, the rate of diving gas consumption increases with depth resulting in divers either becoming out of gas or beginning the ascent with insufficient gas to make the decompression stops required. * Likelihood of nitrogen narcosis is significant at this depth, causing confusion leading to poor judgement in an already demanding situation. Although the effects of nitrogen narcosis may be mitigated by using heliox the Arch is insufficiently deep to warrant its use. * Temptation to dive on a single gas tank. Theoretically, the Arch can be dived on a single 11 Litre tank, and often has been, but this is dangerously close to the minimum gas requirement for the dive and depends on a relaxed diver with a low gas consumption rate committing no errors or hesitations during the dive. Diving the Arch without a stage tank and without rigorous gas planning has resulted in drowning or DCS. Technical diver passing under the Arch.

Yuri carried a video camera, which filmed his death. This has made it the best known death at the site and one of the best known diving deaths in the world. The video shows Yuri in an involuntary and uncontrolled descent, eventually landing on the sea floor at 115 metres where he panics, removes his regulator and tries to fill his buoyancy compensator but is unable to rise. At 115 m he would have been subject to severe nitrogen narcosis, which may have impaired his judgement, induced hallucinations and caused panic and confusion. Lipski had a single tank assumed to be air. Lipski's body was recovered the following day by Tarek Omar, one of the world's foremost deep-water divers, at the request of Lipski's mother.

They provide a high level of function in certain tissues such as salivary glands of insects Polytene chromosomes were first reported by E.G.Balbiani in 1881. Polytene chromosomes are found in dipteran flies: the best understood are those of Drosophila, Chironomus and Rhynchosciara. They are present in another group of arthropods of the class Collembola, a protozoan group Ciliophora, mammalian trophoblasts and antipodal, and suspensor cells in plants. In insects, they are commonly found in the salivary glands when the cells are not dividing. They are produced when repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division forms a giant chromosome. Thus polytene chromosomes form when multiple rounds of replication produce many sister chromatids which stay fused together. Polytene chromosomes, at interphase, are seen to have distinct thick and thin banding patterns. These patterns were originally used to help map chromosomes, identify small chromosome mutations, and in taxonomic identification. They are now used to study the function of genes in transcription.  Function  In addition to increasing the volume of the cells' nuclei and causing cell expansion, polytene cells may also have a metabolic advantage as multiple copies of genes permits a high level of gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, for example, the chromosomes of the larval salivary glands undergo many rounds of endoreduplication to produce large quantities of adhesive mucoprotein (“glue”) before pupation. Another example within the fly itself is the tandem duplication of various polytene bands located near the centromere of the X chromosome which results in the Bar phenotype of kidney-shaped eyes. The interbands are involved in the interaction with the active chromatin proteins, nucleosome remodeling, and origin recognition complexes. Their primary functions are: to act as binding sites for RNA pol II, to initiate replication and, to start nucleosome remodeling of short fragments of DNA.  Structure  In insects, polytene chromosomes are commonly found in the salivary glands; they are also referred to as \\"salivary gland chromosomes\\". The large size of the chromosome is due to the presence of many longitudinal strands called chromonemata; hence the name polytene (many stranded). They are about 0.5 mm in length and 20 μm in diameter. The chromosomal strands are formed after repeated division of the chromosome in the absence of cytoplasmic division. This type of division is called endomitosis. The polytene chromosome contains two types of bands, dark bands and interbands. The dark bands are darkly stained and the inter bands are lightly stained with nuclear stains. The dark bands contain more DNA and less RNA. The interbands contain more RNA and less DNA. The amount of DNA in interbands ranges from 0.8 - 25%. The bands of polytene chromosomes become enlarged at certain times to form swellings called puffs. The formation of puffs is called puffing. In the regions of puffs, the chromonemata uncoil and open out to form many loops. The puffing is caused by the uncoiling of individual chromomeres in a band. The puffs indicate the site of active genes where mRNA synthesis takes place. The chromonemata of puffs give out a series of many loops laterally. As these loops appear as rings, they are called Balbiani rings after the name of the researcher who discovered them. They are formed of DNA, RNA and a few proteins. As they are the site of transcription, transcription mechanisms such as RNA polymerase and ribonucleoproteins are present. In protozoans, there is no transcription, since the puff consists only of DNA. History Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Édouard-Gérard Balbiani in 1881. Balbiani described the chromosomal puffs among the tangled thread inside the nucleus, and named it \\"permanent spireme\\". In 1890, he observed similar spireme in a ciliated protozoan Loxophyllum meleagris. The existence of such spireme in Drosophila melanogaster was reported by Bulgarian geneticist Dontcho Kostoff in 1930. Kostoff predicted that the discs (bands) which he observed were \\"the actual packets in which inherited characters are passed from generation to generation.\\" The hereditary nature of these structures was not confirmed until they were studied in Drosophila melanogaster in the early 1930s by German biologists Emil Heitz and Hans Bauer. In 1930, Heitz studied different species of Drosophila (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. hydei, and D. virilis) and found that all their interphase chromatins in certain cells were swollen and messy. In 1932, he collaborated with Karl Heinrich Bauer with whom he discovered that the tangled chromosomes having distinct bands are unique to the cells of the salivary glands, midgut, Malphigian tubules, and brain of the flies Bibio hurtulunus and Drosophila funebris. The two papers were published in the early 1933. Unaware of these papers, an American geneticist Theophilus Shickel Painter reported in December 1933 the existence of giant chromosome in D. melanogaster (followed by a series of papers the following year). Learning of this, Heitz accused Painter of deliberately ignoring their original publication to claim priority of discovery. In 1935, Hermann J. Muller and A.A. Prokofyeva established that the individual band or part of a band corresponds with a gene in Drosophila. The same year, P.C. Koller hesitantly introduced the name \\"polytene\\" to describe the giant chromosome, writing: Occurrence Polytene chromosomes are present in secretory tissues of dipteran insects such as the Malpighian tubules of Sciara and also in protists, plants, mammals, or in cells from other insects. Some of the largest polytene chromosomes described thus far occur in larval salivary gland cells of the chironomid genus Axarus. In plants, they are found in only a few species, and are restricted to ovary and immature seed tissues such as in Phaseolus coccineus and P. vulgaris (Nagl, 1981), and the anther tapetum of Vigna unguiculata and of some Phaseolus species. Polytene chromosomes are also used to identify the species of chironomid larvae that are notoriously difficult to identify. Each morphologically distinct group of larvae consists of a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species that can only be identified by rearing adult males or by cytogenetic analysis of the polytene chromosomes of the larvae. Karyotypes are used to confirm the presence of specific species and to study genetic diversity in species with a wide range of genetic variation.

It is part of the North Dakota University System. It was founded in 1918 as Dickinson State Normal School and granted full university status in 1987. History Dickinson State was established as a normal school to fill a need for qualified teachers in rural western North Dakota, where fewer than one-quarter of the people working as teachers in the early 1900s were certified as teachers. The university considers June 24, 1918, to be its founding date; this was the first day of classes for the Dickinson Normal School. When first established, the school was tuition-free and operated in the facilities of Dickinson High School. The first campus building, May Hall, was built in 1924. During World War II, Dickinson State Teachers College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. =Enrollment and graduation controversies= In 2011 and 2012, Dickinson State attracted negative attention for some of its academic and business practices. In 2011, the university was discovered to have overstated its enrollments by practices such as counting people as students who had merely attended a conference on the campus. This situation resulted in the dismissal of the university president, Richard J. McCallum. A North Dakota University System audit report released in February 2012 found that the school had relaxed standards and waived some requirements to increase enrollment of foreign students and had, over a period of several years, awarded degrees to 584 foreign students who had not completed the required coursework. The report was a followup of an earlier meeting between Dickinson officials and the Higher Learning Commission at which the DSU officials \\"realized they may have an issue with one or more of the HLC’s requirements surrounding academic agreements\\". Most of the university's foreign students came from China, where the university employed recruiting agents who falsely claimed to be university employees and sometimes misrepresented the university's programs. News media accounts described the audit report as depicting Dickinson State as a degree mill.Audit Depicts N. Dakota University As Degree Mill - NPR, February 10, 2012Dickinson State - alleged diploma mill for Chinese - Associated Press/San Francisco Chronicle, Feb 10, 2012Degrees (Without the Work) for Foreign Students at a North Dakota University - New York Times, 10 Feb 2012 The audit had been requested by the university's president, Douglas Coston, who took office in January 2012, after some university international agreements were found not to conform with requirements of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education and the Higher Learning Commission. On the day of the audit release, the Dean of education committed suicide.Dickinson State University dean found dead Bismarck Tribune, February 10, 2012 Six months later, in July, Dickinson's regional accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), placed the university \\"on notice,\\" requiring the university provide detailed responses to concerns found in the accreditor's recent site visit. That status was removed three years later when HLC renewed DSU's accreditation for ten years. Academics Dickinson State offers four-year degrees in more than 75 fields of study through 10 academic departments. The school also offers pre- professional and two-year coursework. However, it specializes in business management, teacher education, and nursing. Most students attending DSU are business management majors although education (both elementary and secondary), nursing, natural science, and agriculture majors constitute significant areas of study. Dickinson State University has recently started a Graduate Course program in the field of teacher education. This gives participants a head start in graduate school courses but is not an actual graduate program. The university long ago outgrew its original teachers’ college status and has since adopted a broader mission. The present programs include not only teacher education and the liberal arts, but also specialized programs in business, nursing, agriculture, and computer science. There is also opportunity for pre- professional study and vocational training in selected areas. Student programs are based on a core of General Education courses, including fine arts, humanities, natural sciences, mathematics, and the social and behavioral sciences. Dickinson State University students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements by the end of the sophomore year. Students are then free as juniors and seniors to explore a major field of study. =Accreditation= Dickinson State University is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission. Although the university was placed \\"on notice\\" in July 2012 it was removed from that status in October 2013 and is fully accredited. Athletics Dickinson State teams, nicknamed athletically as the Blue Hawks, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the North Star Athletic Association. Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, rodeo, golf, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, rodeo, softball, track & field and volleyball. Hank Biesiot is a former football coach and was one of the few active coaches at the college level with 200 or more wins and 30 or more seasons. The Dickinson State track and field team won NAIA national championships three consecutive years from 2004-2006 under coach Pete Stanton. They were national runner up five other times in the eight-year period from 2003 to 2010. Communications The campus news blog is available online. DSU News covers current happenings among DSU related students and staff. Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library On April 30, 2013, both chambers of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly passed a bill appropriating $12 million to Dickinson State University to award a grant to the Theodore Roosevelt Center for construction of a building to be named the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library. To access these funds, the Theodore Roosevelt Center must first raise $3 million from non-state sources. Dickinson State University is also home to the Theodore Roosevelt Digital Library which has formed partnerships with the Library of Congress and Harvard University, among other institutions.

K-mount lenses were simply named \\"SMC Pentax\\". Details The Takumar designation was used on lenses designed for Asahi's 35 mm cameras, 6×7 cameras, and for other purposes too.Pentax Lens Series overview; http://www.pentaxforums.com/lensreviews/ * Takumar lenses were made in M37 screwmount for the original Asahiflex cameras and continued into the M42 period. * Auto-Takumar lenses were a type of preset lens. The user selected an aperture then engaged a lever to energise the stopping-down mechanism. The camera would then trip this mechanism when the shutter was fired. * Super-Takumar lenses featured a[n improved] form of lens coating (to [reduce] flare) and a more sophisticated stopping-down mechanism. There was a switch on the lens to select \\"Auto\\" or \\"Manual\\" modes. In manual mode, the lens would always be in the selected aperture. In Auto mode, the lens would remain wide open (at maximum aperture) until a pin on the rear of the lens was pushed in. This pin would be automatically pushed in by the camera when the shutter was tripped. * Super-Multi-Coated (later SMC) Takumar. These lenses introduced Asahi's lens multi-coating process [to further reduce reflections and flare]. They also introduced a lug on the rear of the lens which moved with the aperture selected. When used with a camera body which could read the lug, this enabled the use of open-aperture metering. Examples of such cameras are Asahi's Spotmatic F and the ES/ESII. These SMC-Takumar M42 thread mount lenses included: 15/3.5 rectilinear ultra-wide angle, 17/4 full-frame fisheye, 20/4.5, 24/3.5, 28/3.5, 35/2.8, 50/1.4, 50/4 macro, 55/1.8, 55/2, 85/1.8, 100/4 macro, 105/2.8, 135/2.5, 135/3.5, 200/4, 300/4, 400/5.6, 500/4.5, 1000/8. The Takumar series of lenses has an excellent reputation which approaches a cult-like following among some users. They assert these are the best series of photographic lenses ever produced because: - At the time, Japanese industry had a pride-driven, some would say fanatical dedication to producing the absolute best quality in the world. - The lenses were designed for professional durability, quality and performance. - Their performance especially with black and white film is extraordinary; photographs have a crisp, soulful, artistic quality usually attributed to the much more expensive West German-made Leitz and Zeiss lenses. - The M42 thread mount (originally created by Contax, but sometimes also referred to as Pentax screw mount, or universal screw mount, or TM for thread mount) was widely used among many manufacturers and was also easily mated to other camera mounts with simple adapters, making these lenses widely used and appreciated. - Japanese technical expertise and production quality rose rapidly to reach world-class levels in the 1970s, several years before their economy, currency and marketing ability caught up, making these lenses underrecognized and undervalued even until the present. - Dedicated fanatics are convinced these lenses equal or surpass Zeiss lenses in every category except perhaps marketing prowess and mystique. Pentax resurrected the Takumar name in the 1980s and 1990s for a budget line of zoom and prime lenses that lacked the Pentax \\"Super Multi-Coating\\" anti-reflective coating that reduces lens flare. These lenses are marked \\"Takumar (Bayonet)\\" or \\"Takumar-F\\" to distinguish them from the older screw-mount Takumar lenses.

Loose connective tissue is the most common type of connective tissue in vertebrates. It holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to other underlying tissues. For example, it forms telae, such as the tela submucosa and tela subserosa, which connect mucous and serous membranes to the muscular layer. It also surrounds the blood vessels and nerves. Cells called fibroblasts are widely dispersed in this tissue; they are irregular branching cells that secrete strong fibrous proteins and proteoglycans as an extracellular matrix. The cells of this type of tissue are generally separated by quite some distance by a gelatinous substance primarily made up of collagenous and elastic fibers. Usually \\"loose connective tissue\\" is considered a parent category that includes the mucous connective tissue of the fetus, areolar connective tissue, reticular connective tissue, and adipose tissue. Structure =Composition= Schematic representation of the composition of loose connective tissue It is a pliable, mesh-like tissue with a fluid matrix and functions to cushion and protect body organs. Fibroblasts are widely dispersed in this tissue; they are irregular branching cells that secrete strong fibrous proteins and proteoglycans as an extracellular matrix. The cells of this type of tissue are generally connected by a gelatinous substance known as ground substance primarily made up of collagenous and elastic fibers. =Location= It may be found in tissue sections from almost every part of the body. It surrounds blood vessels and nerves and penetrates with them even into the small spaces of muscles, tendons, and other tissues. It may likewise be present in the mediastinal extremities. Nearly every epithelium rests on a layer of areolar tissue, whose blood vessels provide the epithelium with nutrition, waste removal, and a ready supply of infection-fighting leukocytes when needed. Because of the abundance of open, fluid-filled space, leukocytes can move about freely in areolar tissue and can easily find and destroy pathogens. The areolar tissue is found beneath the epidermis layer and is also underneath the epithelial tissue of all the body systems that have external openings. it makes the skin elastic and helps it to withstand pulling pain. It is also a component of the lamina propria of the digestive and respiratory tracts, the mucous membranes of reproductive and urinary systems, the stroma of glands, and the hypodermis of the skin. It is also found in the mesentery which is surrounding the intestine. =Fibers= Loose connective tissue is named based on the \\"weave\\" and type of its constituent fibers. There are three main types: * Collagenous fibers: collagenous fibers are made of collagen and consist of bundles of fibrils that are coils of collagen molecules. * Elastic fibers: elastic fibers are made of elastin and are \\"stretchable.\\" * Reticular fibers: reticular fibers consist of one or more types of very thin collagen fibers. They join connective tissues to other tissues. =Areolar tissue= Areolar tissue ( or ) is a common type of loose connective tissue (and the most widely distributed type of connective tissue in vertebrates). It is so-named because its fibers are far enough apart to leave ample open space for interstitial fluid in between (areolar is Latin for a \\"little open space\\"). It is strong enough to bind different tissue types together, yet soft enough to provide flexibility and cushioning. It exhibits interlacing, loosely organized fibers, abundant blood vessels, and significant empty space filled with interstitial fluid. Many adjacent epithelial tissues (which are avascular) get their nutrients from the interstitial fluid of areolar tissue; the lamina propria is areolar in many body locations. Its fibers run in random directions and are mostly collagenous, but elastic and reticular fibers are also present. Areolar tissue is highly variable in appearance. In many serous membranes, it appears as a loose arrangement of collagenous and elastic fibers, scattered cells of various types; abundant ground substance; numerous blood vessels. In the skin and mucous membranes, it is more compact and sometimes difficult to distinguish from dense irregular connective tissue. Function Areolar connective tissue holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to other underlying tissues. It also serves as a reservoir of water and salts for surrounding tissues. Almost all cells obtain their nutrients from and release their wastes into areolar connective tissue. Clinical significance Organs that are rich in loose connective tissue (such as the eyelids) are usually sites that undergo oedema, indicating kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, periorbital swelling is one characteristic finding in severe kidney disease.

Details  Lala was born in the village of Parol near Jullundur in the Punjab, apparently on 20 April 1876, though some accounts give 20th Feb. 1882. If 1876 is correct, he would have been nearly 40 when he earned the VC in 1916. The son of Dhinga, a 1st Grade zamindar, he was apparently not formally educated but could read and write Hindi and enlisted in the newly raised (1900) 41st Dogra regiment in 1901; he was by all accounts a good sportsman and a football player in his regiment. Before the war, he served with the 41st in their deployment to the China coast between 1904-08. In August 1923, Lala was commissioned as Jemadar, which means that his war record and his career become more easily traceable. \\"War Services\\" in Indian Army Lists show that he served initially in Egypt on the Suez Canal defences and then went with his regiment to France, where he was wounded in action and was one of those Indian casualties who were nursed in the converted Brighton Pavilion, adapted as a hospital for Indian soldiers on the grounds that Indians might feel more at home in the \\"eastern\\" architecture of that exotic building! On recovery, he joined his regiment in Mesopotamia. British and Indian forces (forming Expeditionary Force \\"D\\") had landed in the Persian Gulf as early as November 1914, initially only to secure the oil refineries at the head of the Shatt-al- Arab and around Basra. However, the commanding officer, General Charles Townshend, was drawn into a much larger campaign and, convinced he could take Baghdad, advanced up the Tigris. Defeating the Turks at Qurna, Es Sinn and Nasiriya, he fought the desperate three-day action at Ctesiphon in November 1915 but such were his losses in that pyrrhic victory that he was forced to retreat to Kut -al-Amara and there began the infamous \\"siege of Kut\\", which culminated in April 1916 with one of the most humiliating defeats in British military history - the surrender of the entire garrison, many of whom went on to face horrific conditions as Turkish prisoners of war. While the siege lasted, British and Indian reinforcements on a large scale were dispatched to Mesopotamia and made a series of hard fought but ultimately futile attempts to relieve the besieged garrison. Tens of thousands of casualties were suffered in the repeated attempts to break through a series of well-defended Turkish positions along the Tigris and en route to Kut. In one of these desperate enterprises, Lala was to win the Victoria Cross. The 41st Dogras were part of the force which, along with the 2nd Black Watch, 9th Bhopals, 37th Dogras and 6th Jats, assaulted the Turkish entrenchments near the ruins of Al Orah on the Tigris close to the Hanna defile, 30 miles down-river from Kut. Here, the relief force (reduced to around 10,000 men) encountered 30,000 men of the Ottoman Sixth Army; after a short bombardment on 20–21 January 1916, the 7th Division attacked the Ottoman lines. In an advance across 600 yards of flooded no-man's land and later in pouring rain, the British force was beaten back, sustaining 2,700 casualties. According to their War Diary, only 25 men of the 41st reach the enemy trenches and the regiment came out of action with only 155 officers and men. The strength of the well-prepared Ottoman positions forced the abandonment of the assault and the withdrawal of the relief force to the base at Ali Gharbi. Lance Naik Lala was rewarded with the VC for his action in rescuing a number of wounded men shortly after the assault on 21 January. The citation in the London Gazette reads: ‘For most conspicuous bravery. Finding a British officer of another regiment lying close to the enemy, he dragged him into a temporary shelter, which he himself had made, and in which he had already bandaged four wounded men. After bandaging his wounds, he heard calls from the Adjutant of his own regiment, who was lying in the open severely wounded. The enemy were not more than one hundred yards distant, and it seemed certain death to go out in that direction, but Lance-Naik Lala insisted on going out to his Adjutant, and offered to crawl back with him on his back at once. When this was not permitted, he stripped off his own clothing to keep the wounded officer warmer, and stayed with him till just before dark, when he returned to the shelter. After dark he carried the first wounded officer back to the main trenches, and then, returning with a stretcher, carried back his Adjutant. He set a magnificent example of courage and devotion to his officers’ (London Gazette 13 May 1916). In effect, Lala rescued six men, including his own Adjutant (Lt. A.H.E. Lindop, who regrettably died of his wounds, though not before relating Lala's bravery), but the citation hardly does justice to the awful circumstances surrounding Lala's efforts. Other descriptions offer a more in-depth account, especially emphasising not only the danger from close Turkish fire, but also the terrible weather conditions which prevailed on the day. Edmund Candler, in The Sepoy reports one of Lala's officers relating that: Lala was out all day and most of the night and earned his VC a dozen times. It seemed certain death to go out … with the enemy only a hundred yards off. But he insisted on going out …. There was a freezing wind and the wounded lay in pools of rain and flooded marsh all night; some were drowned, others died of exposure. It was a typically Dogra- like act of Lala to strip himself and to make a shield of his body for his Adjutant … and the Adjutant was only one of five officers and comrades [actually six] whom Lala saved that day.” No less a figure than Major General Sir George Younghusband, who commanded the 7th division, relates the events in greater detail in A Soldier's Memories of Peace and War: A heavy frontal attack was taking place across the dead flat open ground before the Turkish trenches, which were strongly held. On our left, the attack partially succeeded but all along the rest of the line it was held up at distances varying from 100 to 500 yards from the Turks. At this moment Sepoy (now Lance Naik) Lalla (sic) came across a Major in his regiment, 150 yards from the enemy line, lying completely exposed in the open and trying to bandage a grievous wound. Lalla dragged him a few yards into a very slight depression, only a few inches deep, and there bound up the Major's wounds. Whilst doing so, he heard other cries for help and sallying forth dragged four more of his comrades into the meagre shelter and bound up their wounds. Meanwhile, it had come on to rain hard and a pitiless icy wind sprang up. Then Lalla heard another voice calling for help about fifty yards to the front and only a hundred yards from the Turkish trenches. He recognised the voice and said to the Major: “That is my Adjutant Sahib calling. I must go out to help him”. “No, Lalla, it is quite useless”, said the Major; “You will certainly be shot dead and therefore be of no use”. Then, seeing that Lalla was still determined to go, the Major said: I order you not to go; lie down.” Lalla lay still for a while and then again heard the voice from the front calling for help. Lalla jumped up and said “I'll be back in a minute” and dashed off to the Adjutant. This officer, just before he was taken into the operating room in hospital, where he died, dictated his account to a brother officer: “I was shot down in the open about a hundred yards from the enemy and lay in great agony. An officer of the Black Watch, who was lying a few yards off, tried to crawl to my assistance but was instantly shot dead. Every time I made the slightest movement, bullets whistled past me or through me. Then came a Sepoy to my assistance and he was also shot dead. Then it came on to rain and a bitter wind sprang up. Then, as I lay in great pain, suddenly appeared Lalla and lay down beside me with cheering words. First he bound up my wounds and then taking off his own coat spread it over me. He then lay down lengthways so as to protect me from the enemy's bullets. For five hours he lay like this in the wet and cold and all the time kept talking to me cheerfully and encouragingly to keep my spirits up. At length, when it grew dark, he crept off and said he was going back to get assistance and would soon return. I slept or dozed for some time and then heard Lalla's return. “It is good, Sahib, very good. I have brought up some stretcher-bearers not far from here. I will lie flat whilst you get on my back and then I will crawl away with you on my hands and knees.” With great difficulty the Adjutant obeyed these instructions and was borne painfully many hundreds of yards by Lalla to the stretcher bearers. Then Lalla said: “I must return now and fetch the Major and the four Sepoys.” And this he did, and brought them all safely out. And, wonderful to relate, he was not touched by bullet or shell, all day or all night. Next morning he was as hale and cheerful as ever and grinned with great joy when he heard that he was a brave man! The Victoria Cross had only recently been granted to Indian soldiers and perhaps there is no worthier wearer of the badge of honour than Lance Naik Lalla of the Dogras\\". (pp. 334–336) In addition to the VC, which was publicly presented in India in 1924, Lala was also awarded the 1st Class of the Russian Cross of St. George (AO 1065 of 1917) – a unique combination to an Indian soldier – and Mentioned in Dispatches (L.G. 17th Oct. 1916). Lala returned to India in 1917 but saw further action as a Havildar with the 41st Dogras in the Third Afghan War in 1919. He was later awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in the re-numbered 3-17 Dogras, in addition to gaining advancement to officer rank as Jemadar in 1923. He retired after 25 years' service in 1926 and returned to his home in Parol but sad to say did not live long to enjoy an honourable retirement. He contracted polio and died in March 1927; his remains were cremated there shortly afterwards. It is said that his last words were \\"We fought true\\". Nowadays, Lala Ram takes an honoured place amongst India's winners of the Victoria Cross and was named on a memorial plaque recently presented by Great Britain to the Indian Government to commemorate their VC winners. At one stage, a local park was named after him and although it was subsequently re-named there are calls for it to be restored under his name. Sadly, his V.C. group has not fared well.

On 25 July 2016, the ABC broadcast a Four Corners report that disclosed the abuse of youths in the Northern Territory corrections system which triggered the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory. Original facilities 2008 photograph of prison site. The Don Dale Youth Detention Centre was the Northern Territory's first purpose-built institution for young male and female offenders from across the Northern Territory aged from 10 to 16 years. Built in 1991, it was originally located adjacent to Berrimah Prison. The facility replaced Malak House, which had operated as a detention centre since 1987. Don Dale provided medium- to high-level detention, usually in single cells. In the early 2000s all detainees at Don Dale were expected to attend school unless they were involved in vocational programs. Administration The facility is administered by Territory Families, since a departmental reorganisation following the Labor victory at the August 2016 Northern Territory general election. 21st century timeline =2000: Death in Custody= In February 2000, 16-year-old Aboriginal boy named Johnno Johnson Wurramarrba from Groote Eylandt committed suicide at Don Dale. Wurramarrba had been sentenced in January to 28 days detention under the Northern Territory's mandatory sentencing laws for stealing petrol and paint from Angurugu School on Groote Eylandt. A Coronial Inquiry into the circumstances of the death resulted in a number of recommendations being made relating to training of staff and management practices in the centre. In 2011, Xzibit, a US rapper, visited the centre and talked to inmates about his life experiences, following being detained in a juvenile detention centre as a 14-year-old. =2014: Use of tear gas, relocation= In August 2014, six boys were in solitary confinement cells in the Behavioural Management Unit. One boy walked out of an unlocked cell, and beat on a locked reinforced door. The staff declared that there was a \\"riot\\", and released tear gas into the hallway, gassing all six boys. It took up to eight minutes to remove the boys in their cells from the tear gas. A news release to the media falsely asserted that six boys had escaped from their cells, despite CCTV in the hallway showing only one boy in the hallway.http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/07/25/4504895.htm The incident, among others, was investigated by the Northern Territory Children's Commissioner Colleen Gywnne in a report provided in August 2015 to the then Corrections Minister John Elferink. On 4 June 2020, the High Court of Australia found the use of the gas was unlawful.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-03/don-dale-tear-gassing- unlawful-high-court-rules/12315170 Following the tear gas incident, the youths were moved from Malak House to formerly adult Berrimah Prison and Malak House was closed. In September 2014, the prison was renamed Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency remained critical of conditions at the new site. =July 2016: Four Corners program= Use of restraint chairs and cable ties on children was expressly legalised by the Northern Territory Government in May 2016 and were used at facilities in both Darwin and Alice Springs. Graphic footage of repeated child abuse at Don Dale, including the 2014 tear gas incident, was featured in ABC's Four Corners episode \\"Australia's Shame\\", which aired on 25 July 2016. Later in the year the documentary was televised worldwide. Teenage boys were shown being assaulted, stripped naked and tear-gassed. They were being held in isolation up to 72 hours with no running water. The program also showed a 17-year-old boy shackled and hooded in a chair at a facility in Alice Springs. The Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was \\"shocked\\" at the \\"appalling treatment\\" of the detainees, which violates the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, to which Australia is party. Global broadcast of the documentary caused worldwide astonishment about the inadequate actions of the minister. Following national outrage, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory. John Elferink was sacked as Corrections Minister the morning after the program aired. The corrections and justice portfolios were taken on by Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles. Use of restraint chairs and spit hoods were then suspended. On 28 July 2016, it was announced that the 33 youths incarcerated in the centre were to be moved to the Wickham Point Detention Centre, a former immigration detention centre, located around south of Darwin. The Wickham Point Detention Centre has been deemed by the Australian Human Rights Commission to be \\"completely inappropriate for children\\". Within 24 hours the decision to close the centre and relocate the detainees \\"had been scrapped for the time being\\", with Chief Minister Giles saying that the facilities at Don Dale were \\"good enough\\". =August 2016: Royal Commission= The Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory was established on 1 August 2016. While the commission was expected to report by 31 March 2017, the final reporting date was extended three times due to the extent of documentary evidence and witnesses, to 17 November 2017. The report made more than 200 recommendations including the closure of the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. =2017 onwards = In April 2018, the Northern Territory Government announced it would commit to build new youth detention centres in Darwin and Alice Springs as part of a $229.6 million package to overhaul the child protection and youth justice systems and implement the recommendations of the royal commission. By November 2018 the facility was still in use. It was then revealed in Northern Territory Parliament that female detainees were being forced to shower while under video surveillance. On 6 November 2018, a major disturbance broke out at Don Dale. Detainees escaped from their cells by stealing keys and attempted to break out of the facility using power tools. The school room at the facility was burnt and tear gas was used. The detainees were moved from the damaged detention centre to the Darwin watch house. In May 2019 it was reported that every single child in detention in the Northern Territory – 22 boys and 2 girls – was Aboriginal, with 11 of them in Don Dale. Territory Families said it was still \\"not ready\\" to implement some of the key recommendations of the Royal Commission. The age of criminal responsibility had still not been raised to 12, nor the age of detention to 14 years old.

With the passage of the years, this became a formality: the players would replay a game that had already been played, and the shōgun would often be represented by an official, rather than attend himself. The games themselves were, though, bitterly contested, since the castle games had a major effect on the prestige of the four houses. Throughout the Tokugawa shogunate there was an ongoing struggle to take control of the official positions of Meijin and godokoro. Hundreds of game records of the castle games survive; a large collection was edited by Kensaku Segoe. The game series was suspended in 1862 as the political situation became tense.

Biography He was born in Linganore in Frederick County, Maryland, the son of Samuel and Eliza Glisan. He graduated from the University of Maryland medical school in 1849. He practiced medicine for a year in Baltimore and then in 1850 he was appointed assistant surgeon in the United States Army. He served as medical officer in the army for eleven years including five years on the Great Plains followed by six years (1855–1861) in Oregon during the Indian wars. He resigned his commission in 1861 and practiced medicine in San Francisco before moving to Portland, Oregon. In 1863 he married Elizabeth Raynes Couch, a daughter of John H. Couch, one of the founders of Portland. From 1872–1876 he was president of the Multnomah County Medical Society, and was president of Oregon state medical society from 1875–1876.

In China, people named this kind of record \\"qipu\\" (. In Korea, people named this kind of record \\"Gibo\\" (). Go records are traditionally used to record games on a grid diagram, marking the plays on the points by numbers. History The earliest surviving Go game records are collected by the book Wangyou Qingle Ji (), written by Li Yimin () around 1100 AD (Song dynasty). A recording of Wang Jixin's game v. Yushan Laoyu (Ancient China, Tang Dynasty). Expand for a clearer view. Note that the moves are numbered consecutively. The numbering here starts after the first four (unnumbered) moves have been played. A large corpus – many thousands of games – of kifu records from the Edo period has survived. Quite a low proportion was published in book form; strong players used to make their own copies by hand of games to study. This accounts for one feature of the records passed down: they often omit much of the endgame, since for a strong player reconstructing the smaller endgame plays is routine. This explains the survival of some games in different versions, and possible discrepancies in the final margin. The early Western Go players found the method of kifu inconvenient, probably because as chess players they were more familiar with algebraic notation, and because as new players they found it difficult to locate moves. But they quickly discovered the advantages of kifu-style notation—as much as an entire game can be visually displayed in one diagram—and now virtually all Go books and magazines use some modification of the kifu to display games, variations and problems. While a typical piece of chess literature is in algebraic notation punctuated by occasional diagrams, Go literature mostly consists of diagrams with a sequence of plays marked, and prose commentary. The pioneering European player Oskar Korschelt disliked kifus because nineteenth century kifus always used Chinese numerals, which are indeed difficult to read unless one is familiar with them. Numbering in that style continued until 1945, having been popular in the 1930s on the basis of nationalist feeling in Japan. (Hindu-Arabic numerals were also used.) In Japanese Go books, when unoccupied points of the board are mentioned in the commentary, they are usually labelled by hiragana (in iroha order) to this day. Use The playing-through on a Go board of a game record given as a kifu on a single diagram is still a little taxing for a beginner player, because the next move has to be found. An amateur dan player would expect to play through a game of normal length in around 20 minutes. A player of professional level would take ten minutes, and could easily sight-read a professional game from the kifu. Stronger players can locate plays more easily because they often know where the next move is likely to be found. In most games, a small number of plays are at intersections that were previously occupied (this happens, for example, during a ko fight). Annotations by the side of the kifu give this information, usually in the form '57 at 51' or something comparable. Game records are usually completed by information on the players' ranks, the date and competition data, location, winning player and margin of victory. Many of the most important games are now available in machine-readable form, using one of a small number of Go file formats. This has great advantages in terms of ease of playing through games, and lends itself well to database storage and archival. The common opinion is that playing games through on a board (rather than computer monitor) from a printed record is a qualitatively different experience. Other formats =Other notations= There is no other universally-recognised notation comparable to algebraic chess notation for Go. There are several methods in use, including * Using chess-like notation so on a 19x19 board points are a-t ('i' is excluded) for one axis, and 1-19 for the other. * A similar system using Japanese numerals instead of letters. * Using numbers for both axes, e.g. 3-4 is on the third row and fourth column from a corner. * Pierre Audouard devised an elegant system using a letter a, b, c or d to designate the reference corner, plus one or two numbers to indicate the position relative to the corner. An equivalent system was used in ancient Chinese texts. Since the Go board is symmetrical with no particular sides, it makes no difference which corner is used as the reference point from which to count coordinates. =Go file format= Go file formats are used to record the moves in a game of Go or for demonstrations, game reviews, and tsumego (Go problems). The most popular file format is SGF. Many Go programs can read, edit, and write this format. Kifus are not written in a file format for computers but are a written or printed diagrammatic record of a game.

Upsala was founded in 1893 in Brooklyn, in New York City, and moved to Kenilworth, and finally to East Orange in 1924. In the 1970s, Upsala considered moving to Wantage Township in rural Sussex County (where it opened a satellite campus) as East Orange's crime problem magnified and social conditions deteriorated. However, college administration and trustees chose to remain committed to East Orange. Declining enrollment and financial difficulties forced the school to close in 1995. History =Early history (1893–1924)= In its early years, Upsala College was invited to build its campus in Kenilworth, New Jersey (seen here, circa 1906) where it operated for 25 years before moving to East Orange in 1924. Upsala College was founded at the 1893 annual meeting of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America, known as the Augustana Synod—a Lutheran church body with roots in the Swedish immigrant community.Arden, G. Everett. Half a Million Swedes from Bonderud, Omar and Lutz, Charles. America's Lutherans (series). (Columbus Ohio: Wartburg Press, 1958).Johnston, Lawrence Albert. The Augustana Synod : a brief review of its history, 1860-1910. (Rock Island, Illinois: Augustana Book Concern, 1910). The Augustana Synod placed an emphasis on mission, ecumenism, and social service. Meeting at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, the polity decided to open the college in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1893. The Synod chose a young minister, the Rev. Lars Herman Beck (1859–1935), as the college's first president. Beck, a Swedish immigrant to the United States, had received his Ph.D. from Yale University in the previous year and turned down a teaching position at Yale to assume the post at Upsala.\\"Series I Presidential Papers\\" in the \\"Upsala College records, 1893-1995\\" held in the collection of the Swenson Swedish Immigration Research Center, Augustana College (Rock Island, Illinois). Retrieved August 16, 2013. The name Upsala was chosen to honor both the historic Uppsala University in Sweden and the Meeting of Uppsala. That 1593 meeting—exactly 300 years before the founding of Upsala College—firmly established Lutheran Orthodoxy in Sweden after the attempts by King John III to reintroduce Roman Catholic liturgy.\\"N.F.\\" \\"Upsala, The Diet of\\" (article) in Jacobs, Henry Eyster Jacobs, and Haas, John Augustus William (Rev.). The Lutheran Cyclopedia. (New York: Charles Scribner Sons, 1899), 528-529. On October 3, 1893, Upsala College opened in the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem Church in Brooklyn. The first day, Beck began instruction with 16 students.Calman, Alvin R. Upsala College: The Early Years (New York: Vantage Press, 1983). By the end of the year, Upsala had 75 students. Early instruction had been in Swedish as the student body largely consisted of Scandinavian immigrants. In 1897, the college moved to Kenilworth, New Jersey (formerly \\"New Orange, New Jersey\\") when the \\"New Orange Industrial Association\\" offered the young school fourteen acres of land. Upsala erected its first building on the Kenilworth campus in 1899. The college granted its first Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in 1905 to four students. By 1910, Upsala offered Bachelor of Arts in modern and classical languages, and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Mathematics and Sciences, while offering a three-year college preparatory program, instruction in music for preparing \\"teachers of music, organist and choir leaders, and in general to afford its students a musical education\\", instruction in commerce and business to \\"train young men and women for a business career\\" and in stenography for students seeking \\"to fill positions as stenographers and private secretaries.\\" While the college was identified by its connexion with the Swedish Lutheran community, Upsala was the first college in New Jersey to admit women, and it student body welcomed students from many other nationalities and religions. In 1908, the student body consisted of \\"79 Swedes, 2 Finns, 1 Jew, 1 'American', 1 Chinese, 1 Korean, and 1 Persian\\" =East Orange campus (1924–1995)= The college moved to East Orange in 1924 after purchasing a 45-acre site in the city in the previous year. After the passage of Title IX, Audrey Donnelly became the school's Women's Tennis Coach. In 1989, Upsala hosted the National Forensics Association national collegiate speech championship, which featured over 1,100 competitors over five days of competition. However, the surrounding community's crime rate increased, and student enrollment declined throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. Upsala's men basketball team made it to the 1980 NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship, losing to North Park University, 83 to 76. =Wirths Campus in Wantage (1978–1992)= During the tenure of Upsala's sixth president, Rodney O. Felder, Upsala sought to expand and acquired a tract of land in rural Wantage Township in Sussex County in northwestern New Jersey for the construction of a second campus which was called the \\"Wirths Campus.\\" In 1978, the land a large family farm had been donated by Wallace \\"Wally\\" Wirths (1921–2002), a former Westinghouse Corporation executive, author, local newspaper columnist and radio commentator.Augustana College (Rock Island, Illinois) Swenson Center Archives: Wirths Campus in Sussex County records - Series XIV, Boxes 1-6, folders 1-55. Retrieved May 22, 2013. Upsala did not erect any academic buildings on the property, and in these formative years held classes in existing buildings. A few graduates studied at the campus until 1992 when classes ceased and the trustees chose to remain committed to East Orange.Strunksy, Steve. \\"IN BRIEF; Dream of a College Tinged With Sadness\\", The New York Times, August 2, 1998. (Retrieved July 10, 2012). But when the school closed down in 1995 and the school's assets were dissolved, the Wirths family bought back their farm in Wantage from the college for $75,000. =Decline and closing= Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Upsala suffered from severe financial problems and a declining enrollment.Rothstein, Mervyn. \\"IN BRIEF: Against Odds, Revival For Troubled College\\", The New York Times, September 21, 1992. (Retrieved July 10, 2012). The financial issues were exacerbated by students unable to pay tuition. The demographics of East Orange had changed in the aftermath of the Newark riots in the 1960s, and Upsala began to enroll larger numbers of minority students—a move thought to have upset the older Caucasian alumni and donors. East Orange's tax base and socio-economic conditions continued to deteriorate with an increase in crime statistics which made the college an unattractive setting for prospective students. By the early 1990s, the student body had decreased from approximately 1,500 to 435 when the school closed in 1995.\\"IN BRIEF: The Doors Are Closed At Upsala College\\", The New York Times, June 4, 1995. (Retrieved July 10, 2012). The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools announced that as a result of the decline in academic standards and the school's ongoing financial problems, it would not be renewing Upsala College's accreditation. On May 1, 1995, the college's board of trustees voted to close the school when its accreditation expired on May 31, 1995. The school closed with approximately US$12,500,000 in debt.

Several of the college buildings (including Beck Hall, Puder Hall, Viking Memorial Hall (gymnasium) and College Center) were incorporated into the new public secondary school, East Orange Campus High School. During this time, the west campus deteriorated and became blighted and its buildings were looted, vandalized and one building lost to arson.Walker, Steven. \\"East Orange fire officials blame arson for loss of old Upsala College building\\" in The Star- Ledger (March 31, 1998).

O'Bannon wrote the screenplay for Alien, adapted from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett. He also wrote and directed the horror comedy The Return of the Living Dead. He contributed computer animation to Star Wars and worked on cult classics such as Dark Star, Heavy Metal, and Total Recall. Early life O'Bannon was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Bertha (née Lowenthal) and Thomas Sidney O'Bannon, a carpenter. He attended the art school of Washington University in St. Louis, where he did stand-up comedy routines, did make-up for campus theater productions, and provided illustrations for Student Life, the student newspaper. While there he roomed with future movie producer Michael Shamberg. O'Bannon moved home briefly after Washington University and attended Florissant Valley Junior College where he wrote and directed a short science fiction satire titled \\"The Attack of the 50-foot Chicken.\\" O'Bannon also attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois. According to O'Bannon, he was reading an issue of Playboy when he found an article discussing the best film schools, which led him to apply to the University of Southern California (USC). Before applying, O'Bannon was pursuing a psychology degree. It was at USC that he met John Carpenter and collaborated with him on the science fiction student film Dark Star (1974). Career =Early work= Carpenter expanded the Dark Star short into a feature which was released in 1974 with a final budget of only US$60,000. O'Bannon served in a number of capacities, including scripting, editing and acting in one of the leading roles (\\"Pinback\\"). In 1975, Dark Star won the Golden Scroll award (the Saturn Awards' original name) for Best Special Effects. O'Bannon, growing up a science-fiction and horror enthusiast, abandoned technical work (including a stint as a computer animator on George Lucas' classic Star Wars) for screenwriting. =1970s= O'Bannon attended USC Film School and lived near the Los Angeles Campus in an old two-story house affectionately called the \\"Menlo Manor\\" which he shared with other USC students (Don Jakoby, who collaborated on several screenplays with Dan including Blue Thunder; and Jeffrey J. Lee, who became a well-known artist in Europe). Part of his student film Dark Star was filmed there, with O'Bannon co-starring as Sgt. Pinback. He spent many late nights in old Hollywood editing his and other student films. His wish was to become a director. Dark Star was edited by O'Bannon using a 1940s Moviola. He was attached to supervise special effects for an Alejandro Jodorowsky production of Frank Herbert's Dune, but this fell apart in 1975 and the movie was never made as the major Hollywood studios were wary of financing the picture with Jodorowsky as director. O'Bannon's role is prominently featured in the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune. The collapse of Dune left O'Bannon broke, homeless, and dependent on friends for his survival. While living with his friend Ronald Shusett, they came up with the story for O'Bannon's career-making film Alien (1979), for which he wrote the screenplay and supervised visuals. =1980s= In 1981, O'Bannon helped create the animated feature Heavy Metal, writing two of its segments (\\"Soft Landing\\" and \\"B-17\\"). O'Bannon voiced his displeasure with his next big-budget outing, John Badham's Blue Thunder (1983), an action film about a Los Angeles helicopter surveillance team. Originally written with Don Jakoby, Blue Thunder also underwent extensive rewriting, losing some of its political content. He and Jakoby also scripted Lifeforce (1985), a movie based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires and directed by Tobe Hooper that veers from alien visitation to vampirism and an apocalyptic ending. It was not well received at the time, and was considered a box office flop. O'Bannon would again collaborate with Jakoby and Hooper for the 1986 remake Invaders from Mars. Purists considered it inferior to the 1950s original and it also performed poorly at the box office. O'Bannon also worked as a consultant for C.H.U.D., helping to create the design concept for the title creatures. In 1985, O'Bannon moved into the director's chair with The Return of the Living Dead. Like Alien, the film met with success, spawned numerous sequels, and became a cult classic. That year, he was awarded the Inkpot Award.Inkpot Award =1990s= In 1990, O'Bannon and Shusett re-teamed to make Total Recall, an adaptation of the short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" by Philip K. Dick. This was a project the two had been working on since collaborating on Alien. The film earned well over US$100 million. An earlier screenplay by the duo titled Hemoglobin was also produced as the low budget feature Bleeders (1997). O'Bannon's second directorial feature, The Resurrected (1991), was a low-budget horror effort released direct-to-video. Based on the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, it focused on a family's ancient rituals that awaken the dead. In 1995, O'Bannon received a co-writing credit for the sci-fi film Screamers adapted from the Philip K. Dick story \\"Second Variety\\", having written the initial version of the screenplay with Michael Campus in the early 1980s. =2000s= In 2001, O'Bannon was the filmmaker-in-residence at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. =Posthumous= In 2013, Dan O'Bannon's Guide to Screenplay Structure was released, co-written with Matt R. Lohr. Personal life and death He and his wife Diane had a son, Adam. O'Bannon died from complications of Crohn's disease in Los Angeles on December 17, 2009. O'Bannon credited his experiences with Crohn's for inspiring the chest-bursting scene from Alien.

Conquest The medieval kingdoms of Wales Through most of its history before the Anglo-Norman Conquest, Wales was divided into several kingdoms. From time to time, rulers such as Hywel Dda, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and Rhodri the Great managed to unify many of the kingdoms, but their lands were divided on their deaths. Incursions from the English and Normans also amplified divisions between the kingdoms. In the 12th century, Norman king Henry II of England exploited differences between the three most powerful Welsh kingdoms, Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth, allowing him to make great gains in Wales. He defeated and then allied with Madog ap Maredudd of Powys in 1157, and used this alliance to overwhelm Owain Gwynedd. He then turned on Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, who finally submitted to him in 1171, effectively subjugating much of Wales to Henry's Angevin Empire. By 1282, only Gwynedd, whose ruler was accorded the title Prince of Wales, remained independent. With the defeat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd by Edward I Wales lost its last independent kingdom and became subject to the English crown, either directly or indirectly. It retained some vestiges of distinction from its neighbour, however, including the Welsh language, law, and culture. Until the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth in 1485, the Welsh on many occasions revolted against English rule in an attempt to gain their independence. The greatest such revolt was that of Owain Glyndŵr, who gained popular support in 1400, and defeated an English force at Plynlimon in 1401. In response, the English parliament passed repressive measures that included denying the Welsh the right of assembly. Glyndŵr was proclaimed Prince of Wales, and sought assistance from Charles VI of France, but by 1409 his forces were scattered under the attacks of King Henry IV of England and further repressive measures imposed on the Welsh. Glyndŵr himself vanished, and his final resting place remains a mystery. Occupation Throughout the period of conquest the Welsh poets kept alive the dream of independence. In what was known as the canu brud (prophetic poetry), the idea was set out of the coming of a messiah-like figure, known as Y Mab Darogan (The Son of Destiny), who would not only remove the English yoke but win back the whole of Great Britain for the Britons (i.e. the Welsh). During the reign of Henry VIII the Laws in Wales Acts were passed without any democratic mandate, annexing Wales into the English legal system. The repressive measures against the Welsh that had been in place since the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr over a century earlier were removed. These Acts also gave political representation for Wales in the Westminster Parliament. Wales continues to share a legal identity with England to a large degree as part of a joint entity incorrectly known simply as England until 1967 and England and Wales since then. The laws also finished the partitioning of Wales into counties that was begun in 1282 and established local government on the English model. The laws had the effect of making English the language to be used for all official purposes, thus effectively excluding non-English speakers from formal office. On the whole those Welsh people who had a way of expressing an opinion welcomed these moves and saw them as further proof that Henry VII and his descendants were the long-awaited sons of destiny and that Wales had regained what it had lost at the conquest of 1282. Patriotism, or a non-politicised form of nationalism, remained a strong force in Wales, with pride in its language, customs and history common amongst all levels of society. Revolutionary ideas Along with the rest of Europe the effects of the French Revolution were felt in Wales. It brought to the forefront a small minority of Welsh people who sympathised with revolutionary ideas: people such as Richard Price (1723–1791), Iolo Morganwg (1747–1826), and Morgan John Rhys (1760–1804). In the meantime, counter- revolutionary ideas flourished amongst the leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival, but the consequence of turning Wales into a nation with a nonconformist majority was to create a new sense of Welshness. 19th century The rapid industrialisation of parts of Wales, especially Merthyr Tydfil and adjoining areas, gave rise to strong and radical Welsh working class movements which led to the Merthyr Rising of 1831, the widespread support for Chartism, and the Newport Rising of 1839.D. J. V. Jones, \\"The Merthyr riots of 1831.\\" Welsh History Review= Cylchgrawn Hanes Cymru 3#2 (1966): 173. With the establishment of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, nonconformism triumphed in Wales, and gradually the previous majority of conservative voices within the church allied themselves with the more radical and liberal voices within the older dissenting churches of the Baptists and Congregationalists. This radicalism was exemplified by the Congregationalist minister David Rees of Llanelli, who edited the radical magazine Y Diwygiwr (The Reformer) from 1835 until 1865. But he was not a lone voice: William Rees (also known as Gwilym Hiraethog) established the radical Yr Amserau (The Times) in 1843, and in the same year Samuel Roberts also established another radical magazine, Y Cronicl (The Chronicle). Both were Congregationalist pastors.Richard Carwardine, \\"The Welsh Evangelical Community and ‘Finney's Revival’.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 29#4 (1978): 463–480. The growth of radicalism and the gradual politicisation of Welsh life did not include any successful attempt to establish a separate political vehicle for promoting Welsh nationalism. On the contrary Welsh nationalism weakened under the economic pressure as the coal industry of South Wales increasingly was integrated with English industry. On the whole nationalism was the preserve of antiquarians, not political activists.Kenneth O. Morgan, Rebirth of a nation: Wales, 1880–1980 (1981). p 4 But voices did appear within the Liberal Party, which made great gains in Wales in the 19th century with the extension of the franchise and the tacit support of Welsh nonconformity. An intended independence movement established on the pattern of Young Ireland, Cymru Fydd, was established in 1886 but was short-lived. For the majority in Wales, however, the important question was not one of independence or self- government, but of the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales. Nevertheless, their non-political nationalism was strong enough to establish national institutions such as the University of Wales in 1893, and the National Library of Wales and the National Museum of Wales in 1907. Treachery of the Blue Books Welsh nationalists were outraged by the \\"Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales\\" in 1847. The reports had blue covers, and were ridiculed as Brad y Llyfrau Gleision, or in English, \\"The Treachery of the Blue Books\\". They found the education system in Wales to be in a dreadful state; they condemned the Welsh language and Nonconformist religion. Ralph Lingen was responsible for the Blue Books of 1846. By contrast the Reverend Henry Longueville Jones, Her Majesty's Inspector of church schools in Wales between 1848 and 1865, led the opposition to subordination to the education department under Lingen. Jones's reports supported bilingual education and praised the work of many church elementary schools. They came under attack in Whitehall. Jones failed to gain full support in Wales because of his Anglicanism and his criticisms of many certified teachers.H.G. Williams, \\"Longueville Jones, Ralph Lingen and inspectors’ reports: a tragedy of Welsh education.\\" History of Education 25#1 (1996): 19–36. onlineGareth Elwyn Jones, \\"Education and nationhood in Wales: An historiographical analysis.\\" Journal of educational administration and history 38.3 (2006): 263–277. online Influence of European nationalism Two 19th-century figures are associated with the beginnings of Welsh nationalism in the specific political sense: Michael D. Jones (1822–1898) and Emrys ap Iwan (1848–1906). Inspired by the Revolutions of 1848 and the growth of Irish nationalism they saw that Wales was different from England in having its own language which the majority of its residents spoke and in holding to a nonconformist form of the Christian religion which faced many disabilities in the face of the state church. 20th century The Senedd building, home to the Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament Nationalism grew as an influence in 20th- century Wales. At various times both the Labour Party and the Liberal Party took up the cause of Welsh home rule, or devolution. But it was with the establishment of Plaid Cymru (The Party of Wales) in August 1925 (by David John Williams, Fred Jones, Saunders Lewis, Moses Gruffydd, H. R. Jones and Lewis Valentine) that Welsh independence from the UK was first advocated. The Labour Party dominated politics in 1920s; it suffered a sharp setback in 1931, but maintained its hold on Wales. The leftists such as Aneurin Bevan who dominated the Party in Wales rejected nationalism as a backward reactionary movement that was more favorable to capitalism and not to socialism. Instead they wanted a strong government in London to reshape the entire state economy.Martin Pugh, Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party (2010) pp 223–24. The election of a Labour Government in 1997 included a commitment to hold a referendum on the establishment of a National Assembly for Wales. The referendum was narrowly won, with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and much of Welsh civic society supporting the Labour Government's proposals. 21st century A 2007 survey by BBC Wales Newsnight found that 20% of Welsh people surveyed favoured Wales becoming independent of the United Kingdom. In 2009 the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, renewed his call for the National Assembly to be granted full law-making powers, calling for a \\"greater degree of self-determination\\" for Wales. A YouGov poll taken in September 2015 suggested that 17% of Welsh people would vote for independence. Another poll by Face for Business suggests support could be as high as 28%. These are in stark contrast to the last two polls conducted by icm for the BBC which said support is as low as 5% and 3% respectively. The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum saw the voters in Wales choosing the \\"Leave\\" option by 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent.Ellie Mae O'Hagan, \\"Wales voted for Brexit because it has been ignored by Westminster for too long\\" Independent 25 June 2016 A Welsh Political Barometer poll, conducted for ITV- Cymru Wales and Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre from 30 June to 4 July 2016, showed support for Welsh independence had increased following the Brexit vote. Responding to the question “And please imagine a scenario where the rest of the UK left the European Union but Wales could remain a member of the European Union if it became an independent country. If a referendum was then held in Wales about becoming an independent country and this was the question, how would you vote? Should Wales be an independent country?” the results were: Yes: 28%, No: 53% Would Not Vote/Don't Know: 20%. Removing non- committed voters, 35% of those polled would vote for independence. =Plaid Cymru= Plaid Cymru was founded in the 1925. Its first Member of Parliament, Gwynfor Evans, was elected in the 1966 Carmarthen by-election, and today has four such representatives, along with eleven members of the Senedd. Historically, support for the party is concentrated in rural Welsh-speaking areas of north and west Wales, where most of its MPs have been elected. In the late 1960s and 1990s the party enjoyed surges in support; in the 2010s however it has declined dramatically. =Active nationalist parties and movements= * Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society). Established in 1962 by members of Plaid Cymru, it is a pressure group campaigning for Welsh language rights. It uses non-violent direct action in its campaigning, and sees itself as part of the global resistance movement. * Cymru Sovereign (also sometimes referred to as Sovereign Wales). A Welsh nationalist political party established in March 2016 that seeks Welsh independence from the United Kingdom and Welsh independence outside of the European Union (EU). The party also seeks the creation of a publicly owned Central Bank of Wales and the debt free creation of a Welsh pound currency.Cymru Sovereign (official website). Retrieved 13 June 2018.The Eletoral Commission - Cymru Sovereign. Retrieved 13 June 2018. * Llais Gwynedd ('). A regionalist party established due to dissatisfaction with Plaid Cymru in Gwynedd. It currently holds six seats on Gwynedd's local council. * Welsh National Party. Established in 2020 by an ex member of Plaid Cymru. Defunct nationalist parties and movements * Cymru Goch (\\"Red Wales\\" or \\"Welsh Socialists\\"). Cymru Goch was founded in 1987 to fight for a free and socialist Wales. It published the monthly magazine Y Faner Goch (The Red Flag). In 2003, it became part of Forward Wales, which later dissolved in 2010. * Cymuned (Community). A pressure group that campaigned for Welsh language rights established in 2001, it mainly concentrated its efforts in the western parts of Wales where Welsh is the main community language. It also saw itself as part of global movements for the rights of indigenous peoples. * Cymdeithas Cyfamod y Cymry Rhydd (Society of the Covenant of the Free Welsh). Established in 1987, again because of unhappiness with the level of Plaid Cymru's commitment to independence. They achieved publicity by producing their own Welsh \\"passports\\". * Mudiad Adfer (Restoration Movement) was a splinter group of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg in the 1970s. Taking its Welsh-only philosophy from the works and teachings of Owain Owain and Emyr Llewelyn, it believed in the creation of \\"Y Fro Gymraeg\\" – a monoglot region based on the existing Welsh language heartlands in the west of Wales. Adfer slowly disappeared from the scene in the late 1980s. * Mudiad Rhyddhad Cymru (\\"Cymru Liberation Movement\\"): A meeting took place in Flintshire on 10 January 2004 between representatives of Balchder Cymru (Wales Pride), Cymru 1400, Medi 16 (September 16), and the RDM. It was agreed at the meeting that all four organisations should amalgamate to form a stronger nationalist/republican movement. They believed that such a move would strengthen the struggle for an independent Welsh republic. The new movement has been named 'Mudiad Rhyddhad Cymru' (MRC). It aimed to campaign for an independent Welsh republic and to defend Cymru, its language and culture. * Plaid Glyndŵr (\\"Party of [Owain] Glyndŵr\\"). Founded by Dennis Morris in 2012, the party campaigned for full independence for Wales and against colonialism in Wales. Militant nationalism Though mainstream nationalism in Wales has been constitutional, there have been violent movements associated with it. In 1952 a small republican movement, Y Gweriniaethwyr (\\"The Republicans\\"), were the first to use violence when they made an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a pipeline leading from the Claerwen dam in mid Wales to Birmingham. In the 1960s two movements were established in protest against the drowning of the Tryweryn valley and the 1969 investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales: Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (\\"Movement for the Defence of Wales\\", also known as MAC) and the Free Wales Army (also known as FWA, in Welsh Byddin Rhyddid Cymru). MAC were responsible for numerous bombing attacks on water pipelines and power lines across Wales. On the eve of the investiture two alleged members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, died when the bomb they were planting outside a Social Security Office in Abergele exploded. The late 1970s and the 1980s saw an organisation calling itself Meibion Glyndŵr (\\"sons of Glyndŵr\\") responsible for a spate of arson attacks against holiday homes throughout Wales. In the 1970s, a Welsh Socialist Republican Army arose, whose initials in Welsh spelt out the English word \\"DAWN\\": the Welsh Army for the Welsh Republic (WAWR).see: Williams, Gwyn A.

It is the only species in the monospecific genus Centrarchus. A Second World War United States Navy submarine was named the USS Flier after this fish. Description The flier is a small, strongly compressed species of sunfish which has a moderately sized, oblique mouth. The dorsal fin has 11-13 spines and 12-14 soft rays while the anal fin has 7-8 spines and 13-15 soft rays. It has a lateral line and the scales are ctenoid. The flanks have a scattering of dark spots, the underside is pale, and the upperparts are olive in color. There is a vertical dark line through the eye which continues below the eye in what has been described as a \\"teardrop\\". Fish of a standard length less than around have an obvious dark eyespot, or ocellus, which has a reddish margin on the soft part of the dorsal fin. The pectoral and pelvic fins are dusky with paler reticulations. The maximum total length recorded is but they are more commonly around and the maximum published weight is 1.35 pounds. Distribution The flier is found in the southern part of the United States along the Atlantic seaboard from the Potomac River drainage in Maryland, where it was most likely introduced to central Florida. It is then found along the Gulf of Mexico drainages as far west as the Trinity River, Texas, and then north in Mississippi River system to above the fall line in southern Illinois and southern Indiana. Habitat and biology The flier is found in clear, acidic waters including ponds in swamps, sloughs, oxbows, slow-flowing creeks and steams. These habitats should be heavily vegetated and have an average water temperature of . They feed largely on invertebrates including insects, snails, worms and leeches although they will also eat smaller fishes and some phytoplankton. Breeding normally occurs March to May when the water temperature reaches but it has been recorded as early as February. The gravid females have been collected from a variety of habitat including debris filled ditches with soft bottoms as well as gravel bottomed streams and heavily vegetated sand and gravel pits. They will spawn in a variety of water conditions ranging from free-flowing clear or turbid water through stagnant water in ditches and pools. Fliers creat nests in rocks or gravel and surround their eggs with a round adhesive egg envelope. They are colonial nesters, nesting in aggregations with the nests quite closely spaced. Sexula maturity is attained at one year old and when thy are long. The male parent guards the eggs and newly hatched fry. If they are frightened or alarmed, these fish will look for shelter among aquatic vegetation, submerged tree roots or mats of floating vegetation. Taxonomy and etymology The flier was first formally described by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1756-1825) in 1801 as Labrus macropterus with the type locality given as South Carolina. In 1829 Georges Cuvier placed it in the genus Centrarchus. The genus Centrarchus is the sister taxon to the Archoplites and in turn these two are sister to Pomoxis. The generic name is a compound of the Greek kentron meaning \\"sting\\" and archos meaning \\"anus\\", a reference to the long spin in the anal fin. The specific name macropterus is also Greek and means \\"long fin\\". Cultural references A Gato-class submarine, USS Flier, built in 1943, was named for this species.

During the 1980s, he was a leader of the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (the forerunner of the Amhara National Democratic Movement), one of the groups that fought against Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in the Ethiopian Civil War. Biography Tamrat Layne was born in 1955 and raised by a single mother in Addis Ababa. He led the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement during the 1980s, fighting against Mengistu Haile Mariam in the Ethiopian Civil War. In an interview in 1988, he acknowledged that the goals of his movement were similar to that of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, such as its approach to national self- determination and foreign affairs. A self-proclaimed atheist, he believed that \\"freedom comes out of the barrel of the gun.\\" When Mengistu was overthrown in 1991, Tamrat Layne became one of the three-man EPRDF-TPLF junta ruling the country and then in the democratically elected government, the other members being Meles Zenawi (President) and Siye Abraha (Minister of Defence). His position was Prime Minister of the Transitional Government, in which capacity he served from 6 June 1991 until 22 August 1995, when President Meles Zenawi succeeded him as Prime Minister. While in power, he realized that his communist-socialist ideology was mistaken. He staffed important government posts with friends. Tamrat became deputy prime minister until October 1996. On 16 March 2000 the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia sentenced Tamrat to 18 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of corruption and embezzlement charges. He was accused of being involved in an illegal 16 million-dollar deal with a business to export Ethiopian textiles and 1,000 tons of state-owned coffee through a fake company. He claimed to be innocent of all charges against him. Kept in solitary confinement, he studied Buddhism, Islam, and eventually Christianity after a nurse slipped him Christian literature. He reported that while in prison, over the course of three consecutive nights he encountered a figure that he identified as Jesus Christ. After serving 12 years of his 18-year sentence, Tamrat was released from prison in December 2008 when the country began to learn of his innocence and of the corruption of the government that falsely accused him.

W. Norton & Company in 1994. A substantially revised second edition in 2012 removed some poets and added many others, incorporating additional American poetry movements which came to prominence in the 21st century. The introduction identifies the use of postmodern with its early mention by Charles Olson, and identifies the field chosen as experimental poetry from after 1945. The book contains, besides poems, about 20 short essays on poetics. The first edition joined two other collections which appeared at that time: From the Other Side of the Century: \\"A New American Poetry, 1960-1990\\" (1994; edited by Douglas Messerli) and American Poetry Since 1950 (1993; edited by Eliot Weinberger). The anthology, the goal of which is to \\"fully represent the movements of American avant-garde poetry\\", includes representatives from the Beat and New York School poets, the Projectivists, \\"deep image\\" poets, language and performance poetry, and various experimentalists.

He is best known for his work of halakha, the legal code Sefer Ha-halachot, considered the first fundamental work in halakhic literature. His name \\"Alfasi\\" means \\"of Fez\\" in Arabic, but opinions differ as to whether he ever lived in Fez. Biography He was born in Qalaat Hammad, which is understood by most historians of the past 100 years to be Qalaat Beni Hammad in modern-day Algeria, capital city of the Hammadid rulers of central Maghreb.Leonard Levy, R. Yitzhaq Alfasi's application of principles of adjudication in Halakhot Rabbati, footnotes 11-27 However, older sources believe Qalaat Hammad refers to a village near Fez.Alfasi, jewishencyclopedia.com In the former case, Alfasi's name would indicate that his family had ancestry in Fez, an idea which is supported by the frequent reference to him as \\"ben Alfasi\\" or \\"ibn Alfasi\\" by the authorities closest to him in time and place. He studied in Kairouan, Tunisia under Rabbeinu Nissim ben Jacob, and Rabbeinu Chananel ben Chushiel the recognized rabbinical authorities of the age. Rabbeinu Chananel trained Alfasi to deduce and to clarify the Halakha from Talmudic sources, and Alfasi then conceived of the idea of compiling a comprehensive work that would present all of the practical conclusions of the Gemara in a clear, definitive manner. To achieve this goal, he worked for ten consecutive years in his father-in-law's attic. In 1045, Alfasi moved to Fez with his wife and two children.https://dbs.bh.org.il/luminary/alfasi-isaac-ben-jacob (However, Binyamin Ze'ev Benedict and other recent scholars argue that Alfasi was never active in Fez.) Fes' Jewish community undertook to support him and his family so that he could work on his Sefer Ha-halachot undisturbed. They also founded a yeshiva in his honor, and many students throughout Morocco came to study under his guidance. The most famous of his many students is Rabbi Judah Halevi, author of the Kuzari; he also taught Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash (the Ri Migash), who was in turn a teacher of Rabbi Maimon, father and teacher of Maimonides (Rambam). Alfasi remained in Fes for 40 years, during which time he completed his Sefer Ha-halachot. In 1088, aged seventy-five, two informers denounced him to the government upon some unknown charge. He left Fes for Al- Andalus, eventually becoming head of the yeshiva in Lucena in 1089. His \\"magnanimous character\\" is illustrated by two incidents. When his opponent Rabbeinu Isaac Albalia died, Alfasi adopted Albalia's son.http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112370/jewish/Rabbi- Yitzchak-Ben-Baruch-Albalia.htm When Alfasi was himself on the point of death, he recommended as his successor in the Lucena rabbinate, not his own son, but his pupil Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash. Sefer haHalachot Sefer ha-Halachot (ספר ההלכות), also known as Hilchot haRif or Hilchot Rav Alfas (Hebrew: הלכות רב אלפס), was Alfasi's main work, written in Fez. It extracts all the pertinent legal decisions from the three Talmudic orders Moed, Nashim and Nezikin as well as the tractates of Berachot and Chulin - 24 tractates in all. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberations; he also excludes all Aggadic (non-legal, homiletic) matter as well as discussion of the halakha practicable only in Land of Israel. Generally the work follows the ordering of the Talmud, but sometimes Talmudic excerpts are moved from place to place, and very rarely non-Talmudic texts are incorporated into the work.Michael J. Broyde and Shlomo C. Pill, Building the Set Table: An Introduction to the Jurisprudence of Rabbi Yehiel Mikhel Epstein’s Arukh ha-Shulhan in Contrast to the Mishnah Berurah =Impact= Maimonides wrote that Alfasi's work \\"has superseded all the geonic codes…for it contains all the decisions and laws which we need in our day…\\". Sefer ha-Halachot plays a fundamental role in the development of Halakha. Firstly, \\"the Rif\\" succeeded in producing a Digest, which became the object of close study, and led in its turn to the great Codes of Maimonides and of Rabbi Joseph Karo. Secondly, it served as one of the \\"Three Pillars of Halakha\\", as an authority underpinning both the Arba'ah Turim and the Shulkhan Arukh. Rabbi Nissim of Gerona (the RaN) compiled a detailed and explicit commentary on this work; In yeshivot \\"the Rif and the RaN\\" are regularly studied as part of the daily Talmudic schedule. This work was published prior to the times of Rashi and other commentaries, and resulted in a profound change in the study practices of the scholarly Jewish public in that it opened the world of the gemara to the public at large. It soon became known as the Talmud Katan (\\"Little Talmud\\"). At the close of the Middle Ages, when the Talmud was banned in Italy, Alfasi's code was exempted so that from the 16th to the 19th centuries his work was the primary subject of study of the Italian Jewish community. Alfasi also occupies an important place in the development of the Sephardi method of studying the Talmud. In contradistinction to the Ashkenazi approach, the Sephardim sought to simplify the Talmud and free it from casuistical detail; see for example Chananel Ben Chushiel. Other works Alfasi also left many responsa. These were originally written in Arabic, and were soon translated into Hebrew as \\"She'elot u-Teshuvot ha-Rif\\".

University dropout Frank Vitkovic entered the building on the pretext of visiting a friend, and fired on office workers at random with an illegally modified M1 carbine, killing eight and injuring five. After being disarmed, he crawled from an 11th-floor window and died on impact. Several possible motives were suggested. He had once received counselling. He had failed to build relationships with girls. His tennis-playing success had been interrupted by a serious knee injury. And the results of a Scientology test revealed that he \\"had hit rock bottom\\", which may have worsened his depression. Event =Background= Vitkovic was born on 7 September 1965 to a Croatian father and an Italian mother.Mackay, Ian (10 December 1987). \\"The riddle of a 'top bloke' turned killer\\". The Age. p. 1. Along with an older sister, he grew up in the Melbourne suburb of West Preston. He attended Redden Catholic College (formerly Immaculate Heart College, Preston, later renamed Samaritan Catholic College) in Preston. He was also a keen tennis player, winning a number of local club competitions, though his success was cut short by an ongoing knee injury. He started a law degree at Melbourne University in 1984 but, due to poor grades, had voluntarily discontinued that course in early 1987.Mackay, Ian (10 December 1987). \\"The riddle of a 'top bloke' turned killer\\". The Age. p. 4. =Shooting= On 8 December 1987 at around 4:20 p.m., Vitkovic entered the building at 191 Queen Street, Melbourne, carrying a sawn-off M1 carbine in a brown paper bag. Vitkovic went to the 5th floor office of the Telecom Employees Credit Co-operative where a former friend (and the primary target), Con Margelis, worked. Margelis was called to the counter and briefly spoke with Vitkovic, who then pulled his weapon from the bag. The weapon jammed and Margelis ducked behind a counter; Vitkovic then began firing, killing a young female office worker, Judith Morris. A robbery alarm was activated by a staff member at 4:22 p.m. Margelis escaped the office unharmed, and hid in the women's toilets. Vitkovic took an elevator to the 12th floor, to the Australia Post philately security section. There, Vitkovic shot and injured a man and a woman, then pointed his gun at a woman sitting at her desk, only to pan his aim to the left and shoot Julie McBean and Nancy Avignone dead. A man in the corner office on that level, Warren Spencer, was also killed. Vitkovic then ran down the stairs to level 11, firing indiscriminately. He stormed into the computer training centre, shooting Michael McGuire at point-blank range, killing him. He then moved to the north-east corner of the office floor, cornering several office workers at their desks. Marianne Van Ewyk, Catherine Dowling and Rodney Brown were fatally shot in that area, some while hiding under their desks. Three other workers were wounded there. Several victims were shot in the head at very close range as they attempted to hide.Willox, Innes and Darby, Andrew (11 December 1987). \\"Killer had Clifton Hill news clippings\\". The Age. p. 1. A male office worker, Donald McElroy (who had been shot once), and Tony Gioia tackled Vitkovic, while Frank Carmody, who had been shot several times, wrestled the rifle from him. Gioia and Carmody were later awarded Australia's second-highest bravery decoration, the Star of Courage. A wounded female worker, Rosemary Spiteri, took the rifle and hid it in a refrigerator. Vitkovic climbed through an open window, apparently trying to clamber onto an external ledge of the building. Gioia held him by the ankles, trying to prevent his escape. Vitkovic kicked free and fell to his death on the pavement below. No one died in the building's elevators, and Vitkovic did not fire at police or into the street. One bullet pierced a window on the 11th floor. It was believed that around 1,000 people were in the building at the time of the shootings. After the killer's fall, police and members of the special operations group searched the building for accomplices.Willox, Innes (9 December 1987). \\"Nine die in city rampage\\", The Age. pg. 1. Vitkovic had fallen at 4:27 p.m.; police started their search of the building at 4:30 p.m. At 5:00 p.m., the Special Operations Group confirmed that the dead man on the street was the gunman, and the all clear was given for ambulance officers to enter the building to attend to the injured.\\"Ten minutes of terror\\". The Age. 9 December 1987. pg. 5.Murphy, Damien (10 December 1987). \\"Killer leaves trail of carnage\\". The Age. p. 6. =Aftermath= A search of Vitkovic's room after the killings revealed that Vitkovic kept press clippings of the Clifton Hill massacre, with extracts underlined in red. Police believed he had always intended to shoot people in the Queen Street building. It was reported that Vitkovic had left a note at his home; police indicated that it was not a suicide note. Vitkovic had obtained a shooter's licence and had bought the gun a few weeks before the shooting. He had illegally modified the .30 M1 carbine, by reducing the barrel's length. It was loaded with jacketed ammunition.Willox, Innes (10 December 1987). \\"Police seek motive for killer's rampage\\". The Age. p. 6. In the note, addressed to his parents and dated the day of the massacre, he wrote \\"Today is going to be the day. The anger in my head has got too much for me. I've got to get rid of my violent impulses. The time has come to die. There is no other way out.\\" The note had not been read by his parents before it was discovered by police.Willcox, Innes (11 December 1987). \\"Parents unaware of killer's last, anguished words\\". The Age. p. 4. Vitkovic had obtained his shooting licence on 17 September 1987. When asked at that time why he wanted a licence, Vitkovic stated \\"I desire to go hunting\\". He purchased the rifle on lay-by, collecting it 21 October 1987. Before the shooting, Vitkovic had removed the barrel and the handle of the weapon.Wilson, David and Paul Robinson (10 December 1987). \\"Statistics paint a grim picture of Melbourne as the nation's gun capital\\", The Age, pg. 6. After the shooting, a neighbourhood friend of the family said that Frank Vitkovic was an excellent student, a good tennis player, friendly and helpful, over six feet tall and very good looking. He had been a promising tennis player, but this was cut short due to a knee injury. After the shooting, a rumour circulated that he had sought help from Melbourne University counselling service on the day of the shooting. The head of law at the University, Susie Nixon, later told The Age that while Vitkovic had once sought counselling during his career with the law school, reports that he had been at the university on the date of the shooting were \\"totally unfounded\\". He had not left his course with hostility and Nixon believed there was no direct link between the shooting and his \\"deferral\\" from his course. A former secretary of the club where Vitkovic played tennis said he often threw on-court tantrums and did not easily accept losses. He had won a singles championship in his first year at the club but left the next year after he lost the title. Coronial enquiry The coronial enquiry in September 1988 heard that there was chaos during and immediately after the shooting and there was uncertainty over which of the police officers present was in charge. When ambulancemen entered the building with police, the police shouted to announce their presence as lifts arrived at their destination. Police on the floor also called out and pointed their guns in the direction of the lift.Gregory, Peter (21 September 1988).\\" Ambulancemen tell of chaos in Queen Street\\". The Age. p. 5. According to Inspector Adrian Fyfe, the officer in charge at the scene, the first police officer on the scene, a traffic policeman, had acted appropriately. He had used his initiative to isolate the area and had made an accurate assessment of the situation. Fyfe criticised this officer's \\"appalling\\" lack of knowledge of \\"police command structure\\" for not realising who was in charge until 5:00 p.m., 40 minutes after his arrival. Fyfe said the radio call sign he used identified him as the officer in charge.Gregory, Peter (30 September 1988). No drugs, alcohol in killer's body, Queen St inquest told. The Age. p. 15. Con Margelis testified to the coronial enquiry that he and Vitkovic had been friends for several years. Margelis said after Vitkovic arrived to see him on 8 December, he pulled out his rifle, tried to pull the trigger and then aimed it at a female colleague and told her not to move. Knowing that Vitkovic could not move quickly due to a bad knee, Margelis jumped over the counter and hid in the women's toilets on the 5th floor. Margelis said he expected that Vitkovic would come after him, leaving others in the office safe. Of possible reasons for Vitkovic's actions, Margelis said he had not seen Vitkovic in the months prior, adding that \\"I can't really explain\\". Margelis said Vitkovic had become depressed and embittered after injuring his leg playing tennis, followed by a failed operation to repair the damage. Margelis said he began to see little of Vitkovic due to his depression.Gregory, Peter (16 September 1988). \\"Prime target tells of Queen Street rampage\\", The Age, pg. 5. Another employee in the 5th floor office said that their colleague Judith Morris was shot as Margelis attempted to leap over the counter: \\"He was after Con and Judy was in the way.\\" This witness described Vitkovic's eyes as being those of someone \\"completely insane\\" and his laugh as \\"sick\\" and not human, adding that he laughed after shooting Morris. Officer worker Tony Gioia told the inquest he tackled Vitkovic, having just witnessed a co-worker being shot dead at point- blank range. Gioia believed he would be the next victim once Vitkovic turned around and saw him. Gioia said during the scuffle, Vitkovic lunged for the window and struggled to get out, until he was hanging from the ledge with Gioia holding Vitkovic by the ankles. Despite others helping to restrain Vitkovic, he struggled free and fell to the street. A woman in an adjacent office building told the inquest she believed she saw a man in a blue jumper throw the man onto the balcony, and then push him out when he moved back to the window. Under cross examination, she incorrectly identified this as occurring on the building's 10th floor, not the 11th, and stated that her building was from the Australia Post building.Gregory, Peter. \\"'Mates' praised for helping disarm killer\\", The Age, 20 September 1988, pg. 5. The counsel assisting the coroner, Julian Leckie, judged that this witness was \\"honest but mistaken\\". He said that photographs showed Gioia was not wearing a blue sweater on the day. Evidence showed that Vitkovic tried to jump and others tried to prevent this. Leckie also concluded that Rodney Brown would have died from his wounds no matter what was done. The psychologist in charge of the team counselling workers and their families said the video of Vitkovic firing his gun on the 5th floor should not be made public as it would cause significant distress to those being counselled. He advised against publishing a still image of Vitkovic taken from the video. Media outlets had requested copies of the video. The coroner, Hal Hallenstein, said the material presented at the inquest was public and had to be presented in a public way. A pathologist told the inquest that he found no legal or illegal drugs or alcohol in Vitkovic's system. He also said that Vitkovic was killed instantly from multiple injuries consistent with falling from a great height. The contents of Vitkovic's diary were read to the inquest on its 12th day. The diary included apologies to his family for his planned actions, and a suicide note. Among his comments to his sister, he wrote \\"It's time for me to die. Life is just not worth living.\\" The final diary entry, written on the day of the shooting, read \\"Today I must do it, there is no other way out.\\" Earlier entries catalogued his sexual problems. Vitkovic linked those to an incident when he was eight years old and was forced to undress in a school locker room and friends made fun of his uncircumcised penis. \\"After this nudity was a dirty word for me ... Since the age of 12 I knew that normal sex was not possible for me and I avoided girls completely until I was 19.\\" In another entry, he wrote \\"I am the odd man out there's no doubting it\\"; less than a month before the shooting he wrote: \\"As Rambo said in First Blood, once you accept a problem, it's no longer there.\\"Pitt, Helen. \\"Killer's diary tells of turmoil: 'It's time for me to die'\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 October 1988, pg. 2. At the coroner's hearing on 4 October 1988, Joe Dickson, counsel assisting the court, said that the police response was \\"satisfactory, and no complaints could be made about it.\\" He said that police response was fast, and the decision not to send ambulance officers into the building until it was cleared was responsible, noting that no one died because of any delay. He said the police officer who sent people back into the building truly believed he advised them to go to the top floor, despite evidence that he did not. The hearing heard that while three of the people sent back into the building had emotional trauma, no person sent back died or was injured.Gregory, Peter. Police action at Queen Street orderly: counsel. ‘'The Age'’. 5 October 1988, p. 10. Dickson conceded that the senior constable who sent people back into the building might not have taken the best course of action.Pitt, Helen. Scientologists linked with Queen Street killer. The Sydney Morning Herald: 5 October 1988, p. 4. Dickson said a routine practice on the 12th floor where staff had to open a security door to talk to visitors rendered its security measures ineffective. He said the 5th floor Telecom Credit Union security measures were \\"adequate for all purposes except the visit of a maniac.\\" On the 11th floor, no one could have perceived the possibility of a robbery or violence. Dickson said Vitkovic's visit to the Melbourne University counsellor in December 1986 could not be seen to have contributed to the killings. He said that Vitkovic probably brooded over the results of a Church of Scientology personality test given to him on 8 October 1987. The results of the Scientology test showed he \\"had hit rock bottom\\"; the person administering the test did not advise Vitkovic to see a psychiatrist but to enrol in a Scientology course. Forensic psychologist Dr Alan Bartholomew told the coroner's court that Vitkovic would have been eligible at the time to be certified insane under the Mental Health Act. After studying Vitkovic's diaries, Bartholomew concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic and that there was no doubt the personality test worsened his depression and might have contributed to the decline in his mental state. Batholomew agreed that Vitkovic was criminally insane at the time of the shooting and said Vitkovic could have identified with Rambo and the Hoddle Street killings. After hearing representations by counsel representing the building tenants directly affected, the families of those killed, and news media organisations, the coroner Hal Hallenstein refused to suppress publication of photographs taken from a 5th-floor security video that showed Vitkovic. He said those images would be made public at the end of the inquest.

He was the member of the committee of Indian writers and visited countries like the Soviet Union, Hungary, France and West Germany in 1990. He visited Moscow in 1989 as board member for a Soviet newspaper. Ananthamurthy was the leader for the committee of writers who visited China in 1993. Literary Works U R Ananthamurthy in his reading room Ananthamurthy's works have been translated into several Indian and European languages and have been awarded with important literary prizes. His main works include \\"Prashne\\", \\"Aakasha Mattu Bekku\\", Samskara, Bhava, Bharathipura, and Avasthe. He has written numerous short stories as well. Several of his novels and short fictions have been made into movies. Most of Ananthamurthy's literary works deal with psychological aspects of people in different situations, times and circumstances. His writings supposedly analyse aspects ranging from challenges and changes faced by Brahmin families of Karnataka to bureaucrats dealing with politics influencing their work. Most of his novels are on reaction of individuals to situations that are unusual and artificial. Results of influences of sociopolitical and economic changes on traditional Hindu societies of India and clashes due to such influences – between a father and a son, husband and wife, father and daughter and finally, the fine love that flows beneath all such clashes are portrayed by Ananthamurthy in his works. This is evident in his stories like Sooryana Kudure (The Grasshopper)\\", Mouni (Silent Man)\\", \\"Karthika, \\"Ghatashraddha\\" etc. It does not mean that Ananthamurthy is just clinging to portraying only such somewhat standard subjects of Indian literature of his period. His novelette Bara (Drought) portrays the dynamics of a drought-stricken district of Karnataka and the challenges and dilemmas a bureaucrat may face in such situations. The central figure of the novel Sooryana Kudure – Venkata is shunned by his son and wife for his easy-going attitude that does not take him anywhere. Venkata is a non- achiever who could not achieve any material or monetary success in his life. However, he is a simpleton who does not take life's suffering to his heart too much. He likes to see life as living in the love of Amma (or mother-goddess). In all sufferings of life, he has the child-like curiosity about the smallest things in life like a grasshopper (Sooryana Kudure). The evening after his son revolts and leaves the house, he would be engrossed in a sight in his yard a grasshopper shining in the sun's light. His several novels were made into films like Samskara, Bara, Avaste, Mouni, \\"Ghatashraddha\\" and Diksha. Personal life U. R. Ananthamurthy met his wife Esther in 1954 and they were married in 1956. They had two children, Sharath and Anuradha. He resided in Bangalore for most of his later life. His son in law Vivek Shanbhag also was a famous writer in Kannada. Political career U. R. Ananthamurthy made an unsuccessful run for the Lok Sabha in 2004 in which he stated that his prime ideological objective in opting to contest the elections was to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Ananthamurthy awaiting Congress's response to his offer The Hindu – March 16, 2004 A Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda had made an offer for Murthy to contest for his party. However, after the Janata Dal (Secular) worked a power sharing agreement with the BJP, Murthy said: Ananthamurthy also contested for the Rajya Sabha elections from state assembly in 2006. The idea proposed by Ananthamurthy to rename ten cities in Karnataka including Bengaluru from their colonial forms to actual native forms was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and the cities were renamed on the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of the formation of Karnataka. Controversies In June 2007, Ananthamurthy declared that he would not take part in literary functions in future in the wake of strong criticism for his reaction on S.L. Bhyrappa's controversial novel Aavarana that appeared in a section of the media. In 2013, Murthy's statement that there is a reference in the Mahabharata to Brahmin's consuming beef drew flak from Hindu religious leaders. Vishwesha Teertha Swami of Pejawar Math commented that there was no reference to Brahmins consuming beef in the conversation between Bhishma and Yudhishtira or anywhere else in the Mahabharata and Murthy's statement came as a surprise to him. A vocal critic of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)/Jan Sangh for over 50 years, Murthy said in 2013 that he would not live in the country ruled by BJP leader Narendra Modi. He later clarified that those remarks were made when he was \\"overcome by emotion\\" and said that he had no such plan, though he continued to oppose BJP.\\"Kannada Writer Ananthamurthy Makes U-turn on Modi Remarks\\".

The shootings resulted in the deaths of seven people, and serious injury to 19 others. After a police chase lasting more than 30 minutes, 19-year-old former Australian Army officer cadet Julian Knight was caught in nearby Fitzroy North and arrested for the shootings. Knight was later sentenced to seven concurrent sentences of life imprisonment with a non- parole period of 27 years for what was described by the presiding judge as \\"one of the bloodiest massacres in Australian history\\".R v Knight ; [1989] VR 705. The Crown prosecutor, Joe Dickson QC, \\"did not contend that a minimum term should not be fixed\\". Knight currently resides in the maximum security Port Phillip Prison in Truganina, Victoria near Melbourne and was eligible for parole in 2014. Shortly before Knight became eligible for parole, the Victorian government amended the Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) to prevent the parole board from ordering Knight's release on parole \\"unless satisfied, amongst other things, that Mr Knight is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated and that, as a result, he no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person\\".Knight v Victoria . Background Knight's father was involved in the military and, as a result, Knight moved around a lot as a child. His lifelong dream was to defend Australia in a war. After a troubled high-school life, Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on 13 January 1987, at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he lacked self-discipline and performed poorly at his studies and gained good results only in weapons expertise exercises. Knight did not like authority and he hated the social hierarchy of the army which allowed people only a few months older than him to boss him around. One night, despite being confined to the base, Knight was involved in a fight and stabbing at a bar after being confronted by a senior. Knight was consequently discharged and sent back to Melbourne 16 days prior to the massacre. Upon returning to Melbourne, Knight found out that his longtime girlfriend would no longer see him and his mother, on whom he had always relied, had turned his childhood bedroom into an extra living room. Furthermore, Knight was without money, and had no ability or experience to earn a decent wage and, consequently, took on menial work.  Events of 9 August 1987  The events of this day were pieced together after investigation by police, along with the help of Knight himself. =Prelude= The house in Ramsden Street, Clifton Hill At 11:30 on Sunday 9 August 1987, Knight, woke up in his temporary bedroom in the front room of his mother's house at number 6 Ramsden Street, Clifton Hill. Between 13:10 and 16:10 on Sunday 9 August 1987, Knight attended a belated birthday party for his mother at his grandmother's house in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. While at the party Knight consumed two cans of regular beer. He left the party in his own car and drove his younger sister home before driving aimlessly around the Clifton Hill area. At about 16:50, Knight went to see an old girlfriend in Clifton Hill in order to give her a magazine. He only stayed at her flat for about five minutes then he continued to drive aimlessly around the area. Minutes later the gearbox of his car – his only asset – jammed and stuck in second gear. He limped the car home, where he changed clothes and drank another can of beer before walking angrily around to the nearby Royal Hotel, his local pub, at around 17:30. None of Knight's friends were there, so he drank alone from around 17:30. At around 20:50, Knight reportedly began to feel the effects of the beer he'd been drinking and he had a \\"vision\\" of soldiers being ambushed. He felt as if it was a \\"call to arms\\" and at about 20:55, he rushed from the hotel and ran back to his mother's house. =Preparation= Arriving back at his mother's house a few minutes later, he spoke briefly to his sister when she met him in the hallway outside the front room. He then waited until his sister returned to the rear of the house to watch a movie on TV with their mother, before he ventured upstairs to his mother's bedroom. Stored under her bed were his legally owned and licensed weapons: a .177 calibre Daisy BB air rifle, a .177 calibre Chinese air rifle, a .177 calibre Crosman model 766 air rifle, a .22 calibre Ruger model 10/22 semi-automatic rifle, a 12-gauge Mossberg pump- action shotgun, and a Chinese-made 7.62mm calibre M14 semi-automatic military rifle. Knight retrieved the Ruger rifle, the Mossberg shotgun and the M14 rifle, then he took the Ruger and the Mossberg back downstairs to the front room. He then returned to his mother's room and collected the M14, and a steel ammunition box and a leather shotgun cartridge belt from his mother's wardrobe, before returning to the front room to load the three firearms. After loading the firearms and stuffing his pockets with around 100 rounds of ammunition, including a \\"suicide\\" 7.62mm round which he placed in the front right hand pocket of his jeans, he placed a black combat knife down the back of his jeans. He then slung the M14 over his back and picked up the Mossberg and the Ruger in his right and left hands respectively. Immediately afterwards, at around 21:30, he opened the front door of the house and ran out into Ramsden Street. After running west along Ramsden Street and crossing the nearby railway line, Knight reached the eastern side of the main four-lane arterial road known as Hoddle Street. =Shooting spree= Hoddle Street, where a majority of the shootings took place At 21:30, from the nature strip on the east side of the road, Knight commenced firing on passing cars with the Ruger rifle. The first car that Knight opened fire on contained a married couple, Con and Rita Vitkos. Rita received minor wounds and her husband drove on before stopping at a Mobil service station about 150 metres further south down Hoddle Street. Following the Vitkos's was a car containing Michael Anthony and Trevor Smeelie, and a car driven by Gregory Elliott. A bullet struck Elliott's vehicle, narrowly missing his head. Both of these cars were damaged, but none of the occupants were wounded. Following Gregory Elliott's car was a vehicle driven by Alan Jury and containing Monica Vitelli and Dannielle Mina. Jury and Vitelli were both wounded, and they joined the others at the Mobil service station. Knight fired rapid bursts at each car, and he reloaded with spare 10-round Ruger magazines as he moved north along the nature-strip towards the nearby Clifton Hill railway station. He ensured that he fired on every south and north-bound vehicle as it passed him. The next car he fired on contained Raewyn Crighton, Bernd Micheel and Dianne Arnold, who all escaped injury. The following car was driven by Sand Wang, who received minor wounds. The next car was driven by Diane Fitzpatrick, who received a serious back wound. The next three cars to be shot at contained Michael Pearce and Jacqueline Langosch, Issac Lohman, and Reginald Dutton and Dana Sabolcki respectively, and they all escaped injury. At around 21:35, Knight ran out of ammunition for the Ruger, so he dropped it on the nature-strip and commenced firing with the Mossberg shotgun. The loud blasts of the shotgun alerted local residents to the shooting and the first calls were made to the Victoria Police's emergency communications centre, D24. The first car to be hit was driven by Sharyn Maunder, who did not receive any injuries and did not realise the front of her car had been hit. The next car to be hit was driven by Vesna Markovska, who received minor wounds, followed by a car driven by her fiancé, Zoran Trajceski, who also received minor wounds. Both Markovska and Trajceski parked their cars by the side of the road and got out to take cover. As they did so, a car driven by Georgina Papaioannou stopped on the opposite side of the street. Knight immediately opened fire on her car, and Papaioannou was slightly wounded. Soon afterwards, a car driven by Jayne Morris, alongside Kay Edwards and Cecilie Corless, drove south through the ambush zone. =Police response= Further south down Hoddle Street they flagged down a police divisional van containing Constables Glen Nichols and Belinda Bourchier, and informed them about the shootings. Nichols and Bourchier immediately drove to the scene with their lights and siren on as they radioed D24. Soon after 21:38, they reached the intersection of Hoddle Street and Ramsden Street where they were shot at by Knight. Knight continued to change position as he fired at a procession of four single-occupant cars which, in chronological order, were driven by Mathew Morrow, Edward McShortall, Trevor Robinson and Keith Wing Shing. McShortall received minor wounds, but Wing Shing, who stopped his car opposite Knight, received serious jaw and throat wounds. Knight continued to reload and change position as he continued to fire at the passing cars. The next car Knight fired at was a car containing Kevin Skinner, his wife Tracey and their son Adam. Tracey was killed instantly by a bullet to the face and Adam, who was on her lap below the window sill, received minor glass wounds. Following this, a local resident, Peter Curmi, and a friend of his, John Muscat, approached the scene from the western side of the street. Knight fired one shot at them which fatally wounded Muscat in the head and chest, and which seriously wounded Curmi. Immediately after this, the attendant at the nearby swimming pool, Steve Wight, ran to their aid and was seriously wounded by Knight's final shotgun blast. It was now 21:39, and numerous police units were rushing to the scene. Knight dropped the empty Mossberg shotgun and took up a prone firing position with his M14 rifle. At this point, Vesna Markovska broke cover from behind her car and made for the footpath on the eastern side of Hoddle Street. As she stepped onto the footpath she was spotted by Knight who fired a shot which seriously wounded her. When she fell back onto the roadway Knight fired two further shots which killed her. It was now 21:40 and D24 notified the Police Air Wing that one of their Aerospatiale Dauphin police helicopters was needed to assist the police at the scene. Moments later, in a break in the firing, one of the police officers on the western side of Hoddle Street fired a shot at Knight, which missed him by a couple of metres. Immediately following this shot Robert Mitchell, who had driven through the ambush zone unscathed and parked his car further down Hoddle Street, ran up the eastern side of the street in an attempt to render assistance to the fallen Markovska. As he reached her and came to a halt, Knight quickly fired a shot at him which hit him in the right side of the head and killed him instantly. At 21:41, as three police units took up positions in Mayors Park on the western side of Hoddle Street and other police units took up positions in the surrounding area, Knight opened fire on a car driven by Jacqueline Turner and on Papaioannou as she walked from her car to help Markovska and Mitchell. Turner's car was not hit, but Papaioannou was fatally wounded in the left side as she reached Markovska. Following this, Knight fired on a car driven by John Finn who received minor wounds. The next car Knight shot at was driven by Andrew Hack who was seriously wounded in the left side. Following Hack was a car driven by Dusan Flajnik which Knight fired at. Flajnik was hit in the left side and bled to death in his car. At 21:43, Constable Bourchier requested another ambulance from D24 and nominated the Mobil service station as a safe rendezvous point for ambulances as two more police units arrived there. The next car to be shot at contained Michael Smith and Jacqueline Megens. Smith received minor wounds while Megens was seriously wounded in the shoulder. As they were fired upon the first two ambulances arrived at the scene; one at the Mobil service station and one at Mayors Park. It was now 21:44, and the next car to be shot at was driven by Steven Mihailidis who escaped unscathed. Immediately afterwards Knight fired at the rider of a motorcycle, Kenneth \\"Shane\\" Stanton, who was hit in the left leg and fell onto the roadway. As he lay there Knight shot him a further two times and he eventually died. Soon afterwards, at 21:45, a car containing Dimitrios Collyvas, Renata Coldebella, Danny Coldebella and Danny De Luca, followed Stanton down Hoddle Street. Knight, who was by this time beside the southern end of the Clifton Hill railway station buildings, fired a shot at the front of the car. The car stopped and as it reversed back up the street Knight fired two more shots at it before it crashed into a police car, driven by Constable Dominic Cannizzaro, which had just arrived at the scene. The first shot that Knight had fired into the car had slightly wounded Renata, and the second shot he fired had seriously wounded Danny Coldebella. As Collyvas's car was reversing a motorcycle being ridden by Wayne Timms and Jayne Timbury, followed by a car containing Alexandra Stamatopoulos, Steven Stamatopoulos, Irene Fountis, Vicki Fountis and Panagioti Fountis, drove into the ambush zone and stopped opposite Collyvas's car. At this point Knight, who was surrounded by at least 40 armed police officers, decided to withdraw from the area and began \\"hunting\\" police officers. It was just after 21:45, and he'd expended 40 rounds of .22 calibre bullets, 25 rounds of 12-gauge buckshot and 32 rounds of 7.62mm calibre bullets in the preceding 15 minutes. Five people lay dead, two were fatally wounded and a further 17 had been wounded. In addition to the expended ammunition, Knight had lost his \\"suicide\\" bullet and another 7.62mm bullet as he had moved up the nature-strip. Knight had also lost his knife on the nature-strip. He only had his M14 rifle and 17 rounds of ammunition, having discarded the other two firearms. =Police chase= Following his decision to withdraw, Knight turned around and climbed onto the western platform of the Clifton Hill railway station. He ran north along the platform and then continued moving north beside the railway line. He reached a fork in the tracks at around 21:46, and decided to follow the left fork. He spotted a police car in the northern end of Hoddle Street and fired three shots at it. The police car contained Sergeant Graham Larchin and Senior Constable Betty Roberts, who were not injured by the gunfire but who abandoned the car after Knight ceased firing. After firing at Larchin and Roberts's police car Knight moved into a nearby cluster of trees, sat down and smoked a cigarette. Minutes later, police Aerospatiale Dauphin helicopter VH-PVA – call sign \\"Air 495\\" – arrived over the Clifton Hill area and began searching for Knight with a powerful searchlight. A minute later D24 ordered the Victoria Police's elite Special Operations Group (SOG) to attend the scene. Knight finished his cigarette and continued moving in a north-west direction towards Northcote. He crossed over the Merri Creek, which bordered Clifton Hill and Northcote, and took up a position at the end of a road bridge which spanned the creek. Just before 22:00, he fired a shot at a passing police officer, Constable Colin Chambers, who was slightly wounded in the right side. After shooting Chambers, Knight moved back across Merri Creek into the adjoining suburb of Fitzroy North. The police helicopter had found him in its searchlight and was following him. He ran into a line of trees beside the railway line in an attempt to avoid the searchlight, but at 22:05 broke cover onto the railway line, knelt down and fired three shots at the aircraft as it circled over him. The police helicopter, containing Senior Constable Trevor Wilson, Senior Constable Daryl Jones, Constable Keith Stewart, and Ambulance Officer Alan Scott, was hit by the first shot which pierced its right main fuel tank and forced it to make an emergency landing on a nearby sports field. =McKean Street and arrest= Knight continued on into Fitzroy North and headed down McKean Street in an attempt to reach his ex-girlfriend's house. It was now 22:13 and Knight was spotted by two police officers, Constable John Delahunty and Constable Ralph Lockman, who gave chase in their police car. As they bore down on him, Knight ducked into a lane-way, turned around and fired his last ten rounds at the police car as it stopped in the middle of the road facing the lane-way. Delahunty, who was driving the police car, received minor shrapnel wounds to the face and left hand as he and Lockman tumbled out of the car with their revolvers drawn. The police car's headlights were on high beam facing the entrance to the laneway, which was also lit up by a nearby street light. As Delahunty and Lockman took up positions behind their police car and called upon Knight to surrender, Knight squatted down beside a low brick wall and searched his pockets vainly for his \\"suicide\\" bullet. When he realised that he had lost it he leaned out into the headlight beams and dropped the empty M14 on the ground. He then slowly stood up with his hands in the air. When he was fully upright, Delahunty stepped out from behind the rear of the police car and fired a shot at him. Knight was not hit but he ducked back down behind the low brick wall. As Delahunty and Lockman again called on him to surrender he yelled back \\"Don't shoot! I'm coming out!\\" He again rose up with his hands in the air before walking out onto the street where he was arrested by Delahunty and Lockman. Numerous other police officers arrived at the arrest scene, and after a short, initially violent, interrogation (by officers wanting to know where his accomplices were), Knight was driven in an unmarked police car to the St Kilda Road Police Complex by Detective Senior Constable Richard McIntosh, Detective Senior Constable Kim Cox and Constable Robert Kovacs. At the St Kilda Road Police Complex Knight was interrogated extensively by McIntosh and Cox, briefly by the then head of the Homicide Squad, Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cole, then extensively by Homicide Squad detectives Detective Senior Sergeant Brian McCarthy and Detective Senior Constable Graham Kent. Knight also took part in a night-time crime re- enactment and a daytime crime re-enactment, both of which were videoed, and he was interrogated until he was eventually charged with the murder of John Muscat at 12.20pm on Monday 10 August 1987.

Ramachandra Guha called him the \\"Rabindranath Tagore of Modern India, who has been one of the finest novelists-activists since independence\\".The Arun Shourie of the left. Thehindu.com (26 November 2000). Retrieved on 2018-11-15. He was the third writer to be decorated with the Jnanpith Award for Kannada, the highest literary honor conferred in India. His son Ullas is an ecological conservationist. Early life Shivaram Karanth was born on 10 October 1902, in Kota near Brahmavara in the Udupi district of Karnataka to a Kannada-speaking family. The fifth child of his parents Shesha Karantha and Lakshmamma, he completed his primary education in Kundapura and Mangalore. Shivaram Karanth was influenced by Gandhi's principles and took part in Indian Independence movement when he was in college. His participation in the Non-cooperation movement did not allow him to complete his college education which he quit in February 1922. He canvassed for khadi and swadeshi in Karnataka led by Indian National Congress leader Karnad Sadashiva Rao, for five years till 1927. By that time, Karanth had already started writing fiction novels and plays. Career Karanth began writing in 1924 and soon published his first book, Rashtrageetha Sudhakara, a collection of poems. His first novel was Vichitrakoota. Subsequent works like Nirbhagya Janma (\\"Unfortunate Birth\\") and Sooleya Samsara (\\"Family of a Prostitute\\") mirrored the pathetic conditions of the poor. His magnum opus Devaddhootaru, a satire on contemporary India, was published in 1928. Karanth was an intellectual and environmentalist who made notable contribution to the art and culture of Karnataka. He is considered one of the most influential novelists in the Kannada language. His novels Marali Mannige, Bettada Jeeva, Alida Mele, Mookajjiya Kanasugalu, Mai Managala Suliyalli, Ade OOru Ade Mara, Shaneeshwarana Neralinalli, Kudiyara Koosu, Svapnada Hole, Sarsammana Samadhi, and Chomana Dudi are widely read and have received critical acclaim. He wrote two books on Karnataka's ancient stage dance-drama Yakshagana (1957 and 1975). He was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels, but incurred financial losses. He was also a painter and was deeply concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment.A walk through the life of Karanth – KARNATAKA. The Hindu (26 February 2013). Retrieved on 2018-11-15. At the age of 90, he wrote a book on birds (published during 2002 by Manohara Grantha Mala, Dharwad). He wrote, apart from his forty-seven novels, thirty-one plays, four short story collections, six books of essays and sketches, thirteen books on art, two volumes of poems, nine encyclopedias, and over one hundred articles on various issues.  Personal life  Karanth married Leela Alva, a student in the school that Karanth taught dance and directed plays in. Leela belonged to the Bunt community and was the daughter of a businessman, K. D. Alva. They married on 6 May 1936. The couple subsequently attracted ridicule from people in the region over their inter-caste marriage; Karanth belonged to an orthodox Brahmin community. Leela, who had her early education in Marathi language, re-learnt Kannada after marriage and translated the Marathi novel Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto into Kannada. As a dancer, she participated in Karanth's operas. The Karanths had four children together: sons, Harsha and Ullas, a conservationist; and daughters, Malavika and Kshama. His mother's influence on Karanth was described by Ullas as: \\"It was our mother who shaped Karanth's life... She was the backbone of all his endeavours. She was also quite well- read, and she dedicated all of her talents to her husband. She took care of all household responsibilities.\\" The family lived in the Puttur town of Dakshina Kannada, a district in the South Karnataka region, before moving to Saligrama, a town from Karanth's birthplace Kota, in 1974. A few years prior to this, their eldest son Harsha died leaving Leela suffer from \\"depression and hallucinations\\". Leela died in September 1986. It was also the year that Karanth's final novel was published. Karanth was admitted to Kasturba Medical College in Manipal on 2 December 1997 to be treated for viral fever. He suffered from a cardiac respiratory arrest two days later and slipped into a coma. On 8 December, his kidneys began to fail and subsequently developed severe acidosis and sepsis, following which he was put on dialysis. Efforts to revive him failed and he died at 11:35 a.m. (IST) the following day, aged 95. The government of Karnataka declared a two-day mourning in the State as a mark of respect.

As of July 2020, 19 Mark 4s have been scrapped, 144 are still in service (formed of 16 9 carriage sets), and 139 are in storage. History and construction The interior of First Class aboard a Virgin Trains East Coast refurbished Mark 4 FO vehicle A small build compared with the Mark 2 and Mark 3 designs, 314 Mark 4s were built between 1989 and 1992 by Metro-Cammell's Washwood Heath factory to operate services on the newly electrified East Coast Main Line.\\"Met-Cam scoops MkIV contract\\" Railway Gazette International February 1987 page 73 Today they are operated by London North Eastern Railway in 30 fixed formations of nine coaches, with a Class 91 locomotive and Driving Van Trailer. The Mark 4 is an all-steel coach incorporating a number of improvements over the Mark 3 stock - notably the inclusion of automatic push-button operated plug-type doors, in place of manually operated slam-doors, fully sealed gangways and controlled emission toilets (CET). Body shells were built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and Società Italiana Ernesto Breda.\\"Italians to build BR high speed coaches\\" Railway Gazette International December 1988 page 792 After a period of evaluation in 1988, Swiss SIG type BT41A\\"New bogie for German ICE (Intercity Express) based on BT41\\", C. Freitag and S. Karch, SIG Swiss Industrial Company, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Vol 208, 1994. bogies were selected rather than BREL Type T4 bogies when BREL could not provide commercial guarantees on the demanding lateral ride comfort required for 140 mph running (BT41B/C refer to the bogie types used on the Mk4 DVT).\\"Mark IV Passenger Vehicles For East Coast Main Line Electrification\\", P H Watts and M S Hawkridge, Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, 1989.\\"Swiss bogie to carry BR MkIVs\\" Railway Gazette International September 1989 page 667\\"A new way to travel\\" Rail issue 106 pages 40-41 However, during the first year of operation in 1989, complaints were made about the \\"lively\\" ride of the coaches. This required modifications to the damper and spring rates of the bogies and the fitting of inter-coach \\"car coupler dampers\\" to improve damping between the vehicles.\\"The Mk 4 and Mk 5 coaches for British Rail Intercity Part 2: testing, commissioning and service experience with the Mk 4 coach and development of the Mk 5 specification\\", J A Higton and D R Temple, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Vol 206, 1992. Disabled access was another priority of the design, so the door vestibules were enlarged to allow a more generous turning circle for a wheelchair. With ever-increasing levels of overcrowding, the so-called 'gangway passenger' had become an important consideration, so the vestibule environment was improved with carpeted walls, better lighting, sealed gangways and carriage doors plus four flip-down seats per vestibule (since removed and replaced with bench style perch seats). Many of these innovations came courtesy of the abandoned Advanced Passenger Train, upon which the Mark 4 was heavily based. This influence was most obvious with the profiled sides, intended to allow the retrofitting of tilt-equipped bogies derived from the APT. This would have allowed up to 6° of tilt; modified coaches would have been designated \\"Mark 4 T\\" but this plan was abandoned in January 1986. The business case for the Mark 4 anticipated them also being operated on the West Coast Main Line as a follow-on order after the East Coast Main Line electrification, but after the failure of the InterCity 250 project to gain Treasury support, British Rail ordered a small number of Class 90 locomotives to supplement existing locomotives on the West Coast Main Line. The Mark 4 has gained widespread praise for its exceptional crashworthiness, something that was proven in the Hatfield and Selby crashes, where experts identified the integral construction of the vehicles as being a key factor in restricting the death toll. The Class 158 and Class 159 diesel multiple units, although superficially similar, are not based on the Mark 4 bodyshell: the Mark 4 is derived from the Class 156. The Iarnród Éireann Mark 4 push-pull carriages introduced on the Irish railway system in mid-2006 are of a different design, manufactured by the Spanish manufacturer CAF. The Mark 4 was the first British Rail vehicle not to use the iconic Rail Alphabet typeface for interior signage and operating notices. Via Rail Canada's Renaissance fleet of inter-city and sleeper coaches are derived from British Rail's Mark 4. They were built for the abortive Nightstar services to Europe, and adapted by Bombardier Transportation to meet Canadian requirements. Project Mallard The interior of Standard Class aboard a GNER 'Project Mallard' refurbished Mark 4 TSO vehicle The interior of First Class aboard a GNER 'Project Mallard' refurbished Mark 4 FO vehicle Between October 2003 and November 2005, Bombardier Transportation, under contract from GNER, rebuilt and refurbished the carriages under Project Mallard. Trains with rebuilt coaches became known as Mallards to distinguish them from unrefurbished sets during the upgrade programme, named after the Mallard steam locomotive, built in the 1930s by the London & North Eastern Railway and holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives.\\"Bombardier confirmed for Mk4 refurbishment\\" The Railway Magazine December 2002 page 69\\"Queen launches Mk 4 coaches at King's Cross\\" Rail issue 473 29 October 2003 page 12\\"GNER unveils last Mallard\\" Today's Railways UK issue 49 January 2006 page 62 The Mallard refit gave the coaches all-new interiors with new seats, carpeting and power points at every seat. The vestibule areas lost their flip-down seats near the entrances with perch-type seats being put in their place. The buffet coach was turned around with first class seating converted to standard. Wheelchair-width doors were fitted and the seating capacity was increased by fitting airline-style seats in place of the previous groupings of pairs of seats facing each other across a table. Additionally GNER introduced WiFi Internet connectivity as a trial from December 2003 and into service from April 2004, making it the first service of its kind in the United Kingdom.

He is best known as the warden of Bede from the age of seven until his death in 716. He was the Abbot of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, and a major contributor to the project to produce the Codex Amiatinus Bible. He died in Burgundy while en route to deliver a copy of the codex to Pope Gregory II in Rome.  Early life  Not much is known about the earlier period of Ceolfrid's life. His desire to join the monastic community was likely due to his own brother Cynefrid's devotion to the traditions of Christian monasticism. Historians date Ceolfrid's induction into monastic tradition around the date of Cynefrid's death in 660. Ceolfrid is known to have a strong family connection to monastic tradition. In addition to his brother, his cousin Tunbert was the first Abbot of the Monastery of Hexham. His first four years in cloister took place at Gilling Abbey in what is now North Yorkshire, which was also attended by Cynefrid, prior to his departure to Ireland. Ceolfrid is described as having \\"behaved of the greater devotion, giving his mind continually to reading, to labour, and monastic discipline\\".D.S Boutflower, 56 After these four years, Ceolfrid left Gilling as he \\"sought a monastery of a stricter character\\".Boutflower,10 He soon took in with a band of men, led by Wilfrid, later canonized as Saint Wilfrid. These monks are identified by Boutflower as being the Benedictines of Ripon at a monastery under the same name. During this time, he came to refine his own understanding of proper monastic principles. At the age of 27, Ceolfrid was ordained as a priest, and began to acquaint himself to the utmost with the practices of monastic life. Very little is revealed about the period between the end of his days at Ripon, and his appointment under Benedict Biscop, except that he spent some time in the institutions of Abbot Botolph, whom he describes as being filled with \\"the grace of spirit\\".Boutflower, 57 While having been revered as an inspiration for the way of divine living, Botolph also served to inspire a greater sense of humility within Ceolfrid.  Relationship with Benedict Biscop  One of the few surviving pages from the Ceolfrid Bible, one of three versions of the Vulgate Bible created in Wearmouth and Jarrow under Ceolfrid at the turn of the eighth century. British Library, London. In 674, Benedict Biscop received a land grant from King Ecgfrith of Northumbria for the explicit purpose of erecting a monastery. During the construction of his first monastery at Wearmouth, Biscop appointed Abbot Eosterwini (anglicized as \\"Easterwine\\") as his primary Abbot and Coadjutor. The monastery took eight years to build. This institute had left Ecgfrith so enamoured that soon after the completion of the Wearmouth Monastery, he granted Biscop another segment of land for the construction of a second monastery, Jarrow, with the intention that the two should be administered as one. It is during the construction of the Wearmouth Monastery that Benedict Biscop sought out Ceolfrid, who would become \\"his most zealous assistant from the first foundation of the former monastery\\", as well as a close friend. It appears that Biscop's invitation came at a most opportune time, for Ceolfrid had been contemplating the idea of leaving the post he held at the time. He had grown rather disenchanted with the power stratification within the institution (the name of which is unknown), and had had enough of the \\"jealousies and very bitter persecutions of certain men of rank\\",Boutflower, 60 and had been looking to return to his own monastery (assumed to be Ripon). Upon the completion of the Jarrow Monastery, Ceolfrid became the Abbot of the St. Paul's Church on the monasterial grounds. Conflicting reports state that the presence of Ceolfrid during Jarrow's construction varied. Some papers state that Jarrow came into his hands after its completion, while another identified Ceolfrid as being paramount to the actual construction of the monastery; as the individual who directed the construction of the monastery itself. The friendship between the two was fairly close. When Benedict sailed across the English channel to Rome for the last time, he chose only Ceolfrid to join him in his journey. This trip was to be the very trip that would lead to both Abbot's immortalization in the works of Ceolfrid's ward and later contemporary, The Venerable Bede. Ceolfrid also used the trip as an opportunity to explore his role in Biscop's institution, feeling that Rome would be an opportune place to learn his position's responsibilities. Twelve years later, upon the death of Abbot Eosterwini, Ceolfrid was appointed as the sole Abbot for both Monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, an honour never heard of before. In 690, Benedict Biscop died, after being bedridden for a lengthy period of time, and Ceolfrid became the leading head of both monasteries, \\"[whose] libraries of both monasteries, which Abbot Benedict had so actively begun, under his zealous care became doubled in extent\\".Ruby Davis, \\"Bede's early Readings\\"  Relationship with The Venerable Bede  Bede came into Ceolfrid's care at the young age of seven, and became the pupil of the Abbot as well as friend. In his early years at the twin Monasteries of Wearmouth – Jarrow (686), the Plague had struck Northumbria, and ravaged most of the countryside, including the twin Monasteries. Ceolfrid and Bede appeared to have remained untouched by the epidemic, and took the duties of caring for the infected and dying monks of the monasteries with unyielding fervour. They further worked together in maintaining the regular sermons when fear had gripped the population. When the Plague finally passed over, master and pupil began to rebuild the monastic foundations and succeeded effectively. Bede remained in Jarrow for the majority of his life, never straying more than 70 miles from the monastery at any time. He was a loyal pupil until Ceolfrid's death, and he died in Jarrow in 735.  The Codex Amiatinus Project  Portrait of Ezra from the Codex Amiatinus in the Laurentian Library, Florence. The Codex Amiatinus is the oldest manuscript with a complete text of the Vulgate. The Codex Amiatinus is described as a brilliant display of the beauty that is Early British, Pre-Carolingian calligraphy. The composition of the Vulgate was part of the project to expand Wearmouth and Jarrow's extensive library, and Ceolfrid ordered three copies of this Bible manuscript to be composed; one of which would be dedicated to the Pope Gregory II, while the other two copies were meant to stay in the respective churches of Wearmouth and Jarrow. There are no official records that state that the text made it to Rome. It is said that instead, it made its way into Florence, where it was presented by the Lombard Abbot Peter to the Abbazia di San Salvatore at Mount Amiata in Tuscany. It is believed that he changed the dedicatory note inscribed within the leaves as donated to the monastery. This occurred in the 9th century. The document remained at Mount Amiata until 1786, when it was relocated to the Laurentian Library in Florence. There is some dispute over what consisted of this Vulgate Codex. Over the past few hundred years, additional leaves that appear to be related to this text have been located in Britain, some having been used as book wrappings. These new discoveries have led scholars to question the total length of the codex, as there are still fragments missing from it today.  Ceolfrid and the Picts  Sometime after 711, Nechtan mac Der-Ilei, King of the Picts, sought authoritative advice from Abbot Ceolfrid on the reform of paschal cycles with a view to harmonising the celebration of Easter within his kingdom. By 716 both the Picts and the Columban clergy of Iona had adopted the pascha catholica.Grigg, Julianna (2015), The Philosopher King and the Pictish Nation, Four Courts Press, Dublin  Final Days  Ceolfrid apparently knew that he was coming to the end of his life, and so he resigned his post and was succeeded by Hwaetberht. He then set sail for Rome with the intent of delivering the Codex Amiatinus Bible to Pope Gregory II. He made it as far as Langres in Burgundy, where he died on 29 September 716 and was buried.Hind, George. \\"St. Ceolfrid.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3.

While Sigurd gained fame as the \\"warrior king\\" (although owed almost exclusively to his three-year crusade to the Holy Land), Eystein was in contrast portrayed in the sagas as the \\"peace king\\" who stayed home in Norway and improved the country. As Eystein never engaged in warfare, considerably less information is written and known about him than about his brother Sigurd, despite his twenty-year-long reign, just a few years short of Sigurd. Eystein nonetheless gained the affection of his people, and was highly regarded by the saga writers for his deeds. Eystein and Sigurd's reign became the longest joint rule in Norwegian history. Although the later saga literature narrates stereotypical accounts about the two kings, Eystein is known to have improved the infrastructure and raised buildings and churches, particularly across the coast in Western Norway and Trøndelag, from Bergen to the fishing centre of Lofoten in the north. Eystein's activities were especially centered in Bergen, which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time, helped by his construction projects. His activities in Bergen included moving the royal seat to a more central location in the city and building a new royal palace, as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey. Eystein died of illness in August 1123, and his brother Sigurd thereby became the sole Norwegian king. Background Eystein was born in 1088 or 1089 as the first son of the future king Magnus Barefoot, born to an otherwise unknown mother who is only recorded to have been of \\"low birth\\". Upon the death of his father in 1103 during one of his campaigns in Ireland, Eystein became king together with his two brothers Olaf and Sigurd, all of whom had different mothers. Sigurd was about a year younger than Eystein, while Olaf was more than ten years younger than him. Sigurd was the only son who had accompanied their father Magnus on his campaign in the West, but he returned to Norway after Magnus' death. Many accounts concerning Eystein in later sagas are characterized by literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called mannjevning (literally \\"comparison of men\\") between Eystein and Sigurd, in which the two boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing to regularly clear time to talk with him about what troubled him.Saga of Sigurd the Crusader and his brothers Eystein and Olaf, chapter 18. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein \\"was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size.\\"Saga of Sigurd the Crusader and his brothers Eystein and Olaf, chapter 17. More reliable information, particularly about Eystein's building- projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century. Reign The co- rule between Eystein, Sigurd and Olaf entailed a shared kingship, and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders. During the early years of their reign, Eystein is nonetheless said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag, while Sigurd was in Viken. In practice, only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings, as Olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old, and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a retterbot, a special law ordained by the king, which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson and Ælfgifu (under Cnut the Great) in the early 1030s. The kings became very popular because of this. According to some sources, the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd's planned crusade. Coin thought to represent the co-rule of Eystein and Sigurd, and thus dated to 1115–23. In 1107 or 1108, after years of preparations, Sigurd sailed with a large fleet on a crusade to the Holy Land, the first European king ever to do so. Sigurd arrived back in Norway in 1111. Eystein, on the other hand, did not engage in any warfare, and considerably less information is thus written about him than about Sigurd, although Snorri notes that he \\"had also effected much in the country that was useful while King Sigurd was on his journey.\\"Saga of Sigurd the Crusader and his brothers Eystein and Olaf, chapter 15. While Sigurd gained fame in posterity as the \\"warrior king\\", although mainly because of his one-time crusade,Krag (1995) p. 175 Eystein was portrayed by the saga writers as the \\"peace king\\" who stayed at home and improved the country. Since Sigurd remained king for nineteen years after his crusade with little controversy, historian Claus Krag has considered that the domestic peace probably could be attributed equally to Sigurd.Krag (1995) p. 177 In order to contrast Eystein with Sigurd, Snorri tells a story that Eystein instead subdued Jämtland to the Norwegian crown peacefully through the use of gifts and diplomacy. Despite Snorri's account, historical records indicate that Jämtland did not succumb to Norwegian rule until much later, during the reign of King Sverre in 1178. Eystein and Sigurd are, however, known to have claimed monopoly on the trade and taxation in Finnmarken.Gunnes (1976) p. 345 Fish became an increasingly important commodity during Eystein's reign, as more cod was fished in Northern Norway and the demand for stockfish soared in Europe. As the most suitable port, Bergen became the main trade hub for exporting stockfish, including trade connections with Grimsby in England, while it also served to import much needed goods such as grain and flour. To further the trade, Eystein had fishing booths and a church built in the fishing centre at Vågan in Lofoten in Northern Norway,Gunnes (1976) p. 313 and he sailed north to Lofoten and Trondenes himself in 1114.Bertelsen (1995) p. 18 He also secured the route along the coast by constructing a port in Agdenes on the mouth of the Trondheimsfjord, as well as smaller beacons along the coast. Eystein's port construction in Agdenes was compared by Theodoric the Monk to that of Augustus Caesar at Brundisium, an association readily reflected by Theodoric's use of the Latinised name form \\"Augustinus\\" for Eystein.The Ancient History of the Norwegian Kings, chapter 32, footnote 316. (Otherwise, Pope Callixtus II calls Eystein \\"Aistano\\" in a letter.) The existence of a now lost port in Agdenes dated to around Eystein's reign has been supported by recent archaeological surveys in the area. Snorri also says that Eystein had several large dry-docks built in Nidaros, and that he had a large ship built which \\"in size and shape\\" resembled the great ship Ormen Lange once built by King Olaf Tryggvason.Saga of Sigurd the Crusader and his brothers Eystein and Olaf, chapter 27. Eystein also improved the shelters in the mountain passes, notably at Hjerkinn in Dovre, to more comfortable houses with permanent supervision. In Snorri's mannjevning between Eystein and Sigurd, Eystein allegedly maintains that his own building-projects in Norway were \\"more useful for the country,\\" than \\"you [Sigurd] killing bluemen for the devil in Serkland.\\" Eystein was particularly active in Bergen, and his role in the development of the city was probably more important than that of King Olaf Kyrre, the founder of the city according to the sagas.Gunnes (1976) p. 331 He moved the royal seat in the city from Alrekstad to Holmen on the eastern shore of Vågen, in the city core, thereby rationalising the bureaucracy. At Holmen, he built a Church of the Apostles (probably a stave church)Lidén (1980) p. 137 and a St. Nicholas Church,Hartvedt (1998) p. 7 as well as a royal palace which according to Snorri Sturluson was the most imposing wooden building ever raised in Norway (although Theodoric the Monk who wrote earlier already noted it was \\"now almost collapsed from excessive age\\"). He also built a St. Michael's Church and founded the Benedictine abbey Munkeliv Abbey at Nordnes, and the tithe to the church was introduced during the reign of Eystein and Sigurd. Eystein died on 29 August 1123, not long after he was \\"seized with an illness\\" during a feast at Hustad in Fræna, Møre og Romsdal. Snorri tells that his body thereafter was taken to Nidaros, and buried in the Nidaros Cathedral. According to Snorri, it was \\"generally said that so many mourners never stood over any man's grave in Norway as over King Eystein's,\\" at least since the death of Magnus the Good. The reign of Eystein and Sigurd was the longest joint rule in Norwegian history. Sigurd ruled alone after Eystein's death, until Sigurd's own death in 1130. Family Eystein married Ingebjørg Guttormsdatter, from a prominent noble family of Gudbrandsdalen. Their marriage was part of Eystein's strategy of building alliances in Eastern Norway. They had a daughter, Maria, who became the mother of the future royal pretender Olaf Ugjæva by her marriage to the lendmann Gudbrand Skavhoggsson. Olaf was named king in 1165, during the Norwegian civil war era, but was subsequently defeated by Magnus Erlingsson and forced to flee the country. Legacy Opinions on Eystein have been strongly favourable. Theodoric the Monk wrote about Eystein that he \\"was a paragon of honesty who governed himself no less than his subjects with moderation and wisdom. He was a king who loved peace, an assiduous manager of public affairs, and above all a fosterer of the Christian religion.\\"The Ancient History of the Norwegian Kings, chapter 32. Snorri Sturluson later wrote that Eystein \\"was wise, intelligent, and acquainted with the laws and history. He had much knowledge of mankind, was quick in counsel, prudent in words, and very eloquent and very generous. He was very merry, yet modest; and was liked and beloved, indeed, by all the people.\\" The view of Eystein as a peaceful and domestically active king has been supported by modern historians such as Claus Krag, although noting that the literary embellishments should be disregarded. A stylized marble bust of Eystein, dated to before the middle of the 12th century, was found during excavations at Munkeliv Abbey in 1853, and it represents the oldest known preserved portrait of a Norwegian king.Krag (1995) p. 176 The bust has the inscription \\"EYSTEIN REX\\", and was originally probably part of a full figure statue built into the wall.Lidén (1980) p. 150 The headpiece worn on the bust has been said to resemble a German Imperial crown,Gunnes (1976) p. 340 or to be of a Byzantine type. According to Snorri Sturluson, Eystein had \\"somewhat large eyes\\", which seems to correspond with the bust. Since Snorri may have seen the bust in Bergen himself, it is unclear if his account represents an independent source on Eystein's physical appearance. Today, the bust is located in the collections of Bergen Museum. To commemorate his status as founder of the fishing town Vågan (although it had been an important centre for at least a century), a huge statue of Eystein (Øysteinstatuen) by Arthur Gustavson was raised at Breidablikk in Vågan in 1935,Bertelsen (1995) pp. 18-19 after an idea of architect Harald Sund. At Hjerkinn in Dovre, a church dedicated to Eystein (Eysteinskyrkja) was constructed in 1969 according to a design by Magnus Poulsson, in commemoration of Eystein's construction of a sælehus or shelter near the village.Lunde (1997) p. 44 References Bibliography ;Primary sources * Sturluson, Snorri (c. 1230).

Cruickshank was born in Winnipeg in 1888, the first of 5 children. He moved to England with his family when he was 3 where he moved frequently. In the First World War he initially volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps, but transferred to the London Scottish Regiment. After being injured in the Battle of the Somme he was returned home to recuperate before transferring to Egypt. While in Egypt, on 1 May 1918, he volunteered to carry a message along the front line where he was hit several times by a sniper. For his continued attempts at climbing the slopes of a wadi whilst wounded and under sniper fire, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the war he returned to business work before moving to Southend. After serving in the Home Guard as a Major in the Second World War, he served on several local organisations and committees before dying in Leicestershire in 1961. His medal was donated to his regimental museum. Early life Cruickshank was born in Winnipeg in 1888, the first born of 5 children. His two brothers and two sisters were born in England. His youngest brother, John, died at the age of 10 in 1913, tripping as he alighted from a moving tram and fracturing his skull. He had been out shopping with a friend to buy a Scout's cape. His middle brother, Percy, also volunteered for the Army, and was killed while serving in the Royal Fusiliers on the Western Front in 1917, aged 19. He is buried in France.Casualty details for Percy cruickshank Cruickshank moved to England at the age of 3; his father also called Robert originated from Aberdeen. His father had apparently been working with the Canadian Pacific Railway as an accountant. After the family arrived in England they initially lived in Islington according to the 1891 Census but by the 1901 Census had moved to Woodford. From 1903–1904 he was educated at Bancroft's School, Woodford, Essex. After leaving school, he worked as a travelling salesman, joining first Lipton, then the Lever Company. He was very interested in military matters and joined The City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders), a volunteer unit 1908–1911. At some stage his family moved to Harringay, North London, and he became involved in the Scouting movement shortly after it was established. He became an Assistant Scoutmaster. He was also involved in local politics and was noted as a good speaker. He supported Percy Alden MP in several election campaigns. First World War After war was declared, he initially volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps, but transferred to the London Scottish Regiment. After training he was initially posted to the 1st Battalion in France, where he was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in September 1916 at Leuze Wood. He was evacuated to England, but after recovering, he was posted to the 2nd Battalion and joined them first in Salonika prior to it embarking to Egypt. =Victoria Cross= Robert Baden- Powell is speaking at a Boy Scout event in London in September 1918, where Robert Cruickshank, sitting left, is later honored. He was 29 years old, and a Private in the 2/14th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (London Scottish), British Army when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 1 May 1918 east of the Jordan River, Palestine, in the midst of a pitched battle against Turkish troops, Private Cruickshank volunteered to take a message to company headquarters from his platoon which was in the bottom of a wadi, with its officer and most of the men casualties. The official War Office citation gave the following account: > The platoon to which Private Cruickshank belonged came under very heavy > rifle and machine-gun fire at short range and was led down a steep bank into > a wadi, most of the men being hit before they reached the bottom. > Immediately after reaching the bottom of the wadi the officer in command was > shot dead, and the sergeant who then took over command sent a runner back to > Company Headquarters asking for support, but was mortally wounded almost > immediately after; the corporal having in the meantime been killed, the only > remaining N.C.O.

Private > Cruickshank immediately responded and rushed up the slope, but was hit and > rolled back into the wadi bottom. He again rose and rushed up the slope, > but, being again wounded, rolled back into the wadi. After his wounds had > been dressed he rushed a third time up the slope and again fell badly > wounded.

His wounds were now of such a nature as to preclude him making any > further attempt and he lay all day in a dangerous position, being sniped at > and again wounded here he lay. he displayed the utmost valour and endurance, > and was cheerful and uncomplaining throughout. Citation for Private Robert > Edward Cruickshank, Lond. R. (Harringay)published in The Times, June 22nd > 1918 Following the action he was evacuated back to England where he recovered from his wounds, and was feted as a hero. He received his VC at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1918, his mother and fiancée attending. Post-war period Following the First World War he married Gwendoline Mansell and at some time moved to Southend. He had rejoined Lever Brothers, and worked for them for the next 34 years, involved with the sales of margarine. In 1921 he was one of two Lever Brothers ex-servicemen employees who won a ballot to unveil the Port Sunlight War Memorial. In Southend and elsewhere in Essex he became very involved with the British Legion, serving on several committees and acted as Chairman. In the mid-1930s work took him and Gwendoline to Glen Parva, Leicester, where they settled for the remainder of their lives. During the Second World Cruickshank volunteered for the Home Guard and he achieved the rank of Major. Following the war, he then served for many years on various local organisations, particularly the Glen Parva Parish Council where he served as their Chairman for 14 years, retiring only shortly before his death. He was also an active attendee at Regimental reunions, and kept close ties with former comrades. Cruickshank died on 30 August 1961. He was cremated and his ashes were interred at Glen Parva Parish Church, and his name inscribed in the Book of Remembrance.Burial location of Robert Cruickshank (Leicestershire) His wife, Gwendoline, survived until the age of 103. They had no children. On 29 April 2018, a plaque was unveiled in his honour at Glen Parva Memorial Gardens to commemorate the centenary of his being awarded the VC.

The book is directed to programmers who want to improve their code reading abilities. It discusses specific techniques for reading code written by others and outlines common programming concepts. The code examples used in the book are taken from real-life software, many of them coming from the export-19980407 NetBSD snapshot. Although the programming language of choice is claimed to be balanced, the use of C to illustrate basic concepts predominates. Excerpts from important open-source code systems like the Apache Web server, the hsqldb Java relational database engine, the NetBSD Unix distribution, the Perl language, the Tomcat application server, and the X Window System are presented. The book covers most concepts related to code that are likely to appear before a software developer's eyes, including programming constructs, data types, data structures, control flow, project organization, coding standards, documentation, and architectures. A compact disc with 16 million lines of open-source code, accompanying the book, provides the context for all the presented examples. The end chapters may be the ones of most use to advanced users, as the initial chapters delve into programming language constructs, regular expressions, etc. The book inaugurated Addison-Wesley's Effective Software Development Series, edited by Scott Meyers, and received the 2004 Software Development Productivity Award in the “Technical Books” category.

Alsop Jr. Bridge, is a bridge crossing the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. It was the second bridge built across the river. It carries four lanes of traffic, and is signed as US 1/US 90 (SR 5/SR 10). A lift bridge, it opened in July 1941 at a cost of $1.5 million. In 1957 it was named after Mayor John T. Alsop Jr., but continues to be known, even on road signs, as the Main Street Bridge. It remains one of the most recognizable features of the Downtown Jacksonville skyline. History Construction of the Main Street Bridge began in 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million by the Mount Vernon Bridge Company. It was a War Department permitted in 1936 prior to World War II. The Main Street Bridge took three years to be built and had a dedication ceremony on July 17, 1941. The bridge was built as a vertical lift bridge with use of trusses in order to lift up to accommodate ships passing underneath it. The official name of the bridge, John T. Alsop Jr. Bridge, was dedicated in 1957 to former mayor of Jacksonville John T. Alsop. The bridge carries traffic to and from San Marco, Southbank, Downtown Jacksonville and Interstate 95. In 2014 the Main Street Bridge underwent an $11 million renovation to upgrade metal barriers and patch sidewalks. With other nearby bridges having been rebuilt as fixed spans by around the end of the 20th century, the Main Street Bride is now the only remaining moveable bridge carrying automobile traffic across the St. Johns river in the Jacksonville area. Of the eight vehicle crossings in the region, four (Shands, Fuller Warren, Acosta and Main St.) had included movable spans when they initially opened.

It is adjacent to Loopline Bridge on George's Quay. It deals with mainly DART trains and longer distance commuter trains. Commuter services operate to (1) Maynooth and the western suburbs, (2) Balbriggan, Drogheda and Dundalk on the former GNR(I) main line, (3) Gorey and Rosslare Europort and (4) Newbridge, through the Phoenix Park Tunnel. Description The station has two through platforms above street level with ticket areas and retail outlets at street level. The platform retaining walls, the stairwells and canopies were originally timber planking but upgraded to include escalators and fibreglass panels in the 1970s and 1980s. More recent changes have seen new stairwells installed and platforms lengthened to reflect the increasing throughput. There are proposals to build in the airspace above the station and adjacent property has been acquired for this purpose. The ticket office is open between 06:00-00:00 AM, Monday to Sunday. History The station opened on 1 May 1891. It is on the 'Loop Line' which was constructed towards the end of the 19th century by the City of Dublin Junction Railway, connecting the Dublin & Kingstown terminus at Westland Row (now Pearse Station) and Amiens St (now Connolly Station) on the Great Northern Railway (Ireland), and linked into the Midland Great Western freight line, thus joining up all the main railways in Dublin. =City Centre Resignalling= The completion of the Irish Rail City Centre re-signalling project has seen an: * Increase in the number of Northern and Maynooth line suburban trains stopping at Tara street. * Trains from Newbridge also serving Tara Street station. This has been made possible by increasing the ability of the signalling system in the city centre to operate 20 trains per hour in both directions instead of 8. The project began in March 2015 and was commissioned on 17 July 2016. =Redevelopment= In March 2015, the CIÉ group placed a tender to find a new property development partner for development at Tara Street. The resulting partner, Tanat Ltd, was found in July 2015 and a resulting plan proposed a €130-million development for an office block of 22 levels. In May 2017, Irish property developer Johnny Ronan announced that he would submit plans to Dublin City Council an 88-metre tower which proposed office space, a hotel, bar, and restaurant. The plan was rejected by Dublin City Council in July 2017, a decision upheld by An Bord Pleanála in March 2018. In April 2019, An Bord Pleanála approved the plans for a 22-storey tower. Construction began in July 2019.

She is noted for her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now known most of all for an early, but long-ignored critique of a no hidden-variable theorem by John von Neumann. It has been suggested that, had her critique not remained nearly unknown for decades, the historical development of quantum mechanics might have been very different.  Mathematics  Hermann studied mathematics at Göttingen under Emmy Noether and Edmund Landau, where she achieved her Ph.D. in 1926. Her doctoral thesis, \\"Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale\\" (in English \\"The Question of Finitely Many Steps in Polynomial Ideal Theory\\"), published in Mathematische Annalen, is the foundational paper for computer algebra. It first established the existence of algorithms (including complexity bounds) for many of the basic problems of abstract algebra, such as ideal membership for polynomial rings. Hermann's algorithm for primary decomposition is still in contemporary use.  Assistant to Leonard Nelson  From 1925 to 1927, Hermann worked as assistant for Leonard Nelson.C. L.

Quantum mechanics  As a philosopher, Hermann had a particular interest in the foundations of physics. In 1934, she went to Leipzig \\"for the express purpose of reconciling a neo- Kantian conception of causality with the new quantum mechanics\\".Guido Bacciagaluppi, Elise Crull: Heisenberg (and Schrödinger, and Pauli) on hidden variables, On The History Of The Quantum — The HQ2 Special Issue, Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, vol. 40, no. 4, December 2009, pp. 374–382, 2009, (abstract), p. 10 In Leipzig, many exchanges of thoughts took place among Hermann, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and Werner Heisenberg. The contents of her work in this time, including a focus on a distinction of predictability and causality, are known from three of her own publications,see Michel Bitbol, Pierre Kerszberg, Jean Petitot: Constituting Objectivity: Transcendental Perspectives on Modern Physics, Springer, 2009, , p. 331 ff. and from later description of their discussions by von Weizsäcker,Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, see for example: Jagdish Mehra, Helmut Rechenberg: The Historical Development of Quantum Theory, Volume 6 The Completion of Quantum Mechanics 1926–1941, Part 2, Springer, 2001, , p. 712 f. and the discussion of Hermann's work in chapter ten of Heisenberg's The Part and The Whole. From Denmark, she published her work The foundations of quantum mechanics in the philosophy of nature (German original title: Die naturphilosophischen Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik).

Ushenko (ed.): The Philosophy of Relativity, Science, vol. 85, no. 2217 (25 June 1937), pp. 606-607 Earlier, in 1935, Hermann published a critique of John von Neumann's 1932 proof which was widely claimed to show that a hidden variable theory of quantum mechanics was impossible. Hermann's work on this subject went unnoticed by the physics community until it was independently discovered and published by John Stewart Bell in 1966, and her earlier discovery was pointed out by Max Jammer in 1974. Some have posited that had her critique not remained nearly unknown for decades, her ideas would have put in question the unequivocal acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, by providing a credible basis for the further development of nonlocal hidden variable theories, which would have changed the historical development of quantum mechanics. In 2010, Jeffrey Bub published an argument that Bell (and, thus, also Hermann) had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, claiming that it does not attempt to prove the absolute impossibility of hidden variables, and that it is actually not flawed, after all. The validity of Bub's argument is, in turn, disputed.  Political activism  As Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Hermann participated in the underground movement against the Nazis. She was member of the Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK).Grete Henry-Hermann, Friedrich Ebert Foundation, downloaded 22 January 2012  Emigration and later years  By 1936, Hermann left Germany for Denmark and later France and England. In London, in order to avoid standing out on account of her German provenance, she married a man called Edward Henry early in 1938. Her prescience was justified by events: two years later the British government invoked its hitherto obscure Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, identifying several thousand refugees who had fled Germany for reasons of politics or race as enemy aliens and placing them in internment camps. After the war ended in 1945 she was able to combine her interests in physics and mathematics with political philosophy. She rejoined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) on returning in 1946 to what would become, in 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Starting in 1947 she was one of those contributing behind the scenes to the Bad Godesberg Programme, prepared under the leadership of her longstanding ISK comrade Willi Eichler, and issued in 1959, which provided a detailed modernising platform that carried the party into government in the 1960s. She was nominated professor for philosophy and physics at the Pädagogische Hochschule in Bremen and played a relevant role in the Gewerkschaft Erziehung und Wissenschaft. From 1961 to 1978, she presided over the Philosophisch-Politische Akademie, an organisation founded by Nelson in 1922, oriented towards education, social justice, responsible political action and its philosophical basis.Philosophisch-Politische Akademie (in German language), downloaded 22 January 2012  Works  ;Articles: * Grete Hermann: Die naturphilosophischen Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik, Naturwissenschaften, Volume 23, Number 42, 718-721, (preview in German language) * Grete Hermann: Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale.

It appears on a variety of objects from the archaeological record of the ancient Germanic peoples. The term valknut is derived from the modern era, and the term or terms used to refer to the symbol during its historical employment is unknown. Scholars have proposed a variety of explanations for the symbol, sometimes associating it with the god Odin, and it has been compared to the three-horned symbol found on the 9th-century Snoldelev Stone, to which it may be related.Simek (2007:163). The valknut receives sporadic use in modern popular culture and is again associated with Germanic paganism by way of its modern-day revival, Heathenry. Archaeological record Stora Hammars I stone in Gotland, Sweden depicts a valknut in a central and predominant position, appearing alongside figures interpreted as Odin with a characteristic spear shunting another figure into a burial mound while a raven is overhead and another man is hanged. The valknut appears on a wide variety of objects found in areas inhabited by the Germanic peoples. The symbol is prominently featured on the Nene River Ring, an Anglo-Saxon gold finger ring dated to around the 8th to 9th centuries.The British Museum Online. Entry no. 1855,1115.1 A wooden bed in the Viking Age Oseberg Ship buried near Tønsberg, Norway features a carving of the symbol on an ornately stylized bedpost and the Oseberg Tapestry, a partially preserved tapestry found within the ship burial, also features the symbol.Davidson (1967:125). Additionally, the valknut appears prominently on two picture stones from Gotland, Sweden: the Stora Hammars I stone and the Tängelgårda stone. The historically attested instances of the symbol appear in two traditional, topologically distinct, forms. The symbol appears in unicursal form, topologically a trefoil knot also seen in the triquetra. This unicursal form is found, for example, on the Tängelgårda stone. The symbol also appears in tricursal form, consisting of three linked triangles, topologically equivalent to the Borromean rings. This tricursal form can be seen on one of the Stora Hammars stones, as well as upon the Nene River Ring, and on the Oseberg ship bed post. Although other forms are topologically possible, these are the only attested forms found so far. In Norwegian Bokmål, the term valknute is used for a polygon with a loop on each of its corners.Municipal arms for Lødingen, blazoned in the Norwegian Royal Decree of 11 May 1984, quoted in Hans Cappelen og Knut Johannessen: Norske kommunevåpen, Oslo 1987, page 197. The term is also used in Anders Bjønnes: Segltegninger fra hyllingene i Norge 1591 og 1610, Oslo 2010, pages 64–65. In the English language the looped four-cornered symbol is called Saint John's Arms. Theories and interpretations Several explanations for the symbol have been proposed: =Hrungnir's heart= Chapter 17 of the 13th century Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál contains the following description of the heart of the jötunn Hrungnir; \\"Hrungnir had a heart that was famous. It was made of hard stone with three sharp-pointed corners just like the carved symbol hrungnishjarta [Hrungnir's heart].\\"Byock (2001:88). Comparisons have been made between this symbol description and the symbol known as the valknut. =Odin and mental binds= The Tängelgårda stone from Gotland, Sweden features valknuts below a depiction of a horse Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes a connection between the valknut, the god Odin and \\"mental binds\\": > For instance, beside the figure of Odin on his horse shown on several > memorial stones there is a kind of knot depicted, called the valknut, > related to the triskele. This is thought to symbolize the power of the god > to bind and unbind, mentioned in the poems and elsewhere. Odin had the power > to lay bonds upon the mind, so that men became helpless in battle, and he > could also loosen the tensions of fear and strain by his gifts of battle- > madness, intoxication, and inspiration.Davidson (1990:147). Davidson says that similar symbols are found beside figures of wolves and ravens on \\"certain cremation urns\\" from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in East Anglia. =Other= Due to the fact that the symbol appears on picture stones with Odin and on burial gifts in the Oseberg ship burial, Rudolf Simek says that the symbol may have been associated with religious practices surrounding death. Topology The valknut is topologically equivalent to either the Borromean rings, the trefoil knot, or (in modern use only) a closed three-link chain, depending on the particular artistic depiction: File:Valknut-Symbol- borromean.svgThe valknut as Borromean rings (Knot Atlas L6a4) File:Valknut-Symbol-triquetra.svgThe valknut as trefoil knot or triquetra (unicursal) (Knot Atlas 3_1) File:Valknut-Symbol-3linkchain-closed.svgThe valknut as closed 3-link chain (Knot Atlas L6n1) File:Sacrificial scene on Hammars - Valknut.pngAs Borromean rings on the Stora Hammars I stone Modern use The valknut symbol plays a role in modern Heathenry, where numerous explanations and interpretations of the symbol are given. It has been used by various political groups, and sometimes sees use in modern popular culture. In Europe, the Swedish pulp and paper manufacturer and consumer goods company Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget uses a triquetra valknut as their logo, which can be commonly seen on many products produced by the company; the DFB has used a logo inspired by the unicursal form of the valknut for the Germany national football team since 1991. The symbol appears as the fretboard inlay on some of Arch Enemy/Carcass guitarist Michael Amott's signature Dean Guitars \\"Tyrant\\" models, and it is also used as a logo by American engineering firm RedViking.RedViking home page. The symbol, like many others associated with Germanic paganism, has been appropriated by some white nationalist groups to represent their heritage.\\"Hate on Display - Hate Symbols Database: Valknot\\". Anti-Defamation League. Despite this, the valknut has not been classified as generally objectionable by the German government.

Oil paint dries at different rates due to the differing drying properties of the constituent pigment. However, everything else being equal, the higher the oil to pigment ratio, the longer the oil binder will take to oxidize, and the more flexible the paint film will be. Conversely, the lower the oil content, the faster the paint dries, and the more brittle it will be. Ignoring this practice, even in some alla prima painting, may result in a cracked and less durable paint film. It has been claimed by some paint manufacturers that the 'fat-over-lean' principle can be circumvented by using synthetic, alkyd-based painting media such as Galkyd and Liquin. These media do provide consistent drying times, increase the paint film flexibility, and promote adhesion between paint layers. However, because classical painting media, turpentine, natural resins, and certain plant oils (linseed, walnut and poppy) have lasted for centuries when applied properly, some artists choose to avoid synthetic media since their long-term stability is unknown.

Her father, Yakov Ramberg (1855–1928), born in Vištytis, a small town in Suwałki Governorate (nowadays in Lithuania), was a learned merchant and Hebrew publisher and lexicographer, and a Zionist. Her mother, Eiga Ramberg (née Lap), born in the town of Suchowola (nowadays in north-east Poland), daughter of Rabbi Elhanan Tzvi Lap, was a community worker.\\"Ramberg, Eiga,\\" in: Sefer Halshim: Lexicon Eretzyisra'eli, Tel Aviv: Masada, 5697 [1937], p. 2023. (Hebrew) Rambert was the fourth of seven children. The eldest child, Rakhel, was the wife of Hebrew writer Micha Josef Berdyczewski. The second, Ewa Ramberg-Figulla, was a Slavist, the wife of German Hittitologist Hugo Heinrich Figull and mother of physicist Johannes FigullaAvner Holtzman, An Image Before my Eyes, Tel Aviv: Am Oved (Ofakim), 2001, pp. 29–33, 240 (Hebrew). Rambert had a third older Sister, Wella Alapin; younger twin siblings, Hanan and Dvora; and another young brother, Eliezer (Julius) (ibid). (father-in-law of German writer Christoph Hein and grandfather of German writer Jakob Hein). Rambert met her husband Ashley Dukes, a soldier on leave, at a dinner party in 1917. In Rambert's autobiography she says \\"after four days of personal meetings, and seven months of correspondence we were married on 3 March 1918.\\"Marie Rambert, \\"Quicksilver: Autobiography\\" (London: St Martin's Press, 1972), p. 94. This was done partly as a joke so that Dukes could get four weeks of extended leave instead of two days. Their marriage lasted 41 years, until he died in 1959; the couple had two daughters, Angela (1920–2006) and Helena. The poet, Aidan Andrew Dun, is her grandson. Training Rambert began her dance training in her schooling early on. Subjects like foreign languages and history seemed to come easy; however she was a restless child and ended up getting bad marks because of her endless movements during class. At one point in her early training her dance instructor stated that 'In her, was the true spirit of dance.'Mary Clark and Marie Rambert \\"Dancers of Mercury; the story of Ballet Rambert\\" (London, A & C Black, 1962), p. 15. She was unimpressed with the structure and performance of ballet, and was not drawn into dance as a passion until she became enthralled by Isadora Duncan when she attended one of Duncan's performances, and was 'profoundly moved by the beauty of Duncan's dance.'Marie Rambert, \\"Quicksilver\\", page 24. In 1905, after becoming active in political riots, and the tragic day of May Day, Rambert's parents urged her at one point to move to Paris and take up medicine while safely living with her aunt and uncle who were also doctors. She attended a party where she danced a mazurka and danced it with such liveliness that there was applause afterwards; this was her first performance, whether she thought it or not. She met Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora, at this same party, who congratulated her on a wonderful performance, and again she was back into her passion for dance. She studied with Madame Rat from the Paris Opera, and later studied with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, at Dalcroze College who introduced her to eurhythmics. One day at the Dalcroze College, Sergei Diaghilev, watched a class and then asked her to come back to Berlin and study with him in the Ballets Russes. There, Rambert aided them with figuring out Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring with Vaslav Nijinsky. She hesitantly accepted and collaborated with the Ballets Russes led by Diaghilev from 1912–1913. In Ballet Russes she was in the corps de ballet for ballet performances such as Swan Lake, Giselle, and Scheherazade. After a tour with Nijinsky and Ballet Russes, Rambert's contract was not continued and she decided it was time for a new chapter. In 1914 she moved to the United Kingdom, and studied under Enrico Cecchetti.Jane Pritchard, \\"Rambert: A Celebration of the Company’s First Seventy Years\\" (London, Rambert Dance Company 1996), pp. 13–20. Ballet Rambert Blue plaque, 19 Campden Hill Gardens, London After studying with Cecchetti, she went back to study with Madame Rat at the Paris Opera, and took her studies quite seriously. She began teaching more ballet classes in 1919 and later founded her own ballet school in Bedford Gardens. In 1926 she created her own company, originally named Ballet Club. It has been through many name changes, much like Rambert herself. The company began performing at night revues in London. The first informal show was performed in Riverside Nights at the Lyric Theatre, and continued with the nightly revues for a while. She began finding new and promising dancers and choreographers in numerous places, such as Frederick Ashton, to be a part of her company and gave them a chance to grow. From Marie Rambert Dancers, the company changed to Ballet Rambert , later Rambert Dance Company, and from 2014 just named Rambert, a contemporary dance company which tours internationally. It dates its birth to the first performance of Frederick Ashton's A Tragedy of Fashion (1926), making it the first ballet company in Britain. Ashley Dukes, Marie's husband, renovated a building and made it into Mercury Theatre, where the majority of Ballet Rambert's performance occurred. It was said that 'Notting Hill Gate, where the Mercury Theatre stood, was on the slopes of Olympus'.Jane Pritchard, \\"Celebration\\", p. 12. Ballet Rambert has performed such ballets as Coppelia, as well as Balanchine's Night Shadow. Rambert was adamant about finding new and upcoming choreographers. Some of her students and later her colleagues included Ashton, Antony Tudor, and Agnes de Mille, to name a few. In 1965 Rambert, with the help of \\"Norman Morrice, her newest discovery, completely reorganized the company to stress modern dance\\".Jack Anderson,\\"Ballet and Modern Dance: A Concise History\\", (Princeton, New Jersey Book Company, 1986), p. 185. and The repertoire of the company eventually came back to more contemporary ballets, but still has a vast list of pieces that the company has performed throughout the years. She cooperated with Millicent Hodson, to restore Nijinsky's choreography of The Rite of Spring in 1979. The restoration of choreography was completed in 1987. Rambert is known for helping to create and keep the ballet community strong in Britain. \\"The creation of Ballet in Britain is one of the grandest achievements in the artistic annals of our century. It is owed absolutely to the idealism which fired Rambert and Ninette de Valois\\",Jane Pritchard, \\"Celebration\\", p. 16. the founder of The Royal Ballet. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1962 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate. Death She died on 12 June 1982 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 17 June. Her ashes are within the Cloister Walk in section B.

A picture stone, image stone or figure stone is an ornate slab of stone, usually limestone, which was raised in Germanic Iron Age or Viking Age Scandinavia, and in the greatest number on Gotland.The article Bildstenar in Nationalencyklopedin (1990).Hadenius, Stig; Nilsson, Torbjörn; Åselius, Gunnar (1996) Sveriges historia: vad varje svensk bör veta. Bonnier Alba, Borås. p. 28. More than four hundred picture stones are known today.A presentation at the County Museum of Gotland. All of the stones were probably erected as memorial stones, but only rarely beside graves. Some of them have been positioned where many people could see them at bridges and on roads. They mainly differ from runestones by presenting the message in pictures rather than runes. Some picture stones also have runic inscriptions, but they tell little more than to whom the stone was dedicated. Lacking textual explanations, the image stones are consequently difficult to interpret. Similar stones in Scotland are known as Pictish stones.  Groups  The dating of the stones is based on studies of their shapes and ornamentations. Subsequently, three distinct groups of stones exist with various aesthetics, locations and purposes. = 400-600 CE = The first group of picture stones was made in the period 400–600 CE. These have a straight form and the upper part is shaped like the edge of an axe. The ornamentations are usually circular forms with vortex patterns and spirals, but also with images of ships, people, and animals. These older stones were usually raised within grave fields, albeit not on the graves themselves. = 500-700 CE = The second group of picture stones come from the period 500–700 CE, and they are small stones with stylized patterns. Detail of Odin entering Valhalla riding on Sleipnir from the Tjängvide image stone. = 700-1100 CE = The third group was made in the period 700–1100 CE and they consist of tall stones with necks and tall bow-shaped profiles. Their ornamentations present a rich array of pictures: ships with checkered sails and scenes with figures in different fields. The borders are often decorated with various plaited patterns. Many scenes show sacrifices and battles, and a common scene on the stones is a man, riding a horse, welcomed by a woman holding a drinking horn. What is seen are representations of a wealth of legends and myths. Sometimes depictions from Norse mythology and Norse legends can be identified, but largely the stories behind them have not survived in written form. The image stones are valuable sources which complete knowledge from archaeology concerning ships and sails, and they provide information on armor, wagons, and sleighs. The later stones in this group feature an upper field with stylized cross and dragon patterns in the style of some runestones. These stones usually were raised on roads and at bridges to be visible.  Isle of Man  Image stones on display in Gotland Museum The largest of the picture stones on Gotland is found in Änge in Buttle. It is tall and is richly ornamented in the style of the 8th century.

The theorem was first proven by for the special case of polynomial rings and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by . The Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and more generally the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in algebraic geometry, by asserting that every algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of irreducible components. It has a straightforward extension to modules stating that every submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary submodules. This contains the case for rings as a special case, considering the ring as a module over itself, so that ideals are submodules. This also generalizes the primary decomposition form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, and for the special case of polynomial rings over a field, it generalizes the decomposition of an algebraic set into a finite union of (irreducible) varieties. The first algorithm for computing primary decompositions for polynomial rings over a field of characteristic 0Primary decomposition requires testing irreducibility of polynomials, which is not always algorithmically possible in nonzero characteristic. was published by Noether's student . The decomposition does not hold in general for non-commutative Noetherian rings. Noether gave an example of a non-commutative Noetherian ring with a right ideal that is not an intersection of primary ideals. Primary decomposition of an ideal Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. An ideal I of R is called primary if it is a proper ideal and for each pair of elements x and y in R such xy is in I, either x or some power of y is in I; equivalently, every zero-divisor in the quotient R/I is nilpotent. The radical of a primary ideal Q is a prime ideal and Q is said to be mathfrak{p}-primary for mathfrak{p} = sqrt{Q}. Let I be an ideal in R. Then I has an irredundant primary decomposition into primary ideals: :I = Q_1 cap cdots cap Q_n . Irredundancy means: *Removing any of the Q_i changes the intersection, i.e. for each i we have: cap_{j e i} Q_j otsubset Q_i. *The prime ideals sqrt{Q_i} are all distinct. Moreover, this decomposition is unique in the two ways: *The set { sqrt{Q_i} mid i } is uniquely determined by I, and *If mathfrak{p} = sqrt{Q_i} is a minimal element of the above set, then Q_i is uniquely determined by I; in fact, Q_i is the pre-image of I R_{mathfrak{p}} under the localization map R to R_{mathfrak{p}}. Primary ideals which correspond to non-minimal prime ideals over I are in general not unique (see an example below). For the existence of the decomposition, see #Primary decomposition from associated primes below. The elements of { sqrt{Q_i} mid i } are called the prime divisors of I or the primes belonging to I. In the language of module theory, as discussed below, the set { sqrt{Q_i} mid i } is also the set of associated primes of the R-module R/I. Explicitly, that means that there exist elements g_1, dots, g_n in R such that :sqrt{Q_i} = { f in R mid fg_i in I }.In other words, sqrt{Q_i} = (I : g_i) is the ideal quotient. By a way of shortcut, some authors call an associated prime of R/I simply an associated prime of I (note this practice will conflict with the usage in the module theory). *The minimal elements of { sqrt{Q_i} mid i } are the same as the minimal prime ideals containing I and are called isolated primes. *The non-minimal elements, on the other hand, are called the embedded primes. In the case of the ring of integers mathbb Z, the Lasker–Noether theorem is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. If an integer n has prime factorization n = pm p_1^{d_1} cdots p_r^{d_r}, then the primary decomposition of the ideal langle n rangle generated by in mathbb Z, is :langle nrangle = langle p_1^{d_1} rangle cap cdots cap langle p_r^{d_r}rangle. Similarly, in a unique factorization domain, if an element has a prime factorization f = u p_1^{d_1} cdots p_r^{d_r}, where is a unit, then the primary decomposition of the principal ideal generated by is :langle frangle = langle p_1^{d_1} rangle cap cdots cap langle p_r^{d_r}rangle. =Examples= The examples of the section are designed for illustrating some properties of primary decompositions, which may appear as surprising or counter-intuitive. All examples are ideals in a polynomial ring over a field . Intersection vs. product The primary decomposition in k[x,y,z] of the ideal I=langle x,yz rangle is :I = langle x,yz rangle = langle x,y rangle cap langle x,z rangle. Because of the generator of degree one, is not the product of two larger ideals. A similar example is given, in two indeterminates by :I = langle x,y(y+1) rangle = langle x,y rangle cap langle x,y+1 rangle. Primary vs. prime power In k[x,y], the ideal langle x,y^2 rangle is a primary ideal that has langle x,y rangle as associated prime. It is not a power of its associated prime. Non-uniqueness and embedded prime  For every positive integer , a primary decomposition in k[x,y] of the ideal I=langle x^2, xy rangle is :I = langle x^2,xy rangle = langle x rangle cap langle x^2, xy, y^n rangle. The associated primes are :langle x rangle subset langle x,y rangle. Example: Let N = R = k[x, y] for some field k, and let M be the ideal (xy, y2). Then M has two different minimal primary decompositions M = (y) ∩ (x, y2) = (y) ∩ (x + y, y2). The minimal prime is (y) and the embedded prime is (x, y). Non-associated prime between two associated primes In k[x,y,z], the ideal I=langle x^2, xy, xz rangle has the (non-unique) primary decomposition :I = langle x^2,xy, xz rangle = langle x rangle cap langle x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz rangle. The associated prime ideals are langle x rangle subset langle x,y,z rangle, and langle x, y rangle is a non associated prime ideal such that :langle x rangle subset langle x,y rangle subset langle x,y,z rangle. A complicated example Unless for very simple examples, a primary decomposition may be hard to compute and may have a very complicated output. The following example has been designed for providing such a complicated output, and, nevertheless, being accessible to hand-written computation. Let : begin {align} P&=a_0x^m + a_1x^{m-1}y +cdots +a_my^m  Q&=b_0x^n + b_1x^{n-1}y +cdots +b_ny^n end {align} be two homogeneous polynomials in , whose coefficients a_1, ldots, a_m, b_0, ldots, b_n are polynomials in other indeterminates z_1, ldots, z_h over a field . That is, and belong to R=k[x,y,z_1, ldots, z_h], and it is in this ring that a primary decomposition of the ideal I=langle P,Qrangle is searched. For computing the primary decomposition, we suppose first that 1 is a greatest common divisor of and . This condition implies that has no primary component of height one. As is generated by two elements, this implies that it is a complete intersection (more precisely, it defines an algebraic set, which is a complete intersection), and thus all primary components have height two. Therefore, the associated primes of are exactly the primes ideals of height two that contain . It follows that langle x,yrangle is an associated prime of . Let Din k[z_1, ldots, z_h] be the homogeneous resultant in of and . As the greatest common divisor of and is a constant, the resultant is not zero, and resultant theory implies that contains all products of by a monomial in of degree . As D otin langle x,yrangle, all these monomials belong to the primary component contained in langle x,yrangle. This primary component contains and , and the behavior of primary decompositions under localization shows that this primary component is :{texists e, D^et in I}. In short, we have a primary component, with the very simple associated prime langle x,yrangle, such all its generating sets involve all indeterminates. The other primary component contains . One may prove that if and are sufficiently generic (for example if the coefficients of and are distinct indeterminates), then there is only another primary component, which is a prime ideal, and is generated by , and . = Geometric interpretation = In algebraic geometry, an affine algebraic set is defined as the set of the common zeros of an ideal of a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,ldots, x_n]. An irredundant primary decomposition :I=Q_1capcdotscap Q_r of defines a decomposition of into a union of algebraic sets , which are irreducible, as not being the union of two smaller algebraic sets. If P_i is the associated prime of Q_i, then V(P_i)=V(Q_i), and Lasker–Noether theorem shows that has a unique irredundant decomposition into irreducible algebraic varieties :V(I)=bigcup V(P_i), where the union is restricted to minimal associated primes. These minimal associated primes are the primary components of the radical of . For this reason, the primary decomposition of the radical of is sometimes called the prime decomposition of . The components of a primary decomposition (as well as of the algebraic set decomposition) corresponding to minimal primes are said isolated, and the others are said '. For the decomposition of algebraic varieties, only the minimal primes are interesting, but in intersection theory, and, more generally in scheme theory, the complete primary decomposition has a geometric meaning.  Primary decomposition from associated primes  Nowadays, it is common to do primary decomposition of ideals and modules within the theory of associated primes. Influential Bourbaki's textbook Algèbre commutative, in particular, takes this approach. Let R be a ring and M a module over it. By definition, an associated prime is a prime ideal appearing in the set { operatorname{Ann}(m)  0 eq m in M } = the set of annihilators of nonzero elements of M. Equivalently, a prime ideal mathfrak{p} is an associated prime of M if there is an injection of an R-module R/mathfrak{p} hookrightarrow M. A maximal element of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements of M can be shown to be a prime ideal and thus, when R is a Noetherian ring, M is nonzero if and only if there exists an associated prime of M. The set of associated primes of M is denoted by operatorname{Ass}_R(M) or operatorname{Ass}(M). Directly from the definition, *If M = bigoplus_i M_i, then operatorname{Ass}(M) = bigcup_i operatorname{Ass}(M_i). *For an exact sequence 0 to N to M to L to 0, operatorname{Ass}(N) subset operatorname{Ass}(M) subset operatorname{Ass}(N) cup operatorname{Ass}(L). *If R is a Noetherian ring, then operatorname{Ass}(M) subset operatorname{Supp}(M) where operatorname{Supp} refers to support. Also, the set of minimal elements of operatorname{Ass}(M) is the same as the set of minimal elements of operatorname{Supp}(M). If M is a finitely generated module over R, then there is a finite ascending sequence of submodules : 0=M_0subsetneq M_1subsetneqcdotssubsetneq M_{n-1}subsetneq M_n=M, such that each quotient Mi/Mi−1 is isomorphic to R/mathfrak{p}_i for some prime ideals mathfrak{p}_i, each of which is necessarily in the support of M. Moreover every associated prime of M occurs among the set of primes mathfrak{p}_i; i.e., :operatorname{Ass}(M) subset { mathfrak{p}_0, dots, mathfrak{p}_n } subset operatorname{Supp}(M). (In general, these inclusions are not the equalities.) In particular, operatorname{Ass}(M) is a finite set when M is finitely generated. Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring R and N a submodule of M. Given operatorname{Ass}(M/N) = { mathfrak{p}_1, dots, mathfrak{p}_n }, the set of associated primes of M/N, there exist submodules Q_i subset M such that operatorname{Ass}(M/Q_i) = { mathfrak{p}_i } and :N = bigcap_{i=1}^n Q_i.Here is the proof of the existence of the decomposition (following Bourbaki). Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring R and N a submodule. To show N admits a primary decomposition, by replacing M by M/N, it is enough to show that when N = 0. Now, :0 = cap Q_i iff emptyset = operatorname{Ass}(cap Q_i) = cap operatorname{Ass}(Q_i) where Q_i are primary submodules of M. In other words, 0 has a primary decomposition if, for each associated prime P of M, there is a primary submodule Q such that P otin operatorname{Ass}(Q). Now, consider the set { N subseteq M  P otin operatorname{Ass}(N) } (which is nonempty since zero is in it). The set has a maximal element Q since M is a Noetherian module. If Q is not P-primary, say, P' e P is associated with M/Q, then R/P' simeq Q'/Q for some submodule Q', contradicting the maximality. Thus, Q is primary and the proof is complete. Remark: The same proof shows that if R, M, N are all graded, then Q_i in the decomposition may be taken to be graded as well. A submodule N of M is called mathfrak{p}-primary if operatorname{Ass}(M/N) = { mathfrak{p} }. A submodule of the R-module R is mathfrak{p}-primary as a submodule if and only if it is a mathfrak{p}-primary ideal; thus, when M = R, the above decomposition is precisely a primary decomposition of an ideal. Taking N = 0, the above decomposition says the set of associated primes of a finitely generated module M is the same as { operatorname{Ass}(M/Q_i)  i } when 0 = cap_1^n Q_i (without finite generation, there can be infinitely many associated primes.)  Properties of associated primes  Let R be a Noetherian ring. Then *The set of zero-divisors on R is the same as the union of the associated primes of R (this is because the set of zerodivisors of R is the union of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements, the maximal elements of which are associated primes). * For the same reason, the union of the associated primes of an R-module M is exactly the set of zero-divisors on M, that is, an element r such that the endomorphism m mapsto rm, M to M is not injective. * Given a subset Phi subset operatorname{Ass}(M), M an R-module , there exists a submodule N subset M such that operatorname{Ass}(N) = operatorname{Ass}(M) - Phi and operatorname{Ass}(M/N) = Phi. *Let S subset R be a multiplicative subset, M an R-module and Phi the set of all prime ideals of R not intersecting S. Then *:mathfrak{p} mapsto S^{-1}mathfrak{p}, , operatorname{Ass}_R(M)cap Phi to operatorname{Ass}_{S^{-1}R}(S^{-1} M) :is a bijection. Also, operatorname{Ass}_R(M)cap Phi = operatorname{Ass}_R(S^{-1}M). * Any prime ideal minimal with respect to containing an ideal J is in mathrm{Ass}_R(R/J). These primes are precisely the isolated primes. * A module M over R has finite length if and only if M is finitely generated and mathrm{Ass}(M) consists of maximal ideals.. *Let A to B be a ring homomorphism between Noetherian rings and F a B-module that is flat over A. Then, for each A-module E, :operatorname{Ass}_B(E otimes_A F) = bigcup_{mathfrak{p} in operatorname{Ass}(E)} operatorname{Ass}_B(F/mathfrak{p}F).  Non- Noetherian case  The next theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ring to have primary decompositions for its ideals. The proof is given at Chapter 4 of Atiyah–MacDonald as a series of exercises. There is the following uniqueness theorem for an ideal having a primary decomposition. Now, for any commutative ring R, an ideal I and a minimal prime P over I, the pre- image of I RP under the localization map is the smallest P-primary ideal containing I. Thus, in the setting of preceding theorem, the primary ideal Q corresponding to a minimal prime P is also the smallest P-primary ideal containing I and is called the P-primary component of I. For example, if the power Pn of a prime P has a primary decomposition, then its P-primary component is the n-th symbolic power of P. Additive theory of ideals This result is the first in an area now known as the additive theory of ideals, which studies the ways of representing an ideal as the intersection of a special class of ideals. The decision on the \\"special class\\", e.g., primary ideals, is a problem in itself. In the case of non-commutative rings, the class of tertiary ideals is a useful substitute for the class of primary ideals. Notes References *M. Atiyah, I.G.

On 9 August 1987, he shot dead seven people and injured 19 during a shooting spree in Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia, in what became known in Australian history as the Hoddle Street massacre. Knight is currently serving seven concurrent sentences of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years. The judge who sentenced him, Justice George Hampel, stated that there were 'a number of significant mitigatory factors' and 'the fixing of a minimum term in this case is appropriate because of your age and your prospects of rehabilitation.'R v Knight ; [1989] VR 705. The Crown prosecutor, Joe Dickson QC, 'did not contend that a minimum term should not be fixed.' Knight currently resides in the maximum security Port Phillip Prison in Truganina, Victoria near Melbourne and was eligible for parole in 2014, until the Victorian government passed and subsequently approved of legislation which ensures that he is kept in jail until he dies, is in immediate danger of dying or is so incapacitated that he no longer poses a danger to others. Knight has appealed against such legislation numerous times, but lost his final appeal to the High Court in August 2017.  Early life  Julian Knight is the eldest of three children. He was adopted by a family with strong army ties when he was ten days old. Knight moved often as a child, living in Melbourne and Puckapunyal, and also abroad in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In early 1975, Knight's family settled in Laverton, Victoria, and he attended Laverton Primary School until the end of 1978. His parents divorced in 1980, when Knight was 12. He subsequently attended Westbourne Grammar School, Fitzroy High School and later Melbourne High School, a selective secondary school with entry by academic examination. An entry written by students in the 1985 Melbourne High School yearbook says: Julian 'Swapo' Knight inherited the role of \\"cadet unit looney and chief political agitator\\". While at Westbourne he was noted for his fascination with guns and the military, with strong interests in Nazi Germany and World War II. In 1986 he attended La Trobe University to study French, German history and politics. Knight has an IQ of 132, well above average.  Military career  Knight joined the Australian Army Cadets at the age of 14 and served in two cadet units, the Norwood High School Cadet Unit and the Melbourne HSCU. He later enlisted in the Army Reserve at the age of 17 while still in high school, serving as a trooper the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment, an armoured reconnaissance unit. Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon on 13 January 1987, at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he performed poorly at studies and gained good results only in weapons expertise exercises. Knight was advised to leave the army after an incident in which he stabbed his superior, a sergeant, while drinking. Hoddle Street massacre On the evening of Sunday, 9 August 1987, Knight began a shooting rampage in Hoddle Street in the Melbourne suburb of Clifton Hill. The shootings resulted in the deaths of seven people, and serious injury to nineteen others. After a police chase lasting more than thirty minutes, Knight was captured in nearby Fitzroy North and arrested for the shootings. During the trial, it was asserted that Knight has a personality disorder with hysterical features. He was sentenced to seven concurrent terms of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years.  Prison life  Knight is currently an inmate in the mainstream section of the maximum security Port Phillip Prison near Melbourne. He has initiated many legal challenges to the Victorian government while imprisoned. Knight's challenges often concern events and occurrences arising during his imprisonment and his dissatisfaction with prison management and prison discipline. He has spent twelve years of his sentence in High Security management facilities. Shortly before Knight became eligible for parole in 2014, the Victorian government passed the Corrections Amendment (Parole) Act 2014 (Vic), which amended the Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) to prevent the parole board from ordering Knight's release 'unless satisfied, amongst other things, that Mr Knight is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated and that, as a result, he no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person.'Knight v Victoria . = Legal challenges = On 7 September 1992, Knight appeared before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal seeking a review of a decision where he was refused AUSTUDY assistance with his university studies while imprisoned.Re Julian Knight and Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training . On 22 October 2001, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria in his first Supreme Court case against the prison authorities, seeking an injunction ordering the return of documents prepared for the inquest into the death of a prisoner who had hanged himself in 2000. The documents were returned in court that day and the application was dismissed. On 4 July 2002, Knight appeared before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) with a complaint regarding an abuse of human rights where prison officers removed items \\"of a political nature\\" from his cell. The items removed were a collection of business cards, pamphlets and sheets of paper. One sheet of the paper had a large picture of Adolf Hitler in uniform. A second had a picture of Hitler with Nazi insignia and skull and cross-bones, and others only the insignia. The cards featured slogans such as \\"Stop the Asian invasion\\", \\"We just hate all queers\\", \\"White power\\" and \\"Dial-a-racist\\" with contact details.Knight v CORE . Along with the posters and paperwork, a large amount of contraband items were also located in Knight's cell, such as blades, sharpened knives, white supremacist literature, war literature, medication bottles, a leather belt, two television remote controls, an extension lead, a can opener, bale hooks, permanent markers, computer disks - many containing information relating to prison security and staff, pornographic material, sandpaper, masking tape, prison manuals, staff pictures, T.A.B. betting information, and prison and staff rosters. Knight's application was dismissed, even though many of the seized items were returned to him. On 21 August 2002, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking an injunction ordering that prison management and staff cease inspecting and withholding legal mail sent to or by the plaintiff. The application was dismissed. On 2 September 2002, Knight appeared before VCAT seeking access to various prison documents under the Freedom of Information Act. On 9 September, Knight appeared before the VCAT seeking, \\"Full access to the daily staff rosters for HM Prison Barwon since the 1st May 2001\\" under the Freedom of Information Act. The application was affirmed. On 7 October 2003, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking injunctions in regards to opening of private legal mail, prison disciplinary hearings, conditions in solitary confinement cells and Knight's security classification and imprisonment in Barwon Prison's high security Acacia wing. Supreme Court Judge Justice Philip Cummins said of Knight's application, \\"I consider that ordinary tax-payers should not be fixed with the burden of these proceedings. Accordingly, in each instance I order that the costs of the proceedings of the respective defendants be paid by the plaintiff.\\".Knight v Minister for Corrections . The application was dismissed. On 11 November 2003, Knight appeared before the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking an extension of time against a decision of VCAT. The application was dismissed with costs awarded against the applicant. On 26 November 2013, Knight made a 94-page submission to the Defence Abuse Response Task Force (DART). In 2014 he initiated court proceedings in the ACT Supreme Court against the Commonwealth of Australia seeking damages for the bastardization he allegedly suffered whilst at Duntroon. = Vexatious litigant = In February 2003, it was estimated the many legal challenges by Knight had cost the Victorian government over A$250,000, and approximately $128,000 had been spent since October 2001 on external legal advice to deal with Knight's legal appeals and Freedom of Information requests. On 19 October 2004, Knight was barred from launching any further legal action in Victoria's courts for ten years with a judge declaring him a vexatious litigant.Hoddle Street killer banned from court , The Age, 19 October 2004 He was the thirteenth person to be declared a vexatious litigant in Victoria since 1930, and the first prisoner. Knight is still able to make requests under the Freedom of Information Act. On 19 June 2008, Knight made a submission to the Victorian Parliament Law Reform Committee's Inquiry into Vexatious Litigants.Submission VL/14 = Requests for rehabilitation = On 26 June 2007, Knight told the Supreme Court of Victoria he wants access to rehabilitation programs in prison to improve his chance of parole. He also sought permission to write a letter of \\"apology and explanation\\" to one of his victims. The court heard prison authorities intercepted a letter Knight tried to send to one of his victims. He was charged with two prison offences and spent six days in solitary confinement. Knight told the court a letter of apology did not fit the prison guidelines for a prohibited letter, stating, \\"A letter of apology constitutes a facet of my rehabilitation and on a small measure of making amends for my actions,\\" he told the court. Knight was given leave by the Court to proceed with his case.Law to stop criminals contacting victims , NineMSN, 22 August 2007 In June 2009, Knight sued Victorian Attorney-General Rob Hulls to force him to appear before the Supreme Court and to remove his status as a \\"vexatious litigant\\". He also claims the status \\"is being used as an instrument of oppression by Corrections Victoria\\" and says his request for access to a personal computer in his cell was denied. On the 20th anniversary of the Hoddle Street massacre, the judge who sentenced Knight, Professor George Hampel, stood by the sentence he gave him. The Hoddle Street massacre has been the subject of several books, and two Australian TV documentaries: ABC TV's award-winning Hoddle Street (1988) and GTV Channel 9's Hoddle Street (2007).

Poppy seeds yield 45–50% oil. Like poppy seeds, poppyseed oil is highly palatable, high in vitamin E, and has no narcotic properties. Poppy seeds are especially high in tocopherols other than vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than safflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. It has little or no odor and a pleasant taste, and it is less likely than some other oils to become rancid. Uses The oil is sometimes used as a cooking oil; it is also used for moisturizing skin. Its primary use, however, is in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, and soaps. Poppyseed oil is a drying oil. In oil painting, the most popular oil for binding pigment, thinning paint, and varnishing finished paintings is linseed oil. Walnut oil and poppyseed oil are also favored by oil painters, though each oil is used for a different purpose. Poppyseed oil is used especially in white paints. Up through the late 19th century, when these oils became available prepared in tubes, painters tended to prepare them by hand. While poppyseed oil does not leave the unwanted yellow tint for which linseed oil is known, it is much weaker in the test of time than the contemporary linseed oil. Poppyseed oil dries much more slowly (5–7 days) than linseed oil (3–5 days). For this reason poppyseed oil should not be used for a ground layer of a painting, and linseed oil should not be painted over a layer of poppyseed oil. Poppyseed oil is the basis of lipiodol, a radiocontrast agent used in medical radiology. History An early 20th century industry manual states that while the opium poppy was grown extensively in Eurasia, most of the world production of poppyseed oil occurred in France and Germany, from poppy seeds imported from other countries. From 1900 to 1911, France and Germany together produced on the order of 60,000,000 kilograms per year. At that time, poppyseed oil was used primarily to dress salads and frequently was adulterated with sesame oil and hazelnut oil to improve the taste of oil from stored (rancid) seeds. Poppyseed oil was used to adulterate olive oil and peach kernel oil. See also *Fat over lean References * Rosenblum, E. E. (2009). \\"poppy\\". Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia.

Early life Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, son of William Cox and Jane Harvey, and was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in the town. He married Rebecca Upjohn in 1789. Military career Cox had served in the Wiltshire militia before being commissioned as ensign (without purchase) in the 117th Regiment of Foot on 11 July 1795, transferring on 23 January 1796 to the 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 68th Foot on 21 February 1797. He transferred to the New South Wales Corps on 30 September 1797, having changed places with a certain Lieutenant Beckwith, and was made paymaster on 23 June 1798. Cox sailed for New South Wales on 24 August 1799 on the Minerva, with his wife and four sons. Aboard the ship were around 160 convicts, including Joseph Holt and Henry Fulton who were among many political prisoners. Cox used his influence so that the prisoners were often allowed up on deck for fresh air, and Holt in his memoirs states that as a result \\"the ship was the healthiest and best regulated which had ever reached the colony\\". The Minerva arrived in Sydney on 11 January 1800. Cox purchased a farm and made Holt its manager. Further land was purchased but in 1803 large liabilities led to Cox's estate being placed into the hands of trustees. He was suspended from office due to allegations that regimental accounts were involved. Cox returned to England in 1807 to answer allegations that he had misused army funds. The Dictionary of Australian Biography records that Cox was cleared in 1808, and was promoted to Captain of 102nd Regiment of Foot, and placed in charge of Irish political prisoners. However, the London Gazette of 19 April 1808 records, \\"Paymaster William Cox, of the New South Wales Corps, is dismissed the Service.\\" Building career In 1811 Cox returned to Australia. Once back there, he resigned his commission and became principal magistrate at Hawkesbury. He was also responsible for erecting many government buildings. In 1814, Governor Lachlan Macquarie approved Cox's 'voluntary offer of your superintending and directing the working party' that would build a road crossing the Blue Mountains, between Sydney and Bathurst. The completed dirt track was wide by long, built between 18 July 1814 to 14 January 1815 using five free men, 30 convict labourers and eight soldiers. Macquarie surveyed the finished road in April 1815 by driving his carriage along it from Sydney to Bathurst. He commended Cox and stated that the project would have taken three years if it had been done under a contract. As a reward Cox was awarded of land near Bathurst. The road became known as Cox's Road and over time much of it has been bypassed in favour of easier grades. Family Rebecca Cox died in 1819, having borne five sons. In 1821, Cox married Anna Blachford, by whom he had another three sons and a daughter. Their son Alfred Cox was a large landholder in New Zealand and a member of the House of Representatives. Another son, Edward Cox, was a pastoralist who served on the New South Wales Legislative Council. The BBC One television programme Who Do You Think You Are?, which aired on 30 August 2010, traced the ancestry of Australian soap and pop star Jason Donovan through his mother's side of the family back to William Cox.

Plating has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Thin-film deposition has plated objects as small as an atom, therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology. There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is Sheffield plate). Other plating techniques include electroplating, vapor deposition under vacuum and sputter deposition. Recently, plating often refers to using liquids. Metallizing refers to coating metal on non-metallic objects. Electroplating In electroplating, an ionic metal is supplied with electrons to form a non-ionic coating on a substrate. A common system involves a chemical solution with the ionic form of the metal, an anode (positively charged) which may consist of the metal being plated (a soluble anode) or an insoluble anode (usually carbon, platinum, titanium, lead, or steel), and finally, a cathode (negatively charged) where electrons are supplied to produce a film of non-ionic metal. Electroless plating Electroless plating, also known as chemical or auto-catalytic plating, is a non-galvanic plating method that involves several simultaneous reactions in an aqueous solution, which occur without the use of external electrical power. The reaction is accomplished when hydrogen is released by a reducing agent, normally sodium hypophosphite (Note: the hydrogen leaves as a hydride ion) or thiourea, and oxidized, thus producing a negative charge on the surface of the part. The most common electroless plating method is electroless nickel plating, although silver, gold and copper layers can also be applied in this manner, as in the technique of angel gilding.  Specific cases  = Gold plating = Gold plating is a method of depositing a thin layer of gold on the surface of glass or metal, most often copper or silver. Gold plating is often used in electronics, to provide a corrosion-resistant electrically conductive layer on copper, typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms have the tendency to diffuse through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide/sulfide layer. Therefore, a layer of a suitable barrier metal, usually nickel, has to be deposited on the copper substrate, forming a copper-nickel-gold sandwich. Metals and glass may also be coated with gold for ornamental purposes, using a number of different processes usually referred to as gilding. Sapphires, plastics, and carbon fiber are some other materials that are able to be plated using advance plating techniques. The substrates that can be used are almost limitless. = Silver plating = :This section is about the method of adding a thin layer of silver to an object. For the Manhattan Project operation, see Silverplate. A silver-plated alto saxophone Silver plating has been used since the 18th century to provide cheaper versions of household items that would otherwise be made of solid silver, including cutlery, vessels of various kinds, and candlesticks. In the UK the assay offices, and silver dealers and collectors, use the term \\"silver plate\\" for items made from solid silver, derived long before silver plating was invented from the Spanish word for silver \\"plata\\", seizures of silver from Spanish ships carrying silver from America being a large source of silver at the time. This can cause confusion when talking about silver items; plate or plated. In the UK it is illegal to describe silver-plated items as \\"silver\\". It is not illegal to describe silver-plated items as \\"silver plate\\", although this is grammatically incorrect, and should also be avoided to prevent confusion. The earliest form of silver plating was Sheffield Plate, where thin sheets of silver are fused to a layer or core of base metal, but in the 19th century new methods of production (including electroplating) were introduced. Britannia metal is an alloy of tin, antimony and copper developed as a base metal for plating with silver. Another method that can be used to apply a thin layer of silver to objects such as glass, is to place Tollens' reagent in a glass, add glucose/dextrose, and shake the bottle to promote the reaction. :AgNO3 + KOH → AgOH + KNO3 :AgOH + 2 NH3 → [Ag(NH3)2]+ + [OH]− (Note: see Tollens' reagent) :[Ag(NH3)2]+ + [OH]− + aldehyde (usually glucose/dextrose) → Ag + 2 NH3 + H2O For applications in electronics, silver is sometimes used for plating copper, as its electrical resistance is lower (see Resistivity of various materials); more so at higher frequencies due to the skin effect. Variable capacitors are considered of the highest quality when they have silver-plated plates. Similarly, silver-plated, or even solid silver cables, are prized in audiophile applications; however some experts consider that in practice the plating is often poorly implemented, making the result inferior to similarly priced copper cables. Care should be used for parts exposed to high humidity environments because in such environments, when the silver layer is porous or contains cracks, the underlying copper undergoes rapid galvanic corrosion, flaking off the plating and exposing the copper itself; a process known as red plague. Silver plated copper maintained in a moisture-free environment will not undergo this type of corrosion. = Copper plating = Copper plating is the process of electrolytically forming a layer of copper on the surface of an item. = Rhodium plating = Rhodium plating is occasionally used on white gold, silver or copper and its alloys. A barrier layer of nickel is usually deposited on silver first, though in this case it is not to prevent migration of silver through rhodium, but to prevent contamination of the rhodium bath with silver and copper, which slightly dissolve in the sulfuric acid usually present in the bath composition. = Chrome plating = Chrome plating is a finishing treatment using the electrolytic deposition of chromium. The most common form of chrome plating is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10-μm layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000 μm, are called hard chrome and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear. The traditional solution used for industrial hard chrome plating is made up of about 250 g/L of CrO3 and about 2.5 g/L of SO4−. In solution, the chrome exists as chromic acid, known as hexavalent chromium. A high current is used, in part to stabilize a thin layer of chromium(+2) at the surface of the plated work. Acid chrome has poor throwing power, fine details or holes are further away and receive less current resulting in poor plating. =Zinc plating = Zinc coatings prevent oxidation of the protected metal by forming a barrier and by acting as a sacrificial anode if this barrier is damaged. Zinc oxide is a fine white dust that (in contrast to iron oxide) does not cause a breakdown of the substrate's surface integrity as it is formed. Indeed, the zinc oxide, if undisturbed, can act as a barrier to further oxidation, in a way similar to the protection afforded to aluminum and stainless steels by their oxide layers. The majority of hardware parts are zinc-plated, rather than cadmium- plated. =Zinc-nickel plating= Zinc-nickel plating is one of the best corrosion resistant finishes available offering over 5 times the protection of conventional zinc plating and up to 1,500 hours of neutral salt spray test performance. This plating is a combination of a high-nickel zinc-nickel alloy (10–15% nickel) and some variation of chromate. The most common mixed chromates include hexavalent iridescent, trivalent or black trivalent chromate. Used to protect steel, cast iron, brass, copper, and other materials, this acidic plating is an environmentally safe option. Hexavalent chromate has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA and OSHA. =Tin plating= The tin-plating process is used extensively to protect both ferrous and nonferrous surfaces. Tin is a useful metal for the food processing industry since it is non-toxic, ductile and corrosion resistant. The excellent ductility of tin allows a tin coated base metal sheet to be formed into a variety of shapes without damage to the surface tin layer. It provides sacrificial protection for copper, nickel and other non-ferrous metals, but not for steel. Tin is also widely used in the electronics industry because of its ability to protect the base metal from oxidation thus preserving its solderability. In electronic applications, 3% to 7% lead may be added to improve solderability and to prevent the growth of metallic \\"whiskers\\" in compression stressed deposits, which would otherwise cause electrical shorting. However, RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulations enacted beginning in 2006 require that no lead be added intentionally and that the maximum percentage not exceed 1%. Some exemptions have been issued to RoHS requirements in critical electronics applications due to failures which are known to have occurred as a result of tin whisker formation. =Alloy plating= In some cases, it is desirable to co-deposit two or more metals resulting in an electroplated alloy deposit. Depending on the alloy system, an electroplated alloy may be solid solution strengthened or precipitation hardened by heat treatment to improve the plating's physical and chemical properties. Nickel-Cobalt is a common electroplated alloy. =Composite plating= Metal matrix composite plating can be manufactured when a substrate is plated in a bath containing a suspension of ceramic particles. Careful selection of the size and composition of the particles can fine-tune the deposit for wear resistance, high temperature performance, or mechanical strength. Tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, chromium carbide, and aluminum oxide (alumina) are commonly used in composite electroplating. =Cadmium plating= Cadmium plating is under scrutiny because of the environmental toxicity of the cadmium metal. Cadmium plating is widely used in some applications in the aerospace, military, and aviation fields. However, it is being phased out due to its toxicity.Why use cadmium plated fasteners in the aeronautical field . finishing.com Cadmium plating (or cad. plating) offers a long list of technical advantages such as excellent corrosion resistance even at relatively low thickness and in salt atmospheres, softness and malleability, freedom from sticky and/or bulky corrosion products, galvanic compatibility with aluminum, freedom from stick-slip thus allowing reliable torquing of plated threads, can be dyed to many colors and clear, has good lubricity and solderability, and works well either as a final finish or as a paint base.\\"Cadmium vs. Zinc vs. Nickel Plating Comparison \\" Finishing.comCadmium plating . Erie Plating Company If environmental concerns matter, in most aspects cadmium plating can be directly replaced with gold plating as it shares most of the material properties, but gold is more expensive and cannot serve as a paint base. =Nickel plating= The chemical reaction for nickel plating is: At cathode: Ni → Ni2+ + 2 e− At anode: H2PO2 + H2O → H2PO3 + 2 H+ Compared to cadmium plating, nickel plating offers a shinier and harder finish, but lower corrosion resistance, lubricity, and malleability, resulting in a tendency to crack or flake if the piece is further processed. =Electroless nickel plating= Electroless nickel plating, also known as enickel and NiP, offers many advantages: uniform layer thickness over most complicated surfaces, direct plating of ferrous metals (steel), superior wear and corrosion resistance compared to electroplated nickel or chrome. Much of the chrome plating done in aerospace industry can be replaced with electroless nickel plating, again environmental costs, costs of hexavalent chromium waste disposal and notorious tendency of uneven current distribution favor electroless nickel plating.Kanigen . schnarr.eu Electroless nickel plating is self-catalyzing process, the resultant nickel layer is NiP compound, with 7–11% phosphorus content. Properties of the resultant layer hardness and wear resistance are greatly altered with bath composition and deposition temperature, which should be regulated with 1 °C precision, typically at 91 °C. During bath circulation, any particles in it will become also nickel-plated; this effect is used to advantage in processes which deposit plating with particles like silicon carbide (SiC) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). While superior compared to many other plating processes, it is expensive because the process is complex. Moreover, the process is lengthy even for thin layers. When only corrosion resistance or surface treatment is of concern, very strict bath composition and temperature control is not required and the process is used for plating many tons in one bath at once. Electroless nickel plating layers are known to provide extreme surface adhesion when plated properly. Electroless nickel plating is non- magnetic and amorphous. Electroless nickel plating layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another electroless nickel- plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits electroless nickel- plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.

The Ardre image stones are a collection of ten rune and image stones, dated to the 8th to 11th centuries, that were discovered at Ardre Church, in Ardre, Gotland, Sweden. The principal edition is by Sune Lindqvist.S. Lindqvist, Gotlands Bildsteine I (Stockholm 1941). Description The Ardre image stones were re-used as paving under the wooden floors of the local church in the Ardre parish of Gotland. Before the historical significance of rune and image stones was understood or appreciated, they were often used as materials in the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings. The image stones were re- discovered when the church was being restored around 1900. The stones are now preserved in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm.

It is seen that the center of mass, in accordance with the law of conservation of momentum, remains in place. In physics and classical mechanics, the three-body problem is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities (or momenta) of three point masses and solving for their subsequent motion according to Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. The three-body problem is a special case of the -body problem. Unlike two-body problems, no general closed-form solution exists, as the resulting dynamical system is chaotic for most initial conditions, and numerical methods are generally required. Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun. In an extended modern sense, a three-body problem is any problem in classical mechanics or quantum mechanics that models the motion of three particles. Mathematical description The mathematical statement of the three-body problem can be given in terms of the Newtonian equations of motion for vector positions mathbf{r_i} = (x_i, y_i, z_i) of three gravitationally interacting bodies with masses m_i: :begin{align} ddotmathbf{r}_{mathbf{1}} &= -G m_2 frac{mathbf{r_1} - mathbf{r_2}}{mathbf{r_1} - mathbf{r_2}^3} - G m_3 frac{mathbf{r_1} - mathbf{r_3}}{mathbf{r_1} - mathbf{r_3}^3},  ddotmathbf{r}_{mathbf{2}} &= -G m_3 frac{mathbf{r_2} - mathbf{r_3}}{mathbf{r_2} - mathbf{r_3}^3} - G m_1 frac{mathbf{r_2} - mathbf{r_1}}{mathbf{r_2} - mathbf{r_1}^3},  ddotmathbf{r}_{mathbf{3}} &= -G m_1 frac{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_1}}{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_1}^3} - G m_2 frac{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_2}}{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_2}^3}. end{align} where G is the gravitational constant.The Three-Body Problem This is a set of 9 second-order differential equations. The problem can also be stated equivalently in the Hamiltonian formalism, in which case it is described by a set of 18 first- order differential equations, one for each component of the positions mathbf{r_i} and momenta mathbf{p_i}: : frac{d mathbf{r_i}}{dt} = frac{partial mathcal{H}}{partial mathbf{p_i}}, qquad frac{dmathbf{p_i}}{dt} = -frac{partial mathcal{H}}{partial mathbf{r_i}}, where mathcal{H} is the Hamiltonian: : mathcal{H} = -frac{G m_1 m_2}{mathbf{r_1} - mathbf{r_2}}-frac{G m_2 m_3}{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_2}} -frac{G m_3 m_1}{mathbf{r_3} - mathbf{r_1}} + frac{mathbf{p_1}^2}{2m_1} + frac{mathbf{p_2}^2}{2m_2} + frac{mathbf{p_3}^2}{2m_3}. In this case mathcal{H} is simply the total energy of the system, gravitational plus kinetic. =Restricted three-body problem= The circular restricted three-body problem is a valid approximation of elliptical orbits found in the Solar System, and this can be visualized as a combination of the potentials due to the gravity of the two primary bodies along with the centrifugal effect from their rotation (Coriolis effects are dynamic and not shown). The Lagrange points can then be seen as the five places where the gradient on the resultant surface is zero (shown as blue lines), indicating that the forces are in balance there. In the restricted three-body problem, a body of negligible mass (the \\"planetoid\\") moves under the influence of two massive bodies. Having negligible mass, the force that the planetoid exerts on the two massive bodies may be neglected, and the system can be analysed and can therefore be described in terms of a two-body motion. Usually this two-body motion is taken to consist of circular orbits around the center of mass, and the planetoid is assumed to move in the plane defined by the circular orbits. The restricted three-body problem is easier to analyze theoretically than the full problem. It is of practical interest as well since it accurately describes many real-world problems, the most important example being the Earth–Moon–Sun system. For these reasons, it has occupied an important role in the historical development of the three-body problem. Mathematically, the problem is stated as follows. Let m_{1,2} be the masses of the two massive bodies, with (planar) coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), and let (x, y) be the coordinates of the planetoid. For simplicity, choose units such that the distance between the two massive bodies, as well as the gravitational constant, are both equal to 1. Then, the motion of the planetoid is given by : begin{align} frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -m_1 frac{x - x_1}{r_1^3} - m_2 frac{x - x_2}{r_2^3}  frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -m_1 frac{y - y_1}{r_1^3} - m_2 frac{y - y_2}{r_2^3}, end{align} where r_i = sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}. In this form the equations of motion carry an explicit time dependence through the coordinates x_i(t), y_i(t). However, this time-dependence can be removed through a transformation to a rotating reference frame, which simplifies any subsequent analysis. Solutions =General solution= chaotic, a system of 3 bodies interacting elastically isn't. There is no general analytical solution to the three-body problem given by simple algebraic expressions and integrals. Moreover, the motion of three bodies is generally non-repeating, except in special cases. On the other hand, in 1912 the Finnish mathematician Karl Fritiof Sundman proved that there exists a series solution in powers of for the 3-body problem.Barrow-Green, J. (2010). The dramatic episode of Sundman, Historia Mathematica 37, pp. 164–203. This series converges for all real , except for initial conditions corresponding to zero angular momentum. (In practice the latter restriction is insignificant since such initial conditions are rare, having Lebesgue measure zero.) An important issue in proving this result is the fact that the radius of convergence for this series is determined by the distance to the nearest singularity. Therefore, it is necessary to study the possible singularities of the 3-body problems. As it will be briefly discussed below, the only singularities in the 3-body problem are binary collisions (collisions between two particles at an instant) and triple collisions (collisions between three particles at an instant). Collisions, whether binary or triple (in fact, any number), are somewhat improbable, since it has been shown that they correspond to a set of initial conditions of measure zero. However, there is no criterion known to be put on the initial state in order to avoid collisions for the corresponding solution. So Sundman's strategy consisted of the following steps: # Using an appropriate change of variables to continue analyzing the solution beyond the binary collision, in a process known as regularization. # Proving that triple collisions only occur when the angular momentum vanishes. By restricting the initial data to , he removed all real singularities from the transformed equations for the 3-body problem. # Showing that if , then not only can there be no triple collision, but the system is strictly bounded away from a triple collision. This implies, by using Cauchy's existence theorem for differential equations, that there are no complex singularities in a strip (depending on the value of ) in the complex plane centered around the real axis (shades of Kovalevskaya). # Find a conformal transformation that maps this strip into the unit disc. For example, if (the new variable after the regularization) and if , then this map is given by ::sigma = frac{e^frac{pi s}{2beta} - 1}{e^frac{pi s}{2beta} + 1}. This finishes the proof of Sundman's theorem. Unfortunately, the corresponding series converges very slowly. That is, obtaining a value of meaningful precision requires so many terms that this solution is of little practical use. Indeed, in 1930, David Beloriszky calculated that if Sundman's series were to be used for astronomical observations, then the computations would involve at least 10 terms. =Special-case solutions= In 1767, Leonhard Euler found three families of periodic solutions in which the three masses are collinear at each instant. See Euler's three-body problem. In 1772, Lagrange found a family of solutions in which the three masses form an equilateral triangle at each instant. Together with Euler's collinear solutions, these solutions form the central configurations for the three-body problem. These solutions are valid for any mass ratios, and the masses move on Keplerian ellipses. These four families are the only known solutions for which there are explicit analytic formulae. In the special case of the circular restricted three-body problem, these solutions, viewed in a frame rotating with the primaries, become points which are referred to as L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5, and called Lagrangian points, with L4 and L5 being symmetric instances of Lagrange's solution. In work summarized in 1892–1899, Henri Poincaré established the existence of an infinite number of periodic solutions to the restricted three-body problem, together with techniques for continuing these solutions into the general three-body problem. In 1893, Meissel stated what is now called the Pythagorean three-body problem: three masses in the ratio 3:4:5 are placed at rest at the vertices of a 3:4:5 right triangle. Burrau further investigated this problem in 1913. In 1967 Victor Szebehely and C. Frederick Peters established eventual escape for this problem using numerical integration, while at the same time finding a nearby periodic solution. In the 1970s, Michel Hénon and Roger A. Broucke each found a set of solutions that form part of the same family of solutions: the Broucke–Henon–Hadjidemetriou family. In this family the three objects all have the same mass and can exhibit both retrograde and direct forms. In some of Broucke's solutions two of the bodies follow the same path. An animation of the figure-8 solution to the three-body problem over a single period T ≃ 6.3259.Here the gravitational constant G has been set to 1, and the initial conditions are r1(0) = −r3(0) = (−0.97000436, 0.24308753); r2(0) = (0,0); v1(0) = v3(0) = (0.4662036850, 0.4323657300); v2(0) = (−0.93240737, −0.86473146). The values are obtained from Chenciner & Montgomery (2000). In 1993, a zero angular momentum solution with three equal masses moving around a figure-eight shape was discovered numerically by physicist Cris Moore at the Santa Fe Institute. Its formal existence was later proved in 2000 by mathematicians Alain Chenciner and Richard Montgomery. The solution has been shown numerically to be stable for small perturbations of the mass and orbital parameters, which raises the intriguing possibility that such orbits could be observed in the physical universe. However, it has been argued that this occurrence is unlikely since the domain of stability is small. For instance, the probability of a binary–binary scattering event resulting in a figure-8 orbit has been estimated to be a small fraction of 1%. In 2013, physicists Milovan Šuvakov and Veljko Dmitrašinović at the Institute of Physics in Belgrade discovered 13 new families of solutions for the equal-mass zero- angular-momentum three-body problem. In 2015, physicist Ana Hudomal discovered 14 new families of solutions for the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three- body problem. In 2017, researchers Xiaoming Li and Shijun Liao found 669 new periodic orbits of the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem. This was followed in 2018 by an additional 1223 new solutions for a zero- momentum system of unequal masses. In 2018, Li and Liao reported 234 solutions to the unequal-mass \\"free-fall\\" three body problem. The free fall formulation of the three body problem starts with all three bodies at rest. Because of this, the masses in a free-fall configuration do not orbit in a closed \\"loop\\", but travel forwards and backwards along an open \\"track\\". = Numerical approaches = Using a computer, the problem may be solved to arbitrarily high precision using numerical integration although high precision requires a large amount of CPU time. In 2019, Breen et al. announced a fast neural network solver, trained using a numerical integrator. History The gravitational problem of three bodies in its traditional sense dates in substance from 1687, when Isaac Newton published his Principia (Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica). In Proposition 66 of Book 1 of the Principia, and its 22 Corollaries, Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions. In Propositions 25 to 35 of Book 3, Newton also took the first steps in applying his results of Proposition 66 to the lunar theory, the motion of the Moon under the gravitational influence of the Earth and the Sun. The physical problem was addressed by Amerigo Vespucci and subsequently by Galileo Galilei; in 1499, Vespucci used knowledge of the position of the Moon to determine his position in Brazil. It became of technical importance in the 1720s, as an accurate solution would be applicable to navigation, specifically for the determination of longitude at sea, solved in practice by John Harrison's invention of the marine chronometer. However the accuracy of the lunar theory was low, due to the perturbing effect of the Sun and planets on the motion of the Moon around the Earth. Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Alexis Clairaut, who developed a longstanding rivalry, both attempted to analyze the problem in some degree of generality; they submitted their competing first analyses to the Académie Royale des Sciences in 1747.The 1747 memoirs of both parties can be read in the volume of Histoires (including Mémoires) of the Académie Royale des Sciences for 1745 (belatedly published in Paris in 1749) (in French): : Clairaut: \\"On the System of the World, according to the principles of Universal Gravitation\\" (at pp. 329-364); and : d'Alembert: \\"General method for determining the orbits and the movements of all the planets, taking into account their mutual actions\\" (at pp. 365–390). The peculiar dating is explained by a note printed on page 390 of the \\"Memoirs\\" section: \\"Even though the preceding memoirs, of Messrs. Clairaut and d'Alembert, were only read during the course of 1747, it was judged appropriate to publish them in the volume for this year\\" (i.e. the volume otherwise dedicated to the proceedings of 1745, but published in 1749). It was in connection with their research, in Paris during the 1740s, that the name \\"three-body problem\\" () began to be commonly used. An account published in 1761 by Jean le Rond d'Alembert indicates that the name was first used in 1747.Jean le Rond d'Alembert, in a paper of 1761 reviewing the mathematical history of the problem, mentions that Euler had given a method for integrating a certain differential equation \\"in 1740 (seven years before there was question of the Problem of Three Bodies)\\": see d'Alembert, \\"Opuscules Mathématiques\\", vol. 2, Paris 1761, Quatorzième Mémoire (\\"Réflexions sur le Problème des trois Corps, avec de Nouvelles Tables de la Lune ...\\") pp. 329-312, at sec. VI, p. 245. Other problems involving three bodies The term 'three-body problem' is sometimes used in the more general sense to refer to any physical problem involving the interaction of three bodies. A quantum mechanical analogue of the gravitational three-body problem in classical mechanics is the helium atom, in which a helium nucleus and two electrons interact according to the inverse-square Coulomb interaction. Like the gravitational three-body problem, the helium atom cannot be solved exactly. In both classical and quantum mechanics, however, there exist nontrivial interaction laws besides the inverse-square force which do lead to exact analytic three-body solutions. One such model consists of a combination of harmonic attraction and a repulsive inverse-cube force. This model is considered nontrivial since it is associated with a set of nonlinear differential equations containing singularities (compared with, e.g., harmonic interactions alone, which lead to an easily solved system of linear differential equations). In these two respects it is analogous to (insoluble) models having Coulomb interactions, and as a result has been suggested as a tool for intuitively understanding physical systems like the helium atom. The gravitational three-body problem has also been studied using general relativity. Physically, a relativistic treatment becomes necessary in systems with very strong gravitational fields, such as near the event horizon of a black hole. However, the relativistic problem is considerably more difficult than in Newtonian mechanics, and sophisticated numerical techniques are required. Even the full two-body problem (i.e. for arbitrary ratio of masses) does not have a rigorous analytic solution in general relativity. -body problem The three-body problem is a special case of the -body problem, which describes how objects will move under one of the physical forces, such as gravity. These problems have a global analytical solution in the form of a convergent power series, as was proven by Karl F. Sundman for and by Qiudong Wang for (see -body problem for details). However, the Sundman and Wang series converge so slowly that they are useless for practical purposes;Florin Diacu. \\"The Solution of the n-body Problem\\", The Mathematical Intelligencer, 1996. therefore, it is currently necessary to approximate solutions by numerical analysis in the form of numerical integration or, for some cases, classical trigonometric series approximations (see -body simulation). Atomic systems, e.g. atoms, ions, and molecules, can be treated in terms of the quantum -body problem. Among classical physical systems, the -body problem usually refers to a galaxy or to a cluster of galaxies; planetary systems, such as stars, planets, and their satellites, can also be treated as -body systems. Some applications are conveniently treated by perturbation theory, in which the system is considered as a two-body problem plus additional forces causing deviations from a hypothetical unperturbed two-body trajectory.

Gags are usually associated with roleplays involving bondage, but that is not necessarily the case. The person who wears the gag is regarded as the submissive partner, while the other is regarded as the dominant one. People may wear gags for a variety of reasons. Some people derive erotic pleasure from a gag, either in a submissive or dominant role. When combined with other physical restraints, the wearing of a gag can increase the wearer's sense of helplessness and anxiety level within a BDSM scene by rendering them unable to speak during sexual activity, which some people enjoy. For some people, gags have connotations of punishment and control, and thus can be used as a form of humiliation. To some, wearing a gag without restraints is still an act of humiliation, as is an open mouth gag. Some fetishists are sexually aroused by the sound gagged people make when they try to speak, or by seeing a person drool uncontrollably. The type of gag used depends on the tastes of the parties and the type of roleplay scene, what is available at the time, and safety considerations. Some gags are designed to fill the mouth, while others are designed to provide access to the mouth by forcing the mouth open. Gags may be classified as over-the-mouth type, mouth stuffing type or mouth opening type. When a person is sexually aroused by gags, it may be considered a paraphilia. One specific gag paraphilia relates to video depictions in which the captor gags the damsel in distress to stop her screaming for help. Some people are sexually aroused by such imagery, even if there is no nudity or sexual act present, or even if the victim is only gagged but not restrained in any way.  Safety  Gagging anybody is very risky, as it involves a substantial risk of asphyxia if the subject's nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous, as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk, since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never be left alone. In practice, no gag is effective enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud, inarticulate noises to call for help. Thus, a pattern of noises, such as three grunts in rapid succession, is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal safety mechanism, such as a solid object held in the hand that can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.  Types of gag  = Ball = A ball gag is usually a rubber or silicone sphere with a strap passing through its diameter. The most common diameter is , but other sizes can be found. The ball is strapped into the mouth behind the teeth, with the straps going around the head to secure it in place. They are used as a sign of control by the dominant. If the ball is very large, it may be difficult to insert behind the teeth or to remove it. The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk. A wiffle gag is a simple ball gag that replaces the standard solid rubber ball with a light plastic ball similar to the one used for the game of floorball. It is generally safer due to the constant airflow. = Bit = A man, blindfolded with a bit gag A bit gag is styled like the bit used in a bridle for a horse, and much of its sexual appeal stems from fetishistic symbolism in pony play. It consists of a bar that is held in place in the wearer's mouth by straps or other devices. Unlike the metal bit that is most common in horse bridles, the bar of a bit gag is usually a soft rubber cylinder. It is not very effective in preventing speech, unless combined with mouth stuffing, although it will make it somewhat more difficult for the wearer to produce coherent speech. Occasionally, reins are attached. Because of the possibility of injury to the lips, the bit gag is not suitable for rough play. = Butterfly = A butterfly gag is a wing-shaped gag that is usually inflatable by means of a rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates in the shape of a butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place. = Cleave = Model with cleave gag A more effective variant of the over-the-mouth gag is called the cleave gag. Instead of being tied over the person's mouth, the scarf or cloth is pulled between his or her teeth. While such a gag of thin material is not very effective, a thick scarf can be used to hold his or her mouth open. Cleave gags are difficult to remove as they are between the teeth, not over the mouth. When it is applied properly, the gagged person's speech is muffled, but not completely silenced. = Detective / over-the-mouth (OTM) = The basic over-the-mouth gag The detective gag, or over-the-mouth gag (sometimes abbreviated to OTM), is often described in fiction (particularly crime serials) as preventing the subject from speaking through the use of soft materials such as scarves or bandannas. The long scarf or bandanna is pulled over the subject's mouth and tied at the back of his/her head. In practice, it does not silence the subject very effectively. Images of OTM gags, usually applied on women, had been prevalent since the film serials of the early 1900s. For this reason, the OTM gag is associated with the typical damsel in distress. = Bandit / over-the-nose (OTN) = A bandit gag (also known as an over-the-nose or mouth gag) covers the mouth as well as the nose, and is commonly used in Japan and on many cartoons. Without stuffing, it is not very effective. = Forniphilic = A forniphilic gag is a type of gag that has the primary purpose of objectifying and/or humiliating the wearer. The term forniphilic comes from the word forniphilia, which is the incorporation of a bound person into furniture or other objects. The gag becomes a mounting point for a tool or other device which allows a slave to perform a task or service for their master or mistress. When employing the gag, the slave's hands are usually bound behind them so they have no other option than to control the tool with the gag. In order to provide stability and to allow the slave to control the tool, a muzzle gag with a mouthpiece is commonly used as a base for attaching the tool. Types of tool or device can include the following: * A dildo or vibrator * An ashtray * A toilet brush * A feather duster * A boot or floor brush Gags employing a dildo or vibrator are readily available from online retailers; ashtray gags are also popular, but to a lesser extent. Other types of forniphilic gags are much more difficult to source. = Funnel = A woman wearing a funnel gag. A funnel gag consists of a funnel with a tube leading from its spout into the mouth, usually with straps to hold the tube in. Such a gag is used to force the bound person to drink a fluid. It is very easy to choke during such forced drinking. People involved with watersports may also find interest in this gag. = Hand = A hand over the mouth can be used as a gag. When hand gagging someone, a person usually grabs the victim from behind since the victim cannot see this coming. Then, the person firmly places their unfolded hand over the victim's closed mouth. Then they may pull the victim into their body for extra leverage and control. Handgags are common and are often associated with damsel-in-distress phenomena. = Harness = A man wears a head harness with ball gag. A harness gag encircles the head, with straps generally secured by buckles fastened at the back. Head harnesses are most commonly used to provide points of attachments to secure various kinds of gags, such as ball gags, bit gags, muzzle gags and ring gags; although they also have other uses, such as providing attachment points for other forms of bondage, or may be used simply for their psychological effect. Head harnesses may also function as a gag by themselves, by restricting the ability to open the mouth, or have a mouth cover as an integral part. Head harnesses, like many other forms of bondage, also have the effect of creating a sense of objectification and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer's eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of objectification and erotic subjection. = Inflatable = An inflatable gag is usually a rubber balloon which is inflated by a hand valve. Most inflatable gags will not hold in the gagged person's mouth well, so the gag is usually paired with a ring gag to keep it in place. = Knotted = A knotted gag is a blend of the ball and cleave gags. The scarf either has a knot tied in the middle and placed in the gagged person's mouth or is an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) placed backward with the knot tied inside the person's mouth. The knotted gag is able to soak up the saliva that the ball gag does not and can be easily washed for reuse. Knots can be doubled or tripled to fit the size of the gagged person's mouth. = Layered = This is a term for a series of gags over each other; for example, an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) over a cleave gag. Another piece of cloth could be tied under the gagged person's chin in conjunction with an OTM gag. = Medical = Jennings gag Bondage pornography also depicts the use of medical gags such as the Whitehead and Jennings gag in BDSM contexts. Such gags allow unlimited access to the mouth. They stop coherent speech, but do little to silence a person. = Mouth corset = A mouth corset is a type of neck corset that covers both the neck and the mouth. Incorporating a gag into a neck corset presents a few safety issues: should the wearer begin to choke, it is not easy to remove the gag quickly. For this reason, most mouth corsets use a simple muzzle gag that merely covers the mouth and does not force anything into the mouth, thus minimising the risk. Despite not forcing anything into the mouth, mouth corsets are usually very effective in gagging the victim. This is due to the fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging the gag, and the lacing at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks. = Mouthguard = This gag has two mouthguards, similar to those worn by football and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to fit to the mouth of the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to a front faceplate, like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back. = Muzzle = A muzzle gag A muzzle gag works in a similar way as an over-the- mouth gag, only that they are usually made of leather, are fastened around the head with buckles and straps, and cover the lower part of the face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult to draw the line between a muzzle gag and a head harness with an attached gag. Muzzle gags are probably one of the oldest gags and illustrations showing muzzle-like gag devices such as scold's bridles have been observed from early colonial times. A muzzle gag may also have an attached posture collar and may also be fitted with an integrated pecker gag. = Pacifier = A pacifier, or 'dummy' is by design a gag without any alteration. It can be used to quiet a victim, and even strapped in place to prevent removal. Pacifiers are orthodontic and designed to be placed in the mouth. They are very comfortable and soft, and remove the violent connotations of a gag. The wearer's mouth is essentially being plugged. Pacifier used as a gag = Panel = A panel gag is similar to a muzzle gag, except it lacks a head harness. = Pecker = A pecker (penis) gag A pecker or penis gag is a gag that has a bulge resembling a phallus (erect penis) or a nipple that is placed into the mouth to enable the wearer to suck on it in a manner similar to an adult pacifier. The use of a phallic shape is intended to give it an erotic connotation, but it may be a large knob — similar to a ball gag — or may be inflatable. The pecker gag may be wide and flat and large enough almost to fill the mouth, intended to depress the tongue. To keep the gag in the mouth, it is usually paired with a ring, muzzle or panel gag attached to a strap that buckles behind the head. = Ring = A ring gag A ring gag is similar to a ball gag, except that the ball is replaced by a hollow ring. The ring reduces the risk of choking, and allows access to the mouth. Oral sex may be performed if the ring is big enough. A ring gag will cause the subject to drool uncontrollably, this often being the purpose of the gag. = Rope = A rope gag consists of a length of rope wound multiple times through the mouth of the person being gagged – similar to a cleave gag. Soft rope, such as nylon, works well for the comfort of the person being gagged, but rougher rope, such as hemp, will scratch the lips quite a bit. Rope gags can be made into a part of a full-body tie as well, if the person tying the \\"victim\\" up uses the same length of rope for the gag as they do for the tie. = Spider gag = A spider gag A variation on the ring gag, the spider gag has hooks on the sides so as to keep the wearer from flipping the ring horizontally in their mouth. Unlike the ring gag which can be easily flipped, a spider gag is essentially functional and non-decorative. Generally these gags have interchangeable rings so as to accommodate both the wearers' mouth and the size of any object that might be inserted through the ring. = Stuff = A stuff gag is very similar to, and works in the same way as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, allowing the top to pull it out easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag. While it works in preventing speech, a person who has been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, it is for this reason that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful. For the more extreme application, a stuff gag can be used in conjunction with a tape gag, effectively rendering the partner completely silent. This practice requires greater caution, since the risk for asphyxiation is high = Tape = A tape gag A tape gag involves the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around the lower part of the person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin. The top may use tape during a roleplay where a ball gag will be inappropriate; for example, a kidnapper and captive scene that does not immediately lead to sex. Tape gags are commonly used in crime thrillers where the villains wish to prevent the victims from speaking. While tape gags can be combined with stuff gags for enhanced bondage, it is easy for one to choke on the stuffing inside of the mouth. = Tube = A tube gag uses a tube instead of a ring. It allows easy breathing, but not much access to the mouth. It is also possible to have a tube through the ball of a ball gag.

It was built at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (later ANSTO) Research Establishment at , Sydney. The reactor was in operation between 1958 and 2007, when it was superseded by the Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor, also in Lucas Heights. Background and operation Based on the DIDO reactor at Harwell in the UK, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by heavy water (D2O), and the fuel was enriched uranium. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. Like DIDO, its original purpose was nuclear materials testing, using its high neutron flux to give materials intended for use in nuclear power reactors their entire expected lifetime neutron exposure in a relatively short period. HIFAR was used for research, particularly neutron diffraction experiments, production of neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon, and for production of medical and industrial radioisotopes. HIFAR went critical at 11:15 pm local time on 26 January 1958, and was first run at full power of 10 MW (thermal) in 1960. The initial fuel was highly enriched uranium, but over the years the enrichment level of new fuel was steadily reduced, in line with international trends designed to reduce the danger of diversion of research reactor fuel for weapons programs. HIFAR completed conversion to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU) in 2006. Of the six DIDO class reactors built including DIDO itself, HIFAR was the last to cease operation. Permanent decommissioning of HIFAR commenced on 30 January 2007 and is expected to be completed by 2025. On 12 August 2006 Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor (abbreviated as OPAL), the 20 MW replacement reactor located on an adjacent site, went critical. OPAL is served by the same complex of research, isotope production and remote handling laboratories. The two reactors ran in parallel for six months while OPAL was being tested. HIFAR was then permanently shut down and OPAL took over HIFAR's role of Australia's only operating nuclear reactor.

The oil contains polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fats. Composition Walnut oil is composed largely of polyunsaturated fatty acids (72% of total fats), particularly alpha-linolenic acid (14%) and linoleic acid (58%), oleic acid (13%), and saturated fats (9%). Culinary use A cup of California roasted walnut oil Walnut oil is edible and is generally used less than other oils in food preparation, often due to high pricing. It is light- coloured and delicate in flavour and scent, with a nutty quality. Although chefs sometimes use walnut oil for pan-frying, most avoid walnut oil for high- temperature cooking because heating tends to reduce the oil's flavour and produce a slight bitterness. Walnut oil is preferred in cold dishes such as salad dressings. Cold-pressed walnut oil is typically more expensive due to the loss of a higher percentage of the oil. Refined walnut oil is expeller- pressed and saturated with solvent to extract the highest percentage of oil available in the nut meat. The solvents are subsequently eliminated by heating the mixture to around . Both methods produce food-grade culinary oils. Walnut oil, like all nut, seed and vegetable oils can turn rancid. Over 99% of walnut oil sold in the US is produced in California. Artistic use Walnut oil was one of the most important oils used by Renaissance painters. Its short drying time and lack of yellow tint make it a good oil paint base thinner and brush cleaner. Some woodworkers favour walnut oil as a finish for implements that will come in contact with food, such as wooden bowls, because of its safety. Rancidity is not an issue because walnut oil dries when applied to wood in a thin coating. People who mix oil and wax to formulate wood finishes value walnut oil as an ingredient because of the edibility of both ingredients. The oil typically is combined with beeswax in a mixture of 1/3 oil to 2/3 beeswax.

In addition to her career as a patron of the arts in Berlin, she is known for editing and publishing the work of her husband Carl von Clausewitz, especially his military treatise On War. Early life and career Brühl was born in Warsaw, a daughter of Count Carl Adolph von Brühl by his marriage to Sophie Gomm, an aunt of the British Field Marshal Sir William Maynard Gomm.Vanya Eftimova Bellinger, Marie von Clausewitz: The Woman Behind the Making of On War (Oxford University Press, 2016) p. 21 Her parents had named her Maria Sophia, but she was called Marie by her family. She was the oldest child, but many of her siblings died as infants. Therefore, Marie was protective of her sister Fanny, who had survived the smallpox epidemic.Bellinger (2016), pp. 14, 22-23 When Fanny died in March 1804 due to complications during childbirth, Marie was left to care for the orphaned daughter. Brühl also treated her younger brother Fitz more like a son than her sibling.Bellinger (2016), p. 53 Her education began at home under her father's guidance. He taught Marie how to write and read in French, and how to compose letters in a manner appropriate for a \\"lady of high society.\\"Bellinger (2016), p. 22 Her mother taught her English, which Marie spoke fluently and later taught to her friends' children. Marie and Fanny also took lessons in painting, music, and history. It was their mother's intention to create \\"true phenomena\\" out of her daughters.Bellinger (2016), p. 36 She was a talented painter and patron of the arts. She was a close friend of the novelist Bettina von Arnim and her husband Ludwig Achim von Arnim,Bellinger (2016), p. 187 and of Sophie von Schwerin. At the age of 18, Brühl became a lady-in-waiting to queen dowager Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt.Bellinger (2016), p. 40 This position was terminated in February 1805 by the queen dowager's death.Bellinger (2016), p. 54 Later, she became the chief lady-in-waiting to Princess Charlotte, who was only eleven years old at the time.Bellinger (2016), p. 105 After the death of her husband, Brühl assumed the role of chief lady-in-waiting to Princess Augusta in Berlin.Bellinger (2016), p. 227 One of her duties was to look after and educate Prince Frederick, who would later be known as Emperor Frederick III.Bellinger (2016), p. 228 In 1813, in the closing stages of the Napoleonic Wars, Brühl was a volunteer nurse in a military hospital.Bellinger (2016) p. 132 Years with Carl von Clausewitz Painting of Carl von Clausewitz Brühl met Carl von Clausewitz in December 1803 through their mutual friends, Princess Louise and her husband Prince Antoni Radziwiłł.Bellinger, (2016) p. 51 Their meeting came less than a year after Brühl's father's unexpected death due to complications from liver disease in July 1802.Bellinger (2016), p. 50 The two had a lengthy courtship for various reasons; one being her mother's disapproval of the relationship with a man of lesser social standing. Clausewitz had no inheritance and would have to rely solely on his lieutenant's pay, which was not enough to support a family.Bellinger (2016), p. 61 To marry without her mother's blessing would not have been legally possible.Bellinger (2016), p. 83 Marie, herself, was hesitant to commit to the relationship and had to consider all the circumstances surrounding the courtship. She was in her late twenties when the correspondence began between Carl and herself. This was considered past high society's \\"marrying age.\\"Bellinger (2016), pp. 58, 59 Yet Brühl was one of the few unmarried women during that time who earned an income on her own. She did not want to lose, what she referred to as, her \\"inner freedom.\\"Bellinger (2016), pp. 61, 62 The two made their relationship official in May 1806.Bellinger (2016), p. 64 In August 1810, Clausewitz received an important letter from Friedrich Wilhelm that promoted him to the rank of major, and gave him official permission to marry.Bellinger (2016), p. 104 On 17 December 1810, Brühl married Clausewitz.Bellinger (2016), p. 107 The two frequently discussed politics, literature, current events together. They considered each other equals, which was rare for a man to think of regarding his own wife.Bellinger (2016), p. 109 Carl and Marie were unable to conceive children. Present day theories point to Carl's chronic illness as the culprit.Bellinger (2016), pp.134-135 The two were married for a total of 21 years, up until Clausewitz's death. From 1832 to 1834, following Clausewitz's unexpected death from cholera in 1831, she edited and published several of his books, including his most famous one, On War. Throughout their correspondence, Marie insisted that Carl send her his drafts and notes for safekeeping. He was known to have an unorganized writing process that would often lead to lost papers and unfinished ideas.Bellinger (2016), p. 196 In fact, when Carl was writing On War, Marie acted as the researcher and copywriter for the book.Bellinger (2016), p. 175 Marie's handwriting can be found on some of the pages of the On War manuscript, listing notes and references. Bellinger (2016), p. 197 Additionally, Brühl wrote a preface to On War. In the summer of 1832, less than a year after Carl's death, a publishing house in Berlin had put out announcements advertising the upcoming publication of On War. With the help of her brother, Marie transcribed drafts and inserted changes for On War in a manner of months.Bellinger (2016), p. 227 Later years and death Toward the end of her life, Brühl complained of tightness in her chest and ringing in her ears. She lived a busy life with an irregular and hectic schedule. Along with her responsibilities as chief lady-in-waiting, von Brühl also put pressure on herself to publish her deceased husband's works. Those around her were concerned about her health, mood swings, and frequent restlessness. Marie suffered a psychological breakdown after an intense fight with her mother.Eftimova Bellinger (2016) pp. 234-235 \\"Marie von Clausewitz: The Woman Behind the Making of On War\\" (Oxford University Press) After the episode, doctors prescribed various treatments and medications including, \\"bloodletting, laxatives, and nauseant.\\" These seemed to be making Marie sicker and less lucid; she sometimes even spoke of herself in the third person. Her cousin Carl von Brühl insisted on moving her to Dresden to salvage what was left of her health. According to one of her nurses, Marie's arm seemed to have become infected due to the practice of bloodletting. She may have also contracted hepatitis from the bloodletting instruments. Due to the lack of knowledge about modern medicine and infections, the doctor in Dresden simply diagnosed Marie with damaged nerves and ceased treatment.Bellinger (2016), pp. 234-236 On January 28, 1836,Eftimova Bellinger (2016), p. 236 Brühl died at the age of 56.

His ideas on territoriality were influential in the work of Max Nicholson.  Biography  Henry Eliot Howard was born at Stone House, at Stone, near Kidderminster,Kinlen, L. J. Howard, (Henry) Eliot Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry Retrieved 1 May 2015 second son of Henry Howard and Alice Gertrude Thomson. He studied at Stoke Poges, Eton, and Mason College (the forerunner of the University of Birmingham). He entered his father's steelworks firm, Lloyd and Lloyd in Worcester, becoming a director in 1896. Then in 1903 a director of the enlarged firm, Stewarts & Lloyds. Mason College, now the University of Birmingham He showed from his earliest childhood an intense love of natural history. It was not until 1914 that his first work, British Warblers, illustrated by Henrik Grönvold, was fully published, having been issued in parts since 1907. Continually working on the theory of territory, he published Territory in Bird Life, illustrated by George Edward Lodge and Henrik Grönvold, in 1920 (a reissue in 1948 had an introduction by Julian Huxley and James Fisher), followed by An Introduction to the Study of Bird Behaviour, Nature of a Bird's World and lastly A Waterhen's World, in 1940. His books were published under the name \\"Eliot Howard\\". He was a Justice of the Peace and for forty-five years a member of the British Ornithologists' Union, including a period as a vice-president. His home was always in Worcestershire. In 1900 he still gave his address as Stone House, but once married he and his wife lived at 'Clareland', Hartlebury, which overlooked the River Severn, and in whose grounds he conducted much of his ornithological research Nonetheless, much of his time was spent on the wild coast of Donegal and in the north west of Ireland, shooting, fishing and studying natural history. He was attracted to the wild and beautiful area of Horn Head in the North West of Donegal, close to the Atlantic Ocean, through his marriage in 1900 to Anne Elizabeth Frances Stewart (1875–1960) whose family had lived there for many years (the 1901 census of Ireland shows his wife was born in Donegal). He died of meningitis at Clareland on 26 December 1940 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Bishops Green, Stourport, on 30 December. An obituary was published in The Times on 28 December. His papers are in the Alexander Library, at the University of Oxford. His father, Henry was a manufacturing chemist and was son of John Eliot Howard. John's father was Luke Howard. The 1901 Census shows Henry Eliot as an 'Iron tube manufacturer'. The Howards had two sons and four daughters. One daughter, Esme Eleanor Howard, married the Reverend John William Fletcher Boughey, son of the Reverend Percy Fletcher Boughey and Elsie de Strange Herring, on 25 April 1940.

The songs are presented roughly in reverse chronological order, except for \\"And if Venice is Sinking\\". That song appears on the album alongside songs from 1990's Save This House, but was originally released on 1993's Faithlift. As with most of the band's live shows during this era, the studio portion of the album opens with \\"Canadian Skye\\" (from 1997's Weights and Measures) and closes with the band's most famous song, \\"Home for a Rest\\" (from Save This House). At the end of the album, four songs appear which were recorded with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra during the sessions for the album Open Heart Symphony. Those sessions included new songs and performances of several of the band's past hits, but only the new songs appeared on the original album. The performances which appear on Hit Parade collect the hits portion of those shows, along with a rendition of \\"That's Amore\\" sung by Vince Ditrich. The band had long maintained a tradition of having Ditrich, the band's drummer, croon an old pop song — usually \\"That's Amore\\", but occasionally \\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\\" — at some point during its live shows, but the rendition appearing here is Ditrich's only lead vocal performance on a Spirit of the West album. Following this release, the band went on hiatus for several years, returning in 2004 with Star Trails. Track listing All songs by John Mann and Geoffrey Kelly, except where noted. #\\"Canadian Skye\\" #\\"Rites of Man\\" #\\"Wishing Line\\" #\\"Unplugged\\" #\\"Williamson's Garage\\" #\\"Sadness Grows\\" #\\"5 Free Minutes\\" #\\"Bone of Contention\\" #\\"D For Democracy (Scour the House)\\" #\\"Goodbye Grace\\" #\\"Puttin' Up With the Joneses\\" #\\"And if Venice is Sinking\\" #\\"Save This House\\" #\\"Home for a Rest\\" #\\"Political\\" * #\\"That's Amore\\" (written by Harry Warren and Jack Brooks) * #\\"And if Venice is Sinking\\" * #\\"The Crawl\\" These four songs are drawn from the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra sessions.

Early years  Assuras was born in London, Ontario to parents who immigrated from Tripoli, Greece, after World War II. She attended London Central Secondary School, and remained in London to attend the University of Western Ontario, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. She graduated in 1980, then entered the graduate program in journalism and earned her master's degree in 1981. Twenty-one years later she commented on the impact the journalism program had had on her: :\\"It's hard to describe my time at Western because it was a phenomenal turning point in my life. I always had these delusions of being a writer and I always overloaded my mind with information and literature. That program just brought things together for me.\\"  Career  Assuras has worked for CITY-TV and Global Television, including a stint as reporter and weekend anchor for CityPulse from 1985 to 1988. She was the evening anchor at Global TV in 1989. From 1992 to 1993 she worked for CTV, anchoring Canada AM. She then moved to ABC, and in May 1993, joined Aaron Brown as co-anchor of World News Now and ABC World News This Morning. She shared that anchor desk with Boyd Matson, fellow Canadian Kevin Newman, and Mark Mullen before leaving ABC in January 1997. In 1997 she moved to CBS, first joining CBS Eye On People, a cable network that CBS launched in March 1997. She also worked as a national correspondent and later became anchor of the CBS Morning News in 1998. She then become co-anchor of The Saturday Early Show in 1999 and the CBS Evening News Saturday, also in 1999, alternating with Russ Mitchell. In a June 22, 1998 article in Maclean's, Assuras commented on her reason for moving to the United States, saying \\"I wanted to live in a different country. And I wanted to work where you have all the tools you need on a story.\\" In July 2009, Assuras left CBS after her contract with it expired. She later anchored energyNOW!, a half-hour weekly TV news-magazine and opinion program produced by the American Clean Skies Foundation; it aired first on WJLA-TV and later on Bloomberg Television.

Metzger, The Text of the New Testament (Oxford University Press 2005), p. 106. of the Christian Bible. It was produced around 700 in the north-east of England, at the Benedictine monastery of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow in the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria and taken to Italy as a gift for Pope Gregory II in 716. It was one of three giant single-volume Bibles then made at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow, and is the earliest complete one-volume Latin Bible to survive, only the León palimpsest being older; and the oldest bible where all the Books of the Bible present what would be their Vulgate texts. It is named after the location in which it was found in modern times, Mount Amiata in Tuscany, at the Abbazia di San Salvatore and is now kept at Florence in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana (Amiatino 1). Designated by siglum A, it is commonly considered to provide the most reliable surviving representation of Jerome's Vulgate text for the books of the New Testament, and most of the Old Testament. As was standard in all Vulgate bibles until the 9th century, the Book of Baruch is absent as is the Letter of Jeremiah, the text of the Book of Lamentations following on from the end of Jeremiah without a break. Ezra is presented as a single book, the texts of the later canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah being continuous. Similarly the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles are each presented as a single book. In 2018 the Codex Amiatinus was loaned to the British Library for an exhibition of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, returning to England for the first time in 1,300 years. Description The bulk of the Codex Maiestas Domini (Christ in Majesty) with the Four Evangelists and their symbols, at the start of the New Testament (fol. 796v) The symbol for it is written am or A (Wordsworth). It is preserved in an immense tome, measuring high, in breadth, and thick, and weighs over - so impressive, as Hort says, as to fill the beholder with a feeling akin to awe.H. J. White, The Codex Amiatinus and its Birthplace, in: Studia Biblica et Ecclesiasctica (Oxford 1890), Vol. II, p. 273.Richard Marsden, Amiatinus, Codex, in: Blackwell encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, ed. Michael Lapidge,John Blair, Simon Keynes, Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, s. 31. The Book of Psalms is provided in Jerome's third version, translated from the Hebrew, rather than in the pre- Jerome Roman Psalter then standard in English bibles, or in Jerome's second, Gallican version, that was to supplant his Hebraic Psalms in most Vulgate bibles from the 9th century onwards. By contrast with case in most of the rest of the Old Testament, the Amiatinus psalms text is commonly considered an inferior witness of Jerome's Versio juxta Hebraicum; the presence of the 'Columba' series of psalm headings, also found in the Cathach of St. Columba, demonstrates that an Irish psalter must have been its source; but the text differs in many places from the best Irish manuscripts. The New Testament is preceded by the Epistula Hieronymi ad Damasum, Prolegomena to the four Gospels. The Codex Amiatinus qualifies as an illuminated manuscript as it has some decoration including two full-page miniatures, but these show little sign of the usual insular style of Northumbrian art and are clearly copied from Late Antique originals. It contains 1,040 leaves of strong, smooth vellum, fresh-looking today despite their great antiquity, arranged in quires of four sheets, or quaternions. It is written in uncial characters, large, clear, regular, and beautiful, two columns to a page, and 43 or 44 lines to a column. A little space is often left between words, but the writing is in general continuous. The text is divided into sections, which in the Gospels correspond closely to the Ammonian Sections. There are no marks of punctuation, but the skilled reader was guided into the sense by stichometric, or verse-like, arrangement into cola and commata, which correspond roughly to the principal and dependent clauses of a sentence. From this manner of writing the script is believed to have been modeled upon the Codex Grandior of Cassiodorus,Dom John Chapman, The Codex Amiatinus and the Codex grandior in: Notes on the early history of the Vulgate Gospels, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1908, pp. 2–8. but it may go back, perhaps, even to St. Jerome. History Page with dedication; \\"Ceolfrith of the English\\" was altered into \\"Peter of the Lombards\\" Originally three copies of the Bible were commissioned by Abbot Ceolfrid in 692. This date has been established as the double monastery of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow secured a grant of additional land to raise the 2,000 head of cattle needed to produce the vellum. Bede was most likely involved in the compilation. In 716, Ceolfrid accompanied one copy, the Codex Amiatinus, intended as a gift to Pope Gregory II, but he died en route to Rome on 29 September 716 at Langres, Burgundy.Hind, George. \\"St. Ceolfrid.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 17 May 2013 The book later appears in the 9th century in Abbey of the Saviour, Mount Amiata in Tuscany (hence the description \\"Amiatinus\\"), where it is recorded in a list of the Abbey's relics dated 1036, describing it as being an Old and New Testament 'written in the hand of the blessed Pope Gregory' [citation needed]. It remained in the San Salvatore Monastery until 1786 when it passed to the Laurentian Library in Florence. The dedication page had been altered and the principal librarian to the Laurentian, Angelo Maria Bandini suggested that the author was Servandus, a follower of St. Benedict, and that it had been produced at Monte Cassino around the 540s. This claim was accepted for the next hundred years, establishing it as the oldest copy of the Vulgate, but scholars in Germany noted the similarity to 9th-century texts. In 1888, Giovanni Battista de Rossi established that the Codex was related to the Bibles mentioned by Bede. This also established that Amiatinus was related to the Greenleaf Bible fragment in the British Library. Although de Rossi's attribution removed 150 years from the age of the Codex, it remains the oldest version of the Vulgate. As the primary source of the Vulgate, the manuscript was of particular importance to the Catholics during the Counter-Reformation. Protestant translations derived from the original language of the Scriptures, but the Latin text of the Amiatinus was earlier than any then-known Hebrew manuscript, making it a \\"major piece of propaganda in the battle for textual precedence\\". In 1587 Pope Sixtus V demanded the book be sent to Rome where it was consulted for a new papal edition of the Bible, the Sixtine Vulgate;De Hamel, p.64 although in the event, little or no use was made of its readings in either the Sistine or subsequent Sixto-Clementine official Vulgate editions, whose editors rather preferred later medieval Vulgate texts and editions now known to have been heavily corrupted by non-Vulgate readings. In view of the many accumulated corruptions in all published editions of the Vulgate so far, the Oxford University Press accepted in 1878 a proposal from classicist John Wordsworth (later Bishop of Salisbury) to produce a new critical edition of the Vulgate New Testament. This was eventually published as Nouum Testamentum Domini nostri Iesu Christi Latine, secundum editionem sancti Hieronymi in three volumes between 1889 and 1954; 3 vols, the Codex Amiatinus being a primary source for the entire text; which also followed this manuscript in presenting the text in sense lines, cola et commata without any other indication of punctuation. In 1907 Pope Pius X commissioned the Benedictine monks in Rome to prepare a critical edition of Jerome's Vulgate, entitled Biblia Sacra iuxta latinam vulgatam versionem, which eventually emerged as a counterpart Old Testament to the Oxford New Testament, following largely the same critical principles, and according similar primary status to the Codex Amiatinus text (other than for the Psalms); and similarly deriving its layout, cola et commata from Amiatinus. 18 vols.

A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the \\"real\\" reason something occurred. * Example: Why did the ship sink? ** Proximate cause: Because it was holed beneath the waterline, water entered the hull and the ship became denser than the water which supported it, so it could not stay afloat. ** Ultimate cause: Because the ship hit a rock which tore open the hole in the ship's hull. In most situations, an ultimate cause may itself be a proximate cause for a further ultimate cause. Hence we can continue the above example as follows: * Example: Why did the ship hit the rock? ** Proximate cause: Because the ship failed to change course to avoid it. ** Ultimate cause: Because the ship was under autopilot and the autopilot's data was inaccurate. ** (even stronger): Because the shipwrights made mistakes in the ship's construction. ** (stronger yet): Because the scheduling of labor at the shipyard allows for very little rest. ** (in absurdum): Because the shipyard's owners have very small profit margins in an ever-shrinking market. In biology * Ultimate causation explains traits in terms of evolutionary forces acting on them. :Example: female animals often display preferences among male display traits, such as song. An ultimate explanation based on sexual selection states that females who display preferences have more vigorous or more attractive male offspring. * Proximate causation explains biological function in terms of immediate physiological or environmental factors. :Example: a female animal chooses to mate with a particular male during a mate choice trial. A possible proximate explanation states that one male produced a more intense signal, leading to elevated hormone levels in the female producing copulatory behaviour. Although the behavior in these two examples is the same, the explanations are based on different sets of factors incorporating evolutionary versus physiological factors. These can be further divided, for example proximate causes may be given in terms of local muscle movements or in terms of developmental biology (see Tinbergen's four questions).  In philosophy  In analytic philosophy, notions of cause adequacy are employed in the causal model. In order to explain the genuine cause of an effect, one would have to satisfy adequacy conditions, which include, among others, the ability to distinguish between: # Genuine causal relationships and accidents. # Causes and effects. # Causes and effects from a common cause. One famous example of the importance of this is the Duhem–Quine thesis, which demonstrates that it is impossible to test a hypothesis in isolation, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions. One way to solve this issue is to employ contrastive explanations. Several philosophers of science such as Lipton argue that contrastive explanations are able to detect genuine causes. An example of a contrastive explanation is a cohort study that includes a control group, where one can determine the cause from observing two otherwise identical samples. This view also circumvents the problem of infinite regression of 'why's that proximate causes create. In sociology Sociologists use the related pair of terms \\"proximal causation\\" and \\"distal causation.\\" Proximal causation: explanation of human social behaviour by considering the immediate factors, such as symbolic interaction, understanding (Verstehen), and individual milieu that influence that behaviour. Most sociologists recognize that proximal causality is the first type of power humans experience; however, while factors such as family relationships may initially be meaningful, they are not as permanent, underlying, or determining as other factors such as institutions and social networks (Naiman 2008: 5). Distal causation: explanation of human social behaviour by considering the larger context in which individuals carry out their actions. Proponents of the distal view of power argue that power operates at a more abstract level in the society as a whole (e.g. between economic classes) and that \\"all of us are affected by both types of power throughout our lives\\" (ibid). Thus, while individuals occupy roles and statuses relative to each other, it is the social structure and institutions in which these exist that are the ultimate cause of behaviour. A human biography can only be told in relation to the social structure, yet it also must be told in relation to unique individual experiences in order to reveal a complete picture (Mills 1959).

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1 million. The Age reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a Claymore mine, sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old Police Constable Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 24 March 2016 22 other people were injured. Investigations On 7 October 1985, gelignite and detonators were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood. On 25 March 1986, a Commodore was stolen. Both crimes were later found to provide equipment needed for the construction of the bomb. In the course of the investigation, a group of people, including Craig Minogue, Rodney Minogue, Stanley Brian Taylor and Peter Reed, were apprehended. The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.The Russell Street bombing, slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016. A week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, an anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner; Mick Miller, stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted AU$500,000 for the footage. The caller contacted Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in and around the St. Kilda area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact again, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's PremierJohn Cain offered the caller's amount as a reward for information. The caller was later identified as 38-year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from another public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.Forensic Investigators - S02 Ep06 Russell Street BombingThe Events of the Russell Street Bombing, timetoast.com The taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they saw a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30 p.m. on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an identikit picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail. Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986 and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to be planted at a police station in Flemington. A major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red Daimler Sovereign in East Keilor. During the pursuit, the Daimler turned into a side street and crashed. The driver fled on foot into nearby St. Albans where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of Victorian number plates that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver 1985 VK Commodore HDT that also had been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in an armed robbery of a bank in Donvale at 3:00 p.m. on the day of the bombing in which the vehicle was used to ram-raid the front of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the Yarra River at Wonga Park on 7 April 1986. Upon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's VIN on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing. In a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.The Russell Street Bombing As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members (who were also suspected in matters relating to theft of motor vehicles) and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance. One of the addresses under surveillance was a house of an associate on Haros Street in Nunawading. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions. Arrests On 25 April 1986, ten Victoria Police officers raided the Kallista home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a .455 Smith & Wesson revolver and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested. During the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car. Fingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. Police later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to fly to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of Zelinka's metal rubbish bin and put it on the a pile in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip. Zelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as an older male aged in his fifties who was referred to as \\"Stan the Man\\", Zelinka's description of \\"Stan the Man\\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had an extensive criminal record dating back to the late 1940s. Taylor first came attention to the authorities at the age of 8 when he was arrested for truancy and spent two years in the Bayswater Boys Home at The Basin where he was subjected to physical abuse from the other inmates and staff and was introduced to a life of crime. In 1949, he was arrested after being caught fishing in a prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been in and out of jail on criminal charges relating to theft of motorcycles and burglary. In 1961, Taylor was convicted of an armed robbery on a milk bar in Clayton and was sent to Pentridge's notorious H Division where he met Ronald Ryan. While in prison, Ryan approached Taylor and asked him to accompanied Ryan on his 1965 escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge only to be recaptured five days later during which, he committed seven bank robberies. While in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and took part in several prison stage shows. After his release in 1978, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. As a bit-part actor, Taylor starred in a 1979 episode of Prisoner. Detectives arrested Taylor at his home in Birchip on 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any further crimes, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing. Detectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered a large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car. Trial Reed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that \\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\\" Prosecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows: * Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine. * Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue. * Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires. * a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site. * a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises. * tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises. * residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower Templestowe. * evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators. * a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion. * another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives in the garage of a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \\"forget what they'd seen\\". At the end of a six-month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. Taylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79. Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison. Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just prior to the bombing.  Aftermath  In 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex. Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.

It was their final album of new material for Warner Music Canada. It was the band's first album following the departure of Linda McRae, to whom the final song \\"The Hammer and the Bell\\" is dedicated. It was also the band's most directly folk-influenced album in many years, as \\"Canadian Skye\\", \\"Rites of Man\\", \\"Circus\\" and \\"The Hammer and the Bell\\" are all arranged partly around traditional Celtic jigs and reels. This was once one of the band's trademarks, but one they had virtually abandoned on their 1990s albums. The album was recorded in England at Presshouse studios owned by Jethro Tull guitarist Martin Barre. Barre appears on the album as a guest musician, along with Ric Sanders of Fairport Convention, Donald Shaw and Karen Matheson of Capercaillie, and Martin Bell from The Wonder Stuff. For the album's supporting tour, Tobin Frank joined the band as a \\"special guest\\". He retained that billing for several years, but is now officially a member of the band. Although the album was well received by critics, it was not widely promoted by the label, and sold poorly compared to the band's other 1990s efforts. It did not produce any hits for the band, although \\"Soldier's Boy\\" did receive limited airplay on Canadian radio. Following this album, Spirit of the West were dropped from their record label. This was a common occurrence in the late 1990s for bands and artists who had solid, loyal fan bases but did not enjoy multiplatinum sales. Like other such artists, Spirit of the West moved to an independent label for their subsequent albums. Warner released a greatest hits compilation by the band, Hit Parade, in 1999, but the band did not release an album of new material until Star Trails in 2004.

The Combine consist of organic, synthetic, and heavily mechanized elements. They are encountered throughout Half-Life 2 and its episodic expansions, as well as Half-Life: Alyx, as hostile non-player characters as the player progresses through the games in an effort to overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth. The Combine are frequently shown as cruel rulers over the citizens of Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology. In addition to their role within the Half-Life series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve. Design Artwork of a Civil Protection Officer Some elements of the Combine's appearance, such as that of the Advisor, are inspired by the works of Frank Herbert. The towering Striders seen throughout Half-Life 2 and its subsequent episodes are based directly on the Martian tripods of the H.G. Wells novel The War of the Worlds, where said Martians invade Victorian England, using the tripods as their main \\"weapon\\". The name \\"Combine\\" itself is a tribute to Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which features a collection of authorities which mechanistically manipulate and process individuals. During Half-Life 2s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were cut. Female Combine assassins, similar to black ops assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the Half-Life 2: Survivor arcade game. Another non-player character, the cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with an acid gun and although removed from the game, its head was featured in Eli Vance's laboratory. Other cuts included a variety of alien Combine soldiers that would have complemented the trans-human soldiers in the game and a number of synthetic combat machines. Many of Half-Life 2s Combine characters went through multiple redesigns; the Combine Overwatch soldier was subjected to at least twelve redesigns before the final appearance was settled on. Opera singer and actress Ellen McLain provides the voice for the Combine Overwatch announcer and dispatcher in Half-Life 2 and its episodic expansions and their virtual reality prequel Half-Life: Alyx. The various Combine soldiers throughout the games are voiced by John Patrick Lowrie. Attributes =Society= Little is revealed of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in Half-Life 2 states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by a range of species. The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is shown to be a brutal police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar, the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; while in both City 17's waterways and the outskirt's coastal shores the water levels are greatly reduced. At the heart of the Combine's command structure in Half-Life 2, is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching tens of thousands of feet into the sky from ground level,Half-Life 2 Citadel Height and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans- dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines. =Depiction= The Combine is composed of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout Half-Life 2 and its expansions are the transhuman Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. In addition, a variety of combat machines appear, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant 'smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path, as well as a number of weaponized alien 'synths'. Advisors The Advisor's grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author Frank Herbert. Advisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar Civil Protection Civil Protection is the Combine's law enforcement agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks, which heavily resemble a somewhat modified Soviet PMG mask. They are usually armed with electroshock batons and pistols, and are occasionally seen using MP-7 submachine guns. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme police brutality are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as \\"protectors of the civilians well-being\\". On the outskirts of City 17, Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death. Overwatch The Combine Overwatch is the primary military force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of biomechanically enhanced humans, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor with one red eye, while the majority of soldiers wear blue armor. Shotgun units wear similar armour to the standard Combine Soldier, but coloured brown with orange eyes. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles and pulse rifles. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and grenades to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of dropships. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after \\"The Uprising\\" near the end of Half-Life 2. Combine technology The Combine use a large array of science fiction technologies. They have access to teleportation technology, which takes them from their dimension to other dimensions. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations within a dimension, it can only be used to move between dimensions. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents. Militarily, the Combine make use of both synthetics, creatures augmented with machinery, and traditional machines such as armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters. The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like gunships; and Striders, armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret. In Episode Two, the Hunter, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, is introduced. These 2.5 m (8 ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the Half- Life 2, although their roles are not elaborated on. Sentry turrets are also used by the Combine. The Combine also use headcrabs as a biological weapon against dissidents, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity. Appearances =Half-Life series= According to the backstory presented during Half-Life 2, the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the Nihilanth, the boss character at the end of Half-Life. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between Xen and the Black Mesa Research Facility on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in \\"portal storms\\" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When sufficiently wide enough, the Combine launched an invasion in force. The United Nations Secretariat Building in New York City is destroyed and Earth is rapidly defeated in what became known as the Seven Hour War (the title is a reference to the Soviet military exercise Щит-82; \\"Seven-Hour Nuclear War\\"). Earth's surrender is negotiated by Wallace Breen, who is then made the Combine's puppet administrator of Earth, and uses City 17 as his base of operations. Two Overwatch soldiers in Episode Two, with a Hunter in the background. The Combine's first appearance is in Half-Life 2. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel. In Episode One, the destruction of the teleporter at the top of the Citadel has isolated the Combine forces on Earth, but also caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down. This forces Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the critically damaged Citadel to temporarily stabilize its reactor while the city's inhabitants are evacuated. The Combine forces, however, instead attempt to accelerate the meltdown in order to send a message to their native universe for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the message to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel detonates, sending the message and destroying City 17. Episode Two opens with Alyx and Freeman discovering that the Citadel's destruction has resulted in the formation of a super portal to the Combine dimension, which is slowly progressing to a stage where the Combine can send overwhelming reinforcements. They also discover that the data packet in the message they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes that can be used to close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at White Forest. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by Vortigaunts. Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled. The super portal is destroyed after the resistance launch a satellite containing the appropriate data. However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog. The Combine feature again as the primary antagonist in the VR-exclusive prequel, Half- Life: Alyx, which takes place between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2. The game focuses on the efforts of Alyx Vance, her father Eli, and fellow resistance member Russell, as they attempt to infiltrate a massive Combine vault, believing it possesses a weapon that they could use to weaken the Combine occupation on Earth. After navigating through various quarantined zones of City 17 and rescuing Eli following his capture by the Combine, they discover that the vault is constructed not to hold a weapon, but as a prison, which they believe is holding Gordon Freeman. Alyx manages to infiltrate the vault and discovers that it is not being used to imprison Gordon Freeman, but is instead harboring the mysterious G-Man, who shows Alyx a glimpse of Eli's death in the futureAs depicted in the events of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and offers her a chance to prevent it, which she accepts, before placing her in stasis. =Appearances in other media= The use of sandbox applications like Garry's Mod have allowed for Combine non-player characters to be used in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. The Combine are also referenced in the Portal series. In one webcomic, Concerned, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series Combine Nation follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with adhesive bandages and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called The Combine, parodies the TV show The Office. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a webfilter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video The Combine Interview, which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by ActionTrip as \\"eerie, to say the least\\" and by both Joystiq and Kotaku as \\"creepy\\", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. PC Gamer UK noted that \\"the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenising intergalactic murderous alien collective\\". Cultural impact =Merchandise= The Combine have inspired the creation of several items of merchandise for the Half-Life series. A plush toy was created by Valve, based on the synthetic tripod Hunters introduced in Episode Two. Sold and distributed via Valve's online store, the toy was released in February 2008. In addition, Valve has produced t-shirts depicting the Combine's idea of humanity's evolution, from ape to Combine Overwatch soldier, and a lithograph displaying twelve pieces of concept art for the Combine soldier. =Reception= The Combine have received a positive reaction from critics. 1UP.com praised the \\"epic feel\\" built up by the Combine and their harsh rule of City 17 in Half-Life 2, stating that this created \\"a world governed by newspeak, decorated with urban decay, and lacking any hope\\". GameSpot echoed this praise, saying that the \\"vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective\\". PC Zone described the appearance of the Combine's soldiers as \\"stormtrooper-like\\", but although stating that overall the artificial intelligence for the game was \\"extremely competent\\", the Combine non-player characters \\"could have used better survival instincts\\", citing their reluctance to take cover and tendency to charge at the player and into a shotgun blast. A number of reviews of Episode One were disappointed by the lack of new characters for the Combine, although GameSpot praised the improved AI for Combine soldiers and the addition of new abilities, such as rappelling down buildings. The addition of the Hunter in Episode Two was particularly well received by critics; Computer and Video Games stated that they were challenging to fight and were \\"a very welcome addition\\" to the series, while IGN stated that the Hunters were \\"impressively designed... [they are] sleek and powerful all at once and reek of malicious alien intelligence.\\" The Combine were ranked at #22 in IGN's 'Top 100 Videogame Villains' list.

He used the stage name MCA. Yauch founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, an independent film production and distribution company based in New York City. As a Buddhist, he was involved in the Tibetan independence movement and organized the Tibetan Freedom Concert. He died in 2012 from parotid cancer. Early life and education Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Yauch was an only child. His father was an architect, and his mother was a social worker. Yauch's mother was Jewish, and his father Catholic but he had a non-religious upbringing in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn. Yauch attended Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn's Midwood neighborhood. In high school, he taught himself to play the bass guitar and formed Beastie Boys with John Berry, Kate Schellenbach, and Michael Diamond. They played their first show—while still a hardcore punk band in the vein of Reagan Youth—on his 17th birthday. He attended Bard College for two years before dropping out. Beastie Boys Yauch (center) with the Beastie Boys in 2009 Beastie Boys, a hip-hop trio, released their first album Licensed to Ill on Def Jam Records when Yauch was 22. He directed many of Beastie Boys' music videos, often under the pseudonym Nathaniel Hörnblowér. In 2002, Yauch constructed a recording studio in New York City called Oscilloscope Laboratories. He began an independent film distributing company called Oscilloscope Pictures. He directed the 2006 Beastie Boys concert film, Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!, although in the DVD extras for the film, the title character in \\"A Day in the Life of Nathanial Hörnblowér\\" is played by David Cross. Beastie Boys had sold 40 million records worldwide by 2010. In April 2012, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yauch was inducted in absentia due to his illness. His bandmates paid tribute to him; a letter from Yauch was read to the audience. In 2011, Yauch received the Charles Flint Kellogg Award in Arts and Letters from Bard College, the college he attended for two years. The award is \\"given in recognition of a significant contribution to the American artistic or literary heritage\\". Other independent work He directed the 2008 film Gunnin' For That #1 Spot about eight high school basketball prospects at the Boost Mobile Elite 24 Hoops Classic at Rucker Park in Harlem, New York City. Yauch produced Build a Nation, the comeback album from hardcore/punk band Bad Brains. In addition, Oscilloscope Laboratories also distributed Kelly Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy (2008) and Oren Moverman's The Messenger (2009). Personal life and views Yauch in 2007 Yauch was a practicing Buddhist. He became an important voice in the Tibetan independence movement, creating the Milarepa Fund, a nonprofit organization devoted to Tibetan independence and organized several benefit concerts to support the cause, including the Tibetan Freedom Concert. Yauch was also a feminist. In the 1994 Beastie Boys single \\"Sure Shot\\", he rapped the verse: \\"I want to say a little something that’s long overdue / The disrespect to women has to got to be through / To all the mothers and sisters and the wives and friends / I want to offer my love and respect till the end\\". In 1995, while attending a speech by the Dalai Lama at Harvard University, he met his wife, Tibetan American Dechen Wangdu. They married in 1998 and had a daughter, Tenzin Losel, the same year.Tibet Sun: \\"The union between Adam Yauch and Dechen Wangdu: a look back\\" from the International Business Times May 5, 2012 In 1998, during the MTV Video Music Awards, when receiving the Video Vanguard Award, Yauch condemned America's wars in Muslim countries and prejudice against Muslims and Arabs. Artist Cihan Kaan wrote an obituary in Al Jazeera that Yauch was \\"Muslim Americans' hero, and America's personal Jewish Gandhi\\", judging his plea to be greater for intercultural healing than the music of later anti-war rappers whose lyrics included anti-Americanism and conspiracy theories. Illness, death and legacy Yauch in 2006 In 2009, Yauch was diagnosed with a cancerous parotid gland and lymph node. He underwent surgery and radiation therapy, delaying the release of Hot Sauce Committee Part Two and the subsequent tour. He was unable to appear in music videos for the album. Yauch became a vegan on the recommendation of his doctors. At the time, Yauch described the cancer as \\"very treatable\\". Yauch died at age 47 on May 4, 2012. Upon his death, fellow musicians and artists paid tribute. Russell Simmons of Def Jam Records said that Yauch \\"was incredibly sweet and the most sensitive artist, whom I loved dearly\\". Ben Stiller tweeted that Yauch \\"stood for integrity as an artist\\". Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that Yauch was \\"a crazy talent whose contributions with his band were inspirational and consistently ground breaking\\". Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke wrote: \\"We looked up to the Beastie Boys a lot when we were starting out and how they maintained artistic control making wicked records but still were on a major label and the Tibetan Freedom Concerts they organized had a very big influence on me personally and the way Adam conducted himself and dealt with it all impressed me a lot. He was a mellow and [very] smart guy. May he rest in peace.\\" Eminem said in an interview, \\"Adam Yauch brought a lot of positivity into the world and I think it's obvious to anyone how big of an influence the Beastie Boys were on me and so many others.\\" Three days after Yauch's death, bandmate Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz posted a note on the Beastie Boys' Tumblr page about it, acknowledging the pain of losing Yauch and his admiration for him. In his last will and testament, Yauch left instructions that his music could not be used in advertising, though the legal validity of such an instruction has been questioned. Phish dedicated their cover of \\"Sabotage\\" to Yauch during a July 7, 2012 concert at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. On May 3, 2013, ceremonies were held to rename the Palmetto Playground in Brooklyn Heights to Adam Yauch Park.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times. Life Kinck was born in Øksfjord in Loppa, Finnmark, where his father, Theodor Kinck (1832–1903), was a local health inspector and his mother, Hanna Guliante Johannesen (1840–1923), the daughter of a peasant. He read philology and the classics at King Frederick's University, Kristiania (now Oslo). He married a fellow writer, Minda Ramm (1859–1924), in 1893. They had at least two sons, Johan Jørgen Kinck (1873–1955)Retrieved 21 September 2017.Norsk Bibliografisk Leksikon Retrieved 21 September 2017. and Tore. Both Tore Kinck and Minde Ramm wrote memoirs about Kinck \\"full of biographical detail\\" after his death.Brian W. Downs: Modern Norwegian Literature, 1860–1918 (Cambridge, UK: CUP, 1966), p. 268. Retrieved 21 September 2017. Kinck died in Oslo, two days after his 61st birthday. Works Kinck wrote novels, short stories and plays as well as a number of essays on historical and political subjects. He travelled extensively and lived in Italy for long periods. Half of his literary production is related to Italian topics. He often explores the workings of love and tenderness, and the difference between the mass of humanity and individuals. In his more political works, he warns against fascism, a trend that grows stronger in his later writings. Kinck also wrote about struggling artists, the misunderstandings they met with, and their reactions towards them. =Plays= Kinck's plays are very lengthy and are often regarded as pieces for reading, not for performing. When played in full, some of his plays last for seven hours or more. They are often closely connected to his essays; expanding on and dramatizing their ideas. His great historical play Mot Karneval (Towards Carnival), based on the life of Niccolò Machiavelli is a prime example; also, a play based on the life of Pietro Aretino called Den Sidste Gjæst/The Last Guest). His other Italian pieces are based on stories by Boccaccio, and are rooted in medieval tradition, exploring the ways of love and passion. Kinck also wrote four \\"Norwegian\\" plays, with a contemporary setting. They take place in small western valleys, exploring class warfare and the approach of modernity. His greatest play is generally considered to be Driftekaren (The Herdsman, with references to Peer Gynt). It tells of a man who is a \\"trader and a poet\\", and how \\"humanity grows forth\\" in him, as Kinck puts it. His last play was a sequel to this, written in 1925. Many of his plays were performed in the theatre created by Ingeborg Refling Hagen, who was willing to stage even the longest marathon performances; some lasting for ten hours. =Short stories= Kinck wrote many collections of short stories, dealing with both Italy and Norway. Here he told of Norwegian farmers and Norwegian tourists in Italy, sometimes from a comical viewpoint. Many of the shorter pieces are still widely popular. His first collection of stories, Flaggermusvinger (Batwings), is a typical symbolist work. He explores the connection between man and nature and the conflict between the forces of nature and the forces of the human mind, especially guilt, passion and fear. Some of the stories are reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe in style. The book is subtitled Tales From the West, as all of them are set in Western Norway. =Novels= Kinck's novels are mostly placed in a Norwegian setting. They typically involve the approach of modernity and the lack of dialogue between farmers and those in power. =Essays= Kincks essays are mostly historical. He wrote much on Italian topics, analyzing the renaissance and the approach of fascism. He also wrote about the Mafia. The Norwegian essays analyzed the split between the saga and the medieval ballad, focusing on the changes in the mood and styles of storytelling from pagan to Christian times in Norway. Music and film Four composers have written music to works by Kinck. Eivind Groven wrote a number of songs based on texts from Kinck's plays. His first symphony was inspired by the play Driftekaren. Wolfgang Plagge and Ludvig Irgens-Jensen have also composed music based on themes from his novels. Randall Meyers scored the movie Flaggermusvinger (Batwings, 1992), which is based on three of Kinck's short stories. Kinck was credited as the writer of the 1981 TV play Når eplene modnes.IMDb Retrieved 21 September 2017.

Its original literal meaning has evolved to describe any person who will not be swayed from a belief. It is often applied to right wing politics.  Original military use  The phrase die hard was first used during the Battle of Albuera (1811) in the Peninsular War. During the battle, Lieutenant-Colonel William Inglis of the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot was wounded by canister shot. Despite his injuries, Inglis refused to retire from the battle but remained with the regimental colours, encouraging his men with the words \\"Die hard 57th, die hard!\\" as they came under intense pressure from a French attack. The 'Die Hards' subsequently became the West Middlesex’s regimental nickname. The term was later used to deride several senior officers of the Army who sought to maintain the system bequeathed to them by the Duke of Wellington and who strenuously resisted military reforms enacted by Parliament starting in the late 1860s.  British political uses  In British politics the adjective \\"die-hard\\" (best written with a hyphen) was first used to describe those who, during the crisis caused by the Lords' rejection of David Lloyd George's \\"People's Budget\\" of 1909, refused to accept the diminution of the House of Lords' powers by the Parliament Act 1911, and who generally held right wing views, most notably Richard Verney, 19th Baron Willoughby de Broke.see Gregory D. Phillips, The diehards : aristocratic society and politics in Edwardian England Harvard University Press (1979) It was subsequently used to describe right-wing critics of Lloyd George's Coalition Government 1918–1922, several of whom had been die-hards before the War such as Leopold Maxse. There was at this time a \\"higher proportion of Irishmen in the Diehard group than in the rest of the parliamentary Conservative Party\\".Kinnear, Michael The Fall of Lloyd George: The Political Crisis of 1922 Macmillan Press (1973) p79 It was later revived to describe a grouping of members of the Conservative Party in the 1930s, including Henry Page Croft who had been prominent among both the earlier die-hards, who amongst other things refused to accept any moves towards Indian independence. But this time it also included some who \\"did not necessarily share the general views of the right on other matters\\",Stuart Ball, Portrait of a Party: The Conservative Party in Britain 1918-1945 Oxford University Press (2013) p343 such as Winston Churchill who had been a bête noire of the original die-hards. Some of the die-hards, though not Churchill, flirted with Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists and/or supported Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.  Other usage  The term is now commonly used to describe any person who will not be swayed from a belief, and was used as the title of the popular action movie series Die Hard, all starring Bruce Willis as police officer John McClane.

Christof was raised in a classical musician family, though he never had training in music or electronic. First, he got involved in various new wave bands where he was the singer and the programmer. One day, he discovered the Techno music sound, and that changed his musical orientation. Also raised in a family of musicians, Frederic Holyszewski began his musical studies at the age of five, learning Transverse flute and piano. During his teenage years, he found inspiration in the electronic music of the day, including Jean Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Simple Minds. He bought his first synthesizer funded by working at night in bars as a pianist. After the split of his first rock band Vision Quest, in 1990, he started to work on his own with the help of computers. Christof and Frederic met at a French Rave party and subsequently formed the psychedelic trance act Transwave in September 1994. Three months later, the first Transwave release (Datura EP) was launched on the small French label, Transpact. Over the following two years, Transwave released three albums (Hypnorhythm, 1995, Helium, 1996, Phototropic, 1996) and toured around the world, experiencing great success in the psychedelic trance underground and scoring an international trance hit with their track, \\"Land of Freedom.\\" The group split after the D-mention party in Paris in May 1997. Christof and Frederic also released an EP called \\"Anjuna\\" under the name Kaledoid in 1996. Transwave is known for its heavy use of TB-303 based effects. Christof launched his record label 3D Vision Recordings in Paris in 1998, releasing artists as dancefloor oriented as possible, which became one of Psytrance most demanded labels. Also in 2010, he launched iBZ Recordings, more dedicated to Techno and Tech-House. Both are based in Ibiza.... Frederic ventured out and started his own record label and production studio, Questionmark RDS. In 1997, the label released his first solo album Self Oscillation under the name Deedrah which marked Frederic’s first break from the original psychedelic Goa trance sound he was producing before. Since then, label is closed down, but Dado focused since that on collaborating with his friends Dino & Shanti under the name of Krome Angels. Transwave have reunited to perform again at the Boom Festival 2006 in Portugal and in the beginning of 2007 they have released \\"Backfire\\", a compilation of hits and unreleased tracks that have made Transwave.

They are typically used in complex statistical models consisting of observed variables (usually termed \\"data\\") as well as unknown parameters and latent variables, with various sorts of relationships among the three types of random variables, as might be described by a graphical model. As typical in Bayesian inference, the parameters and latent variables are grouped together as \\"unobserved variables\\". Variational Bayesian methods are primarily used for two purposes: #To provide an analytical approximation to the posterior probability of the unobserved variables, in order to do statistical inference over these variables. #To derive a lower bound for the marginal likelihood (sometimes called the \\"evidence\\") of the observed data (i.e. the marginal probability of the data given the model, with marginalization performed over unobserved variables). This is typically used for performing model selection, the general idea being that a higher marginal likelihood for a given model indicates a better fit of the data by that model and hence a greater probability that the model in question was the one that generated the data. (See also the Bayes factor article.) In the former purpose (that of approximating a posterior probability), variational Bayes is an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling methods — particularly, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling — for taking a fully Bayesian approach to statistical inference over complex distributions that are difficult to evaluate directly or sample. In particular, whereas Monte Carlo techniques provide a numerical approximation to the exact posterior using a set of samples, Variational Bayes provides a locally-optimal, exact analytical solution to an approximation of the posterior. Variational Bayes can be seen as an extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm from maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP estimation) of the single most probable value of each parameter to fully Bayesian estimation which computes (an approximation to) the entire posterior distribution of the parameters and latent variables. As in EM, it finds a set of optimal parameter values, and it has the same alternating structure as does EM, based on a set of interlocked (mutually dependent) equations that cannot be solved analytically. For many applications, variational Bayes produces solutions of comparable accuracy to Gibbs sampling at greater speed. However, deriving the set of equations used to update the parameters iteratively often requires a large amount of work compared with deriving the comparable Gibbs sampling equations. This is the case even for many models that are conceptually quite simple, as is demonstrated below in the case of a basic non-hierarchical model with only two parameters and no latent variables. Mathematical derivation = Problem = In variational inference, the posterior distribution over a set of unobserved variables mathbf{Z} = {Z_1 dots Z_n} given some data mathbf{X} is approximated by a so-called variational distribution, Q(mathbf{Z}): :P(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X}) approx Q(mathbf{Z}). The distribution Q(mathbf{Z}) is restricted to belong to a family of distributions of simpler form (e.g. a family of Gaussian distributions) than P(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X}), selected with the intention of making Q(mathbf{Z}) similar to the true posterior, P(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X}). The similarity (or dissimilarity) is measured in terms of a dissimilarity function d(Q; P) and hence inference is performed by selecting the distribution Q(mathbf{Z}) that minimizes d(Q; P). = KL divergence = The most common type of variational Bayes uses the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) of P from Q as the choice of dissimilarity function. This choice makes this minimization tractable. The KL-divergence is defined as :D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q parallel P) triangleq sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) log frac{Q(mathbf{Z})}{P(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X})}. Note that Q and P are reversed from what one might expect. This use of reversed KL-divergence is conceptually similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm. (Using the KL- divergence in the other way produces the expectation propagation algorithm.) = Intractability = Variational techniques are typically used to form an approximation for: :P(mathbf Z mid mathbf X) = frac{P(mathbf X mid mathbf Z)P(mathbf Z)}{P(mathbf X)} = frac{P(mathbf X mid mathbf Z)P(mathbf Z)}{int_{mathbf Z} P(mathbf X,mathbf Z) ,dmathbf Z} The marginalization over mathbf Z to calculate P(mathbf X) in the denominator is typically intractable, because, for example, the search space of mathbf Z is combinatorially large. Therefore, we seek an approximation, using Q(mathbf Z) approx P(mathbf Z mid mathbf X). = Evidence lower bound = Given that P(mathbf Z mid mathbf X) = frac{P(mathbf X, mathbf Z)}{P(mathbf X)}, the KL-divergence above can also be written as : D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q parallel P) = sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) left[ log frac{Q(mathbf{Z})}{P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X})} + log P(mathbf{X}) right] = sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) left[ log Q(mathbf{Z}) - log P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X}) right] + sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) left[ log P(mathbf{X}) right] Because P(mathbf{X}) is a constant with respect to mathbf Z and sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) = 1 because Q(mathbf{Z}) is a distribution, we have : D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q parallel P) = sum_mathbf{Z} Q(mathbf{Z}) left[ log Q(mathbf{Z}) - log P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X}) right] + log P(mathbf{X}) which, according to the definition of expected value (for a discrete random variable), can be written as follows : D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q parallel P) = mathbb{E}_{mathbf Q } left[ log Q(mathbf{Z}) - log P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X}) right] + log P(mathbf{X}) which can be rearranged to become : log P(mathbf{X}) = D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q parallel P) - mathbb{E}_{mathbf Q } left[ log Q(mathbf{Z}) - log P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X}) right] = D_{mathrm{KL}}(Qparallel P) + mathcal{L}(Q) As the log evidence log P(mathbf{X}) is fixed with respect to Q, maximizing the final term mathcal{L}(Q) minimizes the KL divergence of Q from P. By appropriate choice of Q, mathcal{L}(Q) becomes tractable to compute and to maximize. Hence we have both an analytical approximation Q for the posterior P(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X}), and a lower bound mathcal{L}(Q) for the evidence log P(mathbf{X}) (since the KL-divergence is non-negative). The lower bound mathcal{L}(Q) is known as the (negative) variational free energy in analogy with thermodynamic free energy because it can also be expressed as a negative \\"energy\\" operatorname{E}_{Q}[log P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X})] plus the entropy of Q. The term mathcal{L}(Q) is also known as Evidence Lower BOund, abbreviated as ELBO, to emphasize that it is a lower bound on the evidence of the data. = Proofs = By generalized Pythagorean theorem of Bregman divergence, of which KL-divergence is a special case, it can be shown that : right300pxthumbGeneralized Pythagorean theorem for Bregman divergence . : D_{mathrm{KL}}(Qparallel P) geq D_{mathrm{KL}}(Qparallel Q^{*}) + D_{mathrm{KL}}(Q^{*}parallel P), forall Q^{*} inmathcal{C} where mathcal{C} is a convex set and the equality holds if: : Q = Q^{*} triangleq argmin_{Qinmathcal{C}}D_{mathrm{KL}}(Qparallel P). In this case, the global minimizer Q^{*}(mathbf{Z}) = q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_2) = q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_2midmathbf{Z}_1)q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1), with mathbf{Z}={mathbf{Z_1},mathbf{Z_2}}, can be found as follows : : q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_2) = frac{P(mathbf{X})}{zeta(mathbf{X})}frac{P(mathbf{Z}_2midmathbf{X})}{exp(D_{mathrm{KL}}(q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)parallel P(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2,mathbf{X})))} = frac{1}{zeta(mathbf{X})}expmathbb{E}_{q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)}left(logfrac{P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X})}{q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)}right), in which the normalizing constant is: :zeta(mathbf{X}) =P(mathbf{X})int_{mathbf{Z}_2}frac{P(mathbf{Z}_2midmathbf{X})}{exp(D_{mathrm{KL}}(q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)parallel P(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2,mathbf{X})))} = int_{mathbf{Z}_{2}}expmathbb{E}_{q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)}left(logfrac{P(mathbf{Z},mathbf{X})}{q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2)}right). The term zeta(mathbf{X}) is often called the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in practice, since P(mathbf{X})geqzeta(mathbf{X})=exp(mathcal{L}(Q^{*})), as shown above. By interchanging the roles of mathbf{Z}_1 and mathbf{Z}_2, we can iteratively compute the approximated q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1) and q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_2) of the true model's marginals P(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{X}) and P(mathbf{Z}_2midmathbf{X}), respectively. Although this iterative scheme is guaranteed to converge monotonically , the converged Q^{*} is only a local minimizer of D_{mathrm{KL}}(Qparallel P). If the constrained space mathcal{C} is confined within independent space, i.e. q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1midmathbf{Z}_2) = q^{*}(mathbf{Z_1}),the above iterative scheme will become the so-called mean field approximation Q^{*}(mathbf{Z}) = q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_1)q^{*}(mathbf{Z}_2),as shown below. Mean field approximation The variational distribution Q(mathbf{Z}) is usually assumed to factorize over some partition of the latent variables, i.e. for some partition of the latent variables mathbf{Z} into mathbf{Z}_1 dots mathbf{Z}_M, :Q(mathbf{Z}) = prod_{i=1}^M q_i(mathbf{Z}_imid mathbf{X}) It can be shown using the calculus of variations (hence the name \\"variational Bayes\\") that the \\"best\\" distribution q_j^{*} for each of the factors q_j (in terms of the distribution minimizing the KL divergence, as described above) can be expressed as: :q_j^{*}(mathbf{Z}_jmid mathbf{X}) = frac{e^{operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})]}}{int e^{operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})]}, dmathbf{Z}_j} where operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})] is the expectation of the logarithm of the joint probability of the data and latent variables, taken over all variables not in the partition. In practice, we usually work in terms of logarithms, i.e.: :ln q_j^{*}(mathbf{Z}_jmid mathbf{X}) = operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})] + text{constant} The constant in the above expression is related to the normalizing constant (the denominator in the expression above for q_j^{*}) and is usually reinstated by inspection, as the rest of the expression can usually be recognized as being a known type of distribution (e.g. Gaussian, gamma, etc.). Using the properties of expectations, the expression operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})] can usually be simplified into a function of the fixed hyperparameters of the prior distributions over the latent variables and of expectations (and sometimes higher moments such as the variance) of latent variables not in the current partition (i.e. latent variables not included in mathbf{Z}_j). This creates circular dependencies between the parameters of the distributions over variables in one partition and the expectations of variables in the other partitions. This naturally suggests an iterative algorithm, much like EM (the expectation-maximization algorithm), in which the expectations (and possibly higher moments) of the latent variables are initialized in some fashion (perhaps randomly), and then the parameters of each distribution are computed in turn using the current values of the expectations, after which the expectation of the newly computed distribution is set appropriately according to the computed parameters. An algorithm of this sort is guaranteed to converge. In other words, for each of the partitions of variables, by simplifying the expression for the distribution over the partition's variables and examining the distribution's functional dependency on the variables in question, the family of the distribution can usually be determined (which in turn determines the value of the constant). The formula for the distribution's parameters will be expressed in terms of the prior distributions' hyperparameters (which are known constants), but also in terms of expectations of functions of variables in other partitions. Usually these expectations can be simplified into functions of expectations of the variables themselves (i.e. the means); sometimes expectations of squared variables (which can be related to the variance of the variables), or expectations of higher powers (i.e. higher moments) also appear. In most cases, the other variables' distributions will be from known families, and the formulas for the relevant expectations can be looked up. However, those formulas depend on those distributions' parameters, which depend in turn on the expectations about other variables. The result is that the formulas for the parameters of each variable's distributions can be expressed as a series of equations with mutual, nonlinear dependencies among the variables. Usually, it is not possible to solve this system of equations directly. However, as described above, the dependencies suggest a simple iterative algorithm, which in most cases is guaranteed to converge. An example will make this process clearer. A basic example Consider a simple non-hierarchical Bayesian model consisting of a set of i.i.d. observations from a Gaussian distribution, with unknown mean and variance.Based on Chapter 10 of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop In the following, we work through this model in great detail to illustrate the workings of the variational Bayes method. For mathematical convenience, in the following example we work in terms of the precision — i.e. the reciprocal of the variance (or in a multivariate Gaussian, the inverse of the covariance matrix) — rather than the variance itself. (From a theoretical standpoint, precision and variance are equivalent since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two.) =The mathematical model= We place conjugate prior distributions on the unknown mean mu and precision tau, i.e. the mean also follows a Gaussian distribution while the precision follows a gamma distribution. In other words: : begin{align} tau & sim operatorname{Gamma}(a_0, b_0)  mu & sim mathcal{N}(mu_0, (lambda_0 tau)^{-1})  {x_1, dots, x_N} & sim mathcal{N}(mu, tau^{-1})  N &= text{number of data points} end{align} The hyperparameters mu_0, lambda_0, a_0 and b_0 in the prior distributions are fixed, given values. They can be set to small positive numbers to give broad prior distributions indicating ignorance about the prior distributions of mu and tau. We are given N data points mathbf{X} = {x_1, ldots, x_N} and our goal is to infer the posterior distribution q(mu, tau)=p(mu,taumid x_1, ldots, x_N) of the parameters mu and tau. =The joint probability= The joint probability of all variables can be rewritten as :p(mathbf{X},mu,tau) = p(mathbf{X}mid mu,tau) p(mumid tau) p(tau) where the individual factors are : begin{align} p(mathbf{X}mid mu,tau) & = prod_{n=1}^N mathcal{N}(x_nmid mu,tau^{-1})  p(mumid tau) & = mathcal{N} left (mumid mu_0, (lambda_0 tau)^{-1} right )  p(tau) & = operatorname{Gamma}(taumid a_0, b_0) end{align} where : begin{align} mathcal{N}(xmid mu,sigma^2) & = frac{1}{sqrt{2pisigma^2}} e^{frac{-(x-mu)^2}{2sigma^2}}  operatorname{Gamma}(taumid a,b) & = frac{1}{Gamma(a)} b^a tau^{a-1} e^{-b tau} end{align} =Factorized approximation= Assume that q(mu,tau) = q(mu)q(tau), i.e. that the posterior distribution factorizes into independent factors for mu and tau. This type of assumption underlies the variational Bayesian method. The true posterior distribution does not in fact factor this way (in fact, in this simple case, it is known to be a Gaussian-gamma distribution), and hence the result we obtain will be an approximation. =Derivation of = Then : begin{align} ln q_mu^*(mu) &= operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln p(mathbf{X}mid mu,tau) + ln p(mumid tau) + ln p(tau)right] + C  &= operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln p(mathbf{X}mid mu,tau)right] + operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln p(mumid tau)right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[ln p(tau)right] + C  &= operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln prod_{n=1}^N mathcal{N} left (x_nmid mu,tau^{-1} right )right] + operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln mathcal{N} left (mumid mu_0, (lambda_0 tau)^{-1} right )right] + C_2  &= operatorname{E}_tauleft[ln prod_{n=1}^N sqrt{frac{tau}{2pi}} e^{-frac{(x_n-mu)^2tau}{2}}right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[ln sqrt{frac{lambda_0 tau}{2pi}} e^{-frac{(mu-mu_0)^2lambda_0 tau}{2}}right] + C_2  &= operatorname{E}_{tau}left[sum_{n=1}^N left(frac{1}{2}(lntau - ln 2pi) - frac{(x_n-mu)^2tau}{2}right)right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[frac{1}{2}(ln lambda_0 + ln tau - ln 2pi) - frac{(mu-mu_0)^2lambda_0 tau}{2}right] + C_2  &= operatorname{E}_{tau}left[sum_{n=1}^N -frac{(x_n-mu)^2tau}{2}right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[-frac{(mu-mu_0)^2lambda_0 tau}{2}right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{2}(lntau - ln 2pi)right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[frac{1}{2}(ln lambda_0 + ln tau - ln 2pi)right] + C_2  &= operatorname{E}_{tau}left[sum_{n=1}^N -frac{(x_n-mu)^2tau}{2}right] + operatorname{E}_{tau}left[-frac{(mu-mu_0)^2lambda_0 tau}{2}right] + C_3  &= - frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu-mu_0)^2 right} + C_3 end{align} In the above derivation, C, C_2 and C_3 refer to values that are constant with respect to mu. Note that the term operatorname{E}_{tau}[ln p(tau)] is not a function of mu and will have the same value regardless of the value of mu. Hence in line 3 we can absorb it into the constant term at the end. We do the same thing in line 7. The last line is simply a quadratic polynomial in mu. Since this is the logarithm of q_mu^*(mu), we can see that q_mu^*(mu) itself is a Gaussian distribution. With a certain amount of tedious math (expanding the squares inside of the braces, separating out and grouping the terms involving mu and mu^2 and completing the square over mu), we can derive the parameters of the Gaussian distribution: :begin{align} ln q_mu^*(mu) &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu-mu_0)^2 right} + C_3  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ sum_{n=1}^N (x_n^2-2x_nmu + mu^2) + lambda_0(mu^2-2mu_0mu + mu_0^2) right } + C_3  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ left(sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2right)-2left(sum_{n=1}^N x_nright)mu + left ( sum_{n=1}^N mu^2 right) + lambda_0mu^2-2lambda_0mu_0mu + lambda_0mu_0^2 right} + C_3  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)mu^2 -2left(lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_nright)mu + left(sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2right) + lambda_0mu_0^2 right} + C_3  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)mu^2 -2left(lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_nright)mu right} + C_4  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)mu^2 -2left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N} right)(lambda_0+N) mu right} + C_4  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)left(mu^2 -2left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right) muright) right} + C_4  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)left(mu^2 -2left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right) mu + left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right)^2 - left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right)^2right) right} + C_4  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)left(mu^2 -2left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right) mu + left(frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right)^2 right) right} + C_5  &= -frac{operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]}{2} left{ (lambda_0+N)left(mu-frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right)^2 right} + C_5  &= -frac{1}{2} (lambda_0+N)operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau] left(mu-frac{lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n}{lambda_0+N}right)^2 + C_5 end{align} Note that all of the above steps can be shortened by using the formula for the sum of two quadratics. In other words: : begin{align} q_mu^*(mu) &sim mathcal{N}(mumid mu_N,lambda_N^{-1})  mu_N &= frac{lambda_0 mu_0 + N bar{x}}{lambda_0 + N}  lambda_N &= (lambda_0 + N) operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]  bar{x} &= frac{1}{N}sum_{n=1}^N x_n end{align} =Derivation of = The derivation of q_tau^*(tau) is similar to above, although we omit some of the details for the sake of brevity. : begin{align} ln q_tau^*(tau) &= operatorname{E}_{mu}[ln p(mathbf{X}mid mu,tau) + ln p(mumid tau)] + ln p(tau) + text{constant}  &= (a_0 - 1) ln tau - b_0 tau + frac{1}{2} ln tau + frac{N}{2} ln tau - frac{tau}{2} operatorname{E}_mu left [ sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu - mu_0)^2 right ] + text{constant} end{align} Exponentiating both sides, we can see that q_tau^*(tau) is a gamma distribution. Specifically: : begin{align} q_tau^*(tau) &sim operatorname{Gamma}(taumid a_N, b_N)  a_N &= a_0 + frac{N+1}{2}  b_N &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}_mu left[sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu - mu_0)^2right] end{align} =Algorithm for computing the parameters= Let us recap the conclusions from the previous sections: : begin{align} q_mu^*(mu) &sim mathcal{N}(mumidmu_N,lambda_N^{-1})  mu_N &= frac{lambda_0 mu_0 + N bar{x}}{lambda_0 + N}  lambda_N &= (lambda_0 + N) operatorname{E}_{tau}[tau]  bar{x} &= frac{1}{N}sum_{n=1}^N x_n end{align} and : begin{align} q_tau^*(tau) &sim operatorname{Gamma}(taumid a_N, b_N)  a_N &= a_0 + frac{N+1}{2}  b_N &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}_mu left[sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu - mu_0)^2right] end{align} In each case, the parameters for the distribution over one of the variables depend on expectations taken with respect to the other variable. We can expand the expectations, using the standard formulas for the expectations of moments of the Gaussian and gamma distributions: : begin{align} operatorname{E}[taumid a_N, b_N] &= frac{a_N}{b_N}  operatorname{E} left [mumidmu_N,lambda_N^{-1} right ] &= mu_N  operatorname{E}left[X^2 right] &= operatorname{Var}(X) + (operatorname{E}[X])^2  operatorname{E} left [mu^2midmu_N,lambda_N^{-1} right ] &= lambda_N^{-1} + mu_N^2 end{align} Applying these formulas to the above equations is trivial in most cases, but the equation for b_N takes more work: : begin{align} b_N &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}_mu left[sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-mu)^2 + lambda_0(mu - mu_0)^2right]  &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}_mu left[ (lambda_0+N)mu^2 -2 left (lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n right )mu + left(sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 right ) + lambda_0mu_0^2 right]  &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} left[ (lambda_0+N)operatorname{E}_mu[mu^2] -2 left (lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n right)operatorname{E}_mu [mu] + left (sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 right ) + lambda_0mu_0^2 right]  &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} left[ (lambda_0+N) left (lambda_N^{-1} + mu_N^2 right ) -2 left (lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n right)mu_N + left(sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 right) + lambda_0mu_0^2 right]  end{align} We can then write the parameter equations as follows, without any expectations: :begin{align} mu_N &= frac{lambda_0 mu_0 + N bar{x}}{lambda_0 + N}  lambda_N &= (lambda_0 + N) frac{a_N}{b_N}  bar{x} &= frac{1}{N}sum_{n=1}^N x_n  a_N &= a_0 + frac{N+1}{2}  b_N &= b_0 + frac{1}{2} left[ (lambda_0+N) left (lambda_N^{-1} + mu_N^2 right ) -2 left (lambda_0mu_0 + sum_{n=1}^N x_n right )mu_N + left (sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 right ) + lambda_0mu_0^2 right] end{align} Note that there are circular dependencies among the formulas for lambda_Nand b_N. This naturally suggests an EM-like algorithm: #Compute sum_{n=1}^N x_n and sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2. Use these values to compute mu_N and a_N. #Initialize lambda_N to some arbitrary value. #Use the current value of lambda_N, along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute b_N. #Use the current value of b_N, along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute lambda_N. #Repeat the last two steps until convergence (i.e. until neither value has changed more than some small amount). We then have values for the hyperparameters of the approximating distributions of the posterior parameters, which we can use to compute any properties we want of the posterior — e.g. its mean and variance, a 95% highest-density region (the smallest interval that includes 95% of the total probability), etc. It can be shown that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. Note also that the posterior distributions have the same form as the corresponding prior distributions. We did not assume this; the only assumption we made was that the distributions factorize, and the form of the distributions followed naturally. It turns out (see below) that the fact that the posterior distributions have the same form as the prior distributions is not a coincidence, but a general result whenever the prior distributions are members of the exponential family, which is the case for most of the standard distributions. Further discussion =Step-by-step recipe= The above example shows the method by which the variational-Bayesian approximation to a posterior probability density in a given Bayesian network is derived: #Describe the network with a graphical model, identifying the observed variables (data) mathbf{X} and unobserved variables (parameters boldsymbolTheta and latent variables mathbf{Z}) and their conditional probability distributions. Variational Bayes will then construct an approximation to the posterior probability p(mathbf{Z},boldsymbolThetamidmathbf{X}). The approximation has the basic property that it is a factorized distribution, i.e. a product of two or more independent distributions over disjoint subsets of the unobserved variables. #Partition the unobserved variables into two or more subsets, over which the independent factors will be derived. There is no universal procedure for doing this; creating too many subsets yields a poor approximation, while creating too few makes the entire variational Bayes procedure intractable. Typically, the first split is to separate the parameters and latent variables; often, this is enough by itself to produce a tractable result. Assume that the partitions are called mathbf{Z}_1,ldots,mathbf{Z}_M. #For a given partition mathbf{Z}_j, write down the formula for the best approximating distribution q_j^{*}(mathbf{Z}_jmid mathbf{X}) using the basic equation ln q_j^{*}(mathbf{Z}_jmid mathbf{X}) = operatorname{E}_{i eq j} [ln p(mathbf{Z}, mathbf{X})] + text{constant} . #Fill in the formula for the joint probability distribution using the graphical model. Any component conditional distributions that don't involve any of the variables in mathbf{Z}_j can be ignored; they will be folded into the constant term. #Simplify the formula and apply the expectation operator, following the above example. Ideally, this should simplify into expectations of basic functions of variables not in mathbf{Z}_j (e.g. first or second raw moments, expectation of a logarithm, etc.). In order for the variational Bayes procedure to work well, these expectations should generally be expressible analytically as functions of the parameters and/or hyperparameters of the distributions of these variables. In all cases, these expectation terms are constants with respect to the variables in the current partition. #The functional form of the formula with respect to the variables in the current partition indicates the type of distribution. In particular, exponentiating the formula generates the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution (or at least, something proportional to it, with unknown normalization constant). In order for the overall method to be tractable, it should be possible to recognize the functional form as belonging to a known distribution. Significant mathematical manipulation may be required to convert the formula into a form that matches the PDF of a known distribution. When this can be done, the normalization constant can be reinstated by definition, and equations for the parameters of the known distribution can be derived by extracting the appropriate parts of the formula. #When all expectations can be replaced analytically with functions of variables not in the current partition, and the PDF put into a form that allows identification with a known distribution, the result is a set of equations expressing the values of the optimum parameters as functions of the parameters of variables in other partitions. #When this procedure can be applied to all partitions, the result is a set of mutually linked equations specifying the optimum values of all parameters. #An expectation maximization (EM) type procedure is then applied, picking an initial value for each parameter and the iterating through a series of steps, where at each step we cycle through the equations, updating each parameter in turn. This is guaranteed to converge. =Most important points= Due to all of the mathematical manipulations involved, it is easy to lose track of the big picture. The important things are: #The idea of variational Bayes is to construct an analytical approximation to the posterior probability of the set of unobserved variables (parameters and latent variables), given the data. This means that the form of the solution is similar to other Bayesian inference methods, such as Gibbs sampling — i.e. a distribution that seeks to describe everything that is known about the variables. As in other Bayesian methods — but unlike e.g. in expectation maximization (EM) or other maximum likelihood methods — both types of unobserved variables (i.e. parameters and latent variables) are treated the same, i.e. as random variables. Estimates for the variables can then be derived in the standard Bayesian ways, e.g. calculating the mean of the distribution to get a single point estimate or deriving a credible interval, highest density region, etc. #\\"Analytical approximation\\" means that a formula can be written down for the posterior distribution. The formula generally consists of a product of well-known probability distributions, each of which factorizes over a set of unobserved variables (i.e. it is conditionally independent of the other variables, given the observed data). This formula is not the true posterior distribution, but an approximation to it; in particular, it will generally agree fairly closely in the lowest moments of the unobserved variables, e.g. the mean and variance. #The result of all of the mathematical manipulations is (1) the identity of the probability distributions making up the factors, and (2) mutually dependent formulas for the parameters of these distributions. The actual values of these parameters are computed numerically, through an alternating iterative procedure much like EM. =Compared with expectation maximization (EM)= Variational Bayes (VB) is often compared with expectation maximization (EM). The actual numerical procedure is quite similar, in that both are alternating iterative procedures that successively converge on optimum parameter values. The initial steps to derive the respective procedures are also vaguely similar, both starting out with formulas for probability densities and both involving significant amounts of mathematical manipulations. However, there are a number of differences. Most important is what is being computed. *EM computes point estimates of posterior distribution of those random variables that can be categorized as \\"parameters\\", but only estimates of the actual posterior distributions of the latent variables (at least in \\"soft EM\\", and often only when the latent variables are discrete). The point estimates computed are the modes of these parameters; no other information is available. *VB, on the other hand, computes estimates of the actual posterior distribution of all variables, both parameters and latent variables. When point estimates need to be derived, generally the mean is used rather than the mode, as is normal in Bayesian inference. Concomitant with this, the parameters computed in VB do not have the same significance as those in EM. EM computes optimum values of the parameters of the Bayes network itself. VB computes optimum values of the parameters of the distributions used to approximate the parameters and latent variables of the Bayes network. For example, a typical Gaussian mixture model will have parameters for the mean and variance of each of the mixture components. EM would directly estimate optimum values for these parameters. VB, however, would first fit a distribution to these parameters — typically in the form of a prior distribution, e.g. a normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution — and would then compute values for the parameters of this prior distribution, i.e. essentially hyperparameters. In this case, VB would compute optimum estimates of the four parameters of the normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution that describes the joint distribution of the mean and variance of the component. A more complex example Bayesian Gaussian mixture model using plate notation. Smaller squares indicate fixed parameters; larger circles indicate random variables. Filled-in shapes indicate known values. The indication [K] means a vector of size K; [D,D] means a matrix of size D×D; K alone means a categorical variable with K outcomes. The squiggly line coming from z ending in a crossbar indicates a switch — the value of this variable selects, for the other incoming variables, which value to use out of the size-K array of possible values. Imagine a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model described as follows: : begin{align} mathbf{pi} & sim operatorname{SymDir}(K, alpha_0)  mathbf{Lambda}_{i=1 dots K} & sim mathcal{W}(mathbf{W}_0, u_0)  mathbf{mu}_{i=1 dots K} & sim mathcal{N}(mathbf{mu}_0, (beta_0 mathbf{Lambda}_i)^{-1})  mathbf{z}[i = 1 dots N] & sim operatorname{Mult}(1, mathbf{pi})  mathbf{x}_{i=1 dots N} & sim mathcal{N}(mathbf{mu}_{z_i}, {mathbf{Lambda}_{z_i}}^{-1})  K &= text{number of mixing components}  N &= text{number of data points} end{align} Note: *SymDir() is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution of dimension K, with the hyperparameter for each component set to alpha_0. The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution or multinomial distribution. *mathcal{W}() is the Wishart distribution, which is the conjugate prior of the precision matrix (inverse covariance matrix) for a multivariate Gaussian distribution. *Mult() is a multinomial distribution over a single observation (equivalent to a categorical distribution). The state space is a \\"one-of-K\\" representation, i.e. a K-dimensional vector in which one of the elements is 1 (specifying the identity of the observation) and all other elements are 0. *mathcal{N}() is the Gaussian distribution, in this case specifically the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The interpretation of the above variables is as follows: *mathbf{X} = {mathbf{x}_1, dots, mathbf{x}_N} is the set of N data points, each of which is a D-dimensional vector distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. *mathbf{Z} = {mathbf{z}_1, dots, mathbf{z}_N} is a set of latent variables, one per data point, specifying which mixture component the corresponding data point belongs to, using a \\"one-of-K\\" vector representation with components z_{nk} for k = 1 dots K, as described above. *mathbf{pi} is the mixing proportions for the K mixture components. *mathbf{mu}_{i=1 dots K} and mathbf{Lambda}_{i=1 dots K} specify the parameters (mean and precision) associated with each mixture component. The joint probability of all variables can be rewritten as :p(mathbf{X},mathbf{Z},mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}) = p(mathbf{X}mid mathbf{Z},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}) p(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{pi}) p(mathbf{pi}) p(mathbf{mu}mid mathbf{Lambda}) p(mathbf{Lambda}) where the individual factors are : begin{align} p(mathbf{X}mid mathbf{Z},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}) & = prod_{n=1}^N prod_{k=1}^K mathcal{N}(mathbf{x}_nmid mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k^{-1})^{z_{nk}}  p(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{pi}) & = prod_{n=1}^N prod_{k=1}^K pi_k^{z_{nk}}  p(mathbf{pi}) & = frac{Gamma(Kalpha_0)}{Gamma(alpha_0)^K} prod_{k=1}^K pi_k^{alpha_0-1}  p(mathbf{mu}mid mathbf{Lambda}) & = prod_{k=1}^K mathcal{N}(mathbf{mu}_kmid mathbf{mu}_0,(beta_0 mathbf{Lambda}_k)^{-1})  p(mathbf{Lambda}) & = prod_{k=1}^K mathcal{W}(mathbf{Lambda}_kmid mathbf{W}_0, u_0) end{align} where : begin{align} mathcal{N}(mathbf{x}mid mathbf{mu},mathbf{Sigma}) & = frac{1}{(2pi)^{D/2}} frac{1}{mathbf{Sigma}^{1/2}} exp left{ -frac{1}{2}(mathbf{x}-mathbf{mu})^{rm T} mathbf{Sigma}^{-1}(mathbf{x}-mathbf{mu}) right}  mathcal{W}(mathbf{Lambda}mid mathbf{W}, u) & = B(mathbf{W}, u) mathbf{Lambda}^{( u-D-1)/2} exp left(-frac{1}{2} operatorname{Tr}(mathbf{W}^{-1}mathbf{Lambda}) right)  B(mathbf{W}, u) & = mathbf{W}^{- u/2} left{ 2^{ u D/2} pi^{D(D-1)/4} prod_{i=1}^{D} Gammaleft(frac{ u + 1 - i}{2}right) right}^{-1}  D & = text{dimensionality of each data point} end{align} Assume that q(mathbf{Z},mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}) = q(mathbf{Z})q(mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}). Then : begin{align} ln q^*(mathbf{Z}) &= operatorname{E}_{mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}}[ln p(mathbf{X},mathbf{Z},mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda})] + text{constant}  &= operatorname{E}_{mathbf{pi}}[ln p(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{pi})] + operatorname{E}_{mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}}[ln p(mathbf{X}mid mathbf{Z},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda})] + text{constant}  &= sum_{n=1}^N sum_{k=1}^K z_{nk} ln rho_{nk} + text{constant} end{align} where we have defined :ln rho_{nk} = operatorname{E}[ln pi_k] + frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}[ln mathbf{Lambda}_k] - frac{D}{2} ln(2pi) - frac{1}{2} operatorname{E}_{mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k} [(mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)^{rm T} mathbf{Lambda}_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)] Exponentiating both sides of the formula for ln q^*(mathbf{Z}) yields :q^*(mathbf{Z}) propto prod_{n=1}^N prod_{k=1}^K rho_{nk}^{z_{nk}} Requiring that this be normalized ends up requiring that the rho_{nk} sum to 1 over all values of k, yielding :q^*(mathbf{Z}) = prod_{n=1}^N prod_{k=1}^K r_{nk}^{z_{nk}} where :r_{nk} = frac{rho_{nk}}{sum_{j=1}^K rho_{nj}} In other words, q^*(mathbf{Z}) is a product of single-observation multinomial distributions, and factors over each individual mathbf{z}_n, which is distributed as a single-observation multinomial distribution with parameters r_{nk} for k = 1 dots K. Furthermore, we note that :operatorname{E}[z_{nk}] = r_{nk} , which is a standard result for categorical distributions. Now, considering the factor q(mathbf{pi},mathbf{mu},mathbf{Lambda}), note that it automatically factors into q(mathbf{pi}) prod_{k=1}^K q(mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k) due to the structure of the graphical model defining our Gaussian mixture model, which is specified above. Then, : begin{align} ln q^*(mathbf{pi}) &= ln p(mathbf{pi}) + operatorname{E}_{mathbf{Z}}[ln p(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{pi})] + text{constant}  &= (alpha_0 - 1) sum_{k=1}^K ln pi_k + sum_{n=1}^N sum_{k=1}^K r_{nk} ln pi_k + text{constant} end{align} Taking the exponential of both sides, we recognize q^*(mathbf{pi}) as a Dirichlet distribution :q^*(mathbf{pi}) sim operatorname{Dir}(mathbf{alpha}) , where :alpha_k = alpha_0 + N_k , where :N_k = sum_{n=1}^N r_{nk} , Finally :ln q^*(mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k) = ln p(mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k) + sum_{n=1}^N operatorname{E}[z_{nk}] ln mathcal{N}(mathbf{x}_nmid mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k^{-1}) + text{constant} Grouping and reading off terms involving mathbf{mu}_k and mathbf{Lambda}_k, the result is a Gaussian-Wishart distribution given by :q^*(mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k) = mathcal{N}(mathbf{mu}_kmid mathbf{m}_k,(beta_k mathbf{Lambda}_k)^{-1}) mathcal{W}(mathbf{Lambda}_kmid mathbf{W}_k, u_k) given the definitions : begin{align} beta_k &= beta_0 + N_k  mathbf{m}_k &= frac{1}{beta_k} (beta_0 mathbf{mu}_0 + N_k {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k)  mathbf{W}_k^{-1} &= mathbf{W}_0^{-1} + N_k mathbf{S}_k + frac{beta_0 N_k}{beta_0 + N_k} ({bar{mathbf{x}}}_k - mathbf{mu}_0)({bar{mathbf{x}}}_k - mathbf{mu}_0)^{rm T}  u_k &= u_0 + N_k  N_k &= sum_{n=1}^N r_{nk}  {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k &= frac{1}{N_k} sum_{n=1}^N r_{nk} mathbf{x}_n  mathbf{S}_k &= frac{1}{N_k} sum_{n=1}^N r_{nk} (mathbf{x}_n - {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k) (mathbf{x}_n - {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k)^{rm T} end{align} Finally, notice that these functions require the values of r_{nk}, which make use of rho_{nk}, which is defined in turn based on operatorname{E}[ln pi_k], operatorname{E}[ln mathbf{Lambda}_k], and operatorname{E}_{mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k} [(mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)^{rm T} mathbf{Lambda}_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)]. Now that we have determined the distributions over which these expectations are taken, we can derive formulas for them: : begin{align} operatorname{E}_{mathbf{mu}_k,mathbf{Lambda}_k} [(mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)^{rm T} mathbf{Lambda}_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{mu}_k)] & = Dbeta_k^{-1} + u_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{m}_k)^{rm T} mathbf{W}_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{m}_k)  ln {widetilde{Lambda}}_k &equiv operatorname{E}[ln mathbf{Lambda}_k] = sum_{i=1}^D psi left(frac{ u_k + 1 - i}{2}right) + D ln 2 + ln mathbf{W}_k  ln {widetilde{pi}}_k &equiv operatorname{E}left[ln pi_kright] = psi(alpha_k) - psileft(sum_{i=1}^K alpha_iright) end{align} These results lead to :r_{nk} propto {widetilde{pi}}_k {widetilde{Lambda}}_k^{1/2} exp left{ - frac{D}{2 beta_k} - frac{ u_k}{2} (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{m}_k)^{rm T} mathbf{W}_k (mathbf{x}_n - mathbf{m}_k) right} These can be converted from proportional to absolute values by normalizing over k so that the corresponding values sum to 1. Note that: #The update equations for the parameters beta_k, mathbf{m}_k, mathbf{W}_k and u_k of the variables mathbf{mu}_k and mathbf{Lambda}_k depend on the statistics N_k, {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k, and mathbf{S}_k, and these statistics in turn depend on r_{nk}. #The update equations for the parameters alpha_{1 dots K} of the variable mathbf{pi} depend on the statistic N_k, which depends in turn on r_{nk}. #The update equation for r_{nk} has a direct circular dependence on beta_k, mathbf{m}_k, mathbf{W}_k and u_k as well as an indirect circular dependence on mathbf{W}_k, u_k and alpha_{1 dots K} through {widetilde{pi}}_k and {widetilde{Lambda}}_k. This suggests an iterative procedure that alternates between two steps: #An E-step that computes the value of r_{nk} using the current values of all the other parameters. #An M-step that uses the new value of r_{nk} to compute new values of all the other parameters. Note that these steps correspond closely with the standard EM algorithm to derive a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. The responsibilities r_{nk} in the E step correspond closely to the posterior probabilities of the latent variables given the data, i.e. p(mathbf{Z}mid mathbf{X}); the computation of the statistics N_k, {bar{mathbf{x}}}_k, and mathbf{S}_k corresponds closely to the computation of corresponding \\"soft-count\\" statistics over the data; and the use of those statistics to compute new values of the parameters corresponds closely to the use of soft counts to compute new parameter values in normal EM over a Gaussian mixture model. Exponential-family distributions Note that in the previous example, once the distribution over unobserved variables was assumed to factorize into distributions over the \\"parameters\\" and distributions over the \\"latent data\\", the derived \\"best\\" distribution for each variable was in the same family as the corresponding prior distribution over the variable. This is a general result that holds true for all prior distributions derived from the exponential family.

Guardian writer Andrew Anthony described her as \\"a pencil- thin woman with heavily enlarged breasts\\".\\"Risky Business\\", The Observer, 1 August 2004  Personal life  Thomas was born in Sikeston, Missouri as one of 11 siblings. She moved around often in her youth with her family, living in various states including Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee. She spent her teenage years in Daytona Beach, Florida. In Florida she became something of a wild child, sacrificing school and books for sunning and bikinis on the Florida beaches. After high school, she moved to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where she performed a variety of jobs, among them, modeling aside the championship trophy after the annual NASCAR race held there was over. She worked as a prostitute at the Moonlite BunnyRanch, and according to Dennis Hof made $2000 a night. 2002 saw Thomas speaking publicly about her life at the BunnyRanch in the HBO documentary series entitled Cathouse, and in 2003, she appeared in its sequel. She later told interviewer Andrew Anthony that there is no real difference between pornography and prostitution. Thomas is the aunt of porn star Sunrise Adams.Sunrise Adams Thomas was married to Kent Wallace, her publicist and co-star from her reality show Sin City Mom. She dated Dennis Hof, the owner of Moonlight Bunny Ranch, during her tenure there, and during that time legally adopted the name Diane Hof.  Adult film career  Thomas shot her first adult film when she was 18, appearing in Mr. Peeper's 25th Anniversary alongside her husband, Zach, and another man. She says the name \\"Sunset\\" was inspired by a comment of her husband when he said \\"You know what, honey?...you're pretty as a sunset\\"; the name Thomas popped up when she was thinking of a good last name to go with it. After appearing in the Cathouse documentaries, Thomas was featured in the 2005 documentary Pornstar Pets and made an appearance on Maury, in which she encountered a crush from her middle school days. The episode was titled 'I Was An Ugly Teen... Now I'm a Hot, Sexy 10!'. In 2006, Thomas obtained her own show on KSEX radio called Sunset After Sunset. In 2007, she appeared on the Montel Williams Show to discuss her porn career and being a mother. In April 2009 Thomas released her erotic fiction novel, Anatomy of an Adult Film, which was largely a fictionalized account of her adult film career. She was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame in April 2010.

Born in Tianjin, he attended Tsinghua University at the age of 17, and graduated from National Southwestern Associated University in 1940. He served as an assistant lecturer of English at his alma mater for about two years. During World War II, he joined the Chinese Expedition Force in Burma and fought alongside the Allied forces against the Japanese. After the war ended, he attended the University of Chicago, where he obtained a master's degree in English literature. He was a distant paternal relative of the wuxia novelist Louis Cha. Most of Zha's poems were written during the late 1930s and 1940s. His poetry, which is characterised by impassioned speculation, abstract sensuality, and occasionally, restrained irony, is the foremost example of Chinese new vernacular verse absorbing modern Western techniques. Zha was a professed admirer of W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot. He studied their poetry at Southwest Associated University under William Empson, himself a leading modernist poet. On the other hand, the patriotism and the compassion for the suffering and needy in his poetry fall easily in line with a great tradition in Chinese poetry. Zha had to give up poetry writing several years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and he turned to literary translation, for which he is also renowned. His works in this respect include the Chinese translations of Lord Byron's Don Juan and Aleksandr Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. It was not until 1976 that Zha resumed writing poetry. He produced 27 poems that year; highly regarded among them were several moving elegy-style pieces, prophetic of his sudden death of a heart attack in early 1977. External links *Mu Dan.

Tadayoshi thus came to represent two families within the larger Shimazu clan. Shimazu Katsuhisa, who presided over the Shimazu family, did not have a son and he was driven out by Shimazu Sanehisa, who was the head of yet another branch, the Sasshū (薩州家). Sanehisa then laid claim to be the head of the clan without being properly recognized by the rest of the families. Katsuhisa asked Tadayoshi for help to regain his position, and Tadayoshi sent his son Shimazu Takahisa to be adopted by Katsuhisa. In 1526, Katsuhisa handed over the position of the head of the family to Takahisa. In 1539 though, during the Battle of Ichirai, Tadayoshi defeated Katsuhisa (who would regain power later) and Takahisa came to be recognized by all members of the Shimazu clan as the head.

Life and career The Bradbury Building, designed by Wyman, as seen in 2005 Wyman was born in Dayton, the son of Ellen “Nellie” J. (née Rutledge) and Gustavus J. Wyman. On leaving school, he was apprenticed in the architects office of his uncle, Luthor Peters. He moved to Los Angeles in 1891 where he worked as a draughtsman in the offices of Sumner Hunt. In 1892, Hunt was approached by the mining millionaire Lewis Bradbury to construct a landmark building for a site in downtown Los Angeles. Disappointed with Hunt's design, Bradbury took the surprising step of asking the young Wyman to design the building, despite the fact that Wyman had no formal qualifications as an architect, and had not previously designed a building.Barragan, Bianca. \\"The Weird Occult Origins of Downtown LA's Famous Bradbury Building\\", Curbed LA, 17 July 2015. Accessed 7 June 2016. The reasons for this choice are still unclear, but it has been suggested that Bradbury was inspired by some sketches that Wyman had been working on. Wyman had been toying with the design of a futuristic building described in Edward Bellamy's science fiction novel and social commentary, Looking Backward: From 2000-1887 (chapter 10).Bellamy, Edward In the utopian society of the year 2000 the hero is taken to visit a commercial store: With the exception of the fountain, the description neatly fits the interior which Wyman achieved in the Bradbury building just six years after Bellamy's book was published. This narrative has been contested by John Crandell, who claims that the original story was unsubstantiated and relied on a single testimony from Wyman's daughters.Rasmussen, Cecilia. \\"Sifting Myth From History at the Bradbury\\", LA Times, 21 May 2000. Accessed 7 June 2016. According to a story told by Wyman's grandson, the famous sci-fi figure Forrest J Ackerman, Wyman was troubled by the responsibility of taking on the commission. Both he and his wife Belle were Spiritualists, and the couple decided to consult the spirits for guidance. Using a planchette, a device similar to a Ouija board, they traced out the message :Mark Wyman take the Bradbury building and you will be... Successful. Mark Wyman was George's younger brother, who had died at the age of 8. At first, they had trouble reading the final word, as it was written upside down in relation to the rest of the message. As a result, Wyman accepted the commission, and Bradbury was pleased with the drawings and plans for a five-story building at the corner of Broadway and Third Street. The building was completed a year later in 1893 although costs spiralled from $175,000 to $500,000, largely as a result of Bradbury specifying the best quality materials for all aspects of the construction. The Bradbury building was met with critical acclaim, including a positive review in Arts and Architecture magazine. However, it was Wyman's only major success. In the following years, Wyman received numerous commissions for new buildings. He decided to bolster his qualification with an architectural correspondence course, but this seems to have turned him away from using interior light as an architectural element. His office buildings took on a heavy solid style and most have subsequently been demolished, whilst the Bradbury building is still much celebrated. A particular question is why did Esther McCoy not consult a single primary source of information other than the allegation of Wyman's relatives, their claim that George had worked for Sumner Hunt. John Crandell's claim contradicting McCoy's whole thesis is thoroughly based upon primary source information circa 1890s. He has never come across a single piece of evidence that Wyman ever worked directly for Hunt prior to Hunt's election to retain Wyman's services as executive architect for the Byrne Building nine months following completion of the Bradbury. The continued claim of Wyman having been the design architect for the Bradbury Building is one of the most fatuous allegations in the history of Los Angeles.  Cultural influence  Fittingly, given its original inspiration from 19th century science fiction, the building is perhaps best known for its appearance in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Blade Runner, where the decayed and dilapidated interior was used at the location for the home of the toymaker and android designer Sebastien. The building has since been restored, and the exterior is completely different from the sets used in the film, - Sumner, Esther and George ~ The Bradbury, Reconsidered. The Bradbury Building has also featured as a location in several other Hollywood films, including M (1951), Double Indemnity, Marlowe, D.O.A., Chinatown, The Perfect Sleep, Wolf, The Artist and Lethal Weapon 4 and TV shows like City of Angels and The Outer Limits.

A local architect, Sumner Hunt, was hired to design the building, and turned in a completed design,\\"Bradbury Building\\" on the Los Angeles Conservancy website but Bradbury dismissed Hunt's plans as inadequate to the grand building he wanted. He then hired George Wyman, one of Hunt's draftsmen, to do the design. Bradbury supposedly felt that Wyman understood his own vision of the building better than Hunt did, but there is no concrete evidence that Wyman changed Hunt's design, which has raised some controversy about who should be considered to be the architect of the building. Wyman had no formal education as an architect, and was working for Hunt for $5 a week at the time. An entryway with holiday decorations in December 2011 The building opened in 1893, some months after Bradbury's death in 1892, and was completed in 1894, at the total cost of $500,000, about three times the original budget of $175,000.Ferrell, David. \\"The Bradbury Sparkles as Jewel in City Landscape\\" Los Angeles Times (October 10, 2002) =20th century= The building has operated as an office building for most of its history.

Architecture Cast iron filigree balustrades in the building's central atrium The building's undistinguished exterior facade of brown brick, sandstone and terra cotta detailing was designed in the commercial vernacular Italian Renaissance Revival style current at the time. Its interior is its most notable part.\\"The Bradbury Building\\" on the American Institute of Architects, Los Angeles Chapter website The narrow entrance lobby, with its low ceiling and minimal light \\"has the look of a Parisian alley of arched windows\\", and opens into a bright naturally lit great \\"awe-inspiring cathedral-like\\" center court. Robert Forster, star of the TV series Banyon that used the building for his office, described it as \\"one of the great interiors of L.A. Outside it doesn't look like much, but when you walk inside, suddenly you're back a hundred and twenty years.\\" The five-story central court features glazed and unglazed yellow and pink bricks, ornamental cast iron, tiling, Italian marble, Mexican tile, decorative terra cotta and polished wood, capped by a skylight that allows the court to be flooded with natural rather than artificial light, creating ever- changing shadows and accents during the day. At the time the building was completed, it featured the largest plate-glass windows in Los Angeles. Open \\"bird-cage\\" elevators surrounded by wrought-iron grillwork go up to the fifth floor. Geometric patterned staircases and wrought-iron and polished oak railings are used abundantly throughout. The wrought-iron was created in France and displayed at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair before being installed in the building. Freestanding mail-chutes also feature ironwork. The overall effect, according to a Los Angeles Times writer, is \\"a mesmerizing degree of symmetry and visual complexity\\". Tourism The building is a popular tourist attraction. It is open daily and staffed by a government worker who provides historical background on it. Casual visitors are only permitted up to the first landing. Brochures and tours are also available. It is close to three other downtown Los Angeles landmarks: the Grand Central Market, the Million Dollar Theater (across the street) and Angels Flight (two blocks away).

Most notably, the building is a setting in the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, for the character J. F. Sebastian's apartment, and the climactic rooftop scene. The Bradbury Building appeared in the noir films The Unfaithful (1947), Shockproof (1949), D.O.A. (1949), and I, The Jury (1953) (the latter filmed in 3-D). M (1951), a remake of the 1931 German film, contains a long search sequence filmed in the building, and a notable shot through the roof's skylight. The five-story atrium also substituted for the interior of the seedy skid row hotel depicted in the climax of Good Neighbor Sam (1964). The building is also featured in The White Cliffs of Dover (1944), Indestructible Man (1956), Caprice (1967), Marlowe (1969), the 1972 made-for-television movie The Night Strangler, Chinatown (1974), The Cheap Detective (1978), Avenging Angel (1985), Murphy's Law (1986), The Dreamer of Oz (1990 TV movie), 1994's Wolf and Disclosure, Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), Pay It Forward (2000), (500) Days of Summer (2009), and The Artist (2011). Television series that featured the building include the 1964 The Outer Limits episode \\"Demon with a Glass Hand\\", and the 1962 Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Double-Entry Mind.\\" During the season six episodes (1963–64) of the series 77 Sunset Strip, the Stuart \\"Stu\\" Bailey character had his office in the Bradbury. In Quantum Leap the building is seen carrying the name \\"Gotham Towers\\" in \\"Play It Again, Seymour\\", the last episode of the first season (1989). The building appeared in at least one episode of the television series Banyon (1972–73), where it was used as Robert Forster's office,MobileReference. Travel Los Angeles: City Guide and Map 2007. City of Angels (1976) and Mission: Impossible (1966–73), as well as Ned and Chuck's Apartment in Pushing Daisies, which debuted in 2007. The building was also the setting for a scene from the series FlashForward in the episode \\"Let No Man Put Asunder\\". In 2010 the building was transplanted to New York City for a two-part episode of CSI NY. The Bradbury Building and a fake New York City subway entrance across the street were also used to represent the exterior of New York's High School for the Performing Arts in the opening credits of the television series Fame. The building appears as itself in multiple episodes of the fourth season of Amazon Studios' original series Bosch, in both exterior establishing shots, and interior shots. The Bradbury appeared in a 1979 music video by Cher called \\"Take Me Home\\" in addition to music videos from the 1980s by Heart, Janet Jackson, Earth Wind and Fire and Genesis, and a Pontiac Pursuit commercial. Part of Janet Jackson's 1989 film short Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 was filmed in the building as well. The interior appears in the music video for the Pointer Sisters' 1980 song, \\"He's So Shy\\". The Bradbury Building was prominently featured in Monica's 1998 single \\"The First Night\\" as well in Tony! Toni! Toné!'s \\"Let's Get Down\\" music video. In 2016, the interiors were featured in the music video for \\"The Road\\" by Chinese musician Huang Zitao.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZnrDtS2rY The Bradbury has frequently appeared in popular literature. In the \\"Nathan Heller\\" series of detective novels by Max Allan Collins, Heller's A-1 Detective Agency's Los Angeles offices are housed in the Bradbury, as shown in the novel Angel in Black. In the Star Trek novel The Case of the Colonist's Corpse: A Sam Cogley Mystery, the protagonist works from the Bradbury Building four hundred years in the future. Other appearances occur in The Man With The Golden Torc by Simon R. Green, Angels Flight and The Black Box by Michael Connelly, and the science fiction multiple novel series The World Of Tiers by Philip Jose Farmer. DC Comics and Marvel Comics - the latter of which has offices in the real Bradbury Building - both published comic book series based on characters that work in the historic landmark. The building serves as the headquarters for the Marvel Comics team The Order, and in the DC universe, the Human Target runs his private investigation agency from the building. The building was used for the music video for \\"Say Something\\", a song released on January 25, 2018 by Justin Timberlake featuring Chris Stapleton. Chris Brown filmed his music video, \\"Hope You Do,\\" at this iconic location.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmLSua7LPR8 The Bradbury Building was featured in \\"On Location\\", episode 172 of the podcast 99% Invisible.

It is used for bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and prostatitis and is effective against both gram negative and positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and skin rashes. It is a sulfonamide and bacteriostatic. It resembles a component of folic acid. It prevents folic acid synthesis in the bacteria that must synthesize their own folic acid. Mammalian cells, and some bacteria, do not synthesize but require preformed folic acid (vitamin B9); they are therefore insensitive to sulfamethoxazole. It was introduced to the United States in 1961. It is now mostly used in combination with trimethoprim (abbreviated SMX-TMP).SMZ-TMP in Abstract of \\"Cutaneous hypersensitivity to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ TMP) in HIV infected patients\\" at nlm.nih.gov The SMX-TMP combination is on the WHO Model List of Essential medicines as a first-choice treatment for urinary tract infections.

There have been rare instances where severe adverse reactions have resulted in fatalities. These include Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Allergic reactions to Sulfonamides have been shown to include the entire Gel- Coombs spectrum of hyperactivity reactions. Type 1 reactions include immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. In contrast, non-type 1 hypersensitivities are believed to be caused by metabolites of sulfonamides. Therefore, the liver and kidney are the determining factors of these other hypersensitivity reactions; alterations in kidney or liver functions may increase or decrease the frequencies of these reactions. One study has shown the allergic reaction rate to be about 3.0% over 359 courses of therapy. Of the allergic reactions, skin rashes, eosinophilia and drug fever were the most common, while serious reactions were less common. Sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated in people with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides.  Mechanism of action  Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfanilamide, is a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting the production of dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, sulfamethoxazole is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic. Tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathwaySulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Humans do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet.  Pharmacokinetics  Absorption Sulfamethoxazole is well-absorbed when administered topically. It is rapidly absorbed when it is orally administered. Distribution Sulfamethoxazole distributes into most body tissues as well as into sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid. It also crosses the placenta. About 70% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Its Tmax (or time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) occurs 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-life of sulfamethoxazole is 10 hours. However, the half-life of the drug noticeably increases in people with creatinine clearance rates equal to or less than 30 mL/minute. A half-life of 22–50 hours has been reported for people with creatinine clearances of less than 10 mL/minute. Metabolism Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in the human liver to at least 5 metabolites. These metabolites are the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy-sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for the formation of the N4-hydroxy metabolite. In vitro studies suggest sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein transporter. Excretion Sulfamethoxazole is primarily renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 20% of the sulfamethoxazole in urine is the unchanged drug, about 15–20% is the N-glucuronide conjugate, and about 50–70 % is the acetylated metabolite. Sulfamethoxazole is also excreted in human milk.

Its programming is centred towards cultural TV shows and public service programmes in comparison with La 1, its sister network, which is a generalist channel. Some of the network's filming and production of programmes are done on its headquarters in San Cugat del Vallés, Barcelona. The channel started broadcasting in 1966 on UHF frequencies. As RTVE was doing initial test broadcasts on that band, the channel was simply referred to in Spain as \\"UHF\\". It also received other names, such as \\"Cadena II\\", \\"Segunda Cadena\\", \\"Segundo Programa\\" or \\"TVE-2\\" until it adopted the name \\"La 2\\" during the 1990s, with the launch of private television networks for the first time.  History  = Creation of 'The second network' (UHF) = In the 1960s, the Spanish minister of Information and Tourism, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, decided that Televisión Española should start broadcasting a second television network on UHF frequencies, following other European broadcasters that did the same. In 1 January 1965, TVE's second television service was launched in Madrid as a test broadcast, with programming limited to 4 hours at night that consisted on musical slots and re-airings of TV shows from Primera Cadena, mostly Telediario newscasts and Estudio 1. Regular broadcasts were started on 15 November 1966. TVE started producing original programming for the network, mainly produced at the broadcaster's headquarters in Barcelona. UHF's first director was Salvador Pons Muñoz. In its first years, the channel could only be received on Madrid, Zaragoza and Barcelona, cities in which the UHF technology was implemented; it only aired at night and not all TV sets could tune in to. Most TVs couldn't receive UHF broadcasts, so an UHF decoder was needed. As TVE's strategy evolved into turning the first network into a generalist channel, niche programming was moved to UHF. Under the Salvador Pons administration, the second network received artists from the country's Official Film School (), such as Claudio Guerin, Pedro Olea or Antonio Mercero, people who would use the channel as a test zone to air alternative programming, such as documentaries or fiction shows. There was a high share of cultural programmes, like classical music blocks or theatre slots. = 1970s = During the 70s the programming was restricted to the night time (from 20:00 to 00:00), with an extension in the weekends. Coverage reached the big cities of Spain, but although TVE pointed out that only \\"three years\\" would pass before UHF could be tuned in all Spain, the second network could not get it until 1982. For this reason it was not strange that successful programs in the UHF passed to the first network. The UHF continued to develop a minority program, with a strong cultural accent, which did not compete directly with TVE-1. In addition to documentaries, theater and fiction sessions, the second channel accommodated educational spaces and sports. At that time, the second network was colloquially dubbed \\"el canalillo.\\" During the Spanish transition, the programming of the second network received a small boost. In January 1976 debuted the program of debate La Clave (1976-1985), which addressed current issues from different points of view, something very complicated during the Francoism, preceded by a film related to the subject. The interview space was also important A fondo (In depth) (1976 to 1981) in which Joaquín Soler Serrano conversed with personalities from the artistic, literary and scientific fields of the time. On the other hand, the new artistic and musical trends were reflected in Encuentros con las artes y las letras (Encounters with the arts and the lyrics) (1976-1981) and Popgrama (1979-1981). Another important aspect was the consolidation of the territorial centres, especially in Catalonia and Canary Islands. TVE Cataluña established regional programming in opt-outs through the Circuit Català (Catalan circuit), while continuing to produce at the national level. On the occasion of the 1982 World Cup held in Spain, the territorial centre of the Canary Islands erected a new production centre that, in addition to broadcasting the signal of the second network, allowed to develop dedicated programming for the archipelago. = 1980s = In 1983, the second network was renamed \\"TVE-2\\" with a new corporate image. The schedule was not consolidated until the end of the decade. In the mandates of José María Calviño and Pilar Miró, TVE-2 continued to be a cultural channel that accommodated spaces not appropriate for the first network. In the midst of the Movida Madrileña phenomenon, it premiered La Edad de Oro (The Golden Age) (1983 - 1985), with the time turned into a space of worship. The 1980s also marked the premiere of emblematic programs such as the cultural magazine \\"Metropolis\\" (1985), the game show El tiempo es oro (Time is money) presented by Constantino Romero, and Con las manos en la masa (Hands on the bat) (1984), considered the first gastronomical programme in Spanish television history. On the other hand, TVE-2 retained the broadcast of special events live, some of which exceeded in audience the first network: the European football competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup), the Spanish First Division in communities without autonomic television, the qualifying matches of the Spain national football team, and the Eurovision Song Contest from 1984 to 1992. In 1984, it premiered Estadio 2, specializing in sports broadcasts, information and a live results service during the weekends. = Creation of «La 2» = The channel strategy of TVE changed with the emergence of private television in 1989. As of 1991, TVE-2 was turned into «La 2» and assumed a new alternative programming, whose spirit was included in the slogan «La 2, para una inmensa minoría» (La 2, for a huge minority). The following director of TVE, Ramón Colom, would redefine the concept towards a smaller target audience aged 30 years old. In the 90s there was a significant increase in own programming, which would give La 2 its own personality. All documentaries, including Documentos TV, presented by Pedro Erquicia, were moved to that signal. In addition, TVE promoted an alternative newsletter to Telediario with the creation of La 2 Noticias, specialized in news of human, social and ecological interest in exchange for reducing the weight of the policy in the blocks. The new format was premiered on 7 November 1994 and thanks to it two journalists rose to fame: Lorenzo Milá (presenter) and Fran Llorente (news director). In addition, La 2 issued US series with no place on The First: The Simpsons (until 1993), Northern Exposure, Married... with Children and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. As for sports broadcasts, football was transferred to the first channel while the second was left with the rights of the Liga ACB of basketball, the Liga Asobal of handball and the LNFS. Although the channel's audience fell by private competition, these changes served to improve its reputation and turn it into an alternative to conventional programming. The strategy remained unchanged until 2004, with new programs that have been part of the backbone of La 2. In 1996 began the space of scientific disclosure Redes, directed by Eduard Punset, and in 1997 premiered Saber y ganar, presented by Jordi Hurtado, who became the longest-running game show in Spanish television. One year later was launched Versión española (Spanish version), Spanish film program presented by Cayetana Guillén Cuervo and that offered films without advertising breaks. Other important spaces were La noche temática (The thematic night) (documentary block of the pan-European channel Arte), the literary space Negro sobre blanco (Black on white), the informative Escuela del deporte (School of sport) and the containers of infantile programming, among them Con mucha marcha (With a lot of march), TPH Club, Hyakutake and Los Lunnis, the latter one of his greatest commercial successes. = Current situation = In 2004 there are changes in the strategy of La 2: information services are remodeled because Fran Llorente, presenter of La 2 Noticias, is chosen news director of TVE, while Lorenzo Milá becomes the host of the Telediario of La 1. The new direction redirects the offer to the young public, with the advance of primetime at 9:30 p.m., the gradual disappearance of regional programming (except for a few blocks in Catalonia and Canary Islands) and the entry of series American as Six Feet Under, Two and a half men, The OC or Gilmore girls. On 1 June 2010, the Board of Directors of RTVE made La 2 into a strictly cultural channel, positioning it as the reference for creativity and talent. From that same month La 2 stopped broadcasting its sports programming (which happened to Teledeporte) and infantile (which continued in Clan). Instead, it introduced cultural programming from the channel Cultural·es. In addition, an address was created for the channel and its management was moved from Torrespaña, to the center of TVE Cataluña in San Cugat del Vallés, Barcelona. Since 2014, primetime is covered by Spanish cinema cycles from Monday to Friday, and European films on weekends. The audience of La 2 has dropped to 2.6% audience share, similar to the children's channel Clan. = La 2 HD = On 7 September 2017, during the presentation of the new season of the channel, Televisión Española announced the launch of the high definition signal of La 2, which started issuing 31 October 2017 in Madrid, 7 November 2017 in the rest of Spain (except Catalonia and Canary Islands), 14 November 2017 in Catalonia and 21 November 2017 in Canary Islands.

He is the original guitarist of the British progressive rock band Marillion. Outside Marillion, Rothery has recorded two albums as part of the duo the Wishing Tree and an instrumental solo album, The Ghosts of Pripyat, released in September 2014. He also founded the British Guitar Academy in 2011. Biography Rothery was born in Brampton, South Yorkshire, England, and from the age of six he lived in Whitby, North Yorkshire. He began to play the guitar at the age of 15. In an interview for Johnnie Walker's Sounds of the Seventies on BBC Radio 2 in 2013, Rothery revealed that his musical tastes always differed from his friends, who were getting into punk rock while he preferred progressive rock, which he had been introduced to through the Alan Freeman show on BBC Radio 1. = Marillion = In 1979, he saw an ad in the music press for a band called Silmarillion that needed a guitarist. He auditioned successfully for the band (19 August 1979). From this point he concentrated more on melody, composition and mood in his playing, and less on his technique. Later, Silmarillion shortened its name to Marillion. = Outside Marillion =  The Wishing Tree  As well as work with Marillion, he started a solo project under the name the Wishing Tree (with Hannah Stobart providing vocals), and released two albums titled Carnival of Souls (1996) and Ostara (2009).  The British Guitar Academy  In 2011, Rothery launched the British Guitar Academy \\"to bring together some of Britain's top guitarists to pass on their hard won knowledge and experience to a wider audience through a series of workshops and masterclasses. The aim is to concentrate not just on technique but also creativity and individuality.\\"  Solo album The Ghosts of Pripyat (2014)  Rothery had been approached by EMI to make a solo album during the recording of Marillion's Misplaced Childhood (1985) and by Miles Copeland when Marillion were recording Brave in his castle in France in 1994;Steve Rothery Launches Kickstarter Campaign For Solo Album , 25 November 2013, accessed 17 December 2013. he decided to join with Stobart and form The Wishing Tree instead. On 25 November 2013, Rothery announced that he was working on a solo album to be titled The Ghosts of Pripyat and scheduled for a September 2014 release.

He has also cited Joni Mitchell as an influence, especially her use of open tunings, which he believed created a very harmonically rich sound. He has cited Mitchell's \\"A Case of You\\" as one of the songs that had the biggest influence on him.Interview with Steve Rothery. Johnnie Walker's Sounds of the Seventies. BBC Radio 2. 24 March 2013 Rothery added: \\"I was also really influenced by George Harrison—the lesson there being to play just what’s right for the song.\\" According to Rothery: \\"When I was growing up, I was always drawn to players who had an atmospheric and emotional quality to their sound... I think the guitar has the power to communicate emotionally more than any other instrument, and you’re short- changing yourself if you focus on technique at the cost of emotion. You have to listen with your heart, as well as your ears.\\" Barry Cleveland of Guitar Player stated that Rothery \\"specializes in crafting lush sonic atmospheres with layered guitars and effects processing\\". Rothery was hailed by Scott Kahn, the Editor in Chief & CEO of the website MusicPlayers.com, as one of the great progressive rock guitarists, comparing him favourably with John Petrucci, David Gilmour and Alex Lifeson. Kahn described him as \\"an incredibly talented player\\", whose tone \\"is sure to appeal to fans of diverse guitar sounds\\", with \\"guitars drenched in shimmering chorus, sparkling delays and cavernous reverbs\\", \\"spacey sounds and blues sections\\" as well as \\"acoustic rhythms that anchor the melodies.\\" Kahn identified Rothery as having \\"three distinct trademark sounds\\": a \\"sparkling clean arpeggio tone draped in digital delays\\", \\"soaring melodic lead tones\\" and a \\"classic blues tone.\\" Kahn said Rothery was \\"never one to go for major flash, he always plays for the song and not his ego, but when he shines, he shines brightly.\\" Rothery's process for creating his guitar solos is improvisation. He was quoted: \\"That has always been the way I’ve done things, and some of my favourite leads—such as 'Sugar Mice', 'Easter', and the last break in 'This Strange Engine'—were composed on the spot.\\" In 2001, Rothery was voted Yorkshire and Humberside's best guitarist in a poll in Total Guitar magazine with 65% of the vote, beating David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust-era guitarist Mick Ronson into second place. =Equipment= In the 1980s, Rothery used various guitars, including a Yamaha SG-2000 and Fender or Squire Strats. For amps he employed Marshall amps, for overdriven sounds, and Roland Jazz Chorus amps for more effects laden sounds. When interviewed in 2010 he mentioned using a Blade Stratocaster-style guitar with Lindy Fralin pickups, and a signature model by luthier Jack Dent. His guitars are equipped with MIDI. He makes extensive use of loops, via a setup that includes TC Electronic 2290 Dynamic Digital Delays, an AdrenaLinn III, and a variety of other effects all routed through controller made by Gig-Rig. On 8 November 2017 Rothery was presented with his new Blade RH-4 signature guitar by guitar manufacturer Gary Levinson at a promotional event in the Albert Halls in Bolton.

Recording began at Abbey Road Studios on 26 February 1970, and lasted for 15 sessions until 21 July. The album was produced by Pink Floyd's guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright, who also contributed on bass guitar and keyboards respectively, along with previous Madcap contributor Jerry Shirley on drums. Barrett was released in November 1970 on Harvest in the United Kingdom, but failed to chart; it was re-released in 1974 as part of Syd Barrett, which was the first US issues of these LPs. No singles were issued from the album. It was remastered and reissued in 1993, along with Barrett's other albums − The Madcap Laughs (1970) and Opel (1988) − independently and as part of the Crazy Diamond box set. A newly remastered version was released in 2010. Background Initial sales and reaction of Barrett's first solo album, The Madcap Laughs, were deemed sufficient by EMI to sanction a second solo album. On 24 February 1970, a month after releasing Madcap, Barrett appeared on John Peel's Top Gear radio show, where he performed only one song from the newly released album (\\"Terrapin\\"), three that would later be recorded for Barrett (\\"Gigolo Aunt\\", \\"Baby Lemonade\\" and \\"Effervescing Elephant\\") and a one-off (\\"Two of a Kind\\", possibly written by Richard Wright). The session producers had no verbal contact with Barrett, having only communication to him via Gilmour. For the radio session, Gilmour and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley accompanied Barrett on bass and bongos, respectively. The version of \\"Gigolo Aunt\\" recorded for the radio session (and later released on 1988's The Peel Session) was unfinished, as Barrett had sung the opening verse three times. Barrett played slide guitar on the radio version of \\"Baby Lemonade\\", with Gilmour on organ. Two days later, he began working on his second album in Abbey Road Studios, with Gilmour as producer, and a trio of musicians: Richard Wright, Shirley and Gilmour himself. The main aim for the Barrett sessions was to give Barrett the structure and focus many felt was missing during the long and unwieldy sessions for The Madcap Laughs. Thus, the sessions were more efficiently run and the album was finished in considerably less time than The Madcap Laughs (six months, compared to Madcap's one year). On 6 June 1970, Barrett gave his one and only official solo performance, at the Olympia in Kensington, backed once more by Gilmour and Shirley. At the end of \\"Octopus\\", the fourth number of the set, Barrett baffled the audience and his backing musicians by abruptly taking off his guitar and walking off stage. Recording Recording took place at Abbey Road Studios The first session was on 26 February, three of the first songs—fully recorded—attempted during the session were \\"Baby Lemonade\\", \\"Maisie\\" and \\"Gigolo Aunt\\". However, Gilmour thought they were losing the \\"Barrett-ness\\". After \\"Baby Lemonade\\" was attempted, 2 takes of \\"Maisie\\" were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of \\"Gigolo Aunt\\". The next day, two-track demos of \\"Wolfpack\\", \\"Waving My Arms in the Air\\", \\"Living Alone\\" and \\"Bob Dylan Blues\\", were recorded. The former two made it to the album; the latter two didn't. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said \\"Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home.\\" Despite some minor work made to \\"Gigolo Aunt\\", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would \\"spy\\" on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded some work to a song, \\"Wolfpack\\", on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd. On the session of 5 June, Barrett managed to record an unknown number of two-track demos for three songs: \\"Rats\\", \\"Wined and Dined\\", and \\"Birdie Hop\\". The \\"Rats\\" demo recorded here, became the basis for the album master, and would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Two days later, on the 7th, Barrett recorded \\"Milky Way\\", \\"Millionaire\\", before being rounded off with overdubs for \\"Rats\\". \\"Millionaire\\" was originally titled \\"She Was a Millionaire\\", and was originally recorded by Pink Floyd. Barrett recorded two attempts at a backing track before abandoning it, and adding vocals. Yet another break in recording occurred, until 14 July, where Barrett recorded several takes of \\"Effervescing Elephant\\", while numerous overdubs were added to Barrett's \\"Wined and Dined\\" demo by Gilmour. Three takes of \\"Dominoes\\" ensued, with an unknown number of takes of \\"Love Song\\", \\"Dolly Rocker\\" and \\"Let's Split\\" were recorded. \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Dolly Rocker\\" were both overdubbed, the former being overdubbed from 17 to 21 July, but overdubs for the latter were wiped. On 21 July, Barrett worked on another Untitled track (later to be titled as \\"Word Song\\"), recording only one take, before recording 5 takes of the last new song to be recorded for Barrett: \\"It Is Obvious\\". Barrett worked on remakes of two tracks: \\"Maisie\\", and \\"Waving My Arms in the Air\\" (the latter now seguing into a new track, \\"I Never Lied to You\\"). Shirley said of Barrett's playing: \\"He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic.\\" Barrett's direction to the other musicians were limited to pronouncements like \\"Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it's too windy and icy\\". Songs Animals are a recurring item in not only the album, but Barrett's entire solo output. =Side one= \\"Baby Lemonade\\" is a blues folk tune. The intro was actually Barrett simply warming-up on guitar, that Gilmour had managed to record and placed it at the start of the album, making it seem like an intro to the song. The lyrics that describe the way for a person to kill time (such as the line \\"In the clock they sent / Through a washing machine\\"). The solo was performed by Barrett, not Gilmour as is often noted. A recurring theme in the album, starting with \\"Baby Lemonade\\", is the weather. Barrett performed the song twice, both times for the BBC (previously recorded on 24 February 1970, for John Peel's Top Gear, and later for Bob Harris' show on 16 February 1971). \\"Love Song\\" tells the story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered (\\"I knew a girl and I like her still\\"). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics (\\"I'll lay my head down and see what I see\\"). Barrett performed the song for Bob Harris' show in 1971. \\"Dominoes\\" features imagery of regret and recollection in the lyrics. The song features a backwards guitar solo by Barrett, and organ and Rhodes by Wright. The song's \\"You and I\\" lyric refers to the tail end relationship Barrett had with Lindsay. The first of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (\\"In my tears, my dreams\\"). Barrett performed the song for Bob Harris' show in 1971. \\"It Is Obvious\\" is the second of two songs which feature dreamlike- senses in the lyrics (\\"Creep into bed when your head's on the ground\\"). It is also the second of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (\\"Remember those times I could call / Through the clear day time / And you would be there\\"). The theme of weather is referenced again (\\"The softness, the warmth and the weather in suspense\\"). The song also references the Cambridge quarry pits, and the landscape. \\"Rats\\" started off as a jam, but eventually evolved into a structured song. It contains taunting and maniacal lyrics (\\"Rats rats lay down flat / We don't need you we act like that\\"). \\"Maisie\\" is a blues jam, with Barrett muttering the lyrics. =Side two= \\"Gigolo Aunt\\" was performed by Barrett for Top Gear in 1970. For Barrett's only solo performance, at the Kensington Olympia in 1970, he played four songs, one of them being \\"Gigolo Aunt\\". \\"Waving My Arms in the Air\\" contains an echo of \\"Octopus\\" (\\"Waving my arms in the air / Pressing my feet to the ground\\"). The lyrics refer to a hard-learned experience. The song features a childlike section (\\"No care / No no\\"). The song segues into \\"I Never Lied to You\\" with the aid of Wright's organ. \\"I Never Lied to You\\" is the final of three songs on the album which lyrics point to anguish (\\"It's been so hard to bear with you not there\\"). \\"Wined and Dined\\" dated from Barrett's Cambridge days, and is about the relationship between Barrett and his then-girlfriend, Gayla Pinion, a model from Cambridge. The song reflects on about Mediterranean evenings (\\"Musk winds blow\\"), and hauntings of Barrett's childhood (\\"Chalk underfoot / Light ash of blue\\") evoked during a summer party he didn't want to leave. Dave Gilmour added a sinuous sliding lead over Barrett's vocals. \\"Wolfpack\\" had been mentioned by Barrett in an interview, he said the song was one of favourites, out of all his material. \\"Effervescing Elephant\\" was pastiche of the verse form of Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales for Children. In contrast to \\"Dominoes\\", \\"It Is Obvious\\", \\"Rats\\", \\"Waving My Arms in the Air\\", and \\"Wolfpack\\" previously mentioning one or two animals, \\"Effervescing Elephant\\" contains references to a whole jungle full of animals. Barrett performed the song for Top Gear in 1970. For Barrett's only solo performance, at the Kensington Olympia in 1970, he played four songs, one of them being \\"Effervescing Elephant\\". Release and aftermath The cover of the album was designed by Barrett; it was originally one of many drawings Barrett had done in Cambridge, years earlier. Barrett was released in November 1970 to less interest than had greeted The Madcap Laughs earlier in the year, and as a result, failed to reach the chart. Talks of more singles and a third album were rumoured over the following months. Barrett dismissed the album and Madcap, saying: \\"They've got to reach a certain standard and that's probably reached in Madcap once or twice and on the other one only a little – just an echo of that. Neither of them are much more than that.\\" Allmusic reviewer Ritchie Unterberger called the album \\"a bit fuller and smoother than the first album\\", referring to \\"Baby Lemonade\\", \\"Gigolo Aunt\\", and \\"Effervescing Elephant\\" as \\"among his peppiest and best-loved tunes\\"; however, \\"the tone is darker and more meandering\\" in the rest of the album. In an overview of Barrett's career, Rolling Stone referred to both Barrett's solo albums as \\"entrancing\\". On 16 February 1971, Barrett recorded a short set for BBC Radio 1's Sound of the Seventies radio show; in contrast to 1970s radio appearance where Barrett performed new material, this time he played songs from Barrett: \\"Baby Lemonade\\", \\"Dominoes\\" and \\"Love Song\\". Bored and directionless, Barrett headed back to his hometown of Cambridge and – but for a brief dalliance with a band called Stars in 1972, and some abortive recording sessions in 1974 – left his music career behind for good. The album was reissued in late 1974 with his first solo album The Madcap Laughs as record two of the two-record set Syd Barrett in Harvest's series of Harvest Heritage reissues. In 1993, Barrett (along with The Madcap Laughs and Opel) was reissued both independently and as part of the Crazy Diamond Barrett box set, on 26 April 1993. \\"Bob Dylan Blues\\" would later turn up on 2001's The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?. A newly remastered version was released in 2010. For release on An Introduction to Syd Barrett in 2010, Gilmour laid down a new bass track to four songs, only one from Barrett: \\"Dominoes\\".

It was jointly developed by Australia and the United Kingdom between 1951 and 1954, and was in service from 1958 until gradually replaced by the Vickers Vigilant missile in the late 1960s. It was intended to be light enough to deploy with airborne forces, yet powerful enough to knock out any tank then in service. The basic form was later adapted for the short-range surface-to-air role as the Seacat and influenced the development of the Ikara. Development and operations Design was principally undertaken at the Australian Government Aeronautical Research Laboratory, and this phase was also one of the first examples of computer simulation in engineering design. Development testing was carried out at Woomera Prohibited Area, and approval testing at the tank training range at Lulworth Cove, Dorset. Although testing at Dorset apparently achieved an impressive 90% Pkill, in service the missiles were not considered a great success, due to three principal failures: * They were considered too heavy. As they were too heavy for manpacking, they could only be operated from their specialist vehicles, reducing flexibility; and * Accuracy achieved in practice was poor. This may have been because the awkward control system required a lot of practice. Malkara had a training simulator integrated with the launch interface equipment. In their memoirs, some operators state that they only fired one missile in their careers. *Finally, their speed was low, with almost 30 secs to the maximum range Malkara-equipped Humber Hornet vehicle However, lessons learned from the Malkara project led to improvements in later programs. In addition, the basic airframe and expertise were directly used in the development of the Ikara anti-submarine missile and the Sea Cat surface- to-air missile. Malkara was unusual amongst anti-tank missiles in that it had a High-explosive squash head (HESH), also known as High Explosive Plastic (HEP), warhead instead of the more usual shaped charge HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) warhead. The United Kingdom always showed interest for HESH, the main explosive-based anti-tank ammunition in British use including tanks like the Centurion.

Born into the wealthy Sutherland-Leveson-Gower family, she was the eldest daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland by his wife, the political hostess Lady Harriet Howard. In 1844 Elizabeth married George Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, eldest son and heir to the 7th Duke of Argyll. She became the Duchess of Argyll in 1847 when her husband succeeded his father. Like her mother, the Duchess of Argyll was a prominent opponent of slavery. The pair helped write a letter titled An Affectionate and Christian Address of Many Thousands of Women of Great Britain and Ireland to Their Sisters, the Women of the United States of America, calling for an end of slavery; it attracted signatures from 562,848 British women. The two often hosted the American abolitionist and author Harriet Beecher Stowe when she visited England. The Duchess and Beecher Stowe were friends and maintained a correspondence. In 1868, the Duchess of Argyll succeeded the Duchess of Wellington as Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria, holding the position until 1870, when she resigned due to ill health. Soon after being appointed a member of the newly created Order of the Crown of India, she died in 1878 whilst eating with William Ewart Gladstone in London. Family and early life Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower was raised amidst great wealth. Her paternal grandmother, the great heiress Elizabeth Gordon, was suo jure Countess of Sutherland, overseeing estates that spanned 800,000 to one million acres of Scottish Highlands. The Sutherland lands were further augmented with Gordon's 1785 marriage to George Leveson- Gower (later 1st Duke of Sutherland). In 1823, their son George married Lady Harriet Howard, daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle. Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower was born the following year as their eldest daughter, on 30 May 1824. Three brothers and two sisters followed. With family estates in Scotland and England, Elizabeth's upbringing involved much travel. Their main residence was the lavish Stafford House, London, which they acquired in 1827; they also resided on many country estates. The couple, especially Harriet, led vibrant social lives. She was a political hostess known for her friendship and position as Mistress of the Robes to the young Queen Victoria. In 1833, the 1st Duke died and Elizabeth's father succeeded as 2nd Duke of Sutherland, inheriting extensive property. The historian Eric Richards writes that the first half of the nineteenth century saw the height of the House of Sutherland's social and economic influence, with its wealth being derived from rents, various stocks, and dividends from transportation firms. Marriage Trentham Hall in the 1820s While accompanying Queen Victoria to Taymouth Castle in 1842, Lady Elizabeth met George Douglas Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, the eldest son of the 7th Duke of Argyll. They married at the Leveson-Gower estate Trentham Hall on 31 July 1844. The Archbishop of York, Edward Venables- Vernon-Harcourt, presided over the wedding. The Argyll estate was in debt, so Elizabeth's wealth was much needed. Their union resulted in the further joining of two of Scotland's largest landowning families. The young couple was given Rosneath by his father at the time of their marriage. Deeply religious, Elizabeth had been raised in the Anglican faith but converted to the Church of Scotland upon her marriage, taking her first communion in the faith later that year. Like many of her predecessors, Elizabeth was a strong supporter of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles. The couple possessed similar interest in liberal politics. Elizabeth was dignified and cultured, and Lorne found in his new wife \\"more than all that had been told me by her numerous friends... On some subjects, excepting philosophy and the natural sciences, she was more widely read than I was at the time.\\" Duchess of Argyll Lorne succeeded his father as 8th Duke of Argyll on 25 April 1847, whereupon Elizabeth became Duchess of Argyll. The family's primary estates included Argyll Lodge in London, the family seat of Inveraray Castle in Argyllshire, and Rosneath. Their first child, John, was born within a year of their marriage. They would have an additional four sons and seven daughters. The Argyll household was sober, proper, and driven by routine with prescribed times for prayer, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The children were not expected to show emotion such as crying, except for \\"real causes\\" like the death of a family pet. The Scottish scholar John Stuart Blackie enjoyed the solemnity of the couple's lifestyle and visited them often; he dedicated his 1876 work Language and Literature of the Scottish Highlands to Elizabeth. The historian Anne Jordan writes that the Duchess was \\"old before her time,\\" having given birth to twelve children. She suffered from ill health, in part due to an 1868 stroke which left her partially incapacitated; this forced much of the children's upbringing to be overseen by her husband. Her third daughter Lady Victoria, who also suffered from ill health due to a contraction of poliomyelitis, nursed her mother. Once adults, the children's marriage settlements were a drain on the family's resources, with all but one eventually marrying. Their eldest son John married the Queen's fourth daughter Princess Louise in 1871, and became the Governor General of Canada in 1878. Like her mother the Duchess of Sutherland, the Duchess of Argyll was a prominent supporter of the abolitionist movement. Elizabeth was one of many British women affected by the 1852 anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The following year at her mother's house, the Duchess helped draft a letter titled An Affectionate and Christian Address of Many Thousands of Women of Great Britain and Ireland to Their Sisters, the Women of the United States of America. The letter, eventually signed by 562,848 women, called for an end to slavery because the institution did not recognise slave marriages, led to parent-children separations, and prevented slaves from receiving Christian educations. It was sent to the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, the American abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe; she and the Duchess of Argyll became friends, and maintained a correspondence. Harriet Beecher Stowe would often visit the duchesses of Sutherland and Argyll when she travelled to England and benefited from their connections to senior politicians. The Duke and Duchess of Argyll were also friends with American politician and anti- slavery leader Charles Sumner, leading historian Amanda Foreman to write that the \\"relationship between [the Duke of Argyll] and Sumner would prove to be one of the most important friendships of the Civil War.\\" In December 1868, Lady Campbell was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria, succeeding Elizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington as a member of William Ewart Gladstone's first ministry. She resigned the position in 1870 due to ill health, and was succeeded by her sister-in-law Anne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland. In December 1877, Queen Victoria created the Order of the Crown of India and conferred it upon the Duchess of Argyll and dozens of other royal and noblewomen. She was also a member of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, Second Class. The Duchess of Argyll died on 25 May 1878, whilst eating with Gladstone in London. She is buried at Kilmun Parish Church. Three years later her widower married again, to Amelia Maria, daughter of Thomas Legh Claughton, Bishop of St Albans.

As a player MacDonald was a member of the Liverpool \\"double\\" winning side of 1986. Prior to taking his first managerial job at Swindon MacDonald's career most notably included a spell as caretaker manager at Aston Villa following the resignation of Martin O'Neill on 9 August 2010. MacDonald also worked as assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland, with his ex-Liverpool teammate Steve Staunton, who he used to coach at Aston Villa. In 1994, he also spent a short time as caretaker manager at Leicester City. Club career MacDonald was discovered by Leicester City while playing for his home town club, Inverness Caledonian, in the Highland League. Alex Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen, watched Macdonald on several occasions while he played for Inverness Caledonian, but no business was done. MacDonald joined Liverpool from Leicester for £400,000 in November 1984. He never commanded a regular spot at Anfield, but he was in the team at the right time, helping Liverpool to the First Division title in 1986 and then to the \\"double\\" (only the third in the 20th century) when he helped them beat Everton in the 1986 FA Cup Final at Wembley. At the start of the following season, MacDonald broke his leg against Southampton on 20 September 1986. By the time he recovered Kenny Dalglish had settled on Steve McMahon for the central midfield role. He made no appearances for the rest of the 1986–87 season, and just one appearance in the 1987–88 season (in the league against Luton Town on 9 May 1988). In his final season at the club, 1988–89, he made just five competitive appearances before he later had spells on loan at his old club Leicester and also at Rangers. In April 1989, shortly before he left Liverpool, MacDonald, along with his teammates, rallied round the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster.MacDonald attends Hillsborough victim's funeral: Liverpool Echo. Retrieved 5 March 2013. He scored three competitive goals in his time at Liverpool (one in the league, one in the FA Cup and one in the League Cup) as well as two goals in the Football League Super Cup, all of which came in the 1985–86 season. In June 1989 he made a permanent move to Coventry City and played out his career. Management and coaching =Leicester City= In November 1994, MacDonald was named caretaker manager of Leicester City for a short period between the departure of Brian Little and the arrival of Mark McGhee. =Aston Villa = In August 2010, following the immediate resignation of former Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill, he assumed the role of caretaker manager at the club. He had previously been the manager of Villa's successful reserve side and assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national side under Steve Staunton. MacDonald had been employed by Aston Villa since 1995 and had held a number of different positions at the club. MacDonald's first game as caretaker manager came at Villa Park against West Ham United on the opening day of the 2010–11 Premier League season which Villa won 3–0 including the last goal for James Milner as a Villa player. He then led Villa to a 1–1 draw in their Europa League qualifier first-leg match against Rapid Vienna. His second league game in charge resulted in a 6–0 defeat to Newcastle United. Villa named Gérard Houllier as their permanent manager on 8 September 2010; however, MacDonald remained in charge for the following two Premier League matches against Stoke City and Bolton due to Houllier having to work his notice with the French Football Federation. With the departure of Houllier and his number 2, Gary McAllister, the Villa hierarchy let it be known that MacDonald and Gordon Cowans would have futures at the club no matter who the new manager was.Nixon, Alan. Sparky Wants Randy Call: Hughes Keen on Villa Despite Snub The People, 12 June 2011 On 13 December 2018, Aston Villa suspended MacDonald after allegations of bullying from ex-midfielder Gareth Farrelly. Farrelly gave an interview to the Guardian newspaper where he described MacDonald as being \\"relentlessly negative\\" to him in the 1990s. Furthermore, Farrelly claimed MacDonald was \\"incredibly aggressive, with constant verbal and physical bullying\\". Villa initiated an internal investigation and MacDonald was temporarily reassigned to non-player facing duties. On 20 August 2019, Aston Villa announced MacDonald's departure with immediate effect. Aston Villa apologised to all former players that came forward as part of the investigation into Kevin Macdonald's behaviour. In the clubs statement it said \\"Aston Villa wishes to apologise to all former players who were affected by behaviour which would not be tolerated by the Club today\\". = Swindon Town = On 28 February 2013, it was announced MacDonald was the new manager of Swindon Town in League One. MacDonald led the team into the 2013 League One play-offs following a 6th place league finish but lost 5–4 on penalties to Brentford in the semi-finals. On 12 July 2013, he failed to attend a pre-season friendly with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn for what was described by Swindon as 'personal problems' and after six months in the job, it was announced that he had quit the club the following day.

First unveiled on 3 March 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show, it replaced the Silver Spur, which ended production in 1997. Silver Seraph production was discontinued when the license to use the Rolls- Royce marque was sold to BMW, which began manufacture of an unrelated line of vehicles under a new corporation, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.  Development  Development of the Silver Seraph began in the late 1980s, with design work commencing in October 1990. By April 1991, the conceptual design was frozen and approved by the management in June 1991. After several refinements were made, the definitive design was reached in 1994. On 28 July 1995 design patents were filed for both the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and Bentley Arnage utilizing production design prototypes as representations. Development concluded after nearly a decade in late 1997, with pilot production models being produced into early 1998 bearing R396 DTU registration plates. The Silver Seraph was launched at the 1998 Geneva Motor Show.  Description  Press presentation, Geneva 1998 Silver Seraph Interior Aside from the radiator grille, badges and wheels, the Seraph was externally identical to the contemporary Bentley Arnage, sharing both its platform and body shell. It was powered by a BMW M73 5.4 L aluminium alloy V12 engine coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission, making it the first twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce since the 1939 Phantom III. The car conforms to the Euro III emission standards. The body was 65 percent stiffer than that of its predecessor. Standard electronics included digital engine management, adaptive ride control and anti-lock brakes. The exterior was available in one and two-tone finishes. Inside, the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the Bentley Arnage were similar yet distinct. The Seraph's gear selector was column-mounted, and gauges followed a traditional Rolls-Royce layout. In both cars, the seats and dashboard were upholstered in Connolly Leather, with dashboard trim and folding picnic trays for rear passengers faced with glossy burl walnut veneer. The Seraph was known for its relatively limited acceleration and comfortable handling, in comparison to the Arnage, which had a twin turbocharged V8 of its own design and firmer suspension. However, the Seraph still had a top speed of . The RAC gave the car a rating of 7.6/10, stating \\"The Silver Seraph marks a new start for Rolls-Royce in their quest to once more be recognised as manufacturers of the world's best cars. And it's quite a credible effort. Production All Seraphs were hand-built at the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England. The car had a base price of £155,175 in the UK and $220,695 in the US. It was second in cost and exclusivity only to the Rolls-Royce Corniche. A total of 1,570 Silver Seraphs were produced before manufacture ceased in 2002. Park Ward model An extended wheelbase 5-passenger version of the Silver Seraph called the Park Ward debuted at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show.

Duchess of Sutherland (née Howard; 21 May 1806 – 27 October 1868), styled The Honourable Harriet Howard before her marriage, was Mistress of the Robes under several Whig administrations: 1837–1841, 1846–1852, 1853–1858, and 1859–1861; and a great friend of Queen Victoria. She was an important figure in London's high society, and used her social position to undertake various philanthropic undertakings including the protest of the English ladies against American slavery. Family and early life Harriet was the third daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle and his wife Lady Georgiana Cavendish, who was a daughter of the Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Marriage On 28 May 1823 she married her cousin George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower (1786–1861), who had been elected MP for St Mawes, Cornwall (a rotten borough) in 1808, and succeeded his father as second Duke of Sutherland in 1833. Gower was twenty years older than she, but their union proved one of affection and produced four sons and seven daughters. The Duchess of Sutherland held a social position of high influence, aided by her friendship to Queen Victoria as well as her family's great wealth. By the Duchess's influence Stafford House, St. James's Palace, became an important centre of society, cites Lord Ronald Gower, Reminiscences, vol. i. chap. i. and the starting-point of various philanthropic undertakings. The Duchess helped organize the \\"Stafford House Address\\" petition against slavery, and former American First Lady Julia Tyler wrote a defense of slavery titled \\"The Women of England vs. the Women of America\\", in response to it. In response to \\"The Women of England vs. the Women of America\\", former slave Harriet Jacobs wrote a letter to the New York Tribune which was her first published writing; it was published in 1853 and signed \\"Fugitive\\". The Duchess's stance on slavery was heavily criticized by Karl Marx because her mother-in-law, the previous Duchess, had been closely associated with the clearance of the inhabitants of Sutherland thirty years earlier, so that she could reuse 794,000 acres (3200 km2) of land for commercial sheep farming. Mistress of the Robes Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1849 On the accession of Queen Victoria the Duchess was appointed Mistress of the Robes, and held that post whenever the Whigs were in office until her husband's death (August 1837 to September 1841, July 1846 to March 1852, January 1853 to February 1858, June 1859 to April 1861). In that role, she presided at the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. From the Queen's refusal to part with the Duchess and her other ladies arose the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, which resulted in the Whigs returning to office. Victoria gave a sympathetic description of the Duchess's character, cites Martin, Prince Consort, ii. 246 and after the death of Prince Albert, the prince consort, spent the first weeks of her widowhood with the Duchess as her only companion. In 1861 the 4th Rogart Company of the 1st Sutherland Volunteer Rifle Corps formed up. The company bore the title \\"Duchess Harriet's Company Rogart\\" upon the pouch-belt plate. The Duchess's last public appearance was at the Prince of Wales's marriage in 1863. In that year she was seized with an illness from which she never recovered. However, she was able to entertain Garibaldi, for whom she had great admiration, at Chiswick House and Trentham, Staffordshire, during his visit to England in April 1864. She died on 27 October 1868 at her London residence, Stafford House, aged 62. She was interred in the mausoleum of the Dukes of Sutherland at Trentham. W E Gladstone was one of the pall-bearers at her funeral. The Duchess's letters, some of which were published by her son Lord Ronald Gower in Stafford House Letters, parts iv-vi., prove her to have had an affectionate disposition, with some sense of humour. She had also an interest in architecture and gardening. Issue On 18 May 1823 Harriet married George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower, eldest son of the 2nd Marquess of Stafford, and a man twenty years her senior. Her father-in-law was created Duke of Sutherland in 1833, and was succeeded by his son later that year, whereupon Harriet became the Duchess of Sutherland. They had eleven children: * Lady Elizabeth Georgiana (30 May 1824 – 25 May 1878), married George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and had issue. * Lady Evelyn (8 August 1825 – 1869), married Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre * Lady Caroline Leveson- Gower (15 April 1827 – 1887), married Charles FitzGerald, 4th Duke of Leinster and had issue. * Lord George Granville William (19 December 1828 – 22 September 1892), succeeded as 3rd Duke. * Lady Blanche Julia Sutherland- Leveson-Gower (26 June 1830 – 24 February 1832) * Lord Frederick George (11 November 1832 – 6 October 1854) * Lady Constance Gertrude (16 June 1834 – 1880), married Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster and had issue. * Lady Victoria Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (16 May 1838 – 19 June 1839) * Lord Albert (21 Nov 1843 – 1874), married Grace Abdy, daughter of Sir Thomas Neville Abdy, 1st Baronet and had issue, including Frederick Neville Sutherland Leveson- Gower. * Lord Ronald Charles Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (2 August 1845 – 9 March 1916), died unmarried. * Lady Alexandrina Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (3 February 1848 – 21 June 1849) In 1871, while her son-in-law, the Duke of Argyll, was serving in the Cabinet, his son (Harriet's grandson), Lord Lorne, married one of Victoria's daughters, Princess Louise. Harriet's eldest son became 3rd Duke of Sutherland in 1861. In media Harriet was portrayed by Rachael Stirling in the 2009 film The Young Victoria. She was portrayed by Margaret Clunie in the 2016 ITV series Victoria, though she is inaccurately depicted as carrying on an improbable romance with Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), who is also inaccurately depicted as being unmarried at the time.

Created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Steve Yeowell, with original character designs by Brendan McCarthy, it first appeared in 2000 AD #535 (22 August 1987). The character Zenith (real name Robert McDowell Zenith Pop Fax) first appeared in the second episode – the first episode set the backdrop for his introduction. Shallow and sarcastic, Zenith was a distinctly Generation X superhero. Morrison used the Zenith serial to explore cultural differences between generations and criticise the Conservative Party. Zenith was featured regularly in 2000 AD from 1987 until 1992, with occasional appearances since. The series was an early success for Morrison, who has since written popular works for DC and Marvel, using his own characters. The first series won the 1987 Eagle Award for Favourite Single or Continuing Story.\\"Previous Winners: 1988\\" at the Eagle Awards website, archived at The Wayback Machine. (Retrieved 22 September 2018.) Publication history Zenith appeared in August 1987 during a period when editor and assistant editor, Steve MacManus and Richard Burton respectively, were shaking up 2000 AD by publishing numerous new stories which gave fresh talent a chance.Bishop, 2007, page 120 Grant Morrison had been thinking along the lines of Zenith since 1982, but \\"[t]he original version had a more traditional superhero costume and was a little grimmer in tone,\\" and the final concept came together as \\"... a reaction against torment superheroes.\\" Despite liking both Dark Knight and Watchmen, he felt that \\"... both books felt pompous and concept albumy to me as a young man in the '80s.\\" He found more of an influence in the work of Brendan McCarthy: \\"... tell the truth on to the page and let your psyche all hang out,\\" and it was McCarthy who would provide the initial character designs, although he never drew the actual story, because Morrison said \\"... the story as it unfolded would have been too ponderous and long-winded for him.\\" With hindsight, Morrison stated, \\"I like Phase I the least now –- it wears its influences a little too obviously on its sleeve.\\"Bishop, 2007, page 157 He rated Phase III far higher, saying, \\"I think it is one of the greatest superhero crossover events ever.\\"Bishop, 2007, page 129 In America, Zenith Phases I and II were reprinted in colour in Fleetway/Quality's monthly 2000 A.D. Showcase title, beginning in the jointly- numbered issue 29/30, and running through issue 45 (September 1988-December 1989). These issues featured new covers by American comic book artists such as Jackson Guice, Tom Lyle, and Bart Sears. According to the series' index at the Grand Comics Database, \\"The end of the Phase II storyline was also the end of the Zenith reprints, as Phase III was still in progress in the British weekly. It ended in March of 1990, but by that time this magazine was about to be cancelled.\\"\\"2000 A.D. Showcase #45, http://www.comics.org/issue/47157/ Zenith returned for Phase IV in 1992 but Morrison's attention was elsewhere: \\"I'd moved on and was more excited by the possibilities of working with American superheroes. By 1992, Zenith seemed like something dragged up from my past.\\" However, that does not mean he thinks any less of the story: \\"I like a lot of things I write under duress. I actually really like the last book of Zenith. I'm very fond of it.\\" Titan Books published five trade paperbacks of Zenith between 1988 and 1990, collecting Phase I through III. However, for years after that, attempts to re-publish the series (including the never collected Phase IV) were prevented by a copyright dispute between the publisher and Morrison. In 2007, Morrison said, \\"Fleetway have no paperwork to confirm their ownership of Zenith, so I'm currently involved in legal proceedings to clear things up.\\"Bishop, 2007, page 216 On 29 May 2013, British publishing company Rebellion Developments announced that they were publishing a complete collection as a hardcover book limited to 1000 copies.2000AD's official website The book sold out within two days of being announced and the delivery date was brought forward to early October. The book collected all four phases and has a nearly exhaustive collection of covers and pin-ups. Whilst parties involved in ongoing legal proceedings are, as a rule, barred from speaking publicly of them, it appears that Morrison has been unsuccessful in halting that initial publication. Zenith Books 1 and 2 could be pre-ordered for a December 2014 launch through mainstream distribution chains. In September 2017 a new Zenith text story, \\"Permission to Land,\\" appeared in prog 2050, with a new illustration by Steve Yeowell. Zenith also appeared in a story unconnected to the Zenith universe – \\"A Night 2 Remember,\\" a strip about the comic's 25th anniversary celebrations, which appeared in prog 1280. Plot Steve Yeowell's cover to Zenith Book one. Robert McDowell, alias Zenith, was the son of two members of Cloud 9, a super-team of the 1960s assembled by the British military who had rebelled and become hippies and psychedelic fashion icons. Zenith himself used his Biorhythm dependant super-human abilities, not to fight evil, but to promote his career as a pop singer. Shallow, spoilt, self- centred and initially cowardly, he was reluctantly dragged into the struggle against malevolent, supernatural entities known as the Lloigor or \\"Many-Angled Ones\\". The British superhuman project \\"Maximan\\" had emerged from work brought over by defecting Nazi scientists in World War II, in turn, having been developed from knowledge obtained from the Lloigor. The Nazis had created \\"Masterman\\", but the real purpose of the project was to produce host bodies strong enough to house the Lloigor's spirits. Due to those circumstances, within the story's alternate history, Berlin was the target of the first nuclear weapon, not Hiroshima or Nagasaki, mainly because both the British and Nazi supermen were fighting in Berlin at the time. The British superheroes came of age during the tumultuous '60s, and promptly rebelled, as did many teens of that time. Ultimately, Zenith's parents were killed (by American psychic agents - although that is not revealed until later in the storyline) other members of Cloud 9 disappeared, and the few remaining lost their powers and retreated into civilian life: Peter St. John, (Mandala) became a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party, and Ruby Fox (Voltage), a journalist and writer. Siadwell Rhys (Red Dragon) owned a pub in Wales - where he apparently spent much of his time drunk. *In Phase I, Zenith reluctantly teamed up with surviving members of Cloud 9 to defeat the Many-Angled One called \\"Iok Sotot\\", although that proved fatal to Welshman Red Dragon. St John demonstrated his considerable mental powers by defeating Iok Sotot via a post- hypnotic suggestion previously implanted. Phase I showed that Cloud 9 only temporarily lost their powers and regained them under duress—or, in St John's case, never lost them at all. *Phase II detailed the efforts of a media tycoon modelled on Richard BransonTitan Trade novel Phase II to use Zenith and two female superhuman clones—Shockwave and Blaze—as breeding stock for a new group of super-powered humans he intended to use toward achieving world domination. Zenith was generally successful working on his own in Phase II, however he again relied on St John at times, and also a CIA agent who was killed early on. Phase II describes more of the Zenith history, and introduces Chimera, a superhuman composed entirely of thought, who eventually transformed itself into a pyramid-shaped miniature universe. *An interlude between Phase II & III introduces the concept of alternate universes, and that members of Cloud 9 who were previously thought to be dead were in fact establishing themselves in the alternate realities with other-dimensional heroes, and developing their powers and abilities. It is also first suggested (and established later on) that the Zenith universe characters are among the most powerful of all other superheroes. *Phase III involved a multi-dimensional war against the Lloigor utilising comic-book characters from other British comics from the '50s, '60s and '70s (using either the actual characters or analogs, depending on their legal status). The Lloigor, close to \\"ascending\\" and dominating the universe(s), were waiting for the infinite alternate universes to align and form a universe-sized crystal –- the \\"Omnihedron\\". The multi-universal heroes destroyed several alternate Earths to introduce a flaw into the Omnihedron and prevent the alignment, but discovered that they had been betrayed by Maximan: the destruction of the worlds removed a flaw already present in the Omnihedron. Only at the last moment did they succeed by destroying the alternate Earth that the Lloigor were using to ascend. Due to the vast cross- dimensional body count incurred in this series, a surviving superhero commented that it may have been \\"...a pyrrhic victory\\". *The final series, Phase IV, brought the story full circle as the remaining members of Cloud 9 eventually transformed into the very Lovecraftian horrors that Zenith battled in the first series—Iok Sotot, who was Zenith and Blaze's son. After destroying American society in retaliation for a psychic attempt on their own lives, they used the Sun as an incubator for their final metamorphosis into The Many Angled Ones, and after destroying the Earth they ascended to the heavens, attempting to gain control of the multiverse. St John had, however (during part two – \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" episode), trapped the Lloigor in the pocket universe created by Chimera, with the \\"real\\" universe assumed to have been saved –- although it is implied that St John had his own agenda for taking control, as by that time he was already Prime Minister of Great Britain. Zenith since returned three times to the pages of 2000 AD: In zzzenith.com, a one-off featured in \\"Prog 2001\\" set years after the end of the previous series. Zenith once again met with St John, who was still in control of the country via a telepathically-manipulated Tony Blair. Zenith, being aware of that, was not particularly bothered, and therefore, St John seemed equally unconcerned by Zenith's knowledge of the truth. St John was still in possession of the Omnihedron pocket universe containing the Lloigor, however Marconi had been experimenting with it, and St John was worried about the results gained. Collected editions Zenith was printed as a series of (now out of print) trade paperbacks by Titan Books. However, on 29 May 2013, 2000 AD publishers Rebellion announced plans to re-print the entire series in a hardcover volume, limited to 1,000 copies. Priced at £100, the book was published on 1 December 2013, and sold exclusively via their website.2000adonline \\"Zenith to be reprinted\\" at 2000adonline A series of cheaper books began in 2014.Zenith graphic novels at 2000adonline (retrieved 23 September 2017).

Tynan and Eyre were responding to a report of an abandoned car when they were gunned down about 4:50am in Walsh Street, South Yarra (a Melbourne suburb), on 12 October 1988.Revisiting the Walsh Street murders, The Age, 1 October 2005 Four men, Victor Peirce, Trevor Pettingill, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Peter David McEvoy, were charged with murder and later acquitted by a jury in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Two other suspects, Jedd Houghton and Gary Abdallah, were shot and killed by Victoria Police before being brought to trial.Walsh Street revisited, Green Left, 27 May 1992 During 2005, Wendy Peirce, widow of Victor, gave an interview to the mass media. In this interview, she stated that her late husband had planned and carried out the murders and that he was actually guilty as charged.Coming Clean, The Age, 1 October 2005 Prior events Victims Steven Tynan and Damian Eyre On 11 October 1988, Peirce's best friend, Graeme Jensen, was fatally shot by police in Narre Warren. Jensen had been under observation by the Victoria Police Armed Robbery Squad, who had planned to arrest him in connection with an armed robbery and murder. Police followed Jensen to a local store. Three cars containing eight detectives attempted to block Jensen in as he left the store; but one of the cars was delayed by passing traffic, allowing Jensen to drive through. Police later gave sworn evidence that they saw Jensen brandish a firearm. Police yelled at Jensen to stop, one detective yelled: \\"He's got a gun.\\" Jensen was then shot dead. His car crashed into a roadside pole. Report of an abandoned car On 12 October, 13 hours after Jensen's death, at 4:39am, Constables Tynan and Eyre were operating a divisional van from Prahran police station when called to an abandoned Holden Commodore left in Walsh Street, South Yarra. While the officers were examining the vehicle, they were ambushed by armed offenders. Constable Tynan was cut down with a shotgun while sitting in the car, and Constable Eyre was seriously wounded. It is thought that Constable Eyre, despite having suffered serious wounds, struggled with the attacker until another person approached him from behind, managed to remove Eyre's service revolver from its holster and shot him in the head with it. Police believed members of a Melbourne armed robbery gang had organised the murders. In the period up to April 1989 there had been an unusually high number of fatal shootings of suspects by police. The killings of the two police officers were viewed by many as a form of payback by members of the Melbourne underworld. Ty-Eyre task force The police investigation was known as the Ty-Eyre Task Force, a combination of the two surnames of the officers killed. It was headed by Inspector Dave Sprague and was the biggest investigation Victoria Police had ever undertaken at the time and also the longest running, spanning 895 days. At the height of the investigation, police had hundreds of officers working with the task force to investigate the murders. =The Flemington Crew= Police investigations revealed the shotgun used to perform the murders was the same weapon used earlier in a bungled attempt to blast open a bank door during a robbery at the State Bank in Oak Park seven months earlier. A gang, police dubbed The Flemington Crew, had robbed at least four Melbourne banks. The robbers, on security CCTV at the Oak Park robbery, had left shotgun shells at the scene. Seven months into the investigation, the shotgun itself was found half-buried in an inner-city golf course plant bed by a gardener. The shotgun and shells became the single forensic link police had, linking the Oak Park robbery to the same shotgun used in the Walsh Street murders. The shotgun and empty shotgun shell casings are on display at the Victoria Police Museum, Melbourne. =Pettingill family= Members of the gangs responsible for the robberies were believed to be Victor Peirce, Graeme Jensen, Jedd Houghton and Peter David McEvoy. The home of Victor Peirce was raided the day following the Walsh Street shootings. Peirce's house was later demolished and the backyard dug up in the search for evidence. Trial The trial of the four men accused, Victor Peirce, Trevor Pettingill, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Peter David McEvoy, began in March 1991. The prosecution alleged six people were involved in the planning of the shootings: the accused, Jason Ryan, and the late Jedd Houghton. =Prosecution= Jason Ryan became a prosecution witness in the trial and was offered immunity in exchange for his testimony. Police placed Ryan under the witness protection program and moved him to Mansfield on 24 October 1988 for questioning. His evidence changed a number of times up to the opening of the trial. Ryan's evidence had implicated Gary Abdallah, Jedd Houghton, Anthony Leigh Farrell and Emmanuel Alexandris. Police were told the party of killers were Jedd Houghton, Peter David McEvoy, Anthony Leigh Farrell and his uncles Victor Peirce and Trevor Pettingill. Houghton was shot and killed during a police raid on the Big4 Ascot Holiday Park in Bendigo in November 1988. Abdallah was fatally wounded during his arrest on another matter in April 1989. Victor Pierce's wife, Wendy Pierce, also became a prosecution witness and entered the witness protection program. She had previously maintained her husband was with her in a motel all night on the night of the murders; she retracted this alibi in preparation to testify against her husband. But, in a pre-trial hearing, she retracted her retraction and, as a hostile witness, did not appear at the trial. =Not guilty verdict= A memorial in Kings Domain, Melbourne to Victoria Police officers killed in the line of duty. All four men charged with the murders were acquitted in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Victor Peirce and Peter David McEvoy were taken back into custody on other charges. Wendy Pierce was charged with perjury, convicted and sentenced to serve 9 months non-parole.

They were also mentioned several times in the 2011 docudrama Underbelly Files: Tell Them Lucifer was Here (which concerned the 1998 Silk–Miller police murders in Melbourne).

15 June 1832 – 15 July 1911), was a German-born British aristocrat sometimes referred to as the \\"Double Duchess\\" due to her marriages, firstly to the 7th Duke of Manchester and then to the 8th Duke of Devonshire. Early life Luise Friederike Auguste, Countess von Alten, was born 15 June 1832 at Hanover in what was then the Kingdom of Hanover. She was a daughter of Karl Franz Viktor, Count von Alten (1800–1879), and his wife, Hermine von Schminke (1806–1868). Her siblings included: Helene Charlotte Auguste, Countess of Alten, who married Andrei Bludov, Carl Friedrich Franz Victor, Count of Alten, who married Carolina Frederica Groeninx van Zoelen, and Guidobaldine, Countess of Alten, who married Graf August Grote and Don Luigi Maria Colonna, Prince of Stigliano, and Detlof von Bülow. Her paternal grandparents were Adolf Viktor Christian Jobst, Count von Alten (1755–1820), and Charlotte Louise Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau. Mistress of the Robes \\"A social climber with a nose for power\\", the 26-year-old Duchess (through her friendship with Lord Derby, the then prime minister) was appointed Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria in February 1858, resigning in June 1859, when Lord Derby's government fell. Victoria regretted her departure, calling her \\"a very pleasant, nice, sensible person\\". The Duchess soon developed close friendships with Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Lady Eleanor Stanley recorded in her diary in 1859 that during a \\"paper chase\\", the Duchess caught her hoop while climbing over a stile and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company. The Duc de Malakoff, the French ambassador, is said to have exclaimed \\"C'était diabolique!\\" at the sight. Devonshire House Ball of 1897 In July 1897, the Duchess hosted the Devonshire House Fancy Dress Ball at Devonshire House, the London residence of the Dukes of Devonshire during the 18th and 19th centuries. The party was a costume ball thrown to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. The Queen's Private Secretary, Francis Knollys, wrote to the Duchess that the Prince of Wales (who dressed as the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta) thought the party a success. At the ball, the Duchess dressed as Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. Marriages and issue Illustration of Kimbolton Castle in 1880, which shows the present mansion as rebuilt between 1690 and 1720 On 22 July 1852, the twenty-year old Louisa was married at Hanover to Viscount Mandeville, eldest son and heir of the 6th Duke of Manchester. Upon his father's death on 8 August 1855, he succeeded his father as 7th Duke of Manchester, and Louisa became Duchess of Manchester. They had five children: # George Victor Drogo Montagu, 8th Duke of Manchester (1853-1892), who married Consuelo Yznaga (1853–1909), and had issue. # Lady Mary Louisa Elizabeth Montagu (1854–1934), who was born at Kimbolton Castle and married, firstly, to William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, at Kimbolton Castle on 10 December 1873, and had issue. She secondly married on 20 July 1897 to Robert Carnaby Forster of Easton Park, Wickham Market, Suffolk (d. 1925), without issue. # Lady Louisa Augusta Beatrice Montagu (1856–1944), born at Kimbolton Castle. She married Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, on 10 August 1876 in London, and had issue. # Lord Charles William Augustus Montagu (1860–1939), who married the Hon. Mildred Cecilia Harriet Stuart (1869–1942), daughter of Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington, at Kimbolton Castle on 4 December 1930. He had no issue. # Lady Alice Maude Olivia Montagu (1862–1957), born in London. She married Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, on 5 January 1889 in London, and had issue. Louisa became estranged from the Duke, and they lived apart for many years. Louisa became the companion of Spencer Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, and a notable political hostess. The Duke died in Naples on 22 March 1890. On 16 August 1892, at Christ Church, Mayfair, the sixty-year-old Dowager Duchess of Manchester married Lord Hartington, by then the 8th Duke of Devonshire. She thereby became Duchess of Devonshire, with a nickname of the \\"Double Duchess\\". After the Duke of Devonshire's death on 24 March 1908, she was widowed for the second time, becoming the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire. On 15 July 1911, at the Sandown Races in Esher Park, the Duchess died after a seizure, aged 79, and was interred at Edensor in Derbyshire.

On one occasion during this period Lieutenant Stannard and two of his crew tackled for two hours a fire on the jetty caused by a bomb igniting ammunition. Part of the jetty was saved, which proved invaluable at the subsequent evacuation. Later feats included the destruction of an enemy bomber whose pilot, thinking that he had HMT Arab at his mercy, ordered that she be steered into captivity.

He also played for Bournemouth, Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield United. He initially started out with Non-league Andover. He took over as player-manager of Sheffield United in 1997, but lasted less than a year. He later had brief spells in charge of Barnsley in 2001 and Millwall in 2006. He now works for the Glenn Hoddle Academy. Career =Playing career= Born in Romsey, Hampshire, Spackman started at Andover and spent his first three years as a professional with Bournemouth before joining Chelsea for £35,000 in the summer of 1983. He signed for Chelsea as part of manager John Neal's re-building of the side alongside the likes of Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie. Spackman scored on his debut for the club in a 5–0 opening day win over Derby County, though he was not a regular goalscorer. Chelsea were promoted at the end of that season as Second Division champions and finished 6th in the following two seasons back in the top tier, with Spackman a near ever-present. During the 1986–87 season, several key players, including Spackman, fell out with manager John Hollins and he was sporadically left out of the starting line-up or played out of position. He was sold to Liverpool in 1987 for £400,000. Initially he was a frequently used substitute at Liverpool, and he was in the team which lost the 1987 League Cup final to Arsenal. Spackman only had a regular role in the Liverpool team during this season, but played an essential role. When regular midfield general Ronnie Whelan was injured early in the campaign, Spackman was handed the No.5 shirt and he never missed a game for the whole campaign, gaining plaudits for his unselfish running and industry around the park in a team which featured the likes of John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge. Liverpool lost just twice in the league all season, claiming the title with ease and Spackman was in the side which beat Nottingham Forest 5–0. Spackman's stamina and unselfishness set up the last goal for Aldridge. Whelan was fit again with a month of the season left, but wasn't selected. Spackman was selected for the rest of the campaign, including the FA Cup Final, which Liverpool surprisingly lost to Wimbledon. Spackman and teammate Gary Gillespie both played that game with bandages around their heads after the two had suffered cuts in a clash during a game against Derby County the previous week. He left Liverpool for Queens Park Rangers in February 1989 but stayed there for less than a year, joining Scottish side Rangers in November 1989, winning honours there. He went back to Chelsea in 1992 before moving to Sheffield United in 1996 as player-coach and assistant-manager to Howard Kendall. =Managerial career= When Kendall left the Blades in 1997 Spackman became caretaker manager before being appointed as manager on 5 August. United had a good start to the season but huge losses and high wages from the previous season's promotion failure led to enforced sales of key personnel. The final straw being the sale of both of the club's top scoring strikers (Brian Deane – 11 league goals – went to S.L. Benfica & Jan Åge Fjørtoft – 9 league goals – to Barnsley) on the same day. Even though leaving midseason, Deane would go on to become the team's top scorer that year, such was the lack of replacements. Spackman was unhappy over this and resigned in March 1998. He later managed Barnsley between January and October 2001 but was sacked with the club near the bottom of the table. They were relegated at the end of that season. He re- entered management with Millwall in May 2006 but left only a few months later in September, with the club in the relegation zone of League One. As of 2010, he has failed to manage any club for a full season. =Media career= After Spackman left Barnsley, he began a new career in the media, becoming a pundit with Sky Sports before re-entering management with Millwall in 2006. Spackman currently appears as a regular pundit on Singapore's Football Channel, alongside other former players such as John Burridge and Rob Lee. Spackman regularly appears on Sentana Sport Saturday afternoon as an expert pundit. Spackman currently appears as a pundit on Britain's sports TV station Sports Tonight Live.

the A4012 road. It is about four miles east of Leighton Buzzard. Nearby places are Heath and Reach, Eggington, Stanbridge, Battlesden, Toddington, Tebworth and Tilsworth. Hockliffe is in Heath and Reach ward which sends a councillor to Central Bedfordshire Council. The ward includes the villages of Heath and Reach, Hockliffe, Eggington, Stanbridge, Tilsworth, Tebworth and Wingrave. The ward was created in 2011 and has since been represented by Councillor Mark Versallion and Hockliffe Parish Council Representative Denise Southard. Clipstone Brook There was a term applied from the 18th century which was \\"as straight as Hockley Brook\\" because of the meandering bends of the said brook. The correct name of the brook is the Clipstone Brook. The first field (though in the parish of Chalgrave) is still known by locals as the Old Ride, due to the original crossing of the brook of the original Woburn Road the later road being constructed in the 19th century through to the second Battlesden road turning near to the village of Milton Bryan. The new Woburn Road is about a 100 yards to the west from the said crossing and is now used by farm vehicles over a newer bridge. The second field was known as Horseshoe Corner as the brook was shaped like a horseshoe before it was straightened out by a farmer after the Second World War. Recently there have been regular sitings of the invasive signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, in the brook. It was noted in the local newspaper, The Leighton Buzzard Observer, that one was found inside a toy lobster during a clear out of a section of the brook near Leighton Buzzard in 2009. Hockliffe Radio Station During the Second World War a Czechoslovak military intelligence wireless transmission station was situated just outside Hockliffe.Neil Rees (compiler), The Secret History of The Czech Connection – The Czechoslovak Government in Exile in London and Buckinghamshire, England, 2005, .Jean Yates and Sue King (compilers), Dunstable and District at War from Eyewitness Accounts, Book Castle, 2006, , pages 276-283. The station was constructed by the Special Operations Executive in 1942 exclusively for Czech intelligence services. The station was used to contact Czech embassies in such countries as Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. Eleven men operated the station until June 1945, when they were able to return to their country. People from Hockliffe Hockliffe is the birthplace of Arthur Henry Neumann (1850–1907), a British explorer, hunter, soldier and travel writer, famous for his exploits in Equatorial East Africa at the end of the 19th century.

He received the award as member of the 2/43rd Battalion, during the Borneo campaign of the Second World War. Early life Tom Starcevich was born on 5 September 1918 at Subiaco, Western Australia, the son of immigrants: Gertrude May Starcevich, née Waters (born c. 1897, in Dunkirk, Kent, England) and Joseph Starcevich (born c. 1892, in Lič, Croatia- Slavonia, Austro-Hungarian Empire). The couple were married in 1915 at Mount Magnet, Western Australia. Starcevich and his older brother, Joseph Frederick (Joe) Starcevich (1915–2007), grew up on a farm at Grass Patch, north of Esperance. Tom was one of ten children. Military service Following the outbreak of the Second World War, both Starcevich brothers enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force: Joe on 23 October 1940, after which he was assigned to the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion;World War Two Nominal Roll, 2002, \\"Starcevich, Joseph Frederick\\" (24 January 2013) and Tom on 9 April 1941 (service number WX11519), becoming a member of the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion.World War Two Nominal Roll, 2002, \\"Starcevich, Leslie Thomas\\" (24 January 2013) Joe Starcevich became a prisoner of war following the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. He endured harsh conditions in captivity, including forced labour at Japanese prisoner of war camps at Changi Prison, the Burma-Thailand Railway and Nagasaki, Japan but survived the war.Joe Starcevich avoided the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in 1945 partly because he was hospitalised, after breaking his hip when a tunnel collapsed in a coalmine. A doctor who was also a prisoner of war set Starcevich's leg without anesthetic or antibiotics, and using the only metal pin available: a spoke from a bicycle wheel. The Hon.

He also saw action the following year in the Huon Peninsula during the New Guinea campaign. The 9th Division landed in Brunei Bay on 10 June 1945 with the 2/43rd Battalion landing at Labuan Island. Nine days later the battalion moved to the mainland and, on 28 June, during the capture of Beaufort, during fighting in North Borneo, the lead section of Starcevich's company came under fire from two Japanese machine-gun positions and suffered casualties. Starcevich, a Bren gunner, moved forward and assaulted each position in turn, killing five Japanese soldiers and causing the remainder of the machine guns' crews to retreat. Later that day, when the company was again held up by two machine gun positions, Starcevich adopted similar tactics and single-handedly captured both positions, killing seven members of their crews. For his actions, Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for the award was published in the London Gazette on 6 November 1945, reading: Starcevich was presented with the ribbon of the Victoria Cross by Brigadier Victor Windeyer, during a unit parade at Papar in North Borneo on 12 November 1945.Caption to AWM photograph 124957 He was presented with the actual medal at Government House, Perth on 27 May 1947 by Sir James Mitchell, Lieutenant Governor of Western Australia.Dennis Pillinger and Anthony Staunton. Victoria Cross presentations and locations, 2000, Starcevich held the rank of private throughout his military service and was discharged on 12 February 1946, as part of the prolonged demobilisation process that followed the end of hostilities. He reportedly wanted to re-enlist in the Australian Army during the Korean War, but his wife talked him out of it.Parliamentary Library [Commonwealth of Australia], 2012, \\"Leslie Thomas Starcevich\\" (24 January 2013). Post-war life Starcevich spent the first four years after the war as a motor vehicle sales representative in Perth. He married Kathleen Betty Warr, née Hardy, at the Perth registry office on 19 December 1947.The Daily News (Perth), 19 December 1947, p1. The couple, who had three children, divorced in 1969. From 1951, Tom and Joe Starcevich obtained and jointly worked a soldier settlement wheat and sheep farm at Carnamah. In 1981, Tom Starcevich moved back to Grass Patch, where he had bought a small farm. He died at Esperance, Western Australia, on 17 November 1989. Memorials The track in Borneo on which Starcevich's celebrated action occurred was later renamed Victoria Cross Road. He is also commemorated by Starcevich Monument. Starcevich's VC is on display at the Army Museum of Western Australia, in Fremantle, Western Australia. A bronze statue of Starcevich was unveiled at Grass Patch in 1995. The Leslie Starcevich Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood is named in his honour.

It can show simulated or real rape. It is not the same as the depiction of rape in non-pornographic media. Simulated scenes of rape and other forms of sexual violence have appeared in mainstream cinema, including rape and revenge films, almost since its advent. The legality of simulated rape pornography varies among jurisdictions of the world. It is controversial because of the argument that it encourages people to commit rape. However, studies of the issue and effects of pornography depicting sexual violence produce conflicting results. It has been mentioned in discussions concerning opposition to pornography. Simulated rape pornography is linked to rape fantasy. Numerous internet users search for 'rape scenes' and 'forced sex videos' on pornography websites. The creation of real rape pornography is a sex crime in countries where rape is illegal. Real rape pornography, including child rape pornography, is created for profit and other reasons. Rape pornography, as well revenge porn and other similar subgenres depicting violence, have been associated with rape culture. Legality =United Kingdom= The possession of rape pornography is illegal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland, the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 criminalised possession of \\"extreme\\" pornography. This included depictions of rape, and \\"other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity, whether violent or otherwise\\", including those involving consenting adults and images that were faked. The maximum penalty is an unlimited fine and 3 years imprisonment. The law is not often used, and it resulted in only one prosecution during the first four years that it was in force. In England and Wales it took another five years before pornography which depicts rape (including simulations involving consenting adults) was made illegal in England and Wales, bringing the law into line with that of Scotland. Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 had already criminalised possession of \\"extreme pornography\\" but it did not explicitly specify depictions of rape. At that time it was thought that the sale of rape pornography might already be illegal in England and Wales as a result of the Obscene Publications Act 1959, but the ruling in R v Peacock in January 2012 demonstrated that this was not the case. The introduction of a new law was first announced in 2013 by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron. In a speech to the NSPCC he stated that pornography that depicts simulated rape \\"normalise(s) sexual violence against women\\", although the Ministry of Justice criminal policy unit had previously stated that \\"we have no evidence to show that the creation of staged rape images involves any harm to the participants or causes harm to society at large\\". In February 2015, Section 16 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 amended the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 to criminalise the possession of pornographic imagery depicting acts of rape. The law only applies to consensual, simulated, fantasy material. The possession of an image capturing an actual rape, for example CCTV footage, is not illegal; but a \\"make believe\\" image created by and for consenting adults is open to prosecution. In January 2014 sexual freedom campaign groups criticised Section 16 as being poorly defined and liable to criminalise a wider range of material than originally suggested. However, in April 2014 the BBFC's presentation to Parliament suggested that the proposed legislation would not cover \\"clearly fictional depictions of rape and other sexual violence in which participants are clearly actors, acting to a script\\". =Germany= In Germany, the distribution of pornography featuring real or faked rape is illegal. =United States= There are few practical legal restrictions on rape pornography in the United States. Law enforcement agencies concentrate on examples where they believe a crime has been committed in the production. \\"Fantasy\\" rape pornography depicting rape simulations involving consenting adults are not a priority for the police. In response to the verdict of the People v. Turner sexual assault case, xHamster instituted a \\"Brock Turner rule\\", which banned videos involving rape, including those involving sex with an unconscious partner or hypnosis. Real rape cases =Non-internet= American porn actress Linda Lovelace wrote in her autobiography Ordeal, that she was coerced and raped in pornographic films in the 1970s. =Internet= Internet policing with respect to investigating actual crime has been made increasingly difficult by rape pornography websites operating anonymously, ignoring ICANN regulations and providing false information for the Whois database. It was reported that sexual assault occurred on the casting couch website GirlsDoPorn while it was in operation. Many of the women featured were allegedly blackmailed. Japanese women were forced to be in pornographic videos in the 2010s. Real rape videos of women and girls were filmed in the Doctor's Room and Nth room cases in South Korea in late 2010s and early 2020s. Videos showing real rape have been hosted on popular pornographic video sharing and pornography websites. These websites have been criticized by petitioners. Cybersex trafficking Victims of cybersex trafficking have been forced into live streaming rape pornography, which can be recorded and later sold. They are raped by traffickers in front of a webcam and or forced to perform sex acts on themselves or other victims. The traffickers film and broadcast the sex crimes in real time. Victims are frequently forced to watch the paying consumers on shared screens and follow their orders. It occurs in locations, commonly referred to as ‘cybersex dens,’ that can be in homes, hotels, offices, internet cafes, and other businesses.

They were formed in 1997 by the same team that managed the Spice Girls before they launched their career. The group were mostly known as a five-piece, consisting of Robinson, Neville, Conlon, Abz Love and Jason \\"J\\" Brown. Five enjoyed remarkable success worldwide, particularly in their native United Kingdom, as well as most of the rest of Europe and Asia. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Five has been certified for 1.6 million albums and 2.4 million singles in the UK. They split up on 27 September 2001 after selling 10 million copies of their records worldwide. Robinson, Love, Neville, and Brown briefly reformed the group without Conlon (who departed before their 2001 split) in September 2006, with a new management team headed by music manager Richard Beck. Eight months later, having secured a lucrative tour but failing to gain enough record company interest, Five made an announcement via their official website that they would again disband. In 2012, the group announced that they were planning another reunion, this time with Conlon on board. Lead singer Brown initially agreed to take part in the reunion, but later changed his mind, claiming that he no longer wanted to be in the public eye. The group continued with only four members, but decided to keep the name Five. Alongside Blue, 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X, Five were featured in the ITV2 documentary series The Big Reunion, which began airing on 31 January 2013. This was followed by a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013 and an arena tour around the UK and Ireland in May, which was their first ever tour without Brown. In November and December 2013, Five headlined their own tour, the 5ive Greatest Hits Tour, their first solo tour as a four-piece. In August 2014, Love announced his departure from the band via a tweet, leaving Conlon, Neville and Robinson to continue as a trio. Career =1997–98: Formation and 5ive= In 1997, an advertisement was placed in the UK performing arts newspaper The Stage, asking for young male singers/dancers to audition for a boy band-style group with \\"attitude and edge\\". Bob and Chris Herbert, the two men who had earlier created the Spice Girls, thought the time was right for a male group. Over 3,000 hopefuls auditioned, including Russell Brand, and they were finally narrowed down to only 14, five of whom had arranged themselves into a group while waiting for their audition. The auditions resulted in a provisional casting of nine members: Richard Breen (now better known as Abz Love), Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Sean Conlon, Jason \\"J\\" Brown, and stand-by members Peter Montpellier, Paul Taylor, Anthony Baker (rapper) and Ric Hershon. Because his first name was Richard, Breen created the nickname 'Abs' (from his middle name, \\"Abidin\\") to avoid confusion with Neville (born Richard Neville Dobson). Montpellier and Taylor were later cut when the final five were chosen in May 1997 and Hershon couldn't attend the final selection. Anthony Baker made it into the band originally, but doubt was cast over Anthony's rapping style as his North Eastern accent came through. The group subsequently were signed by Simon Cowell and BMG/RCA for a six-album deal. Five practiced and demoed their work at Trinity Studios in Knaphill – the same place the Spice Girls did a few years previously. In November 1997, Five released their debut single \\"Slam Dunk (Da Funk)\\", which debuted at number 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also released in the U.S. in 1998 but had little chart success, reaching number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100, although it was chosen as the NBA's new theme song. In 1998, Five earned their first major international hit, \\"When the Lights Go Out\\", which cracked the U.S. top 10 and earned Gold status there soon after. Five then went on an eight-day tour to promote their upcoming album, appearing in a concert special for the Disney Channel with Irish girl group B*Witched, in Times Square in New York City and on MTV's TRL. The debut album 5ive peaked at number 27 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and topped the charts in other countries worldwide, including the UK. A lesser known fact is that there was a 6th member of the group 5ive. Daniel Want, was released pre- signing of the first album deal, for reasons unknown to him. The dispute remains unsettled to this day. \\"It's the Things You Do\\" was released in late 1998 in the U.S., only to receive a lukewarm reception. The group embarked upon a U.S. tour with the American boy band NSYNC, but soon after pulled out due to exhaustion, flying back to England to rest and start work on a new album. Still from the first album, \\"Got the Feelin'\\", \\"Everybody Get Up\\", and \\"Until the Time Is Through\\" were all released as singles in the UK throughout 1998. Five reached the top 5 in several countries around the world, and the latter two singles each rose to the number two spot in the UK. A significant element in Five's popularity was their resemblance to American boy bands such as New Kids on the Block, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC in their uptempo musical style and 'street' image, in contrast to Take That, Boyzone, and 98 Degrees, who at the time were primarily known for their ballads. Five also wrote or co-wrote almost all of their own songs, something boy bands had never done much of until then. According to Cowell, Five almost broke the US. Unfortunately they made some bad decisions. When Cowell heard \\"...Baby One More Time\\", he wanted Five to have it, but writer Max Martin had given it to Britney Spears. Five were later offered \\"Bye Bye Bye\\", but upon hearing the song, they turned it down and dissed it. \\"Then they went out to Sweden a few weeks later to record a song which they famously turned down, called \\"Bye Bye Bye.\\" And it really was bye bye bye after that. That would have been the record that broke them. I would have broken that band,\\" Cowell said. =1999–2000: Invincible= In August 1999, the first single of their second album, Invincible, the catchy dance tune \\"If Ya Gettin' Down\\", was released and became a major hit worldwide but yet again failed to go to number 1 in their home country, kept out of the top spot by Ricky Martin. Finally, in October 1999, after three consecutive number-two peaks, \\"Keep on Movin'\\" became their first UK number 1, as well as their biggest selling single to date. The second album hit the top five shortly thereafter. \\"Don't Wanna Let You Go\\" was released in early March 2000, peaking at number 9. On 3 March 2000, Five opened at the BRIT Awards with rock legends Queen, performing an updated version of that band's hit, \\"We Will Rock You\\". That night Five won their first BRIT Award, as \\"Best Pop Act\\", and their cover of the Queen song went on to become their second number 1 in the UK in July 2000. The first half of 2000 found Five on a successful world tour, performing concerts in the UK, Europe, Russia, Australasia and—as a foursome—South America, after Neville contracted chickenpox and had to be flown back to England. After finishing the tour, Five continued to perform at many concerts in the UK, including Party in the Park with Queen. A re-issue of Invincible included remixed versions of a couple of songs and five live tracks from their tour, as well as a bonus track, \\"Don't Fight It Baby\\". Due for release in July 2000 in the US, the song was pulled from release after the group was dropped by their stateside label, Arista Records. Five also had problems with their Asian record company, and subsequently cancelled their Asian tour. Suffering from this major blow, the lads headed back to the studio and started writing songs for their next album. They continued to win awards in the UK and Europe, and in December 2000 launched their second big tour, in their home country. =2001: Kingsize, Conlon's departure and split= In January 2001, Five went to perform at one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock in Rio in Rio de Janeiro, to an audience of almost 500,000 people. In May 2001, after many months of creative writing and \\"developing their own personal sound\\", Kingsize was completed. When it was time to begin filming the video for their first single off the album, however, Conlon was unable to appear as he was suffering from a mental breakdown from stress caused by being part of the group. This was not publicly revealed at the time, however, and it was claimed he was ill from glandular fever instead. The \\"Let's Dance\\" video was released with a life-size cardboard cut-out standing in for the singer, and rumours that he had in fact left the band had to be quashed. Robinson also needed a time temporarily to be with his son, Brennan Rhys, who was born premature. The remaining three members, Brown, Love and Neville pressed on with heavy promotion of the group's third album and the \\"Let's Dance\\" single. Whilst performing at a concert in Belgium in July, Neville tore the tendons in his left foot, putting a halt to all promotion and prompting the group to have a few meetings to re-think their options and future. \\"Let's Dance\\" was released in mid August 2001, however, and became their third UK number one, holding the top spot for two weeks. Kingsize debuted two weeks later at number three, and went on to achieve Gold status. Two weeks after the release of Kingsize, the band announced Conlon's departure. Neville said in an interview several years later that the band's management kept Conlon's departure from the band a secret, so they were not aware that he had left when they filmed the \\"Let's Dance\\" video. On 27 September 2001, after a month of serious meetings with record management, the band announced on MTV Select that it would split after releasing a compilation later that year. The following day, Robinson married his fiancé, Kerry Oaker, at a ceremony with all of his former bandmates in attendance. Years later, Breen revealed he was strongly against the idea of splitting up; he described the break-up as feeling something had been taken from him. On 19 November a Greatest Hits album was released with 15 past hits, two remixes and one new song. On 24 November, a double-A-side single with \\"Closer to Me\\" and \\"Rock the Party\\" was released in United Kingdom with an animated video. The two songs was included in their previous album Kingsize, but after Conlon's departure, they decided to release as a single from their Greatest Hits album. The album was released on United States on 15 February 2002. In the band's short life- span, they experienced success around the world, racking up three number-one singles in the UK and selling an estimate of 15-20 million copies of their records worldwide, including 7 million copies of their albums worldwide and 2 million in the United States, and picking up numerous awards along the way. =2006–07: First reunion= On 17 September 2006, an announcement was made via Five's official Myspace page that a press conference was to be held at The Scala in central London on 27 September. After a venue change due to a shooting at The Scala, the conference was moved to the Bar Academy Islington. It was confirmed at the press conference that four of the five members would be reuniting (Conlon now being committed to his Sony deal). Five recorded new material for what was to be their fourth studio album, working with Guy Chambers, Swedish producer/songwriter Anders Bagge, and French DJs Trak Invaders. They also planned to tour in 2007. By January 2007, Five had completed half of their album and were looking to be signed to a record label with new manager, Richard Beck, who also secured an MTV documentary series titled Five - The Revive. The album was expected to be released within the next few months. On 8 March 2007, at midnight, Five premiered one-minute clips of three brand new songs that were to have been on the new album. The songs, titled \\"70 Days\\", \\"Settle Down\\" and \\"It's All Good\\" can be heard on the band's official website and also on their Myspace page. On 19 May 2007, only eight months after reforming and having failed to secure a lucrative enough record deal, 5ive announced via their website that they would no longer be pursuing a comeback. =2012–present: Second reunion, Brown's 2012 and Love's 2014 departure= In 2012, Conlon reunited with his former bandmates to discuss the possibility of a second reunion. Brown initially was willing to take part in the reunion, but later on pulled out and the other members then stated that they would continue as a four-piece. The return was announced on 18 October. In 2013, the group took part in The Big Reunion, where they talked about their time together and the difficulties that came with being in a band. Robinson also expressed his annoyance toward Brown's refusal of reuniting. In January 2013, it the group were looking to find a new member to replace Brown, and they were also having disagreement over the group's name. The group auditioned three men to become the new member of the band, but in the end the plan for a fifth member was dropped and Five decided to continue as a four-piece. Brown eventually appeared on The Big Reunion: On Tour to deny the accusations made by his bandmates in September 2013. He acknowledged his behaviour could have been seen as loud and overbearing, but he denied bullying Conlon. During a meeting with Love on the show, Brown explained how he had moved on and that he did not feel comfortable returning to Five. On 16 September 2013, the band picked up the award for Best Music Act (On a Reality TV Show) at the National Reality TV Awards. In November and December 2013, Five embarked on their own tour in UK and Australia, the 5ive Greatest Hits Tour. In March 2014, it was rumored that Love had quit the group, but at the time they denied it. In June 2014, Five supported McBusted on four dates of their McBusted Tour and later that month Love stated that the group's future is uncertain. Love eventually announced that he had left the group in August 2014 via Twitter, without telling the other members beforehand. In an interview a few days before the announcement, Love revealed that he only agreed to reunite with Five because of financial necessity. The band has since continued as a three piece. In February 2016, they released another album, entitled Keep On Movin' - The Best of Five.

Serving as a sergeant during the First World War, Statton was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 following his assault on four German machine guns. With three men, Statton rushed the posts armed with only a revolver and succeeded in capturing the first gun. Moving to the second, he killed the crew of five himself before the two remaining gun crews were forced to retreat. Born in Tasmania, Statton was married and working as a farmer when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force during 1916. Posted to the 40th Battalion, he was shipped to England where he spent three months training. Arriving on the Western Front in 1917, Statton was awarded the Military Medal during the Battle of Messines while leading carrying parties to the frontline under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. Wounded twice during the war, Statton returned to Australia in 1919 and was discharged the following year. In 1934, he took part in rescue work aiding families isolated by severe bushfires in the Derwent Valley. Following a period of service during the Second World War, Statton died of stomach cancer in 1959. Early life Statton was born in Beaconsfield, Tasmania, on 21 October 1890 to Edward Statton, a miner, and his wife Maggie Lavinia (née Hoskins). He was educated at Zeehan State School, before gaining employment as a farmer in Tyenna. Giving his age as twenty-one, Statton married Elsie May Pearce in a Methodist ceremony on 12 September 1907; the couple later had a son and two daughters. First World War Despite his wife's disapproval, Statton enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 29 February 1916, and was allotted to the newly raised 40th Battalion as a private. Appointed lance corporal on 22 May, Statton embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT Berrima on 1 July, bound for England. The troopship disembarked at Devonport a little over seven weeks later, where the 40th Battalion spent the next three months training. Promoted to corporal on 19 November 1916, Statton embarked along with the rest of the 40th Battalion for France and the Western Front four days later. Initially posted to Le Havre, the battalion was transferred to Flanders in Belgium during early 1917. Statton was promoted to temporary sergeant on 16 January 1917, which was made substantive from 26 April. In June, the 40th Battalion took part in the Battle of Messines. Over a three-day period during the engagement at Messines from 7–9 June, Statton was placed in charge of supervising and leading carrying parties to the frontline. Throughout this work, he was subject to heavy German artillery and machine gun fire, and on several occasions the party was decimated by shellfire. Despite this, the parties managed to reach the frontline on every occasion. For his actions throughout this time, Statton was later awarded the Military Medal, the recommendation of which cited his \\"exceptional fine work and gallant conduct\\". The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 16 August 1917. On 12 October 1917, Statton was involved in operations during the First Battle of Passchendaele when he suffered a gunshot wound to his right shoulder. First admitted to the 22nd General Hospital, Douane, Statton was then transferred to the VAD Hospital, Tonbridge, as the wound required treatment in England. Having sufficiently recovered after a period of hospitalisation at the Fort Pitt Military Hospital, Chatham, and 3rd Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, Statton was granted two weeks leave from 28 January 1918. Returning to duty, he was attached to the Overseas Training Brigade at Longbridge Deverill prior to re-embarking on 1 May for France, where he rejoined the 40th Battalion twelve days later. While in action around the village of Villers-Bretonneux on 10 June, Statton was wounded in a gas attack on his position. Initially admitted to the 10th Australian Field Ambulance, he was transferred to the 40th Casualty Clearing Station six days later, before returning to the 40th Battalion on 24 June. Beginning on 8 July, Statton was placed on a five-day attachment to a demonstration platoon at the 10th Brigade Headquarters. Returning to his battalion, he was attached to the American 3rd Battalion, 130th Regiment, for service over a seven-day period later that month. He rejoined the 40th Battalion on 27 July. =Victoria Cross= Between 10–12 August 1918, the 3rd Australian Division—of which the 40th Battalion was part—was ordered to attack from an easterly direction against the southern bank of the Somme River, and advance along the road past Proyart. On 12 August, the 40th Battalion was tasked with the objective of seizing and holding a valley to the south of the Proyart–Chuignes road. The advance entailed moving the battalion across approximately of open ground, while under the direct observation of German forces on high ground to the east of Proyart. At the same time, the 37th Battalion was to move through the village of Proyart itself, and proceed to a line just beyond the railway to the north of the Proyart–Chuignes road. It was during this action that Statton was to earn the Victoria Cross. The 40th Battalion began its attack at approximately 07:30, and by 08:30 had successfully advanced . It was at this point, however, that the unit came under an intense barrage from German artillery, and were prevented from moving further forward. With assistance from a Lewis Gun team under Statton's command, the battalion's A Company managed to reach the centre of Proyart village an hour later. The remainder of the 40th Battalion attempted to follow, but soon became subject to heavy machine gun fire. With his Lewis Gun, Statton engaged two German machine gun posts and thus enabled the remainder of his battalion to continue its advance. The battalion was later able to reach its objectives. Percy Statton's medals at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. At 18:00, the 40th Battalion received a message that the 37th Battalion was about to attempt to advance from the village to its own objective. From his position, Statton observed a line of German machine gunners firing on the 37th Battalion and preventing its advance. He turned his Lewis Guns on them in an attempt to assist a party of men from the 37th as they attacked. Having failed, a party of thirteen men were assembled and rushed the position soon after, but the group was wiped out before they reached the first gun. Gathering Corporal Upchurch and Privates Leslie Styles and Beard, Statton worked his way along under the cover of the Chuignes road embankment. Reaching within of the machine gunners and armed with only a revolver, Statton led the three men as they rushed across the open ground towards the German strongpoint. Reaching the position, the party was able to dispose of the first gun and its crew before moving onto the second, where Statton personally shot four of the five crew members and bayoneted the fifth with his own rifle. Seeing this, the two remaining gun teams began to retreat but were killed by Statton's Lewis Gunners. Soon after, another German machine gun opened up, killing Private Styles and wounding Corporal Upchurch. With Private Beard, Statton began to crawl back to his own lines, while the inspired 37th Battalion continued its advance and cheered the pair as they went past. Later that evening, Statton, while under heavy machine gun fire, went out and retrieved the badly-wounded Upchurch and the body of Styles. By 20:00, both battalions had reached and consolidated their positions, and were relieved by the British 17th Division the following day. At 09:00 on 27 September 1918, the 40th Battalion was ordered onto parade by the unit's Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Lord. Addressing the assembled crowd, Lord announced that that same day, the name of Sergeant Percy Statton would appear in the London Gazette announcing that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Described by the battalion's history as a \\"reluctant hero\\", Statton was granted three cheers before he was carried shoulder high through the ranks while the battalion band played. The full citation for Statton's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette later that day, reading: =Later war service= From 20 October 1918, Statton was granted ten days leave to Paris. Returning to the 40th Battalion, he was sent to Amiens the following day and attached to 4th Army Guard for special duties over a three-day period. Briefly re-joining his battalion, Statton was shipped to England on 5 November for special duties. During this time, the Armistice was signed officially declaring the war's end, and Statton was granted two weeks leave in December. Returning to France on 27 January 1919, Statton was attached to the Headquarters of the Australian Base Depot from 25 March. Shipped to England in June, Statton attended an investiture ceremony in the Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace, where he was presented with his Victoria Cross by King George V. During his time in England, Statton undertook a course at the Motor Training Institute in preparation for non-military employment, before he was granted a month's leave. Returning to duty on 24 September, Statton boarded HT Pakeha twelve days later and departed for Australia. The troopship arrived in Tasmania on 26 November and Statton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 19 January 1920. Later life A group of Victoria Cross recipients gathered to march in the 1938 Sydney Anzac Day march. Statton is in the centre, fifth from right. Following his discharge, Statton settled in Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained employment in the timber industry. True to her word that she would leave him if he went off to war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire. During the Second World War, Statton enlisted for service with the Volunteer Defence Corps of the Australian Military Forces. Commissioned as a lieutenant on 18 June 1942, he served throughout the war with the 5th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, until his discharge on 9 January 1946. Statton's wife died in 1945, and on 16 December 1947, he married Monica Enid Effie Kingston; the pair later had a son. The couple lived at Ouse, where Statton worked as a commercial agent and was a member of the local council. In 1956, Statton joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the award. At the Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart, on 5 December 1959, Statton died of stomach cancer. Accorded a full military funeral, Statton was cremated and his ashes interred at the Cornelian Bay Cemetery. His Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Australian War Memorial.

He was Director General of MI5 from 1956 to 1965. Some commentators, including journalist Chapman Pincher and intelligence officer Peter Wright, have suggested that Hollis was a Soviet agent. In his book, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorised History of MI5, Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew rejects this theory. A 2015 panel held by the The Institute of World Politics did not reach a definite conclusion, however, it did raise serious doubts and questions about the official position on the case. Early years, family, and education Hollis' father, the Right Reverend George Hollis, was Bishop of Taunton. His mother was a daughter of a Canon of Wells Cathedral.Pincher, 1984, p. 14 Hollis was educated at Clifton College, Bristol.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p367: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 From 1924 to the spring of 1926, he attended Worcester College, Oxford, where he read English, but left without completing his degree. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites' Club. Professional career From the spring of 1926 into 1927, he was a clerk for the Standard Chartered Bank in London.Pincher, 1984, p. 17 In early 1927, he went to Hong Kong as a freelance journalist, then moved to Shanghai. From 1 April 1928, he worked for British American Tobacco. In 1930, he transferred to Beijing. In June 1938, he joined MI5 F Division (Countersubversion). Many departments of MI5, including F Division, moved from London to Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, during World War II, due to threat of bombing. From 1953–56, Hollis was MI5 Deputy Director General under Dick White, succeeding White in 1956 and remaining in that post until his retirement in 1965. Mole suspicions After Kim Philby's flight from Beirut to Moscow in 1963, rumours began to circulate that Hollis had alerted him to his impending arrest. Hollis was criticised for not alerting John Profumo, the War Secretary in Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's Conservative government, that he might have become entangled with a Soviet spy ring through his friendship with Stephen Ward and his affair with showgirl Christine Keeler, who was introduced by Ward to Profumo. Soviet Naval Attache Eugene Ivanov was also involved with Keeler at this time, in the early 1960s, and sought to learn the date of American plans to arm nuclear warheads in West Germany, from Profumo through Keeler. Profumo had to resign in mid-1963, and the resulting scandal did much to bring the Labour Party to power in the October 1964 General Election. During the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of MI5 operations failed in circumstances that suggested the Soviets had been tipped off. Although many such failures were subsequently blamed on the actions of such self-confessed or defected agents as Philby, Guy Burgess, and Anthony Blunt, a number of failures occurred after all three had lost their access to secret information. Some in MI5 concluded the Soviets had an agent in a very senior position within the organisation. Peter Wright, Arthur S. Martin, Jane Sissmore and others became convinced that either Hollis or his deputy, Graham Mitchell, could be the only ones responsible, eventually confiding their suspicions to Dick White, director general of MI6. White instructed Martin to inform Hollis that Mitchell was a suspect, and Hollis instructed Martin (after due consideration) to keep Mitchell under surveillance. Author Nigel West implies that this was a deliberate ploy to keep tabs on both Mitchell and Hollis. Martin eventually became so disgruntled and outspoken about Hollis's attitude toward the investigation that Hollis suspended Martin for a fortnight, and the case was turned over to Wright. Much of the investigation was centred around interviews with Anthony Blunt at that time, and Peter Wright had amassed a sizable amount of taped evidence from Blunt when Martin returned from suspension. After 1964, Blunt gradually confessed his double-agent role in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Eventually the PETERS operation wound down. By then, some time after Hollis had retired, suspicion had lifted from Mitchell and focused solely on Hollis. However, the then Director General Martin Furnival Jones refused to sanction an investigation into Hollis. Mole Hunt (Chapter 3, page 45) noted that the investigative team known as FLUENCY had been disbanded before any conclusions had been reached. In 1984, investigative journalist Chapman Pincher published Too Secret Too Long, a book which examined the early life of Hollis and his MI5 career drawing upon new sources and upon many interviews with retired intelligence personnel. Pincher published an updated version of his book in 2009. Pincher also accused Hollis of being a Soviet agent, although entirely separate from the Cambridge Five spy ring. Pincher claims Hollis was recruited by Richard Sorge in China in the early 1930s to spy for the GRU. Evidence has been advanced to support these assertions by Pincher in his book, Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain, which is devoted to positing that Hollis was \\"Elli\\", the highly placed mole within MI5 identified by Igor Gouzenko, and operating as a Soviet agent from the 1940s until retiring from MI5. Under Furnival Jones, the higher management of MI5 expressed indignation and loss of morale about the Hollis affair. Hollis was asked to come in and clear up the allegations. Having been the director, Hollis was aware of the procedures of the interrogation and investigation. He remained calm and composed throughout, denying all allegations. Martin and Wright and the team were unable to convince anyone else in MI5 or MI6 that they were right about Hollis. Wright retired in January 1976, upon reaching age 60, and, by his own account, was enraged at being denied a pension for his 30 years of service, on highly legalistic and technical grounds. He emigrated to Tasmania, Australia, where he wrote an account of his work at MI5. Despite attempts by Margaret Thatcher's government to suppress the publication and distribution of Spycatcher, it was finally published in 1987, and eventually sold over two million copies around the world. In the book Wright claimed that Hollis had been a Soviet agent. Among the evidence for this claim is the Igor Gouzenko defection, at Ottawa in 1945. Hollis was sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko, a cipher clerk in the Soviet embassy in Ottawa. Gouzenko had provided Hollis with clear information about Alan Nunn May's meetings with his handlers; all these meetings were immediately cancelled. May was a scientist and part of the Soviet spy ring which obtained the secrets of the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb for the United States. Gouzenko noted that the man who met him seemed to be in disguise, not interested in his revelations, and discouraged him from further disclosures. In view of this circumstantial evidence, Wright became convinced that Hollis was a traitor.Wright, p. 288 Wright alleges in Spycatcher that Gouzenko, who had worked for the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate, the Russian foreign military intelligence service), himself deduced later that his interviewer might have been a Soviet double agent, and was probably afraid that he might recognise him from case photos that Gouzenko might have seen in KGB or GRU files, hence the disguise. Gouzenko also admitted that he, being a lower level clerk, had no access to such files. Peter Wright had given a televised interview during the dispute with Thatcher's government. Following Peter Wright's TV interview in 1984, Arthur Martin wrote a letter to the Times, and it was published 19 July 1984. Martin stated that while Wright exaggerated the certainty with which they regarded Hollis's guilt, Wright was justified in saying that Hollis was the most likely candidate, for the reasons Wright had cited. In her 2001 autobiography, Christine Keeler (John Profumo's mistress), alleged, without supporting evidence, that Hollis and Stephen Ward were part of a spy ring with Sir Anthony Blunt. Ward committed suicide on 3 August 1963 as the Profumo scandal progressed.Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 243–247 In Christine Keeler's updated book, Secrets and Lies, published in 2012, Keeler stated she saw Hollis five times at the house she was sharing with GRU Agent Stephen Ward. Hollis was visiting Ward at the shared house and Keeler used to serve them coffee.Keeler, p.77 In his book, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorised History of MI5, a Cambridge professor, Dr Christopher Andrew, used access to 400,000 MI5 files to compile an official history of the service. He claims he has proved conclusively that Hollis was not a double agent and that Wright was misguided at best. Dr Paul Monk, an Australian former senior intelligence analyst and author of the argument maps used in the Institute of World Politics panel, provides a counterpoint to the Authorized History. He believes Andrew dismisses Wright's claims almost ad hominem but fails to address the specific points made by Pincher in his final (2009) book on the subject. He describes Andrew's description of Hollis's background as - in light of the allegations made against him - insouciant. Monk feels that as he is arguing that Hollis is innocent, Andrew should have given Hollis the vetting he did not receive when he entered MI5 (Particularly in light of Hollis's relationships with confirmed Soviet assets, regardless of whether he was one of them). Monk discusses at length the flaws of the book, for example, the notion that Leo Long was definitely ELLI (this is supposedly disproved by KGB archives - Long is thought to be RALPH, rather - and solely supported by the later questioned testimony of Gordievsky). He surmises with the following > Christopher Andrew treads a well-worn path in failing utterly to address > that case, much less refute it once and for all. In the 2009 ITV programme, Inside MI5: The Real Spooks, Oleg Gordievsky recounted how he saw the head of the British section of the KGB, expressing surprise at the allegations that he read in a British newspaper about Hollis being a KGB agent, saying \\"Why is it they are speaking about Roger Hollis, such nonsense, can't understand it, it must be some special English trick directed against us.\\"Inside MI5: The Real Spooks (ITV 2009), youtube.com; accessed 3 April 2016. But Chapman Pincher in Treachery states that Hollis was believed to be a GRU agent, the GRU being a different organisation from the KGB.Pincher 2009, p. 241 On 21 April 2015, the Institute of World Politics held a panel debating whether or not Hollis was a mole. They published a report and chronology. The official MI5 website denies that Hollis was a Soviet agent, adding: > Hollis' non-involvement with the Soviets was confirmed in the 1980s by a > senior KGB defector, Oleg Gordievsky. He has described how the Soviets > themselves were baffled by the allegations against HollisMI5 website; > accessed 8 August 2014. Family Hollis married Evelyn Swayne on 17 July 1937 at Wells Cathedral, with his father performing the ceremony. She was the daughter of a solicitor from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset. The couple had one son, Adrian Swayne Hollis. Hollis's son, Adrian (1940–2013), was a classical scholar and Grandmaster of correspondence chess, and was British Correspondence Chess Champion in 1966, 1967 and 1971. Philosopher Martin Hollis (1938–1998) was his nephew. His elder brother, Christopher Hollis (1902–1977), was a Conservative MP for Devizes from 1945-55.

The village is located within the borough of Fareham and is the site of the London Area Control Centre (LACC) and the London Terminal Control Centre (LTCC), part of National Air Traffic Services Air Traffic Control Centre, and Bursledon Brickworks, the last remaining example of a Victorian steam-powered brickworks. Swanwick has no real village centre and the only commercial premises of note is the Elm Tree Public House. Since the 1980s, the gradual spread of housing developments has meant that Swanwick has partly merged with the new development of Whiteley although the only direct vehicular access is via Yew Tree Drive (once a bus only route). Swanwick railway station on the West Coastway Line is approximately one mile south of the village and is nearer Park Gate than Swanwick. The village's \\"twin\\" Lower Swanwick is situated two miles west of the village on the edge of the River Hamble. History Human activity at Swanwick dates back to the Bronze Age. It is understood that a ritual from the era involved the digging of shafts or wells to the underworld; one such shaft at Swanwick was found to contain 20 cylindrical loom-weights and a wooden post with organic residues believed to be the remains of flesh and blood. A refuse pit dating from Roman times has also been found at Swanwick. In the autumn of 877 AD Alfred the Great blockaded the city of Exeter in order to capture the band of pagans there; some of the pagans fled by sea and were pursued by king's ships to Swanwick where the pagans' boats were sunk after a month at sea. Some historians have debated whether this was at Swanwick in Hampshire, or a coastal settlement called Sanewick in Dorset. Some accounts indicate that the pagans, who were Danish, lost some 120 vessels at Swanwick.ASC 877 - English translation at project Gutenberg. Retrieved 2 May 2013 The Post Office Directory of 1855 listed Swanwick as a hamlet within the parish of Titchfield (itself the largest parish in the county of Hampshire at the time). The hamlet had an independent chapel and four residents were listed: a gentleman by the name of William B Gates, a farmer (John Crosskey), a blacksmith (Richard Hewett) and a grocer (Thomas Privett). Around the beginning of the 20th century the area around Swanwick was noted for its strawberry beds. Strawberry farming remained a feature of the area, and in 1961 strawberries from Swanwick were being cooled immediately after picking as an experimental way of retaining quality and freshness for longer. Swanwick's cooled strawberries were being transported to markets as far away as Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow. The air traffic area control centre at Swanwick was brought into operation in 2002. A control centre for London City Airport is being added with a scheduled completion in 2018. The decision has been taken to relocate the control tower to a site away utilising three cable links providing live video will be a UK first by replacing air traffic controllers with a remotely operated digital system. It will be tested for a year before becoming operational in 2019. Landmarks The area houses Bursledon Brickworks and Swanwick Lakes Nature Reserve. The nature reserve is an area of about 80 acres, that was formed from clay pit excavations. Owned by NATS, the site is managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest. Both NATS and the Nature Reserve formed part of the original brickworks.

He began publishing poetry in the 1910s, then in the 1920s spent five years teaching at Keio University in Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan and after his return to England, where he took up a post at University College Hull, he continued to publish poetry, fiction and criticism. His works include The Course of English Classicism from the Tudor to Victorian Age (1930), a study of classicism in British art; Yofuku, or, Japan in Trousers (1931), a travel book about his experiences in Japan which was critical of aspects of Japanese culture; and A Hundred Years of English Literature (1959), a survey of the literature of Britain, the British Empire and the United States. Early life and career Sherard Vines was born in Oxford in 1890. His father, Sydney Howard Vines, was Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford and named his son after William Sherard. He attended Magdalen College School and New College, Oxford. His tutor at Oxford was the literary scholar George Stuart Gordon. From 1910 to 1914 he was editor of Oxford Poetry, in which he also published his own work. He held an academic position at Belfast University until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He served in the Highland Light Infantry until 1917, when he was wounded and forced to return to civilian life. While in France, he had married a 21-year-old Salvadorean-born Frenchwoman, Helene Ernestine Dreyfus.Vines married Helene Dreyfus on 12 July 1916 in Paris, according to Leicestershire Antills and Connected Families, accessed 16 May 2020. She joined him in England, and gave birth to a daughter, Jeannine in 1922.After divorce ended Vines' first marriage, Helene raised their daughter, Jeannine Agnes Renestine Vines, in France. Jeannine married Jacques Barry Delongchamps in 1948; their eldest son is French diplomat François Barry Martin-Delongchamps His collection The Two Worlds was reviewed in 1917 in Poetry, where it was described as an uneven work in which \\"it would seem as though the author, in advancing, grew bolder in thought, more daring as to form, casting aside tritenesses and careless rhymes that mar the first part of the work.\\" In the following years Vines was associated with the Bloomsbury Group and poems of his were included in the Sitwells' Wheels anthologies between 1917 and 1921. In 1920 he published The Kaleidoscope: Poems for the People. Reviewing The Kaleidoscope in Poetry, Marion Strobel commented that the volume \\"springs fearlessly from one subject to another\\" and prefers \\"a harsh simplicity\\" to \\"sensuous cadences\\"or \\"beauty of wording\\". Japan Starting in 1923, Vines taught for five years at Keio University in Tokyo. He was invited to Keio by Junzaburō Nishiwaki, whom he had met in England and who later translated some of his works into Japanese. Vines' arrival in Japan was simultaneous with that of fellow English poet Edmund Blunden, who taught at the Imperial University of Tokyo. In 1924 and 1925 Vines contributed short stories to Blunden's Oriental Literary Times. These included the semi-autobiographical \\"Also Ran\\", about an obscure author denied the success he believes he deserves. In 1925 he published a critical biography of the Japanese author Yone Noguchi. From 1925 to 1927 he was a tutor to Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu. Another poetry collection, The Pyramid, was published in 1926. A reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement wrote of The Pyramid: \\"[Vines'] despair is significant because it is so intellectually positive ... His verse is remarkable for the piercing violence with which it expresses the disenchantment of one for whom the world has become divested of value.\\" Movements in Modern English Poetry and Prose, composed mostly of lectures Vines had given and written with Japanese students in mind, was published in 1927. A review in The Criterion described the book as \\"not only up-to-date and impartial, but also full of acute perceptions and judgments.\\" While in Japan he also became friends with the South African author William Plomer, who spent the years 1926–29 there and described Vines as \\"a poet of distinction\\", albeit \\"neglected ... by a reading public too easily hypnotized by the parrot-like repetition of names and too incurious to find things out for itself\\". Return to Europe Vines returned to Europe in 1928 to take up a position as Professor of English at University College Hull. That year he published a further volume of poetry, Triforium, which featured works that had previously appeared in the Japanese literary magazine Mita Bungaku. His novel Humours Unreconciled: A Tale of Modern Japan, published in 1928, satirises the expatriate community in Tokyo in the 1920s and comments on the perceived prevalence of suicide in Japan through the tale of an extramarital affair and a murder misrepresented as a suicide. The Course of English Classicism from the Tudor to Victorian Age, a critical study, was published in 1930. The book sought to trace the growth of classicism in British art beginning in the Tudor period. George Orwell, reviewing the book in the New Adelphi, noted that Vines viewed poetry as \\"a thing of wit, grandeur and good sense, not of 'magic' and seductive sounds\\", and praised Vines' \\"admirable account of the main drift of classicism\\". A reviewer in The Review of English Studies described it as \\"a very stimulating and provocative book\\" which would encourage a reconsideration of Augustan literature. At Hull he was a colleague, friend and neighbour of the economist Eric Roll. Vines' students at Hull included Harold Andrew Mason. In 1930 Vines he married his second wife, Agnes Rennie Cumming; their daughter, Rennie J. Vines, was born in 1933. His travel book Yofuku, or, Japan in Trousers was published in 1931 and overlaps to a degree with Humours Unreconciled. It contains numerous references to his time at Keio and discussion of the perceived eccentricities of Japanese society, customs and cuisine. Vines described the typical Japanese student as \\"personally as a rule most charming, and sometimes a trifle pathetic\\", and noted divergent attitudes among Japanese people toward foreigners. In the book Vines also sought to establish connections between features of Japanese life and the Japanese climate and cuisine. William Snell has argued that Yofuku portrays Japan in a less positive light than Humours Unreconciled, and reflects Vines' \\"particularly jaundiced view of [Japan] and its people\\". A reviewer in Pacific Affairs criticised Vines' focus on the aspects of Japanese life he found less pleasant, and asserted that \\"the informed reader, particularly one who has lived in Japan,\\" would find it incomplete and one-sided, concluding \\"it is hard to imagine any considerable public for the book or any way in which that public could be served by its appearance.\\" Return, Belphegor!, a fantasy novel about the devil, was published in 1932. Georgian Satirists was published in 1934. In 1941 Green to Amber, a novel about English society in the late 1930s, was published. In 1950 Vines published A Hundred Years of English Literature, a survey of literature produced in the United Kingdom, United States and British Empire from around 1830. Reviewing it for Books Abroad, John Paul Pritchard described Vines as \\"a staunch defender of the Victorians\\" and noted the book's incomplete coverage of American literature. Robert Withington, reviewing the book in the CEA Critic, likewise noted certain omissions and argued that much of the book's material would be too obscure for students and too contentious and incomplete for academics. Vines remained at Hull until his retirement in 1952, and died in 1974.

Incest pornography can feature actual relatives, but the main type of this pornography is fauxcest, which features non-related actors of similar looks to suggest family relationship. This genre includes characters with various levels of kinship, including first cousins, aunts, uncles, parent(s), offspring, nieces and nephews. In many countries, incest pornography amounts to illegal pornography.  History and legality  Arguably the most famous example of the genre is the Taboo film series of the 1980s. The first film in this series, which starred Kay Parker, was released in 1980. It spawned numerous sequels, several of which won adult film awards. There is a substantial amount of incest pornography on the Internet, leading some to argue it may legitimize or encourage real-life incest. Jeffrey Masson has even argued that incest porn is \\"the very nucleus of pornography -- its prototypical form.\\"  Twincest and sibcest porn  Going back at least as far as the Christy twins in the 1970s, depictions of incest, and particularly incest between twins, have been a feature of gay pornography. Though the Christy twins may have been unrelated but similar-looking men and some twins have appeared together in scenes without substantial contact between them, some genuine twins have performed sexual acts on each other. It is illegal in many jurisdictions. For example, in Australia it is rated \\"Refused Classification\\" (RC). The 1999 William Higgins production Double Czech included actual sex between the Bartok twins, as did the 2009 sequel between the Richter twins, though the Bartok brothers were described as \\"looking utterly mortified\\" in their scene. Not so for another pair of Czech twins, Elijah and Milo Peters, who work together condomless for both oral and anal sex for studio Bel Ami. As of 2010, they were reported to live together as a monogamous couple outside of their porn careers and want to continue working together for another 50 years. Some scenes with the Peters twins together have needed to be re-edited in order to gain approval from film classification censors for distribution in markets including the United Kingdom and the United States.  Fauxcest  Fauxcest refers to pornographic or erotic depictions of incest by actors who are merely pretending to be related but in actuality have no biological relation. Pseudoincest and fauxcest are sometimes categorized under the umbrella of smut. The term \\"fauxcest\\" is a portmanteau of \\"faux\\" and \\"incest\\", sometimes transcribed as \\"faux-incest\\" and sometimes used interchangeably with \\"family roleplay\\" or \\"fictional incest\\". Besides women, its primary consumers are couples and millennials. According to one pornographic film director, part of the appeal of the fauxcest genre is a desire by porn consumers to view taboo and controversial content. As of 2016, the genre had been growing in popularity at a rate of 1000% since 2011 and 178% since 2014, a spike that some industry professionals have attributed to female porn consumers who largely seek a content that is accompanied by a narrative. Variations of pretend relationships include siblings, mom–son, dad–daughter, step-relatives and various others. One of the reasons behind a trend towards pseudoincest over actual blood-relation incest within fiction is the bannable nature of consanguineal forms since some publishers will refuse to publish such content. On GameLink, one in ten purchases had a fauxcestual theme, and one sociologist has said the theme has become more mainstream as evidenced by its depiction on fantasy novel and television series such as Game of Thrones. Pseudo-incest fictional books began to increase in popularity in the year 2011. However, some self-publishing companies are welcoming towards content that has pseudo-incestual themes.

Description The Suwannee bass is a rather small species compared to its congeners and has a deep body with a large mouth in which the maxilla is placed beneath the eye and there is a circular patch of teeth on the tongue. The base of the soft part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin are scaled. They are mostly brown in colour marked with a dozen olive blotches on the flanks. These blotches are wider than the gaps between them towards the head but they merge towards the tail eventually creating a horizontal band near the caudal peduncle. There is a large blotch at the base of the caudal fin which has a pale margin, this is more obvious in young fish which also show bold mottling on the soft part of the dorsal fin, the anal fin and the caudal fin.

It has been introduced into the t is introduced in the St. Marks River and the Wacissa River in Florida. Habitat and biology The Suwannee bass is found in fast-moving shallow areas of rivers, known as shoals, over limestone, this is frequently covered in sand. They usually prefer neutral or basic waters, originating in springs emerrging from aquifer]s in the limestone. They are uncommon in the lower parts of the Suwannee River where there is a tidal influence, but are absent from the upper reaches which are dominated by acidic waters draining from the Okefenokee Swamp. This species has a diet which is dominated by crayfish, although they will eat other invertebrates and fishes. In the lower, tidal reaches of the Suwannee River the blue crab is taken by this species. The spawning season runs from February to May, peaking in April and May, when the water temperature reaches The eggs are laid in circular depressions excavated near the edges of the streams where they are fertilised by the male. The male then guards the eggs up to the point of hatching. Females have a faster growth rate and attain larger sizes than the males, the males rarely attain lengths greater than . The females can have a life span of up to 12 years although in the males it is 9 years.

It won the Best Screenplay award at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The film features a clip from the 1948 film Blood on the Moon. Plot The protagonist, Lolita Cassard, lacks confidence and self-esteem because she doesn't look like the women who fill the pages of fashion magazines. Her father, Étienne Cassard, is a respected novelist, but rarely considers the feelings of others, only thinking of himself and worrying about aging. Pierre Millet, a younger writer, doubts he will ever be successful. Meanwhile, Sylvia Millet, a singing teacher, believes in her husband's talent, but doubts her own and that of her student, Lolita. When Sylvia discovers that Lolita is the daughter of Étienne, an author whom she admires, she befriends Lolita in order to gain access to Étienne for her husband's sake. Lolita does not believe or see that Sylvia is just another person being generous to her because her father is famous. She begins to confide in Sylvia about her father, love life, and self-confidence issues. Sylvia surprisingly takes a liking to Lolita and begins to see Étienne for the man he really is. Throughout the film Sébastien, a young journalist, befriends Lolita. He is the only one with pure intents, even after he finds out who her father is. He takes a liking to Lolita, but she refuses to show any interests and is only infatuated with another boy, Mathieu. Mathieu is everything Sébastien is not. Mathieu only has interest for Lolita because of her father and mistreats her. Lolita casts all of these same behaviors on Sébastien and does not realize that he truly does like her for herself. After a crazy weekend at Étienne's cottage, Sylvia leaves Pierre because he has become just like Étienne, Lolita goes after Sébastien because she realizes he has honest intentions, and Étienne is repeatedly reminded that he is an indifferent father to Lolita.

An opponent of the 1920 Republican presidential candidate, Warren G. Harding, Chancellor gained notoriety when he allegedly wrote a study of Harding's ancestry just prior to the election, asserting that Harding had an African-American ancestor. Chancellor denied authorship, and it has never been proved. Two years later, a biography of Harding was published under Chancellor's name, but Chancellor denied authorship of that as well.  Biography  William Estabrook Chancellor was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1867. After graduating in 1889 from Amherst College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, editor of the college newspaper and class orator, he went into teaching. In 1906, while serving as superintendent of schools of Paterson, New Jersey, he was appointed superintendent of schools in Washington, D.C. He also served as superintendent of schools in Bloomfield, New Jersey; and Norwalk, Connecticut. He wrote prolifically, publishing around 40 books and hundreds of articles between 1904 and 1920. He married into the family of Harriet Beecher Stowe. He was a Democrat. From 1914 to 1920, he was a professor of economics, politics, and social science at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. In 1920, Chancellor, a student of the American presidency who had authored Our presidents and their Office, helped gather biographical information on Republican presidential candidate Warren G. Harding. His investigations included Harding's racial lineage. Chancellor concluded that Harding had some black ancestry. A firestorm erupted around Professor Chancellor when some pamphlets were published about Harding's ancestry, which Chancellor was accused of writing even though he denied it. The scandal cost him his professorship at the College of Wooster, and, subjected to continuing harassment, he fled to Canada in 1921. In 1927 Chancellor was hired by the Xavier University, in Cincinnati, where he taught until his retirement. Chancellor continued to teach, lecture, and publish for the remainder of his life. He died in Wooster in 1963, aged 95.  Research on Harding  Chancellor's research of Harding's lineage was based on affidavits provided by aged Crawford County, Ohio, residents asserting that Harding was of mixed race. Chancellor's research indicated that Harding had a great-grandmother, Elizabeth Madison, who was black. The affidavits by elderly residents in Galion, Ohio, served as the basis for a book later attributed to Chancellor. There was no birth record for Harding, who was born in 1865 near Corsica (now Blooming Grove), Ohio; Ohio did not mandate the recording of births until 1867. Further, there were no court records, deeds, or other legal documents that could prove whether Harding was of mixed race. U.S. Census records prior to 1850 did not provide a complete enumeration by name and race of all people in a household. Instead, 1840 and earlier census records only listed the name of the head of household and counted by \\"hash-mark\\" the age-group and sex of other persons living with that head of household. Chancellor allegedly wrote two pamphlets about Harding's racial lineage prior to the 1920 presidential election, unleashing a major scandal by asserting that Harding was of mixed- race descent. Chancellor denied writing the pamphlets, but he refused to sign a statement saying that he believed Harding to be all white, because he considered that to be a lie. Four days before the election, the college dismissed him from his professorship. Copies of the pamphlets were confiscated by Federal agents and destroyed; only five are thought to be in existence, three of which are owned by rare book collectors, the other two owned by museums. After Harding was elected president, Chancellor did additional research, with the aim of publishing a biography of Harding. The book was to include not only Chancellor's findings about Harding's lineage, but also extended to corruption in the nominating process, and, later, in the formation of Harding's administration. He singled out oil companies in particular. Many of Chancellor's allegations of corruption were later borne out by the Teapot Dome scandal. Early in 1921, Harding learned of Chancellor's planned book and sent Federal agents to destroy the manuscript. Federal agents also monitored Chancellor. Facing ongoing harassment and unable to do research or find another teaching position, he went to Canada in 1921, where he remained until 1922. In the spring of 1922, Chancellor was in Dayton, Ohio (his hometown as well as that of 1920 Democratic Presidential candidate and prominent newspaper publisher James Cox) long enough allegedly to publish a biography of Warren Harding. The author of the book, which was titled Warren Gamaliel Harding, President of the United States, is listed as William Estabrook Chancellor. In the book, the race rumors are developed at great length. Some additional research was also included, such as the first notice of Harding's poor cardiovascular health. (Harding died of cardiovascular disease in 1923, before completing his term in office.) Chancellor gave several interviews to journalists during subsequent years in which he denied writing either the book or the pamphlets. He never suggested who might have been responsible. Research by Ohio author John A. Murphy, published in 2000 under the title \\"The Indictment\\" led Murphy to conclude that, although some of Chancellor's research was included in the 1922 biography, Chancellor himself did not write the book, nor did he publish anything on Harding's background. It appeared that Chancellor was falsely accused with its publication. After the 1922 biography of Harding was published, a statewide organization sold the book door-to-door during the midterm election year. Based on details within John A. Murphy's book and other existing bibliographical materials, the electronic/audio book entitled \\"The Chancellor Affair: The FBI File: The True Story about How President Warren G. Harding Abused Power in the White House and Silenced His Most Vocal Critic\\" was published in 2017 on Amazon. The book told the complete account of the Chancellor affair, and included a detailed family perspective as its author was a family descendant of Chancellor.  Evaluation  In 2015, press reports indicated that DNA analysis showed Harding had no recent black ancestors. According to Harding biographer John W. Dean, Chancellor's analyses were partly based on a story spread by Amos Kling, Harding's father-in-law, who opposed him politically. Dean, who lived in Marion, Ohio, as a teenager, claimed that Kling spread the story as retribution for positions taken by Harding in his newspaper The Marion Star. Dean characterized Chancellor as racist. Following Chancellor's death, the author Francis Russell attempted to determine whether Harding was of mixed race. His book, The Shadow of Blooming Grove, published in 1968, noted that he was unable to substantiate Chancellor's conclusions beyond circumstantial evidence. Further discussion of Chancellor's research appears in the book The Strange Deaths of President Harding by Robert H. Ferrell, published in 1996. (This work should not be confused with the 1930 book by Gaston Means, The Strange Death of President Harding, which uses the singular \\"Death\\"). Russell wrote, \\"To anyone who tracks it down today, [the book attributed to Chancellor] comes across as a laughable partisan screed, an amalgam of bizarre racial theories, outlandish stereotypes and cheap political insults. But it also contains a remarkable trove of social knowledge—the kind of community gossip and oral tradition that rarely appears in official records but often provides clues to richer truths.\\"  Selected publications  *The United States: A History of Three Centuries, 1607–1904 (1905) with Fletcher Willis Hewes *Our City Schools, Their Direction and Management (1908) *Class-teaching and Management (1910) *Our Presidents and their Office (1912) *A Life of Silas Wright 1795–1847 (1913) *Our Schools: Their Administration and Supervision (1915) *Educational Sociology (1919) *The Health of the Teacher (1919) *History and Government of the United States, for Evening Schools (1912, first edition 1905)  Further reading  * John W.

He was the second Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces and Deputy Prime Minister from 1977 to 1981. Biography The Israeli delegation to the 1949 Armistice Agreements talks. Left to right: Commanders Yehoshafat Harkabi, Aryeh Simon, Yigael Yadin, and Yitzhak Rabin (1949) IDF Chief of Staff Yigael Yadin presenting a decoration to actor Edward G. Robinson (1950) Yigael Sukenik (later Yadin) was born in Ottoman Palestine to archaeologist Eleazar Sukenik and his wife Hasya Sukenik- Feinsold, a teacher and women's rights activist. Military career Yigal Yadin with General Riley, UN Chief of Staff, Middle East Area, Jerusalem He joined the Haganah at age 15, and served in a variety of different capacities. In 1946, he left the Haganah following an argument with its commander Yitzhak Sadeh over the inclusion of a machine gun as part of standard squad equipment. In 1948, shortly before the State of Israel declared its independence, Yadin, interrupted his university studies to return to active service. He served as Israel's Head of Operations during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and was responsible for many of the key decisions made during the course of that war. In June 1948 he threatened to resign during the Generals' Revolt during which he accused Ben-Gurion of attempting \\"to transform the army as a whole into an army of one political party (Mapai)\\".Peri, Yoram (1983) Between Battles and Ballots: Israeli Military in Politics. Cambridge University Press. . p. 55. Yadin was appointed Chief of Staff of the IDF on 9 November 1949, following the resignation of Yaakov Dori, and served in that capacity for three years. He resigned on 7 December 1952, over disagreements with then prime minister and defense minister David Ben-Gurion about cuts to the military budget, which he argued should be at least one third of the national budget.Peri. p. 193. By age thirty-five, he had completed his military career. Archaeology career Upon leaving the military, he devoted himself to research and began his life's work in archaeology. In 1956 he received the Israel Prize in Jewish studies, for his doctoral thesis on the translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. As an archeologist, he excavated some of the most important sites in the region, including the Qumran Caves, Masada, Hazor, Tel Megiddo and caves in Judean Desert where artifacts from Bar Kokhba revolt were found. In 1960 he initiated scholarly archeological exploration of caves south of Ein Gedi, an enterprise approved by Ben-Gurion in which Israel Defense Forces rendered considerable support. He wrote about the expedition and its findings in his 1971 book Bar- Kokhba: The Rediscovery of the Legendary Hero of the Second Jewish Revolt against Rome. Yadin considered the Solomonic Gate at Tel Gezer to be the highpoint of his career. He was sometimes forced to deal with the theft of important artifacts, occasionally by prominent political and military figures. In one instance, where the thefts were commonly attributed to the famous one- eyed general Moshe Dayan, he remarked: \\"I know who did it, and I am not going to say who it is, but if I catch him, I'll poke out his other eye, too.\\" Even as an archaeologist, Yadin never completely abandoned public life. On the eve of the Six-Day War, he served as a military adviser to prime minister Levi Eshkol, and following the Yom Kippur War, he was a member of the Agranat Commission that investigated the actions that led to the war. Political career In 1976 Yadin formed the Democratic Movement for Change, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym Dash, together with Professor Amnon Rubinstein, Shmuel Tamir, Meir Amit, Meir Zorea, and many other prominent public figures. The new party seemed to be an ideal solution for many Israelis who were fed up with alleged corruption in the Labor Alignment (the dominant party in Israel from its founding and up to that time), which included the Yadlin affair, the suicide of Housing Minister Avraham Ofer, and Leah Rabin's illegal dollar- denominated account in the United States. Furthermore, Dash was a response to the increasing sense of frustration and despair in the aftermath of the 1973 war, and the social and political developments that followed in its wake. Many people regarded Yadin, a warrior and a scholar, as the quintessential prototype of the ideal Israeli, untainted by corruption, who could lead the country on a new path. In the 1977 elections, which transformed the Israeli political landscape, the new party did remarkably well for its first attempt to enter the Knesset, winning 15 of the 120 seats. As a result of the election, Likud party leader Menachem Begin was initially able to form a coalition without Dash (or parties to its left), significantly lowering the bargaining power of Dash. Dash joined the coalition after a few months. As the new Deputy Prime Minister, Yadin played a pivotal role in many events that took place, particularly the contacts with Egypt, which eventually led to the signing of the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty between Israel and its neighbor. Nevertheless, Dash itself proved to be a failure, and the party broke up into numerous splinter factions; Yadin joined the Democratic Movement, but it too split up and he sat as an independent MK for the remainder of his term. During a cabinet meeting, May 1981, while still Deputy Prime Minister, he accused Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan of \\"lying to the government\\" and told Prime Minister Begin \\"You have lost control of the defence establishment.\\"Peri. Page 267. He retired from politics in 1981. Yadin was married to Carmela (née Ruppin), who worked with him throughout his career in translating and editing his books and with whom he had two daughters, Orly and Littal. He died in 1984 and was buried in the military cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The Israeli actor was his brother. Published works * Views of the Biblical World.

XBRL allows the expression of semantic meaning commonly required in business reporting. The language is XML- based and uses the XML syntax and related XML technologies such as XML Schema, XLink, XPath, and Namespaces. One use of XBRL is to define and exchange financial information, such as a financial statement. The XBRL Specification is developed and published by XBRL International, Inc. (XII). XBRL is a standards-based way to communicate and exchange business information between business systems. These communications are defined by metadata set out in taxonomies, which capture the definition of individual reporting concepts as well as the relationships between concepts and other semantic meaning. Information being communicated or exchanged is provided within an XBRL instance. Early users of XBRL included regulators such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS). Common functions in many countries that make use of XBRL include regulators of stock exchanges and securities, banking regulators, business registrars, revenue reporting and tax-filing agencies, and national statistical agencies. A wiki repository of XBRL projects is available to be freely explored and updated. Within the last ten years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United Kingdom's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Singapore's Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), had begun to require companies to use it, and other regulators were following suit.Regulators are serious about universal financial language Financial Times 8-Dec-2010 Development of the SEC's initial US GAAP Taxonomy was led by XBRL US and was accepted and deployed for use by public companies in 2008 in phases, with the largest filers going first: foreign companies which use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are expected to submit their financial returns to the SEC using XBRL once the IFRS taxonomy has been accepted by the SEC. In the UK in 2011, both HMRC and Companies House accepted XBRL in the iXBRL format. XBRL was adopted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) of India for filing financial and costing information with the Central Government.  Specification  The current version of the base XBRL specification is 2.1, with errata corrections. The current version of the Inline XBRL specification is 1.1 Conformance suites are available to test processors of XBRL and Inline XBRL documents.  XBRL document structure  In typical usage, XBRL consists of an XBRL instance, containing primarily the business facts being reported, and a collection of taxonomies (called a Discoverable Taxonomy Set (DTS)), which define metadata about these facts, such as what the facts mean and how they relate to one another. XBRL uses XML Schema, XLink, and XPointer standards. = XBRL Instance = The XBRL instance begins with the <xbrl> root element. There may be more than one XBRL instance embedded in a larger XML document. Xbrl Instance is also known as XBRL file. The XBRL instance itself holds the following information: * Business Facts – facts can be divided into two categories ** Items are facts holding a single value. They are represented by a single XML element with the value as its content. ** Tuples are facts holding multiple values. They are represented by a single XML element containing nested Items or Tuples. In the design of XBRL, all Item facts must be assigned a context. * Contexts define the entity, e.g., company or individual, to which the fact applies, the period of time the fact is relevant, and an optional scenario. Date and time information appearing in the period element must conform to ISO 8601. Scenarios provide further contextual information about the facts, such as whether the business values reported are actual, projected, or budgeted. * Units define the units used by numeric or fractional facts within the document, such as USD, shares. XBRL allows more complex units to be defined if necessary. Facts of a monetary nature must use a unit from the ISO 4217 namespace. * Footnotes use XLink to associate one or more facts with some content. * References to XBRL taxonomies, typically through schema references. It is also possible to link directly to a linkbase. This is an example of a fictitious Dutch company's International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) statement instance file : 38679000000 35996000000 870000000 ... 10430000000 ACME 2004-01-01 ACME 2004-12-31 ACME 2004-01-01 2004-12-31 iso4217:EUR = XBRL Taxonomy = An XBRL Taxonomy is a collection of taxonomy schemas and linkbases. A taxonomy schema is an XML schema document (file). Linkbases are XML documents (file) which follow the XLink specification. The schema must ultimately extend the XBRL instance schema document and typically extend other published XBRL schemas on the xbrl.org website. * Taxonomy schemas define Item and Tuple \\"concepts\\" using elements. Concepts provide names for the fact and indicate whether or not it is a tuple or an item, the data type (such as monetary, numeric, fractional, or textual), and potentially more metadata. Items and Tuples can be regarded as \\"implementations\\" of concepts, or specific instances of a concept. A good analogy for those familiar with object oriented programming would be that Concepts are the classes and Items and Tuples are Object instances of those classes. This is the source of the use of the \\"XBRL instance\\" terminology. In addition to defining concepts, taxonomy schemas reference linkbase documents. Tuples instances are 1..n relationships with their parents; their metadata is simply the collection of their attributes. * Linkbases are a collection of Links, which themselves are a collection of locators, arcs, and potentially resources. Locators are elements that essentially reference a concept and provide an arbitrary label for it. In turn, arcs are elements indicating that a concept links to another concept by referencing the labels defined by the locators. Some arcs link concepts to other concepts. Other arcs link concepts to resources, the most common of which are human-readable labels for the concepts. The XBRL 2.1 specification defines five different kinds of linkbases. ** Label Linkbase ** Reference Linkbase ** Calculation Linkbase ** Definition Linkbase ** Presentation Linkbase Label Linkbase This linkbase provides human readable strings for concepts. Using the label linkbase, multiple languages can be supported, as well as multiple strings within each language. XBRL aims to become a worldwide standard for electronic business reporting. This requires taxonomies to present business data in many different languages. Therefore, it is important to be able to create an element that is assigned with labels for different languages. There may also be different labels for different purposes. All labels are stored and linked to the elements in a label linkbase. Elements defined in a schema are built to convey accounting meaning to computers. In order to make it easier for computers to process their names, they have to obey some rules. For example, the use of spaces is not allowed so 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' would be named 'CashAndCashEquivalents' . Additionally, big taxonomies such as IFRS obey specific rules of naming and labelling to ensure consistency within the schema. For example, there could be a list of words that are excluded from the names, e.g., :and:, \\"of\\" ..., or words that appear only in a particular order (i.e., 'Net' or 'Total' at the end of the label after a comma). In the label linkbase, elements are connected to human readable labels using \\"concept-label\\" arcrole. As mentioned above, elements can be assigned to labels in different languages. An example that describes definitions of labels of the IFRS element AssetsTotal in English, German and Polish is provided below. Assets, Total Vermögenswerte, Gesamt Aktywa, Razem To distinguish between languages, XBRL uses the XML attribute lang. Taxonomy creators may also define different labels for one element. One of the ideas of XBRL is that the information about the period and currency for which the element is reported is not contained within an element definition but is described by a context in instance documents. In financial reporting on the other hand, many terms express the date for which they are being reported, for instance Property, Plant and Equipment at the beginning of year and Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of year. XBRL allows the creation of different labels depending on the context in which an element will be used. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, Plant and Equipment, Net, Beginning Balance Property, Plant and Equipment, Net, Ending Balance The example above shows how three different labels are assigned to one element by applying different role attributes on labels. Reference Linkbase This linkbase associates concepts with citations of some body of authoritative literature. Financial concepts appearing on business reports more often than not stem from regulatory documents issued by authorities. For example, the IFRS Taxonomy describes financial reports prepared based on IFRSs (Bound Volume). Elements defined by this taxonomy refer to the specific terms and concepts explained in the standards. For this reason, a taxonomy is often provided with a reference linkbase that presents relationships between elements and external regulations or standards (the other solution is to enclose documentation in label linkbase). This helps instance creators and users understand the intended meaning of each element and provides support for its inclusion in the taxonomy. The reference layer does not contain the full text of the regulations. Instead, it points to source documents by identifying their name and indicating the relevant paragraphs and clauses. This connection is created using \\"concept-reference\\" arcrole. There are several types of references that could be provided for each element. IAS 7 14 IAS 7 18 a The example above indicates references for Cash Flow from (Used in) Operations. First, it provides a reference to a document which explains how and where the element should be presented in terms of its placement and labeling. In IAS 7, paragraph 14 we read that the concept Cash Flows from Operating Activities exists and what it is derived from. Second, the measurement reference provides explanations about what determines the value of the element and how it should be calculated. This description can be found in IAS 7 paragraph 18.a. XBRL also allows an element to be assigned other types of references containing examples, commentaries, etc. Calculation Linkbase This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts so that values appearing in an instance document may be checked for consistency. The idea of the calculation linkbase is to improve the quality of an XBRL report. It contains definitions of basic validation rules, which apply to all instance documents referring to a particular taxonomy. A hierarchical calculation linkbase sorts all monetary elements in this way so that lower level elements sum up to or are subtracted from one another so that the upper level concept is the result of these operations. The sign of the relationship depends on the weight attribute that is assigned to the arc connecting two elements. An example is provided below. The example shows that there are defined two calculation arcs providing details concerning relations between Gross profit, Revenue and Cost of Sales. In Income Statements, Gross profit is the difference between the other two. Therefore, we assign weight attribute value to \\"1\\" on the arc connecting Gross profit and Revenue and \\"-1\\" between Gross profit and Cost of Sales. The reason why there is a difference between calculation and presentation linkbases, is that the total element that stands for the summation of all others usually appears at the bottom in the financial statements whereas in the calculation linkbase it must be placed as the top concept. Presentation Calculation Assets (Presentation) Assets, Total Assets, Non-Current Assets, Non-Current +1 Assets, Current Assets, Current +1 Assets, Total There are two major rules concerning calculation relations in XBRL. Firstly, we cannot carry out operations on elements that have different values of the periodType attribute. This is often called the cross-context rule and relates to defining some elements as \\"For period\\" (duration) and others as \\"As of date\\" (instant). For example, concepts that appear on the Balance Sheet are instant: which means that their value is presented for a specified day, while elements in the Income Statement or Statement of Cash Flows are duration: because they represent actions that took place over a period of time. The problem emerges for example in the Statement of Changes in Equity or Movements in Property, Plant and Equipment where instant elements mix with duration. The solution to this problem is a formula linkbase that will provide taxonomy creators with many more functions than just simple addition or subtraction. Secondly, the double entry accounting rule requires XBRL taxonomy creators to define the credit/debit nature of monetary elements appearing in the Balance Sheets and Income Statements. This rule does not only disallow the addition of elements with opposite balance attributes—they must be subtracted—it also defines whether the numerical value contained within an element should be positive or negative. Definition Linkbase This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts using a variety of arc roles to express relations such as is-a, whole-part, etc. Arc roles can be created by those who create XBRL taxonomies or commonly used arc roles can be added to the XBRL Link Role Registry (LRR). The definition linkbase provides taxonomy creators with the opportunity to define different kinds of relations between elements. There are four standard types of relationships supported by the definition linkbase. The first one is referred to as general-special. It distinguishes between concepts that have more generic or more specific meaning. For example, ZIP code is the US representation of Postal Code which is used worldwide. Therefore, to indicate that connection, taxonomy creators define Postal Code as a general term to which there is more specialised concept ZIP code. Second available relation type is essence-alias. By using it, taxonomy creators are able to indicate that two concepts have similar meaning. For example, some airlines may want to use the term Planes to describe their main component of their PPE while other would prefer Aircraft. To state that meaning of these two is the same and that they can be used interchangeably, taxonomy creators may connect them using \\"essence-alias\\" arcrole. The third standard type of relation is called requires-element. As its name indicates, taxonomy builders use it to force instance creators to enter the value of one element, if they provide the content of another. For instance, a regulator may want to require disclosures on a particular component of Assets if it appears on the Balance Sheet. In order to achieve that, the definition linkbase defines \\"requires-element\\" relationship between them (for example, Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and Property, Plant and Equipment Disclosures). The fourth relation is similar- tuples. It resembles \\"essence-alias\\" relation but is applied for tuples. It connects two tuples that are equivalents in terms of definition (documentation from label linkbase or reference in reference linkbase) but are diverse from XML perspective i.e., do not have identical content models, for example contain different elements. One of the reasons that this type of relation was introduced is the prohibition of schema redefinition which prevents changes in a tuple's content model. Presentation Linkbase This linkbase associates concepts with other concepts so that the resulting relations can guide the creation of a user interface, rendering, or visualization. Business reports are in general prepared in the form of tables or statements or other structures. The presentation linkbase stores information about relationships between elements in order to properly organize the taxonomy content. This allows the elements to be arranged in a structure that is appropriate to represent the hierarchical relationships in particular business data. These groupings can be performed in many ways. For example, a typical Balance Sheet contains Assets, Equity and Liabilities. Assets consist of Current Assets and Non-current Assets. Current Assets are split in Inventories, Receivables and so on. The presentation linkbase, using parent-child relations organizes elements in this way and helps users find concepts they are interested in. The main drawback of a tree-like (hierarchical) structure in a presentation linkbase is that it only allows the presentation of flat lists of elements, while financial statements also contain more sophisticated reports such as Changes in Equity or Movements in Property, Plant and Equipment . The XBRL Consortium is currently working on rendering solutions that would provide for the automatic creation of such reports. This is the taxonomy schema of the above shown instance file: XBRL's Global Ledger Framework (XBRL GL) is the only set of taxonomies that is developed and recommended by XBRL International.  XBRL modules  XBRL International has issued and reissued a stability pledge in relation to the core XBRL 2.1 specification. In addition to the core XBRL 2.1 specification, work continues on the development of XBRL modules that define new, compatible functionality. * XBRL Dimensions – This module has achieved Recommendation status in 2005. A new edition of the Dimensions 1.0 Specification with errata corrections was issued on 7 September 2009. The Dimension 1.0 Specification is an optional extension to the XBRL 2.1 Specification that enriches the rules and procedures for constructing dimensional taxonomies and instance documents. It supports the use of XBRL taxonomy linkbases to define additional, structured contextual information for business facts. Each piece of contextual information is referred to as a \\"dimension.\\" The base XBRL specification essentially defines three dimensions: reporting period, reporting entity (i.e.; a company or a division thereof), and a loosely defined reporting scenario, originally intended to distinguish between actual vs. projected facts. Taxonomies using XBRL Dimensions can define new dimensions, specify the valid values (\\"domains\\") for dimensions, designate which dimensions apply to which business concepts through mechanisms called \\"hypercubes\\", and relate other taxonomy metadata (labels, presentation information, etc.) to dimensions. * XBRL Formula – This module achieved Recommendation status 22 June 2009. The Formula Specification 1.0 supports the creation of expressions (using XPath) that can be applied to XBRL instances to validate its information or to calculate new XBRL facts in a new instance. To see how formula components interrelate, click Interactive diagram of related Formula specifications * Inline XBRL (or iXBRL) – This module achieved Recommendation status 20 April 2010. The Inline XBRL Specification defines how XBRL metadata can be embedded within well-formed HTML or XHTML documents, so that data and associated rendering information can be encapsulated within a single document. * XBRL Versioning – This module achieved Recommendation status 27 February 2013. This specification enables creation of Versioning Report which can be used by the authors of XBRL taxonomies to provide documentation of the changes between two taxonomies. Many large taxonomies (such as the IFRS taxonomy) change every year. * XBRL Table Linkbase – This module allows taxonomy authors to define tabular reporting templates. The Table Linkbase can be used for presentation of XBRL data, and also for data entry, by allowing software to present a template for completion by the user. The Table Linkbase is well-suited to handling large, highly-dimensional reporting templates such as those used for Solvency II reporting to EIOPA, and COREP and FINREP reporting to the EBA.  Extensibility  Besides the creation of additional modules, XBRL International supports several methods for continuing expansion of shared XBRL functionality. * Link Role Registry – This registry, hosted at xbrl.org, collects link roles and arc roles to promote reuse across taxonomies. * Functions Registry – This registry collects XPath functions for reuse in formula linkbases. * Transformation Rules Registry – This registry collects common transforms used to convert human- readable data in Inline XBRL documents (e.g. \\"1st January 2016\\") into the formats required by XBRL (\\"2016-01-01\\").  iXBRL  iXBRL (Inline XBRL) is a development of XBRL in which the XBRL metadata are embedded in an HTML document, e.g., a published report and accounts. It requires the HTML document to be well-formed but does not otherwise specify the required XML format. Typically, iXBRL is implemented within HTML documents, which are displayed or printed by web browsers without revealing the XBRL metadata inside the document. The specification does, however, provide a normative schema which requires that any schema-valid iXBRL document should be in XHTML format. Most iXBRL financial reports are produced in one of two ways: # The system which creates the report formats it directly in iXBRL. In the UK, where all companies are required to file in iXBRL, the main commercial accounting packages all provide iXBRL export of financial reports. # The financial report is produced as a Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel document, and a \\"Tagging Program\\" is used to add the XBRL concept metadata and to export the document as Inline XBRL. With large and complex financial statements, a single iXBRL file may be too large for a web browser to handle. This happens more often when, as in the UK, the company report, which may contain many graphics, is combined with the accounts in a single iXBRL document. The iXBRL specification allows for a set of iXBRL documents to be treated as a single iXBRL document set. In the UK, HM Revenue and Customs requires businesses to submit their report and accounts and tax computations in iXBRL format when making their Corporation Tax return. Businesses and their agents can use HMRC's Online Filing software to prepare their report and accounts and tax computations in iXBRL format or they can prepare the iXBRL files themselves and submit them to HMRC. HMRC's Online Filing software is an example of a program which generates iXBRL from source data. This uses a series of forms in which the key data (which will appear in XBRL tags) are entered in data entry fields. Additional data (the rest of the report and accounts) are entered in text boxes. The program generates the iXBRL report and accounts in a standard sequence of sections and a standard format. All other formatting of material is lost. While the resulting report and accounts meets HMRC's requirements, it is not an attractive document to view or read. iXBRL is mandated for corporate filings by government agencies in Japan, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, Companies House also accepts iXBRL. Although iXBRL is not mandated by Companies House, it makes up the majority of the filings received each year. Since June 2016 the SEC started allowing firms to file using iXBRL in the required HTML filings. In June 2018, the SEC announced plans to move to iXBRL, removing the requirement to file separate HTML and XBRL documents.  History  XBRL's beginning, in 1998, can be traced to the initial efforts of one person, Charles Hoffman, a Certified Public Accountant from Tacoma, Washington. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) was also instrumental in pulling together what eventually became XBRL International. The specification went through several versions prior to XBRL v2.1 which was published in 2003. * 1.0 – Published in July 2000, this version was based on DTDs. It expressed the difference between data exchange in instance documents and metadata exchange in taxonomy documents. Taxonomies were expressed as XML Schema files, but these were not used for instance validation. * 2.0 – This version introduced use of XML Schema substitution groups as a way of allowing schema validation of instances. Concept relations were broken out into separate XLink-based linkbases. Context data in the instance was collected into a separate element. * 2.1 – Published December 31, 2003, this version tightened the definition of terms significantly, allowing for the introduction of a conformance suite. XBRL v2.1 has remained stable since publication, and has been updated only for errata corrections. The standard has evolved significantly through the development of additional XBRL modules. Details of all versions of the specification and associated modules can be found on the XBRL Specification Subsite.  Lack of accuracy  In April 2009 a study of the North Carolina State University Department of Accounting College of Management evaluated the accuracy of XBRL filings for 22 companies participating in the SEC's voluntary filing program in 2006. Results of a comparison of XBRL filings to Forms 10-K revealed multiple errors in signage, amounts, labeling, and classification. The study considers that these errors are serious, since XBRL data are computer-readable and users will not visually recognize the errors, especially when using XBRL analysis software. A different conclusion was reached by Du et al., 2013 who argued that companies are going through a learning curve and are steadily improving. In December 2017, Charlie Hoffman stated that there is a 10.2% chance that an XBRL-based public company financial report has errors in its primary financial statements. Hoffman predicts that per the current number of errors and the pace errors are being corrected, within about five years the information quality of XBRL-based public company financial reports will be very good.  Impact of XBRL  An evaluation by Debreceny, Roger S., et al. 2005, of the impact of Financial Reporting in XBRL on the SEC's EDGAR System. A tool for converting the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows into XBRL‐tagged format. Corporate governance is significantly and positively associated with a firm's decision to be an early and voluntary filer of financial information in XBRL format. = Impact on financial reporting in the European Union = On 18 December 2017 European Securities and Markets Authority published the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) setting out the new European Single Electronic Format (ESEF). Under the draft regulation, starting in 2020, financial reports containing IFRS consolidated financial statements shall be labelled with XBRL tags.

Very heavy machine gun fire followed immediately, the Captain being killed and the boat thrown off course. A British aircraft saw the problem, dived on the searchlight and put it out with gunfire. Lieutenant Steele took the wheel and steadied the boat, lifting the dead officer away from the steering and firing position, and successfully torpedoed the battleship Andrei Pervozvanny at 100 yards range. He then manoeuvred the CMB in a very confined space to get a clear shot at the other battleship Petropavlovsk before making for the safety of the bay.

He worked mainly as a stage actor, with only a limited number of screen appearances. He was also a comedian, with a 'glaikit' (Scots word for naïve or clueless) mannerism. Life and career He was born at 118 Kirkland Street, Maryhill, Glasgow, the fourth of the six children of James MacRae, a sergeant in the Glasgow police force, and his wife, Catherine Graham. He attended Allan Glen's School and matriculated in the engineering faculty at Glasgow University in 1923–24, but did not graduate. He first made his name as a comic actor of distinction with Curtain Theatre in 1937, in the title role of Robert McLellan's Jamie the Saxt, a performance which became his \\"signature\\" role in the early years. He was then a member, along with Stanley Baxter, of the early Citizens' Theatre company in Glasgow, founded during the war in 1943. He had a role in the 1949 Ealing comedy Whisky Galore!, based on the book by Sir Compton Mackenzie, and, in the first TV series adapted from stories about Para Handy - Master Mariner, Neil Munro's masterpiece of west coast \\"high jinks\\", MacRae played the eponymous Captain. He had a home in Millport on the island of Cumbrae. In 1953 he starred alongside Jean Anderson in the role of James MacKenzie, an embittered settler in the drama The Kidnappers. One of the film's most memorable moments comes with the horror on Duncan MacRae’s face at what his grandchild must have thought of him when the little boy implores \\"Don't eat the babbie\\". During the 1960s he appeared in episodes of the cult TV series The Avengers and The Prisoner, and as Inspector Mathis in the Bond spoof Casino Royale. MacRae became a mainstay of television Hogmanay celebrations in the 1950s and 1960s with a rendition of his song (in Glaswegian Scots), \\"The Wee Cock Sparra\\". MacRae died in March 1967, in Glasgow, before the release of several screen appearances: in the films Casino Royale, and 30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia, and in the television series The Wednesday Play and The Prisoner.

The film stars Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei and Ellen Barkin. Plot The film starts with a voice-over of Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) over the images of a scientific experiment with a bull and a herd of cows, apparently the bull never mounts a cow twice, not even if her scent is changed. He prefers a new cow. Jane says that until recently, she believed that men are all like the bull, but to understand what happened we have to go back in time. Jane is a production assistant with a talk show that has recently been syndicated, which means that the host Diane Roberts (Ellen Barkin) who wants to be the best, is always looking for the ungettable guests, like Fidel Castro. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the producer of the talk show and is a womanizer, much to the dismay of Jane who comments on his actions with amicable critique. Eddie is looking for a roommate, but his messages on the bulletin board are sabotaged by disgruntled exes. He wonders whether Jane would like to move in, but she turns him down with a vengeance. Then they meet the new producer of the show, Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear), and Jane is immediately smitten. She tells her friend Liz (Marisa Tomei) and discusses her bad luck with men. Meanwhile, her sister is trying to get pregnant with a fertility program. Ray calls Jane and they spend an evening together and end up kissing. The next morning she calls Liz and is ecstatic. Liz gives her some advice as to how to deal with Ray and his girlfriend Dee (with whom he has trouble). Ray and Jane seem to be very much in love. The relationship evolves, and they decide to move in together. Jane puts in her notice to the landlord; Ray goes to tell his girlfriend that it is over, but doesn't tell her about the new woman in his life. Ray starts to get distant while Jane is packing to move, and over dinner he breaks it off, leaving Jane in tears. The next morning in the office Jane takes her revenge by announcing to move in with Eddie. She learns to deal with the many women in Eddie's life and the two bond over scotch and leftover food. She reads an article about the old cow syndrome and starts researching for her theory of men. Liz works at a magazine for men and needs a columnist and persuades Jane to write a column about her theory, under the pen name Dr. Marie Charles. The column that deals with the insecurity and dishonesty of men is a big hit. Everybody wants to meet Dr. Charles, so does Diane. At a Christmas party, Ray tells her he misses her and asks her out for New Year's Eve, but he stands her up. When Jane shows up at a party looking for Eddie at midnight, she can't find him and leaves in tears. Eddie spots her in the crowded room and tries to go after her but can't find her. Back at the office, Ray tries to apologize, but Diane interrupts wearing a shirt Jane bought for Ray. Jane realizes she is \\"Dee,\\" and Ray is back with her. A board meeting is going to start and Eddie makes sure Jane isn't crying going in, but Jane is distracted so he covers for her. When Ray shows emotion over a Gérard Depardieu movie, Jane spills her guts over his inability to show empathy for her broken heart. After the meeting Diane, unaware of Jane's relationship with Ray, gives her advice on how to win her boyfriend back, telling her how she got hers back. At a bar, Liz follows Dr. Charles's advice and is not going to fall for the same kind of guy anymore. Jane and Eddie get into an argument over the advice of Dr. Charles. At home she tells him she has to believe the theory because otherwise she is afraid that men don't leave women - they leave her. Eddie comforts her by saying Ray is not the last man she'll ever love, and they fall asleep together. The next morning Eddie wakes up happy and comfortable while Jane freaks out. Eddie tells her not to analyse this too. He is happy that he slept the whole night with her without it leading to sex. She tells Eddie he will show his true colours and will hurt her some time soon. Eddie tells her it is not about him, but it is her attitude that is the problem. Jane gets a call and it is her brother-in-law telling her that her sister suffered a miscarriage. At the hospital she sees the true love between them and decides to tell Diane that Dr. Charles is going to be on her show. The interview is meant to be over the telephone, but Jane changes her mind mid-way and goes on the stage. She tells the audience that there is no Dr. Charles (we see Eddie leave at this point) and that the theory is ridiculous because she was hurt and needed to blame men for her pain. By this time Eddie is long gone. Jane goes after Eddie and tells him she found new love. He doesn't answer but kisses her with passion, with the dulcet tones of Van Morrison's \\"Someone like You\\" playing in the background.

Glamorama is set in and satirizes the 1990s, specifically celebrity culture and consumerism. Time describes the novel as \\"a screed against models and celebrity.\\" Development Ellis wanted to write a Stephen King-style ghost story novel, which would eventually become Lunar Park; finding it difficult at the time, he began work on the other novel which he had in mind. This was a Robert Ludlum-style thriller, with the intention of using one of his own vapid characters who lack insight as the narrator. Ellis composed the book between December 1989 and December 1997. Literary devices, plot, and themes The novel is a satire of modern celebrity culture; this is reflected in its premise, which features models-turned-terrorists. A character remarks, \\"basically, everyone was a sociopath ... and all the girls' hair was chignoned.\\" The novel plays upon the conspiracy thriller conceit of someone \\"behind all the awful events\\", to dramatize the revelation of a world of random horror. The lack of resolution contributes to Ellis' artistic effect. The obsession with beauty is reflected in consistent namedropping; this satirizes (the main character) Victor's obsession with looks, and perhaps is indicative of the author's own attraction to glamor. Ellis drops names in Glamorama so often that Entertainment Weekly describes \\"Nary a sentence ... escapes without a cameo from someone famous, quasi-famous, or formerly famous. In fact, in some sentences, Ellis cuts out those pesky nouns and verbs and simply lists celebrities.\\" Namedropping and commoditization have a depersonalizing effect (a world reduced to \\"sheen and brands\\"); as the reviewer for The Harvard Crimson observes, \\"When Victor undergoes a transformation to a law student, we know he is different because he now wears a Brooks Brothers suit and drinks Diet Coke. London and Paris become nothing more than a different collection of recognizable proper nouns (Notting Hill and Irvine Welsh in the first case; Chez Georges and Yves Saint Laurent in the second).\\" A writer for the New York Times observes \\"much of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of his characters' clothes and accouterments ... out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity\\". In speech, his writing demonstrates the ways in which his characters, too, have internalized the language of consumerist advertising and marketing. According to the Lakeland Ledger, Glamorama is something of a Through the Looking-Glass allegory and a cautionary tale navigating the perils of dissolving identity. In parody of how people now think in modern terms, Ellis \\"annoying[ly]\\" lists \\"the songs that are playing in the background, or even quoting them, as he does with Oasis' \\"Champagne Supernova\\"; in effect, the novel is provided with a movie soundtrack. As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. \\"PhotoSoap for Windows 95\\") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes hard to tell what is real in the 'modern' world. As such, \\"meaningful identity is obliterated\\"; this furthers the recurring joke from American Psycho wherein \\"characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences\\". The book prominently features a conceit wherein Victor's life is being filmed by a camera crew \\"introduced a third of the way into the book\\". As well as a postmodern device to examine the questionable \\"reality\\" of the situation, it also functions as a \\"tidy commentary\\" on the advent of mass surveillance in the 1990s. EW interprets the scene to mean \\"Modern life has become a movie (a point made more cogently by Neal Gabler's new book, Life the Movie).\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette took the same meaning from the conceit, and described it as a \\"not-so-deep observation\\" that \\"has no real pay-off\\". The New York Times felt it was a \\"halfhearted narrative device ... suggesting that the novel's action is actually part of a film that's being made.\\" The reviewer felt that allusions to \\"\\"the director\\" or to the fact that this or that scene is a \\"flashback\\"\\" was used to retroactively suggest cohesion in the novel's plot. \\"As much as celebrity itself, our collective celebrity worship becomes the real target of Ellis' satire\\", writes the Star Tribune. Models in the novel act as a synecdoche of the larger culture. Reviewer Eric Hanson writes, \\"Their [models'] selfishness and brutality, he implies, are simply an extreme manifestation of what consumer culture encourages in everyone.\\" Victor's own pursuit of being cool or too hip \\"destroys him\\". A CNN reviewer gives the example of Victor not wanting to explain his impersonator, \\"because the places he was seen were always hot spots he should have frequented.\\" Characters Victor Ward is the novel's lead character, who had previously appeared as Victor Johnson in The Rules of Attraction (1987). In Glamorama, now an \\"A-list model, would-be-actor and current \\"It boy\\", \\"an uberstereotype of the male model\\", Victor lives by his catchphrase mantra \\"the better you look, the more you see\\". As Harvard Crimson observes, \\"His lifestyle is the extreme of everything the current culture worships: he can't avoid thinking in brand names and image and speaks with lines from pop songs.\\" Uncharacteristic for an Ellis protagonist, as the Crimson notes, Victor is \\"terrified by\\" the \\"coldbloodedness\\" he encounters when he becomes embroiled in international terrorism. As an unintelligent narrator, Victor (through his inability to comprehend his situation), underlines how \\"the world of celebrity in Glamorama is inescapable\\". Compared to other Ellis protagonists, Victor is less \\"sensitive and insightful\\" than Less Than Zero's Clay, neither the \\"preening psychopath\\" that is American Psycho's Patrick Bateman\\", he is nevertheless an \\"[un]sympathetic protagonist (in his own way, he's as morally bankrupt as ... Patrick Bateman).\\" As narrator, \\"Victor's perceptions\\" sum up \\"[the glamor world's] disconnection from what the rest of us consider \\"real life\\"... [where] Everything he sees is a brand name.\\" CNN speculates when Victor begins speaking to the novel's \\"film crew\\" (one of its literary devices), that this could mean that the character is schizophrenic. Victor comes across \\"oddly homophobic for a member of the pansexual New York fashion scene\\"; when his gay assistant accuses \\"I know for a fact you've had sex with guys in the past\\", he retorts that he did \\"the whole hip bi thing for about three hours back in college\\". The mysterious F. Fred Palakon first appears a quarter of the way into the novel, when he offers to pay Victor $300,000 to track down his former Camden classmate Jamie Fields, a double-agent working in the terrorist organisation with which Victor becomes involved. It is never clarified exactly which political organisation Palakon appears to be working for; he even appears alongside Senator Johnson, Victor's father, a United States Senator with ambitions to become President. Of Palakon, 'the director' says \\"We've been through this a hundred times ... There is no Palakon. I've never heard that name.Glamorama, p.470 Victor's girlfriend Chloe Byrnes is a supermodel and a recovering drug addict. Alison Poole, the main character from Jay McInerney's 1988 novel Story of My Life, appears, having also previously appeared in American Psycho in 1992. In Glamorama, Alison is \\"[Victor's] boss's girlfriend (another supermodel)\\", \\"here playing Lewinsky\\". Bobby Hughes is a successful male model and the leader of his international terrorist group. Victor engages in a bisexual threesome with him and with Jamie Fields.Glamorama, pp.334–340. Lauren Hynde from The Rules of Attraction also reappears, having become a successful actress with ties to Hughes' terrorist organisation; other Rules characters appear (e.g., in flashback) such as Bertrand, who is now a terrorist also.  Adaptations  In 1999, the contemporary Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a composition for chamber ensemble entitled Glamorama Spies, which was inspired by the novel. Glitterati is a 2004 film directed by Roger Avary assembled from the 70 hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of The Rules of Attraction. It expands upon the minimally detailed and rapidly recapped story told by Victor Ward, portrayed by Kip Pardue, upon his return to the United States after having travelled extensively around Europe. In regard to expanding upon those events, the film acts as a connecting bridge between The Rules of Attraction and the upcoming film adaptation set to be directed by Avary. Avary has called Glitterati a \\"pencil sketch of what will ultimately be the oil painting of Glamorama.\\" In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of Glamorama, narrated by Jonathan Davis, as part of its Modern Vanguard line of audiobooks. In 2010, when a film adaptation of Glamorama was mentioned in an interview with Movieline.com, Bret Easton Ellis commented, \\"I think the days of being able to make that movie are over.\\" From the same interview, Ellis mentioned that an idea for a mini-series adaptation was brought forth to HBO though it was ultimately declined and further stating the movie would be left in Roger Avary's hands if one was to be made. On October 13, 2011, Bret Easton Ellis reported on Twitter the following: =Zoolander controversy= Fans have noted similarities to the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander. Ellis stated that he is aware of the similarities, and went on to say that he considered and attempted to take legal action. Ellis was asked about the similarities in a 2005 BBC interview. In the response to the question, he said that he is unable to discuss the similarities due to an out- of-court settlement. Reception Much criticism of the novel noted its length. Time's Joel Stein noted \\"The idea—models so solipsistic that they become terrorists—is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages, but it's unsustainable at 482.\\" He describes the book's first 185 pages as \\"inanely repetitive\\". Entertainment Weekly opines \\"It's like reading Page Six of the New York Post, but for 482 pages.\\" One reviewer found the opening scenes \\"funny enough\\" although noted that it \\"gets tired easily\\". Contrarily, the Star Tribune felt \\"the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller- style second half is less successful.\\" In fact, the humour in the novel was praised by multiple critics. The Star Tribune notes Victor's lack of depth, malapropisms, overuse of the word \\"baby\\" and the novel's \\"enchantingly disaffected monotone\\" of \\"a been-there-done-that Valleyspeak\\". Hanson felt that the horror elements in the \\"labyrinthian\\" thriller section of the novel seemed \\"recycled from American Psycho.\\" Entertainment Weekly also state their preference for the \\"first 189 pages\\". Contrarily, the New York Times felt that the book was devoid of fun, where even the blackest satire (e.g. Evelyn Waugh's Loved One) are more humorous. EW places Glamorama within an emerging tradition of celebrity satire, noting \\"the glitterati are the satirical target du jour, what with Woody Allen's limp, oral-sex-filled film Celebrity, and Jay McInerney's clever novel Model Behavior\\" (both 1998). McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel's comparative darkness to his own Model Behaviour (also about 90s nightlife and supermodels), published the same year, saying \\"I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don't go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers\\". (Regarding McInerney's novel, Stein had felt that the novelist's attempt at a zeitgeist novel was one \\"looking at the '90s through an '80s lens\\".) Harvard Crimson noted, similar to McInerney, that \\"Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it\\" but remarks that \\"Fortunately, Ellis does more than that injecting Glamorama with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in about a quarter of the way into the novel.\\" The New York Times question the choice of subject matter as well: \\"Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one- liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?\\" The reviewer furthermore suggested \\"Glamorama is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to criticize.\\" The book's style is summarized by one reviewer as \\"a book that reads like a movie\\", and another notes that Ellis' writing \\"can be sharp\\", and succeeds in creating a \\"creepy sense of dread about our culture\\". On its influence, Time felt that the novel's \\"contribution\\" to the world comes in Victor's catchphrase, which they describe as Tom Wolfean. In an otherwise damning review, the New York Times commented \\"[Ellis] has an uncannily keen eye for the tiny details of the lives of the abel-obsessed yuppies and would-be celebs he's sending up\\". A CNN reviewer felt, upon reading the book, that \\"Bret Easton Ellis is a gifted writer\\"; he praised his \\"unflinching eye\\" in capturing the details of \\"the ensemble worn by a notorious clothes horse, or the grisly aftermath of a hotel bombing, or the graphic details of a menage a trois .\\" The world Ellis evokes, through the eyes of the male model, Harvard Crimson notes is one \\"where no one has any emotions beyond the visceral response, where all the sex scenes are described in purely pornographic terms.\\" A.J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly did not enjoy the book's more \\"meta\\" conceits, and gives the novel a 'C'. Daniel Mendelsohn of the New York Times opines derisively that \\"Like its predecessors, Glamorama is meant to be a withering report on the soul- destroying emptiness of late-century American consumer culture, chichi downtown division; but the only lesson you're likely to take away from it is the even more depressing classic American morality tale about how premature stardom is more of a curse than a blessing for young writers.\\" The CNN reviewer concludes \\"in the end, \\"Glamorama\\" is less than the sum of its parts\\". Ellis himself has claimed that, as of 2018, the novel has failed to break even for its US publisher, Knopf. Notes Further reading * Mandel, Naomi ed.

It was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus The Bachman Books. The story takes place in an unnamed Midwestern city in 1973–1974. Grieving over the death of his son and the disintegration of his marriage, a man is driven to mental instability when he learns that both his home and his workplace will be demolished to make way for an extension to an interstate highway. Andy Muschietti (director of It and It Chapter Two) and Barbara Muschietti will be producers of the film adaptation of Roadwork and Pablo Trapero is hired to directing it. Plot During a man-on-the-street news interview in August 1972, an unnamed man (later identified as Barton George Dawes) gives his angry opinion of a new highway extension project. The narrative then jumps forward to November 1973, with Dawes, seemingly unaware of the underlying motivations of his actions, visiting a gun shop and purchasing two high-powered firearms: a .44 Magnum revolver and a hunting rifle chambered for .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridges. The story gradually reveals that Dawes' son Charlie had died of brain cancer three years earlier, and that Dawes is unable or unwilling to sever his emotional ties to both the industrial laundry where he works and the house in which Charlie grew up. The laundry and his entire neighborhood are to be demolished as part of the project. Dawes resigns his middle management job at the laundry after sabotaging the purchase of its new facility, and his wife Mary leaves him once she learns of both these actions and his failure to find a new house for the couple. Dawes then approaches Salvatore \\"Sal\\" Magliore, the owner of a local used-car dealership with ties to organized crime, in an attempt to obtain explosives. Magliore initially dismisses him as a crackpot, so Dawes assembles a load of Molotov cocktails and uses them to damage the highway construction equipment. He is not caught, but his actions cause only a brief delay in the project. Dawes initially refuses to accept the money being offered by the city for the house under the eminent domain statute, but changes his mind after the city's attorney threatens to publicize his brief tryst with Olivia Brenner, a young hitchhiker who had previously taken shelter at the house. Magliore has Dawes' house checked for listening devices planted by the city and later agrees to sell him a load of explosives. Dawes gives half the money from the house sale to Mary, gives $5,000 to a homeless man in a coffee shop, and has Magliore invest most of the remainder on behalf of Olivia after paying for the explosives. In January 1974, with only hours remaining before he is required to leave the property, Dawes wires the whole house with the explosives and barricades himself inside. When the police arrive to forcibly evict him, he shoots at them, killing no one but forcing them to take cover and attracting the attention of the media. Dawes coerces the police into letting a reporter - the same one who interviewed him in 1972, though neither recognizes the other - enter and speak to him. Once the reporter has left, Dawes tosses his guns out the window and sets off his explosives, destroying the house and killing himself. A short epilogue reveals that the reporter and his team ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the incident and uncovered the truth about the extension project: there was no real reason for it. Unless the city built a certain number of miles of road per year, it would become ineligible for federal funding of interstate construction projects. The city quietly began preparing to sue Mary for her share of the eminent domain payout, but dropped the suit in the wake of public outcry. Author's comments In the introduction to The Bachman Books, King stated: \\"I think it was an effort to make some sense of my mother's painful death the year before - a lingering cancer had taken her off inch by painful inch. Following this death I was left both grieving and shaken by the apparent senselessness of it all... Roadwork tries so hard to be good and find some answers to the conundrum of human pain.\\" King also described his disappointment with the work, and stated that he was of two minds about having it reprinted, but decided to in the end in order to give readers an insight into his personality at the time. In a new introduction to the second edition of The Bachman Books, King stated that he had changed his mind and that Roadwork had become his favorite of the early books.  Connections to other King works  The mangle in the laundromat where Dawes works is nicknamed \\"The Mangler\\", because of \\"what would happen to you if you ever got caught in it.\\" King had previously published a short story called \\"The Mangler\\" (1972), in which a demon-possessed mangle kills workers in an industrial laundry facility. Roadwork relates a story about a .22 caliber, single-shot rifle that Barton Dawes had bought as a boy: In Apt Pupil (1982), Todd Bowden sees an injured blue jay on the ground while cycling; the bird's beak opens and closes slowly.

Etymology The name Ayia Napa is derived from a Venetian-era monastery of the same name, located in the center of the town, next to the square that today is the clubbing centre. The word \\"Ayia\\" means \\"holy\\" in Greek. \\"Napa\\" is archaic and means \\"wooded valley\\" or \\"dell\\". In ancient times the area surrounding the town was covered with thick forest.  Tourism  =Strategy= The city in 2013 under new leadership and management shifted its strategy and decided to improve on quality rather than quantity. The vision of the city according to public statements of mayor Yiannis Karousos is to by 2030 become the best and most cosmopolitan tourist resort of the mediterranean. Beginning in 2013, the resort has implemented a series of actions in fulfilling its vision, upgrades in public infrastructure and the hospitality sector (hotels and restaurants), shutting down problem establishments, and attracted mega projects such as the 220 million euro marina. Additionally, major events and festivals have been added to the calendar, to improve the quality of the resort and promote its cosmopolitan aspects. The vision set by the city is supported by the Cyprus Tourism Strategy, which for 2030 was completed in March 2017, and which sets as a vision for Ayia Napa the following: Ayia Napa should aspire to be regarded as one of Europe’s top three beach and nightclubbing holiday destinations, with a customer value proposition (CVP) offering the best beach and marine experience in Cyprus for young adults, complemented by international standard beach clubs and nightlife. The strategy evaluates the quality of Ayia Napa as 3.4/5 and proposes that its future direction should be an increase in quality in all the areas of the tourism product from accommodation to nightlife having as a goal to increase its quality evaluation to 4.4/5 On 6 March 2018 the city announced a shift on its tourism strategy, having as a main goal turning low quality nightlife into a cosmopolitan nightlife. The city council, after hearing all the stakeholders of the Ayia Napa tourism, voted unanimously against the low quality youth tourist product (organised youth) which typically misbehaves and does not respect the laws of Cyprus and with their actions create negative publicity for the resort and do damage to the reputation of the Ayia Napa brand, which, according to the announcement, the city has worked very hard to reposition and reintroduce in the last years. =2019 Ayia Napa rape allegation case= In late December 2019, a 19-year-old British woman was convicted of making a false rape claim. This case was closely followed by the world media, especially in the UK, with journalists describing it as a miscarriage of justice. In an unusual step, the UK government described the case as \\"very distressing\\". On 17 July 2019, the woman reported that she had been gang raped by twelve young Israeli men while staying at a hotel in Ayia Napa. Following the alleged rape, she had been taken to hospital with severe injuries, with hospital staff contacting the police. The accused men were originally arrested but then released, and the woman was arrested instead. After over seven hours of questioning without a lawyer present, the woman signed a pre-written retraction, and she was charged on 30 July with \\"public mischief\\" for allegedly making a false rape accusation. She was imprisoned while on bail for six weeks, and was then required to remain in Cyprus. She was tried and convicted on 30 December 2019. Following her conviction, there was a call in the UK for visitors to boycott Cyprus because of a perception that its legal system would not only fail to protect victims of rape, but would even punish them. Several commentators suggested that the decisions by Cypriot authorities had been intended to protect Ayia Napa's reputation as a safe tourist venue, but that the decision to prosecute the woman had actually increased Ayia Napa's reputation for sexual violence because of the perception that rapists could act with impunity and rape victims would not be protected. Other articles reported that this aggressive stance against rape victims might be common practice in Ayia Napa. The case had also come to global attention a few months after the Mitsero murders, an incident in which a Cypriot army officer was convicted for the murder of seven females from 2016 to 2018, and Cypriot authorities were still in the midst of being heavily criticised for ignoring the multiple missing person reports filed by the victims' relatives over the span of two years. History According to local legend, the area around the monastery was accidentally discovered by a hunter in pursuit of his prey. Upon discovery, the icon of the Virgin Mary in the area was called Virgin Mary of Napa, eventually shortened to Ayia Napa. The monastery, built in 1100, was built around a cave, in honour of the Virgin Mary of Ayia Napa. According to local tradition, nobody lived within close vicinity of Ayia Napa until 1790. The first inhabitant was Nikolaos Kemitzis from Thessaloniki, who arrived from Greece around 1790 and settled in the village of Panayia, located on the northeastern part of Ayia Napa. Kemitzis had a fight with the Ottoman authorities who ruled Cyprus at the time, and decided to move near the monastery of Ayia Napa.  Government recognition awards and statistics The Government of Cyprus, recognizing the importance of Ayia Napa to Cyprus' economy, decided in 2014 to characterize Ayia Napa as a main city-urban center. This was credited to the efforts of the mayor of Ayia Napa, Yiannis Karousos. Today, Ayia Napa is the largest tourist resort in Cyprus, with a 27,000-person-bed capacity and more than 175 hotels and apartments of all sizes. In 2017, the resort received over 700,000 tourists and accommodated 5 million overnight stays, representing approximately 30% of all Cyprus overnight stays. The city of Ayia Napa has the seventh largest budget of the 30 active municipalities of Cyprus, and employs 280 people. The City was recognized as a Prime City Destination by the Oxford Business Assembly, and was awarded in 2018 the International flag of investment and innovation attractiveness 'Flag of Europe\\" and the International Certificate of Excellence in Investment and Innovation (ICEII). Geography Ayia Napa lies near Cape Greco at the eastern part of Cyprus, south of Famagusta, and forms part of a larger area known as Kokkinochoria (\\"Red Villages\\", a name derived from the vivid red colour of the soil). It is a town of the Famagusta District, in the remaining Greek-controlled southern part of the district, while the northern part has been occupied by Turkish forces since 1974. Ayia Napa is about from Protaras, a town that has seen similar development but still manages to remain low-key and more favourable for families and Cypriot locals.  Beaches The resort has twenty-seven beaches, of which fourteen have been awarded the blue flag award, more than any other resort in Cyprus. In 2018, it was announced that Nissi Beach ranked as third in the list of the most popular beaches on Instagram. A CNN feature ranked Nissi Beach as the best beach to visit for the month of July 2018. In 2011, it came first in the TripAdvisor list of the best beaches in Europe In 2017, Makronissos Beach was chosen by Travel weekly as the third best beach for Cyprus and Greece. Cultural sites and events Nissi Beach =Sites= Ayia Napa Medieval Monastery is the main point of significant historical interest in the Ayia Napa area. The Makronissos Tombs are an archaeological site consisting of set of ancient rock-cut tombs, an adjacent sanctuary and quarry, and evidence of funeral pyres. The town contains two municipal marine museums: the Tornaritis- Pierides Museum of Marine Life and the Thalassa Agia Napa Municipal Museum (also known as the Thalassa Museum of the Sea). The former, founded in 1992, displays marine fossils, specimens, and dioramas.. The latter, founded in 2005, displays the \\"marine heritage of Cyprus, from prehistoric times to the present\\" and features a full-scale replica of a 300 BCE merchant ship which was salvaged during the 1960s. The Ayia Napa Sculpture Park, which is located on the east side of Ayia Napa, was inaugurated in May 2014 with seventeen sculptures. By 2017, the sculpture park contained 144 sculptures through the participation of 104 sculptors. The sculpture park has gained worldwide recognition and was accepted as a member to the International Sculpture Symposium Alliance, and has been turned into an international attraction, with the participation of artists from all over the world. =Festivals= The Ayia Napa International Festival was first held in September 1985 and has since been established as an annual event, usually over the last weekend of September. It takes place in Sepheris Square in Ayia Napa Monastery. The festivities reflect the historic, cultural and agricultural traditions of Ayia Napa and Cyprus as a whole. The programme includes theater performances, operas, concerts, and Cypriot and foreign folk dancing. Visitors can also enjoy art and photo exhibitions, wood carving and silversmithing workshops, and culinary shows with halloumi cheese making. The Ayia Napa Youth Festival was established in 2010 when the Ayia Napa Youth Council accepted the proposal of its president Yiannis Karousos and decided to organise a festival similar to the large music festivals of Europe. The festival is based on several principles such as free entrance, the headliners to be chosen by the public, a charity goal, and a social responsibility message attached to it. All styles of music are welcome. At the first festival, which took place at the harbour square of Ayia Napa, more than 10,000 people visited the festival during the three-day period with bands such as the Greek reggae act Locomondo, pop-rock band MPLE, and hip hop band Stavento featuring Ivi Adamou. 25 rock and metal bands performed. In 2011, the Ayia Napa Youth Festival became international and included the bands Stratovarius, Sabaton, Rotting Christ, Nightstalker, and other bands from all over Europe. The 3rd Ayia Napa Youth Festival took place in 2012. =World record= Following the proposal of Mayor Yiannis Karousos, then President of the Ayia Napa Tourism Committee, on 16 September 2007, the world's longest chain of syrtaki dancers (a famous Greek dance) danced to \\"Zorba the Greek\\" in a successful attempt to enter the Guinness Book of World Records. The chain had a total of 268 members of eight dancing groups. Then Ayia Napa Mayor Antonis Tsokkos said the aim of the event was to send the message that the village was interested in Greek culture and to promote the tourist resort abroad. Head of Cultural Services Maria Tofini said that, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the dancers had to perform in synchronised step for the attempt to qualify. The event drew the attention of tourists and locals, many of whom danced on the beach and in the sea.  Municipality The City of Ayia Napa is well known for its city management and its applications. They have implemented some major decisions and setup an example in Cyprus municipal management * Beaches are public and under City management. Through the initiative of the City of Ayia Napa all the beaches in Cyprus are under the management of the local authorities(cities and villages). Beaches in Cyprus until the end of 2014 were under the management of private individuals and companies which were given licences to manage the beaches directly and without public tenders. Through the actions of the City of Ayia Napa the management returned to the Municipalities. This fact, benefited the general good and the public interest leading to revenues in excess of 3.5 million euros on annual basis for the City. For the City to take over the management of the beaches it had to take some very difficult decisions and implement them the Mayor Yiannis Karousos, who led this initiative, and the city councilors who voted in favor of the proposal, experienced a lot of pressure, threats and several legal actions against them, all which were turned down by the courts. * Participatory Budget. The city of Ayia Napa became the first city in Cyprus who had voted and implemented a participatory budget. in October 2017 the city decided that €240,000 of its development budget will be allocated to projects who will be proposed and chosen by citizens and organisations of Ayia Napa. * Broadcasting live a city council meeting. in January 2017 the City become the first city council in Cyprus who transmitted a live webcast of its council meetings. * Annual Barometer. citizens, businesses and visitors evaluate the City and its services through an annual research survey .Starting 2017 the city implemented an annual survey where citizens, businesses and tourists evaluate the City in a range of features, its services but also state their issues and feedback. *Participate and improve my city application . Improvement of the City with the help of its citizens. the City created an online application where its citizens and visitors can upload and report issues and problems they have in many areas , such as technical, cleaning, repairs, complaints etc. the applicant and the visitors of the application can watch the follow up and the time the city took to reply and fix the issue *Blockchain the city became the 1st City in Cyprus who took a decision to implement blockchain technologies for improving its productivity and services. the City signed an agreement on 2 May 2018, with university of Nicosia, a blockchain and cryptocurrency specialist, in which the university will act as consultant to the city and advise in issues of blockchain, artificial intelligence and smart cities Points of interest Cape Greco Following his election as mayor in March 2013, Yiannis Karousos implemented a strategy in which visitors will enjoy and be able to visit points of interest other than the beaches and the sea: * The Ayia Napa Sculpture Park. This park by January 2018 included more than 200 sculptures from 140 sculptors from all over the world. * The Fisherman of Ayia Napa. Fishing is part of the history of Ayia Napa. The population once consisted of mainly fishermen and farmers. This monument was created and dedicated to all the fishermen of the world, and was inaugurated in June 2015. * The Mermaid of Ayia Napa. A sculpture on the harbor of Ayia Napa. The mermaid was inspired through the poems of the Nobel-winning poet George Seferis and through Alexander the Great, as according to legend, she was the sister of Alexander the Great. She has the unique feature of two tails. The sculpture was inaugurated in 2015. * The Lady Farmer. Located in the heart of the city, the statue is a modern version of the lady farmer. * The Farmer of Ayia Napa. A square was created on Yiannaki Pappoulis Street where the sculpture of the Farmer of Ayia Napa was placed. This initiative was under the measures taken for improvements and changes in the city center. The monument was inaugurated in July 2016. * Kemitzides, the Family of Ayia Napa. A collection of three sculptures representing the Kemitzis family, who created Ayia Napa in 1790. The man has Greek characteristics on his clothes because Kemitzis was from Thessaloniki. The lady is a classic Cypriot woman and the child symbolizes the continuation of the family. The project was inaugurated in September 2016. It was donated to the city by five families of Ayia Napa. * The Cactus Park. A park was created which includes over 10,000 cactus and dessert plants. Located next to the sculpture park, it was created with voluntary work. The park was inaugurated in June 2015. * Artificial Reef. The main interest point inside the artificial reef is the Kyrenia ship, which was donated by the Ministry of Defense to the city of Ayia Napa. Other underwater sculptures are also located in the reef. It was inaugurated in February 2015. * The Fishing Boats Roundabout. A touch of the history of Ayia Napa can be seen on the first main roundabout of Ayia Napa. The city was looking for ways to create positive feelings and memories when entering the city. An abandoned fishing boat was transferred there together with some other fishing boats. * The Cape Greco Environmental and Educational Center, which provides information and education with regards to the national park of Cape Greco, a nature 2000 protected area. The center was inaugurated in May 2017 * First and Second World War volunteers monument. In October 2016 the city inaugurated in the presence of the Minister of Defence the monument dedicated to the citizens of Ayia Napa who participated in the First and Second World Wars. The monument is called From Yorgopotamos to El Alamein. Marina On 30 September 2016, the foundation stone of the Ayia Napa Marina (the largest private project in Cyprus at the time) was set. It is expected to cost €250 million and be completed in 2021. The main investor is Egyptian tycoon Naguib Sawiris. Ayia Napa Mayor Yiannis Karousos presented Sawiris with the town's golden key and said that this was an \\"exceptional day for the municipality and for Cyprus\\", further stating that the project underlines Ayia Napa's ambition to become \\"the best and most cosmopolitan tourist resort in the Mediterranean\\".

Biography  Kpomassie was born in 1941, in Togo, and received only six years of elementary education. His father, a prominent man in the village, had eight wives and 26 children. When he was a young man, he was collecting coconuts in a tree when he was surprised by a python, and fell to the ground. His father believed that his resulting illness could only be cured by consulting the priestess of the python cult, deep in the forest, and so he was taken, through one long night, into the heart of the snake-infested cult. The cure worked, but the priestess required a payment - Kpomassie would need to be initiated into the snake cult. This would require living for the next seven years in the jungle, among the snakes. It was at this time, recovering from his illness and waiting to be taken back to the jungle, that Kpomassie found a children's book (The Eskimos from Greenland to Alaska by Dr. Robert Gessain) at the local Jesuit library about Greenland. Not only did this strange country have no snakes, but it had no trees in which they might hide. He fell immediately in love with the country and the idea of its native hunters. As soon as he was well, he ran away from home, with the sole idea of somehow reaching Greenland. For the next twelve years he traveled, refusing to stay in one place more than six months, and worked his way through the countries of West Africa, into Europe, and finally, in the mid-1960s, found a boat to Greenland. All the while, he taught himself languages through correspondence courses and made an endless number of friends through his skills as a story-teller and natural charm. The story of his adventures in Greenland can be found in his book, published in France in 1977, An African in Greenland. Kpomassie was awarded the Prix Littéraire Francophone International in 1981. In 2003, Leonard Lopate interviewed Kpomassie on WNYC for The Leonard Lopate Show. In New York City, in September 2009, the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts and Flux Factory organized an exhibition called Arctic Book Club centered on the book, with Kpomassie himself as the guest of honor. Kpomassie currently lives in Nanterre, near Paris, France, but continues to regularly visit Greenland and his native country of Togo.

The kingdom lasted as an independent state from the 16th to the 19th century. The Omukama of Bunyoro remains an important figure in Ugandan politics, especially among the Banyoro people of whom he is the titular head. He is closely related to the Omukama of Toro Kingdom. The Royal Palace, called Karuziika Palace, is located in Hoima. The current Omukama is Solomon Iguru I and his wife is the Queen or Omugo Margaret Karunga. As a cultural head, the King is assisted by his Principal Private Secretary, a Cabinet of 21 Ministers and a Orukurato (Parliament). Constitutional recognition In 1962, the United Kingdom granted independence to Uganda. In February 1966, Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution and seized power, abolishing all of the traditional kingdoms—including Bunyoro—in 1967. The Omukama (King) of Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom was reinstated by Statute No. 8 of 1993, enacted by the Parliament of Uganda after the monarchy had been abolished for many years. Unlike the pre-1967 Omukama, who was both titular head and a political figure of the government of Bunyoro, the Omukama today is a cultural leader above partisan politics, although the king remains the titular head of the Bunyoro regional government. Article 246 of the 1995 Ugandan constitution provides: > 246. Institution of traditional or cultural leaders. (1) Subject to the > provisions of this Constitution, the institution of traditional leader or > cultural leader may exist in any area of Uganda in accordance with the > culture, customs and traditions or wishes and aspirations of the people to > whom it applies.

History of the Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara dynasties =The Babiito dynasty= The Bachwezi dynasty was followed by the Babiito dynasty of the current Omukama of Bunyoro-Kitara. Any attempt to pinpoint the dates of this, or any other dynasty before it, is pure conjecture; as there were no written records at the time. Modern day historians place the beginning of the Babiito dynasty at around the time of the invasion of Bunyoro by the Luo from the North. The first mubiito (singular) king was Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi I, whose reign is placed around the 14th century. To date, there have been a total of 27 Babiito kings of Bunyoro-Kitara.

VOS is available on Stratus's ftServer and Continuum platforms. VOS customers use it to support high-volume transaction processing applications which require continuous availability. VOS is notable for being one of the few operating systems which run on fully lockstepped hardware. During the 1980s, an IBM version of Stratus VOS existed and was called the System/88 Operating System. History VOS was designed from its inception as a high-security transaction-processing environment tailored to fault-tolerant hardware. It incorporates much of the design experience that came out of the MIT/Bell- Laboratories/General-Electric (later Honeywell) Multics project. In 1984, Stratus added a UNIX System V implementation called Unix System Facilities (USF) to VOS, integrating Unix and VOS at the kernel level. In recent years, Stratus has added POSIX-compliance, and many open source packages can run on VOS. Like competing proprietary operating systems, VOS has seen its market share shrink steadily in the 1990s and early 2000s. Development =Programming for VOS= VOS provides compilers for PL/I, COBOL, Pascal, FORTRAN, C (with the VOS C and GCC compilers), and C++ (also GCC). Each of these programming languages can make VOS system calls (e.g. \`s$seq_read\` to read a record from a file), and has extensions to support varying-length strings in PL/I style. Developers typically code in their favourite VOS text editor, or offline, before compiling on the system; there are no VOS IDE applications. In its history, Stratus has offered hardware platforms based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor family (\\"FT\\" and \\"XA\\" series), the Intel i860 microprocessor family (\\"XA/R\\" series), the HP PA-RISC processor family (\\"Continuum\\" series), and the Intel Xeon x86 processor family (\\"V Series\\"). All versions of VOS offer compilers targeted at the native instruction set, and some versions of VOS offer cross-compilers. Stratus added support for the POSIX API in VOS Release 14.3 (on Continuum), and added support for the GNU C/C++ compiler, GNU gdb debugger, and many POSIX commands in VOS Release 14.4. Each additional release of VOS has added more POSIX.1 capabilities, to the point where many user-mode open-source packages can now be successfully built. For this reason, beginning with Release 17.0, Stratus renamed VOS to OpenVOS. Stratus offers supported ports of Samba, OpenSSL, OpenSSH, GNU Privacy Guard, OpenLDAP, Berkeley DB, MySQL Community Server, Apache, IBM WebSphere MQ, and the community edition of Java. Numeric values in VOS are always big endian, regardless of the endianness of the underlying hardware platform. On little endian servers with x86 processors, the compilers do a byte swap before reading or writing values to memory to transform the data to or from the native little endian format. =Command Macro Language= VOS has a fairly complete command macro language which can be used to create menu systems, automate tasks etc. VOS command macros accept arguments on the command-line or via a user interface \\"form\\". Arguments are defined at the beginning of the command macro in a \\"parameters\\" section. The language supports a range of statements, including if/then/else, boolean operations, \\"while\\" loops, \\"goto\\" and excellent error reporting. The command macro language can be executed in interactive and non-interactive (batch or started process) modes. It can be used to automate programs, capturing prompts and sending appropriate responses. This has led Stratus to limit the capabilities of the command macro language. The macro language lacks support for user-defined functions and does not easily support include files. The string handling is prone to errors, especially with embedded control characters. Overview VOS was coded mainly in PL/I with a small amount of assembly language before it was migrated to ftServer series. As of 1991, the system was written in PL/I and C, with only 3% in assembly. This, and Stratus's advanced compilers, made VOS more portable than contemporaries such as VMS or Domain/OS. Its overall structure has much in common with Multics, and many of the system's features can be traced back to Multics to varying degrees. The system exposes a number of fundamental abstractions to the software designer or programmer, most notable being *Processes *Devices *Hard Disks *Various IPC mechanisms *Tasks A process is the scheduled entity in VOS and each process has a set of attributes that govern how it is manipulated by the system. For example, processes have a user name and process name. The former is used by VOS to determine the process's access rights to external devices and items with the file system. Of fundamental significance is a process's privileged flag, which is a binary attribute. Privileged processes may perform privileged operations. This mechanism is used to restrict certain potentially powerful operations that can have system wide consequences (e.g. shutting down the system, dismounting a hard disk etc.). Distribution VOS is distributed only by Stratus Technologies. The distribution media is a 3.5 mm DAT tape for Continuum, and an SDLT tape for early V Series platforms. As of OpenVOS Release 17.0, Stratus offers support for distributing OpenVOS on a DVD or by downloading a release file. Software installations may be done by the Stratus Field Engineer or by the customer's system administrator. Interface The command-line interface is the main, and most powerful, user interface for a VOS system. Users may be locked into \\"form\\" based sub-system by command macro scripts if required, although a skilled user would be able to break out of this and get command- line access. (It is, in fact, possible for a Stratus system administrator to set up a user's account such that an attempt to break out of FMS—the Stratus Forms Management System—to the command line results in the user being logged out.) Command macros and programs can be invoked with an argument to display a form listing all the available parameters, which the user can navigate using the \\"tab\\" key. Each parameter is generally restricted to control what the user can input. This includes lists of valid values, numeric-only, text-only, etc. Parameters can also be hidden using a \\"secret\\" tag, or made mandatory. All commands in VOS are defined in full with underbars to separate words. For example, changes the working directory. The VOS help system uses this convention to assist users who are looking for a subset of possible commands; for instance, those referring to \\"change\\" are found by . Users may customize their command interface by means of a file that contains abbreviations for commands. Command abbreviations are conventionally named after the first letters of the command they represent, so may be expanded to . Applications =System applications= VOS is used on Continuum and ftServer systems, both of which are designed to be highly fault-tolerant. As such, these systems are typically used in safety-critical or mission-critical applications, typically banks, hospitals, telecommunications and transaction processing companies. =Communications= VOS supports the following protocols *TCP/IP *X.25 *SNA *SDLC/QLLC *Async *Bisync *LAPB *Poll/Select *RJE/HASP *ALC/SLC *Visa, S.W.I.F.T., NASDAQ, FAS, CHIPS, AMEX *MQ Series Older versions of VOS implemented a non-OSI standard TCP/IP known as OS TCP/IP (Operating System TCP/IP.) VOS since version 14.x has implemented OSI- compliant Streams-TCP. Older applications using OS TCP/IP have to be ported in order to use STCP. This can mean a loss of functionality as OS TCP/IP supported several functions that are not OSI-compliant and have therefore been abandoned. The ftServer hardware that V Series runs on only supports TCP/IP and X.25 (X.25 only when equipped with the optional NIO.) Websphere MQ 6.0 (a.k.a. MQ Series) is TCP/IP based; so, that is also supported by ftServer hardware. Devices supporting the legacy protocols run on the Continuum hardware and may be accessed from current hardware over the Open StrataLINK network. Fault tolerance Fault tolerance is built into VOS from the bottom up. On a hardware level, major devices are run in lockstepped duplex mode, meaning that there are two identical devices performing the same action at the same time. (In addition, each device, or board, is also duplexed in order to identify internal board failures at a hardware level, which is why Stratus hardware can be defined as \\"lock stepped\\".) These boards are actively monitored by the operating system which can correct any minor inconsistencies (such as bad disk-writes or reads). Any boards which report an unacceptable number of faults are removed from service by the system; the duplexed board will continue operation until the problem is resolved via a hot-fix. This includes CPUs, disk drives, and any other device that can logically be duplexed (which by definition, excludes communications devices). The system will continue processing as normal and will automatically raise a fault ticket with Stratus Customer Service via RSN (the Remote Service Network). Stratus Customer Service will then dial into the system using RSN to investigate the problem and dispatch replacement parts. The operating system is designed to avoid crashes due to a simplexed hardware failure. File system VOS supports a number of unique file types: * Stream files: a stream of binary data, corresponding directly with the concept of a file on other operating systems. * Fixed files: a sequence of records of a fixed size. * Relative files: a sequence of records of a fixed file supporting random access * Sequential files: a sequence of records of variable size * Queue files: file- system based backup for message queues * Pipes: named pipes for inter-process communication * Transaction files: these provide support for journal based rollback The VOS API allows the creation of multiple indexes per file, sorting according to the contents of a record, or an external key, or an internal key, or a well-defined set of multiple keys. A VOS file with one or more indexes can be used as a C-ISAM database table. VOS uses a proprietary file naming syntax which includes the system name, module name, disk number, and directory, with components separated by the \\">\\" symbol. Typically the system disk will be housed in the same module as the CPU, \`#m1\`, so a system file for a VOS cluster would be referenced as (%system)#m1_d01>system>devices.table VOS disk allocation and memory is organised in \\"blocks\\", each block being 4,096 bytes. Memory takes the form of RAM or paging. VOS systems support paging partitions and paging files. In modern versions of VOS, paging files can be created dynamically by the SysAdmin (but not removed without a reboot). These paging files can in theory consist of more than one extent (which is viewed by the kernel as a mini-paging partition) which may or may not be contiguous. However, non-contiguous extents are NOT recommended as they greatly increase disk activity. Admin should create the largest possible extent for the paging files as early as possible after the system has been booted. =File system security= VOS supports write, read, execute, and null (no) access to all files, directories and devices (although directories and files have slightly different access lists). Access can be assigned to users, groups, or the world. Only read access is required to run an executable program, provided that the user has \\"status\\" access for the directory in which that program resides. VOS inherited access control lists from Multics and also implements directory access control lists. If a file does not have an access control list, the containing directory's default access control list applies. Access to devices is typically controlled by creating a file which is linked to the device by the administrator. (This may be true in OpenVOS, but does not apply to the original operating system.) Access is then given to this file, and this sets the access on the device. Open StrataLINK VOS has always been a network-aware operating system. Virtually every system call in the native API has a parameter that determines what computer the operation affects. If the operation isn't local, it is redirected to the target computer via remote subroutine call. For example, file names are parsed to indicate which computer the file resides on. The StrataLINK networking model has a two level hierarchy for naming computers: Each computer is called a module and modules are aggregated into systems. Each system is administered as a unit. In other words, all of the modules in a system are aware of all the disks and hardware devices on that system. The result of this is that a file name that begins with the system name refers to files on other computers and can be opened without the need for any special networking. The same is true for devices. Other system entities, such as processes, are referenced using module names which are written %system#module. The VOS system and module names have no defined relationship with IP addresses or domain names—The VOS API was developed in late 1980—before the Internet was widely adopted and long before URLs were even invented. Historically, StrataLINK was a proprietary 10Mb CSMA/CD ring network which allowed high performance (for the time) with very low memory overhead and CPU utilization. This was never developed beyond 10Mb and was dropped in favor of using TCP/IP because Ethernet became the dominant networking standard and because memory and CPU processing got cheaper. Open StrataLINK can also use X.25 for wide area communications. Using the Open StrataLINK protocols for wide area communications is also referred to as StrataNET.

Born in Napier in New Zealand, Storkey moved to Australia in 1911. He was a law student at the University of Sydney when the First World War began. He volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in May 1915 and was posted to the 19th Battalion. He saw action on the Western Front, including during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. It was during the German Spring Offensive of 1918 that he performed the actions that led to his award of the VC. He finished the war as a captain. Discharged from the AIF, Storkey returned to his legal studies and became a crown prosecutor for the New South Wales Department of Justice. Shortly before the Second World War, he was appointed a district court judge and served in this capacity until his retirement in 1955. He moved to England where he died in 1969 at the age of 78. Early life Percy Storkey was born on 9 September 1893 in Napier, New Zealand to Samuel Storkey, an Englishman who worked as a printer and his New Zealand-born wife, Sarah . Samuel Storkey had moved to Napier as a young boy with his father William. Percy Storkey was educated at Napier Boys' High School, where he was dux of the school in his final year, and later Victoria College in Wellington, where he studied fine arts. As a teenager, Storkey served in the Territorial Force as an infantryman with the Wellington Regiment, eventually achieving the rank of colour sergeant. In around 1911 or 1912, Storkey moved to Sydney in Australia and worked as a clerk for a steamship company. Within a year he was on the administrative staff at the University of Sydney. He then enrolled in the university's law school but the First World War curtailed his studies. First World War Storkey enlisted for service in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 10 May 1915. Prior to his commissioning on 24 September as a second lieutenant, he served as a platoon sergeant in the 30th Battalion. He embarked for England aboard the Suevic at the end of the year but not before his former colleagues at the University of Sydney presented him with a wristwatch. and was posted to the 19th Battalion, then stationed on the Western Front in France, in mid-November 1916. He was wounded in the thigh during fighting at Flers, on the Somme, within days of joining the battalion. Promoted to lieutenant in January 1917, he was wounded again, in the ankle, in October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele while on the Menin Road. The following month, having returned to duty, he was given temporary command of a company. In March 1918, the Germans began their Spring Offensive and the 19th Battalion, as part of the 2nd Division, helped in shoring up the front-lines as the Germans advanced. On 7 April 1918, while holding the lines near Villers-Bretonneux, his company, with Storkey as its second-in-command, was sent forward to clear Hangard Wood, believed to be lightly held by the enemy. The company commenced its advance early in the morning after a covering artillery barrage lifted, but Storkey had fallen asleep and was left behind at the starting line. He shortly woke and quickly caught up with the advance, about ahead. By this time, machine gun fire had caused a quarter of the company to become casualties, including its commander, Captain Clarrie Wallach. Taking command, Storkey led a small party on a foray to outflank the machine gun post that was holding up the advance. Despite being detected as they approached, he seized the initiative and led a prompt charge that saw his party capture a machine gun along with 50 Germans and killing or wounding about 30 more. His conduct leading the attack had deceived the Germans into believing the size of the force facing them was much larger than it was. The position secured, the Australians pushed on further into the wood but were unable to locate their objective. Storkey, considering the available options for cover too exposed, opted to withdraw the company back to their starting positions. On reporting to his battalion commander, he was ordered to retake the position but advised that he had too few men to so. His explanation was accepted and Storkey returned to his trench. Over 150 soldiers of the company had become casualties of the attack, but it had resulted in useful information on the German forces at Hangard Wood. For his actions at Hangard Wood, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). At the time, the VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Storkey's VC, published in the London Gazette, read: Later wounded for a third time, Storkey was promoted to captain the following month and given command of his own company. On 25 July 1918, King George V presented him with his VC at Buckingham Palace. As part of a special furlough, he returned to Australia in November 1918 and was discharged from the AIF early the following year. He was allocated to the Reserve of Officers in July 1920. Later life Oil portrait of Captain Percy Valentine Storkey, VC, AIF, painted by Duncan Max Meldrum around 1920 Returning to civilian life, Storkey resumed his legal studies. In May 1919 he was made an associate to Judge Langer Owen of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and then worked for Justice Charles Wade. He qualified as a lawyer in 1921 and briefly worked in private practice before becoming a crown prosecutor for the New South Wales Department of Justice; his jurisdiction covering the south-western area of the state. He fulfilled this role for several years until his appointment as a district court judge in May 1939, the first VC recipient to be become a member of the bench. He presided over trials in the northern district of New South Wales. Prior to his appointment to the judiciary, he briefly worked for the legal department of the Australian Army. He was also involved in the Returned Soldier's League and became the president of the sub-branch in Vaucluse, the suburb of Sydney where he lived. In 1955 Storkey retired and moved to England where he lived in Teddington, Middlesex, with Minnie , his English-born wife, whom he had married in 1922 in Sydney. The next year, he attended the VC centenary celebrations in London. He died at home on 3 October 1969, survived by his wife. The couple had no children. He was cremated and his ashes scattered at South West Middlesex Crematorium. The machine gun captured during the action at Hangard Wood that saw him awarded the VC is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where a street is also named for him. Medal Storkey left his VC, along with his Victory Medal, British War Medal, and medals from the 1937 and 1953 coronations, to his old school, Napier Boys' High School. In 1983 there was a controversy when the school Parents' League wanted to sell the VC to finance student scholarships but backed down in the face of public protests. Eventually the medals were transferred to the National Army Museum at Waiouru, where they are displayed on a long-term loan. A replica of his VC is also on display in the foyer of the assembly hall at Napier Boys' High School.

It was published by Texere in 2001. The tagline and theme of the book is \\"Why numbers make us irrational\\". Premise The author's premise is that humans have been trying to improve the quality of life and happiness by using numbers to count an increasing amount of things, and while it has worked in many ways, it has also had a cost in sanitizing the representation of existence by trying to reduce everything to numbers, and has not often been very effective. This tension is very similar to the one described in the classic The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution of C. P. Snow. Synopsis The first chapter is entitled \\"A Short History of Counting\\". It describes the progression of numbers from being considered divine in early history to their present-day pragmatism. It opens in 1904 Berlin with the story of a counting horse named Clever Hans, who was, to the relief of all, proved by psychologist Oskar Pfungst to not really be able to count. This fit in with the earlier opinion of Nicholas of Cusa, a cardinal who was a pioneer of quantification, that counting is what separates man from animals. Boyle then covers the history of counting in detail, starting with when numbers were considered to be divine and were the exclusive domain of the accountant-priests of the Assyrian Empire, then going on to Pythagoras and the Ancient Greeks who believed numbers represented the harmony of nature. Legend has it that Pythagoras may have studied with the Magi and been influenced by them after having been held captive in Babylon. Even a later practical and scientific mathematician such as Heinrich Hertz agreed with this natural significance of numbers. Boyle then goes to the medieval fascination and obsession with clocks that are thought to have possibly been invented by Gerbert of Aurillac, a monk. The long and fascinating history of the abacus also turns up time and time again in counting history. Luca Pacioli's invention of double-entry accounting further brought us to the present day situation of numbers being used to measure everything. The next chapters tell the stories of various historical figures and how they relate to the book's concept. They are all good stories; many of them focus on the unintended consequences of the ideas of their creators, specifically Thomas Malthus and John Maynard Keynes, who have both become known as measurers, but were really more interested in unmeasurable concepts. It all starts with eccentric Jeremy Bentham who tried to measure happiness, then progresses to his utilitarian followers John Stuart Mill and Thomas Malthus. One problem with counting that became evident from this era was that it gave no solutions or causality, just data. Next he describes the political self-esteem movement started by California politician John Vasconcellos in consultation with his friend Jack Canfield, author of the popular self-esteem self-help book Chicken Soup for the Soul. A lot of Vasconcellous' ideas came from the Esalen Institute in the mountains near Big Sur, where Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of human needs theory was popularized. Boyle then tells the interesting story of Frederick Winslow Taylor and his extremely number- oriented scientific management. He then covers the ethical investing fad, an attempt to measure by more than numbers that itself falls victim to counting irrationality. Next is the story of economist John Maynard Keynes. The chapter on \\"New Indicators\\" describes attempts to replace GNP with broader measures such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) that attempt to account for full environmental costs. That index was popularized in a 1994 article in The Atlantic Monthly by Clifford Cobb about his new Redefining Progress think tank. Hazel Henderson's 1981 book Politics for the Solar Age was responsible for sparking the creation of the Air Pollution Index, one of many quality of life measurements that are now proliferating. An interesting point is that such measurements are often most meaningful if created and made by the people who care about them. The next chapter covers the story of Edgar S. Cahn who came up with the time dollar as an outgrowth of his battles with proponents of cost–benefit analysis but more importantly from his desire to make people feel valuable. The initial time dollar projects began in 1987 with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The book ends with a chapter named \\"The bottom line\\". Boyle summarizes how the practice of trying to measure everything (which used to go by the name pantometry but is now so common that the word has fallen out of use) can rob us of our humanity. Measuring is very necessary, but so is intuition and storytelling, which can often express points much better than numbers can. He thinks we should try to bridge the gap between the eastern and western view of numbers, which have been in conflict since Pythagoras. He ends with a relevant quote from Prince Charles from his millennium broadcast on the BBC. Boyle's bottom line is that measuring does not in itself improve anything.

It was about long and in weight, making it one of the largest theropods of its time. Individuals of this species may have grown even larger, because the only known specimen probably represents a sub- adult. Cryolophosaurus is known from a skull, a femur and other material, the skull and femur of which have caused its classification to vary greatly. The femur possesses many primitive characteristics that have classified Cryolophosaurus as a dilophosaurid or a neotheropod outside of Dilophosauridae and Averostra, whereas the skull has many advanced features, leading the genus to be considered a tetanuran, an abelisaurid, a ceratosaur and even an allosaurid. Since its original description, the consensus is that Cryolophosaurus is either a primitive member of the Tetanurae or a close relative of that group. Cryolophosaurus possessed a distinctive \\"pompadour\\" crest that spanned the head from side to side. Based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture, it is thought that this bizarre crest was used for intra-species recognition. The brain of Cryolophosaurus was also more primitive than those of other theropods. Cryolophosaurus was first excavated from Antarctica's Early Jurassic, Sinemurian to Pliensbachian aged Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, by paleontologist Dr. William Hammer in 1991. It was the first carnivorous dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic Period. Discovery and naming The unrestored holotype of Cryolophosaurus, FMNH PR1821. Cryolophosaurus originally was collected during the 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils were found in the siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian Stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier. Skeletal mount in front view In 1991, both Hammer and the Ohio State University geologist David Elliot excavated separate outcrops near Beardmore Glacier, sharing logistical expenses. Elliot's team first came across the remains of Cryolophosaurus in a rock formation around the altitude of high and about from the South Pole. When the discovery was made, they soon notified Hammer. Over the next three weeks, Hammer excavated of fossil-bearing rock. The team recovered over 100 fossil bones, including those of Cryolophosaurus. The specimens were formally named and described in 1994 by Hammer and Hickerson, in the journal Science. During the 2003 season, a field team returned and collected more material from the original site. A second locality was discovered about higher in the section on Mt. Kirkpatrick. The name Cryolophosaurus ellioti is derived from the Greek words κρυος (meaning 'cold' or 'frozen', in reference to its discovery in Antarctica), λοφος (meaning 'crest') and σαυρος (meaning 'lizard'), thus \\"cold crest lizard\\". Hammer and Hickerson named the species C. ellioti, after David Elliot, who had made the initial discovery of the fossils. Description restored with scales The holotype FMNH PR1821 is the only fully described specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7-10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the distal end of a tibia; the distal end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum. In 2013, new material of Cryolophosaurus was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material has not yet been published in a non-abstract form. Size Comparison with a human and Emperor penguin Cryolophosaurus was a large, well- built theropod, one of the largest of its time. The genus has been described by Roger Benson and colleagues (2012) as a top predator in Antarctica. It had slender proportions. Cryolophosaurus was estimated as being in length by William R. Hammer & William J. Hickerson (1999). A 2007 study by Nathan Smith et al. revised the length to . Its weight estimated at . Based on these length and weight estimates, Cryolophosaurus is currently the largest known Early Jurassic theropod. Smith et al. (2007b) and Benson et al. (2012) noted that the holotype individual probably represents a sub-adult, so adults could have been larger. In 2016 Molina-Pérez and Larramendi gave a larger estimation of 7.7 meters (25.3 ft) and 780 kg (1.720 lbs). =Skull= left alt= The holotype of Cryolophosaurus consists of a high, narrow skull, which was discovered articulated with the rest of the skeleton. The skull is an estimated long. It has a peculiar nasal crest that runs just over the eyes, where it rises up perpendicular to the skull and fans out. It is thin and highly furrowed, giving it a unique \\"pompadour\\" appearance and earned it the nickname \\"Elvisaurus.\\" The crest is an extension of the skull bones, near the tear ducts, fused on either side to orbital horns which rise from the eye sockets. While other theropods like the Monolophosaurus have crests, they usually run along the skull instead of across it. An unpublished study conducted by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The study found that the Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda. Closer examination of how the skull bones fused together reviewed details in the snout and forehead that are especially similar to Dilophosaurus. Classification Cryolophosaurus restored with a speculative coat of feathers Classification of Cryolophosaurus is difficult because it has a mix of primitive and advanced characteristics. The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later species of the clade Tetanurae, like China's Sinraptor and Yangchuanosaurus. This led Paul Sereno et al. (1994) to place Cryolophosaurus in the taxon Allosauridae. Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that Cryolophosaurus might be a ceratosaur or even an early abelisaur, with some traits convergent with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group. While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered Cryolophosaurus as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors found that it was more closely related to Dilophosaurus and Dracovenator. Sterling Nesbitt et al. (2009), using the characters of Tawa found Cryolophosaurus to be a neither dilophosaurid nor averostran neotheropod but instead the sister group of a clade composed of dilophosaurids and averostrans. However, in 2012, Matthew Carrano found that Cryolophosaurus was a tetanuran, related to Sinosaurus, but unrelated to Dilophosaurus. Fossil pelvis of Cryolophosaurus. The loop at the widest part of the pubis is large compared to later theropods. The following family tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the early theropod groups compiled by Hendrickx et al. in 2015. Paleobiology =Cranial ornamentation= Restoration of the head crest Cranial display features, such as the one possessed by Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are available to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures can be explained by the phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating. In 2019, a species recognition function was disputed but a socio-sexual display structure model was suggested. =Diet= When the type specimen was discovered, several long cervical ribs, of a supposed prosauropod dinosaur were found in the mouth of Cryolophosaurus, which led Hammer (1998) to conclude that it was feeding on the prosauropod when it died. Hammer further noted that since the ribs were found extending all the way back to the theropod's neck region, this individual may have choked to death on these ribs. However, Smith et al. concluded that these remains belonged to the Cryolophosaurus specimen itself, and not to Hammer's \\"prosauropod\\". Hammer also concluded that a post-canine tooth belonging to a tritylodont (an early mammal relative), found with the remains, was part of its stomach contents when it died. =Paleopathology= left Some Cryolophosaurus bones have pathologies that show evidence of scavenging. Broken teeth from a juvenile Cryolophosaurus were found nearby. These teeth have no roots and likely shed naturally while scavenging the adult Cryolophosaurus carcass. alt= Another possible pathology is found in the astragalus (ankle bone) of Cryolophosaurus. This bone was preserved with a small splint from the fibula located just above the ankle. The splint, however, may also be just a unique morphological feature of Cryolophosaurus. Paleoecology left All known specimens of Cryolophosaurus have been recovered in the Hanson Formation, which is one of only two major dinosaur- bearing rock formations found on the continent of Antarctica. It was discovered in \\"tuffaceous\\" siltstone deposited in the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian stage of the Early Jurassic, approximately 194 to 188 million years ago. This geological formation is part of the Victoria Group of the Transantarctic Mountains, which is approximately above sea level. The high altitude of this site supports the idea that early Jurassic Antarctica had forests populated by a diverse range of species, at least along the coast. The Hanson Formation was deposited in an active volcano−tectonic rift system formed during the breakup of Gondwana. In the Early Jurassic, Antarctica was closer to the equator and the world was considerably warmer than today, but the climate was still cool temperate. Models of Jurassic air flow indicate that coastal areas probably never dropped much below freezing, although more extreme conditions existed inland. Cryolophosaurus was found about from the South Pole but, at the time it lived, this was about or so farther north. This formation has produced the remains of Glacialisaurus (a large basal sauropodomorph), a crow-sized pterosaur (a dimorphodontid), a synapsid (a tritylodont, which is a type of synapsid about the size of a rat), herbivorous synapsid, and two small unnamed sauropodmorphs. There are also the remains of many plant genera recovered from the Early Jurassic Camp Hill Formation, around the same age as fossils of Cryolophosaurus, proving that dense plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward.

At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments. Surveying has been a subjective process open to interpretation by the person or persons producing the document as well as open discussion to the persons abiding by the document. The variables that originally defined the \\"bounds\\" need to be converted to metes by more modern methods. Today the word \\"art\\" is being used when discussing surveying as in Surveying is an \\"Art\\" leaving much to surveyor opinion to \\"update\\" the existing deed. In most areas, urban deeds have defined the boundary lines sufficiently to buy and sell land with sufficient clarity however as one moves further into larger parcels the subjectivity grows. * Metes. The term \\"metes\\" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods. * Bounds. The term \\"bounds\\" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public road way, or an existing building. The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms), and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.  Usage  A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: \\"Commencing at a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, thence north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, thence northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the point of commencement.\\" The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark. The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction. Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments. In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees), but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east). For example, such a bearing might be listed as \\"N 42°35' W\\", which means that the bearing is 42°35' counterclockwise, or west of north. This has the advantage of providing the same degree measure regardless of which direction a particular boundary is being followed; the boundary can be traversed in the opposite direction simply by exchanging N for S and E for W. In other words, \\"N 42°35' W\\" describes the same boundary as \\"S 42°35' E\\", but is traversed in the opposite direction. In most distance measures, especially those in older deeds and where measuring distances over a furlong, boundary lengths are listed in rods or poles instead of feet or meters. Rods and poles are equivalent measures equaling 16.5 feet. There are four rods in one chain. The old English surveyors actually carried chains 66 feet in length with which to measure lengths, as well as poles 16.5 feet long, and many older legal descriptions of real estate in the United States are given in chains and poles.  Resolving inconsistencies  Some courts have established a list of priorities to resolve inconsistent descriptions of corners. In descending order starting with the most reliable: (1) natural monuments, (2) artificial monuments such as roads and marked or surveyed lines, (3) adjacent tracts or boundaries, (4) courses or directions, (5) distances, and (6) area or quantity.Stoebuck & Whitman, The Law of Property 827 (3d ed. 2000)  Difficulties  Once such a survey is in place, the corners may have to depend on tradition and long use to establish the line along the boundaries between them. In some areas where land was deeded before 1593, the lengths given predate the changes to the length of the furlong and mile by Queen Elizabeth I. In other places references to the official borders of towns, counties, states and even the U.S. may have changed. Compass directions always have to be tied to a table of annual deflections because magnetic north is constantly changing. The description might refer to landmarks such as the large oak tree which could die, rot and disappear; or be confused with a different tree that had grown over time. Streams might dry up, meander or change course. Man-made features such as roads, walls, markers or stakes used to mark corners and determine the line of the boundaries between corners may have been moved. As these features move, change and disappear over time, when it comes time to re-establish the corners along the line of these boundaries (for sale, subdivision, or building construction) it can become difficult, even impossible, to determine the original location of the corner. In the metes and bounds system, corners, distance, direction, monuments and bounds are always carried back to the original intent regardless of where they are now. Court cases are sometimes required to settle the matter when it is suspected the corner markers may have been moved. These kinds of problems caused the United States to largely replace this system except in the east. Beginning with the Land Ordinance of 1785, it began a transition to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) used in the central and western states. The eastern, or original states, continue to use the metes and bounds surveys of their founders. History of use in the United States  This system was imported to the original colonies that formed the United States. It is also used in some states that were previously part of one of the Thirteen Colonies, or where land was allocated before 1785. These include West Virginia, Kentucky, Maine, Tennessee and Vermont. Because Texas was an independent republic prior to statehood, its land system is primarily metes and bounds. Election constituency boundaries continue to be described by the use of metes and bounds, even in jurisdictions where land plats are not otherwise based upon metes and bounds. Such mapping generally uses streets and their intersections to define the boundaries of election districts, wards, precincts, inter alia. E.g.: \\"From the intersection of Main Street and John Doe Boulevard, thence north to ABC Drive, thence generally east along the median of ABC Drive to 123rd Street, thence...\\"  Use of the term in patent law  In patent law, an application provides background and disclosure necessary to describe an invention, but it is the claims that define the protected aspects. It is therefore said that the claims set out the metes and bounds (see, e.g. in United States patent law, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure § 2173.05(a)) for the protected invention. As a deed might describe a parcel of land, a patent claim carves out systems, methods, etc. that are infringed by something meeting every single one of the claim features. Moreover, an applicant must present an argument for patentability (or, in the United States, an argument against a prima facie case of non-patentability) based only on features found within the claims. The requirement to clearly define the metes and bounds of a claim is found in United States patent law at least at 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, which states, \\"[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\\" See also  *Boundary (real estate) *Beating the bounds *Surveying *Lot and block survey system *Township, civil township, survey township  Notes  Land surveying systems ","title":"Metes and bounds"},{"id":"1208837","text":"Bust of Archidamus III from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, now in the Naples National Archaeological Museum Archidamus III (Ancient Greek: Ἀρχίδαμος Γ΄ Arkhídāmos), the son of Agesilaus II, was king of Sparta from 360 BC to 338 BC. While still a prince, he was the eispnelas (εἰσπνήλας, inspirer, or pederastic lover) of Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias. He interceded with his own father to spare his aites' (ἀΐτας, lover) father's life in a legal matter, an action which further intensified friction between Athens and Sparta. He later led the Spartan forces both before and during his rule. Archidamus headed the force sent to aid the Spartan army after its defeat by the Thebans at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and was commander later during the fighting in the Peloponnese. Four years later he captured Caryae, ravaged the territory of the Parrhasii and defeated the Arcadians, Argives and Messenians in the \\"tearless battle\\", so called because the victory did not cost the Spartans a single life. However, he was in turn defeated by the Arcadians in 364 BC at Cromnus. In 362, he showed great courage in the defense of Sparta against the Theban commander Epaminondas. As king, Archidamus supported the Phocians against Thebes in the Sacred War of 355–346. In 346 BC he went to Crete to help Lyttos in their struggle against Knossos in the Foreign War. In 343 BC, the Spartan colony Tarentum asked for Sparta's help in the war against the Italic populations, notably the Lucanians and the Messapians. In 342 BC Archidamus arrived in Italy with a fleet and a mercenary army and fought against the barbarians, but in 338 BC he was defeated and killed under the walls of Manduria. He was succeeded by his son Agis III, and was also the father of Eudamidas I and another son named Agesilaus.

It is about south of Lamberhurst, Kent. The reservoir was part of a project to increase supplies of water in the area. It supplies not only Southern Water’s customers in the Medway towns, Thanet and Hastings, but is also used by other water companies in the area. Work began to construct the reservoir in 1973 by damming and then flooding a valley. It was completed in 1975 having been filled with over 31,300 million litres of water. The project cost £11 million to build. It is now the largest body of inland water in south east England. In winter, when the flow in the River Medway exceeds 275 million litres per day, river water is pumped to storage in the reservoir. There is an outline plan to raise the water level by a further 3m to increase the yield by up to 30% to help with the growing water demand in south-east England. This will however put further demands on the River Medway to supply the additional water required with the potential for environmental degradation in the river and the eco-systems that it supports. The reservoir in common with most large clean water lakes, is host to a large variety of wildlife. Leisure use Many recreational activities take place on and around the reservoir. These include sailing and windsurfing (formerly through Bewl Valley Sailing Club, now through Bewl Sailing Association Ltd), rowing and sculling (through Bewl Bridge Rowing Club), Canoeing and Kayaking (through Bewl Canoe Club), trout fishing, walking and cycling (on a 12 mile Round Reservoir Route).http://www.bewlwater.co.uk/page.php?section=2&page;=4 Bewl Water Outdoor Centre offers a wide range of training, team building and adventure opportunities, on and around Bewl Water.

Its name derives from its systematic name, dimethylphenylaminobenzoic acid. It was discovered and brought to market by Parke-Davis in the 1960s. It became generic in the 1980s and is available worldwide under many brand names such as Meftal. As of 2015 the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is more than $200. In some other countries it is less expensive: for example, in Austria 30 tablets cost between €3.80 and €7.15 as of 2020. Medical uses Mefenamic acid is used to treat pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, postoperative pain, acute pain including muscle and back pain, toothache and menstrual pain, as well as being prescribed for menorrhagia. There is evidence that supports the use of mefenamic acid for perimenstrual migraine headache prophylaxis, with treatment starting two days prior to the onset of flow or one day prior to the expected onset of the headache and continuing for the duration of menstruation. Mefenamic acid is recommended to be taken with food. Contraindications Mefenamic acid is contraindicated in people who have shown hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and asthma to this drug or to other NSAIDs (e.g. Aspirin); those with peptic ulcers or chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; those with kidney or liver disease; heart failure; after coronary artery bypass surgery; and during the third trimester of pregnancy. Side effects Known mild side effects of mefenamic acid include headaches, nervousness, and vomiting. Potentially serious side effects may include diarrhea, gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcers, hematemesis (vomiting blood), skin reactions (rashes, itching, swelling; in rare cases toxic epidermal necrolysis) and rarely blood cell disorders such as agranulocytosis.Jeffrey K. Aronson. Meyler's Side Effects of Analgesics and Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Elsevier, 2009 It has been associated with acute liver damage. In 2008 the US label was updated with a warning concerning a risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in pregnancy.FDA March 2008 FDA advisory In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. Overdose Symptoms of overdosing include kidney failure, gastrointestinal problems, bleeding, rashes, confusion, hallucinations, vertigo, seizures, and loss of consciousness. It is treated with induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, bone char, and control of electrolytes and vital functions. Interactions Interactions are broadly similar to those of other NSAIDs. Mefenamic acid interferes with the anti–blood clotting mechanism of Aspirin. It increases the blood thinning effects of warfarin and phenprocoumon because it displaces them from their plasma protein binding and increases their free concentrations in the bloodstream. It adds to the risk of gastrointestinal ulcera associated with corticosteroids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It can increase the risk for adverse effects of methotrexate and lithium by lowering their excretion via the kidneys. It can increase the kidney toxicity of ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Combination with antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors, sartans and diuretics can decrease their effectiveness as well as increase the risk for kidney toxicity. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Like other members of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of NSAIDs, it inhibits both isoforms of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

The carboxy groups at the bottom right of each substance can be glucuronidized. Mefenamic acid is rapidly absorbed from the gut and reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to four hours. When in the bloodstream, over 90% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It probably crosses the placenta, and is found in the breast milk in small amounts.Mefenamic Acid . Accessed 2020-07-22. It is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 to the only weakly active 3'-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid. 3'-carboxymefenamic acid has also been identified as a metabolite, as well as carboxy glucuronides of all three substances. Mefenamic acid and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (52–67%) and the faeces (20–25%, or less than 20% following another source). The parent substance has a biological half-life of two hours; the half-life of its metabolites may be longer.

Overview The book details Kpomassie's upbringing in Togo, his encounter as a teen with a book about Greenland and his determination to move there and become a hunter. As A. Alvarez, in his introduction, writes: \\"Kpomassie's book is the ultimate exotic mix—an adventure story that begins in Togo, a narrow strip of a country, formerly a French colony, sandwiched between Benin and Ghana, and ends in Upernavik, way north of the Arctic Circle, on the west coast of Greenland.\\"Alvarez, A.: Introduction, page vii. NYRB Classics, 2001 After ten years, working his way across Africa and Europe, he finally arrives on the Arctic island. The book recounts all the many episodes one expects from adventure literature: trouble at home, imagining a better life elsewhere, the struggle to find that life, disillusionment with certain hard facts that rub against bookish fancies, and the return, a state of mind where the author is more mature and more in touch with reality. Again, as Alvarez points out, the story reads like a fairy tale. Readers discover the meaning of the Togolese bokonon, priest of the sacred python, uncharacteristic forms of French hospitality, German housekeeping, Danish dishwashing, and, most of all, the unusual sense of freedom and casualness of the Inuit people. His encounter with the native Kalaallit population, which is very different but in many ways very similar in its lifestyle to the tribal society of Togo, forms the core of this book. Kpomassie did an interview for the BBC, in which he describes his encounters.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csyx41 References Greenlandic culture Togolese diaspora Togolese literature 1981 non-fiction books ","title":"An African in Greenland"},{"id":"1208849","text":"In politics of the United States, the fourth branch of government is an unofficial term referring to groups or institutions perceived variously as influencing or acting in the stead of the three branches of the US federal government defined in the Constitution of the United States (legislative, executive and judicial). Views as to whether the influence is due or undue or the actions are for good or ill also vary. Such groups can include the press (as a departure from the 'Fourth Estate'), the people (in sum or as grand juries), and interest groups. The Independent administrative agencies of the United States government, while technically part of any one of the three branches, may also be referred to as a ‘fourth branch’. The U.S. intelligence community has also increasingly been seen as a fourth branch. In this regard, the 'fourth branch' aspect of the intelligence community together with interest groups and other external actors intersects significantly with the construct of the 'deep state'.  The press  While the term ‘fourth estate’ is used to emphasize the independence of 'the press', the fourth branch suggests that the press is not independent of the government.Martin A. Lee and Norman Solomon. Unreliable Sources (New York, NY: Lyle Stuart, 1990) The concept of the news media or press as a fourth branch stems from a belief that the media's responsibility to inform the populace is essential to the healthy functioning of democracy. Douglass Cater, in his 1959 \\"The Fourth Branch of Government\\" offered the hypothesis that the press had become \\"a de facto, quasiofficial fourth branch of government\\" and observed it was the looseness of the American political framework that allowed news media to “insert themselves as another branch of the government”. Cater was \\"convinced that, insofar as the press did act as a true political player (rather than an unbiased observer of politics), it corrupted itself and went astray from its primary responsibility—to convey important information and to act as a nonpartisan watchdog for the public against all trespassers on their rights.\\" In 1985, Walter Annenberg noted that several commentators were applying the term 'fourth branch of government' to the press to indicate that it has at least as much if not more power to direct public policy than do the other three branches, in part because of its direct contact with the public and its protection \\"by the First Amendment from responsibility for what they report\\".  The people  Justice Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in United States v. Williams, 1992 has been relied on to refer to grand juries as a fourth branch of government. In that opinion, Scalia wrote: > [T]he grand jury is mentioned in the Bill of Rights, but not in the body of > the Constitution. It has not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of > the branches described in the first three Articles. It 'is a constitutional > fixture in its own right'[case cites]. In fact the whole theory of its > function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government, > serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the > people. Some have used this to call for common law grand juries \\"to expose fraud and corruption whether it is in the judicial or political realm.\\" Others have used the term in calls to, e.g, \\"empower the people\\" by petition or referendum processes or, similarly, for \\"broader and more direct participation in our governance\\" by eliminating the Electoral College, implementing e-voting and other measures.  Interest groups  In an article titled \\"The 'Fourth Branch' of Government\\", Alex Knott of the Center for Public Integrity asserted in 2005 that \\"special interests and the lobbyists they employ have reported spending, since 1998, a total of almost $13 billion to influence Congress, the White House and more than 200 federal agencies.\\"  Administrative agencies  The administrative agencies that are funded from public money may exercise powers granted by Congress. Without appropriate controls and oversight this practice may result in a bureaucracy (in the original literal sense). Some critics have argued that a central paradox at the heart of the American political system is democracy's reliance on what the critics view as undemocratic bureaucratic institutions that characterize the administrative agencies of government.Kevin B. Smith and Michael J. Licari, Public Administrations: Power and Politics in the Fourth Branch of Government (Roxbury, February 2006) An argument made for calling administrative agencies a \\"fourth branch\\" of government is the fact that such agencies typically exercise all three constitutionally divided powers within a single bureaucratic body: That is, agencies legislate (a power vested solely in the legislature by the Constitution)See generally United States Constitution, Article I through delegated rulemaking authority; investigate, execute, and enforce such rules (via the executive power these agencies are typically organized under); and apply, interpret, and enforce compliance with such rules (a power separately vested in the judicial branch).See generally United States Constitution, Article III Additionally, non-executive, or \\"independent\\" administrative agencies are often called a fourth branch of government, as they create rules with the effect of law, yet may be composed at least partially of private, non-governmental actors. = Autonomous actions of U.S. intelligence community = Alfred W. McCoy states that the increase in the power of the U.S. intelligence community since the September 11 attacks \\"has built a fourth branch of the U.S. government\\" that is \\"in many ways autonomous from the executive, and increasingly so.\\" Stephen F. Cohen, in a May 17, 2017 interview with Tucker Carlson said : \\"You and I have to ask a subversive question. Are there really three branches of government. Or is there a fourth branch of government? These intel services?\\" and that a military alliance Obama tried with Putin against terrorism was \\"sabotaged by the Department of Defense and its allies in the intelligence services.\\" Each of Trump's efforts to \\"cooperate with Russia?\\" have been \\"thwarted [by] a new leak of a story.\\" Closely related concepts Bob Jessop, in his book, 'The State: Past, Present, Future’ notes the similarity of three constructs: #’Deep state’ — for which he cites Mike Lofgren’s 2014 definition: \\"a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern … without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process …”. #’Dark state’ — “networks of officials, private firms, media outlets, think tanks, foundations, NGOs, interest groups, and other forces that attend to the needs of capital, not of everyday life” while “concealed from public gaze (or ‘hidden in plain sight’)\\", citing Jason Lindsay (2013).[The Concealment of the State] Jason Royce Lindsey, 2013 pages 35–36 #’The Fourth Branch’ of US government — consisting of “an ever more unchecked and unaccountable centre …, working behind a veil of secrecy”, citing Tom Engelhardt (2014). Per Engelhardt: “Classically, … the three branches of government … were to check and balance one another so that power would never become centralized …. The founding fathers [never envisioned] that a fourth branch of government, the national security state, would arise, dedicated to the centralization of power in an atmosphere of total secrecy. In the post-9/11 years, it has significantly absorbed the other three branches.” In popular culture * In The Simpsons episode \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\" (originally aired October 9, 1994), Springfield's leading conservative talk radio host, Birch Barlow (a parody of leading American conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh) welcomes listeners to his show by introducing himself as the \\"fourth branch of government\\" and the \\"51st state.\\" * In 2007, the short-lived ABC drama- thriller Traveler, the fourth branch existed as a secret society created by the Founding Fathers and composed of the oldest families in the United States, whose purpose is to implement checks and balances on the U.S. government to guide the true course of America. * Rapper and political activist Immortal Technique has a track entitled the \\"4th branch,\\" in which he applies the role of said branch to the media in a pejorative manner. He implies in this track (or pretty much explicitly states) that corporately owned mass-media outlets of the United States act more like another part of the government instead of as independent entities, and he gives some of his reasons for this belief on the track.

Abolitionist Richard and Maria Cosway, and Ottobah Cugoano, (1784) by Richard Cosway In 1784, Stuart was employed as a servant by the artists Richard Cosway and his wife, Maria. Through the Cosways, he came to the attention of leading British political and cultural figures of the time, including the poet William Blake and the Prince of Wales. Together with Olaudah Equiano and other educated Africans living in Britain, Stuart became active in the Sons of Africa, an abolitionist group whose members wrote frequently to the newspapers of the day, condemning the practice of slavery. In 1786 he played a key role in the case of Henry Demane, a kidnapped black man who was to be shipped back to the West Indies. Cugoano contacted Granville Sharp, a well-known abolitionist, who was able to have Demane removed from the ship before it sailed.Harris, Jennifer. \\"Quobna Ottabah Cugoano\\", Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook: 2002, Detroit, MI: Gale Research Company, 2003. Thoughts And Sentiments On The Evil & Wicked Traffic Of The Slavery & Commerce Of The Human Species 1787 – title page In 1787, possibly with the help of his friend Olaudah Equiano, Cugoano published an attack on slavery entitled Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species (1787). By now a devout Christian, he wrote work informed by that religion. His writing called for the abolition of slavery and immediate emancipation of all slaves. It argues that the slave's duty is to escape from slavery, and that force should be used to prevent further enslavement. The narrative was sent to King George III, the Prince of Wales and to Edmund Burke, a leading politician.Peter Fryer, Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain, London: Pluto Press, 1984, p. 101. George III, along with much of the royal family, remained opposed to abolition of the slave trade. Four years later, in 1791, Cugoano published a shorter version of his book, addressed to the \\"Sons of Africa\\". In it, he expressed qualified support for the failed British efforts to establish a colony in Sierra Leone for London's Poor Blacks (mostly freed African-American slaves who had been relocated to London after the American Revolutionary War. Other early settlers were Black Loyalists, also former American slaves, from Nova Scotia, who chose to move to Sierra Leone.) Cugoano called for the establishment of schools in Britain especially for African students. Nothing is known of Cugoano after the release of his book. In August 2020, it was announced that Cugoano is to be honored with a blue plaque in London.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/28/spy-becomes- first-woman-of-south-asian-descent-to-get-blue-plaque-in-london References External links *Thoughts and sentiments on the evil and wicked traffic of the slavery *Narrative of the Enslavement of Ottobah Cugoano, a Native of Africa, London: Printed for the Author and Sold by Hatchard and Co., 1825, online text at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina. *Resources for the study of Cugoano, Brycchan Carey Website *Adam Hochschild, \\"The Unsung Heroes of Abolition\\", History, BBC, page includes engraving by Richard Cosway, possibly of Cugoano *Selected Passages from Narrative of the Enslavement of a Native of Africa, Spartacus Educational 18th-century British writers Abolitionism in the United Kingdom African slave trade 1757 births Year of death missing English people of Ghanaian descent Ghanaian writers Ghanaian abolitionists Black British former slaves Black British writers British abolitionists Black British activists People from Central Region (Ghana) ","title":"Ottobah Cugoano"},{"id":"1208870","text":"CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V., known as Cemex, is a Mexican multinational building materials company headquartered in San Pedro, near Monterrey, Mexico.

History CEMEX was founded with the opening of Cementos Hidalgo, in 1906. Meanwhile, Cementos Portland Monterrey began operations in 1920, and in 1931, the two companies merged, becoming Cementos Mexicanos, now CEMEX. In the 1960s, CEMEX grew significantly when it acquired several more plants throughout Mexico. In 1976, the company went public on the Mexican stock exchange, and that same year, became the largest cement producer in Mexico with the purchase of three plants from Cementos Guadalajara. In 1982, the company made significant progress in overseas markets, doubling its exports. Further acquisitions of Mexican cement companies were made in 1987 and 1989, making CEMEX one of the ten largest cement companies in the world. In 2004, CEMEX received the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for their creative and efficient use of information technology.https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/business- transformation-awards.aspx =Internationalization, 1990–2006= In 1992, CEMEX began its push into the international landscape with the purchase of Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana de Cementos (Valcem, currently head of CEMEX Spain) and Cementos SANSON. Venezuela's largest cement company, VENCEMOS, was acquired by CEMEX in 1994, and plants were purchased the same year in the United States and in Panama. In 1995 CEMEX acquired a cement company in the Dominican Republic, and with the purchase of a majority stake in a Colombian cement company in 1996, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In 1997–1999, the company expanded its scope to include Asia and Africa, making major purchases in the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt, as well as Costa Rica. The acquisition of U.S. based Southdown made CEMEX the largest cement company in North America, and further international purchases were made in the following two years—a Thai company in 2001, and in 2002, a Puerto Rican company. On March 1, 2005, CEMEX completed its $5.8 billion acquisition of the London-based RMC Group, which made CEMEX the worldwide leader in ready-mix concrete production and increased its exposure to European markets. With the acquisition, the company expected its annual cement production to increase to 97 million tons. Also they had hoped to see its annual sales grow to $15 billion, just shy of the market leader, Lafarge , which had sales of $17 billion. As none of these targets was met, CEMEX started looking for another suitor in its M&A; push. On October 27, 2006, CEMEX announced a US$12.8 billion offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Rinker Group, Limited. Seven months later, on April 10, 2007, the Rinker board of directors approved an upgraded offer of USD 14.2 billion, and on June 7, 2007, CEMEX secured the commitment from the holders of more than 50% of the shares to complete the acquisition. =Recent history (2006–)= In November 2006, an American embassy cable released via WikiLeaks listed Cemex among \\"Mexico's monopolists\\", with a market share of 87.6%; its competitor Holcim Apasco was listed with a market share of 12.4%. (see also ) Shortly after the apparent finalization of the Rinker deal on 2007, the United States Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against CEMEX, blocking the acquisition.Source: http://www.fromthedoj.com/2009/03/us-doj-blocks-cemex- acquisition-of-rinker/ After a lengthy process, CEMEX complied with regulators by divesting (selling) 40+ cement and concrete plants formerly part of itself or Rinker, essentially devaluing the initial deal.http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f243500/243560.htm In April 2008, the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, announced the nationalization of \\"the whole cement industry\\" in that country, in response to the belief that the industry was exporting its products in order to receive prices above those it was allowed within the country.Hugo Chavez Nationalizes Cement Industry, CBS News, April 4, 2008. In mid-2008 the Venezuelan government took over the Venezuelan operations of CEMEX, the largest Venezuelan producer with around a 50% market share; a deal on compensation was still to be reached in March 2009, despite agreements being reached in mid-2008 with the other two major cement producers. In December 2011, an agreement was reached, with Cemex receiving $600m in compensation, and benefiting from the cancellation of $154m in debt.Cemex, CEMEX and Venezuela sign agreement on compensation for nationalization of CEMEX Venezuela After having problems with the Mexican peso devaluation of 2008, including problems with derivatives,http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2008/10/10/precarious- peso-pounds-cemex.aspx CEMEX had to rethink its international standings to decrease debt and avoid a default. In June 2009, CEMEX sold its Australian operations to Holcim for A$ 2.2 billion (US$1.75 billion) helping refinance its US$14 billion debt, which partly was due to the acquisition, two years earlier, of the Rinker Group. In December 2010, DOL Resolves Employee Back Wage Case With CEMEX – The U.S. Department of Labor announced the filing of a consent judgment in a case against CEMEX Inc. and the recovery of $1,514,449 in overtime back wages for 1,705 current and former ready-mix drivers who worked in eight states. In February 2018, the company reported record earnings of $750 million for all of 2016, the highest in a decade. Lowering company debt after recent acquisitions were a main cause of the company's financial performance.

The fine was the highest ever given under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulations, and was also the highest for an Environment Agency prosecution for six years.ENDS Report 381, October 2006, pp 4-5 The fine was, however, judged excessive by the Court of Appeal and so reduced to £50,000.ENDS Report 391, August 2007 In April 2007, CEMEX announced that it had installed a £6.5 million dust abatement system at the same works in Rugby, which had cut particulate emissions by 80%. The site comes under the auspices of the EU Waste Incineration Directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel. There are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice, although it is common practice in many cement works.ENDS Report 388, May 2007, p 29 During tests conducted from June 10 to August 5, 2008, the Monterey Bay (California) Unified Air Pollution Control District reported high levels of chromium VI, also known as hexavalent chromium, a cancer causing chemical agent, at an elementary school and fire department in Davenport, California. Chromium VI is the contaminant that inspired the movie, Erin Brockovich. The toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the Cemex Cement plant in Davenport, as the levels of Chromium VI measured eight times the air district's acceptable level at Pacific Elementary School and 10 times at the Davenport Fire Department. Both are located less than a half-mile from CEMEX.Source: http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_10630621 Chromium VI may have been unwittingly produced at the CEMEX plant in Davenport for the last seven years. According to Ed Kendig, the executive director of the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, it's \\"highly possible\\" that Chromium VI continues to be produced across the country as an accidental, previously unknown byproduct of the cement-making process.Source: http://www.metrosantacruz.com/metro-santa-cruz/10.15.08/nuz-0842.html In 2007, the EPA filed a complaint against CEMEX for violating federal air regulations at its Victorville plant, and in 2006, CEMEX was cited for violations at plants in Santa Barbara and Michigan. Environmentalists and scientists are concerned for the Monterey Bay coastline where Cemex has a sand mining operation in the city of Marina, California. The California Coastal Commission in March 2016 issued a Cease and Desist order asking for \\"administration civil penalties\\" stating that \\"the operation is narrowing beaches and impacting environmentally sensitive habitat.\\" Cemex denies the allegations and as of May 2017 continues to operate.

Named after Claude Shannon, the source coding theorem shows that (in the limit, as the length of a stream of independent and identically-distributed random variable (i.i.d.) data tends to infinity) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate (average number of bits per symbol) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source, without it being virtually certain that information will be lost. However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy, with negligible probability of loss. The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word (which is viewed as a random variable) and of the size of the target alphabet.  Statements  Source coding is a mapping from (a sequence of) symbols from an information source to a sequence of alphabet symbols (usually bits) such that the source symbols can be exactly recovered from the binary bits (lossless source coding) or recovered within some distortion (lossy source coding). This is the concept behind data compression. = Source coding theorem = In information theory, the source coding theorem (Shannon 1948) informally states that (MacKay 2003, pg. 81, Cover 2006, Chapter 5): > i.i.d. random variables each with entropy can be compressed into more than > bits with negligible risk of information loss, as ; but conversely, if they > are compressed into fewer than bits it is virtually certain that information > will be lost. = Source coding theorem for symbol codes = Let denote two finite alphabets and let and denote the set of all finite words from those alphabets (respectively). Suppose that is a random variable taking values in and let be a uniquely decodable code from to where . Let denote the random variable given by the length of codeword . If is optimal in the sense that it has the minimal expected word length for , then (Shannon 1948): : frac{H(X)}{log_2 a} leq mathbb{E}[S] < frac{H(X)}{log_2 a} +1 Where mathbb{E} denotes the expected value operator.  Proof: Source coding theorem  Given is an i.i.d. source, its time series is i.i.d. with entropy in the discrete-valued case and differential entropy in the continuous-valued case. The Source coding theorem states that for any , i.e. for any rate larger than the entropy of the source, there is large enough and an encoder that takes i.i.d. repetition of the source, , and maps it to binary bits such that the source symbols are recoverable from the binary bits with probability of at least . Proof of Achievability. Fix some , and let :p(x_1, ldots, x_n) = Pr left[X_1 = x_1, cdots, X_n = x_n right]. The typical set, , is defined as follows: :A_n^varepsilon =left{(x_1, cdots, x_n)  :  left-frac{1}{n} log p(x_1, cdots, x_n) - H_n(X)right < varepsilon right}. The Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) shows that for large enough , the probability that a sequence generated by the source lies in the typical set, , as defined approaches one. In particular, for sufficiently large , P((X_1,X_2,cdots,X_n) in A_n^varepsilon) can be made arbitrarily close to 1, and specifically, greater than 1-varepsilon (See AEP for a proof). The definition of typical sets implies that those sequences that lie in the typical set satisfy: :2^{-n(H(X)+varepsilon)} leq p left (x_1, cdots, x_n right ) leq 2^{-n(H(X)-varepsilon)} Note that: *The probability of a sequence (X_1,X_2,cdots X_n) being drawn from is greater than . *left A_n^varepsilon right leq 2^{n(H(X)+varepsilon)}, which follows from the left hand side (lower bound) for p(x_1,x_2,cdots x_n). *left A_n^varepsilon right geq (1-varepsilon) 2^{n(H(X)-varepsilon)}, which follows from upper bound for p(x_1,x_2,cdots x_n) and the lower bound on the total probability of the whole set . Since left A_n^varepsilon right leq 2^{n(H(X)+varepsilon)}, n(H(X)+varepsilon) bits are enough to point to any string in this set. The encoding algorithm: The encoder checks if the input sequence lies within the typical set; if yes, it outputs the index of the input sequence within the typical set; if not, the encoder outputs an arbitrary digit number. As long as the input sequence lies within the typical set (with probability at least ), the encoder doesn't make any error. So, the probability of error of the encoder is bounded above by . Proof of Converse. The converse is proved by showing that any set of size smaller than (in the sense of exponent) would cover a set of probability bounded away from .  Proof: Source coding theorem for symbol codes  For let denote the word length of each possible . Define q_i = a^{-s_i}/C, where is chosen so that . Then :begin{align} H(X) &= -sum_{i=1}^n p_i log_2 p_i  &leq -sum_{i=1}^n p_i log_2 q_i  &= -sum_{i=1}^n p_i log_2 a^{-s_i} + sum_{i=1}^n p_i log_2 C  &= -sum_{i=1}^n p_i log_2 a^{-s_i} + log_2 C  &leq -sum_{i=1}^n - s_i p_i log_2 a  &leq mathbb{E} S log_2 a  end{align} where the second line follows from Gibbs' inequality and the fifth line follows from Kraft's inequality: :C = sum_{i=1}^n a^{-s_i} leq 1 so . For the second inequality we may set :s_i = lceil - log_a p_i rceil so that : - log_a p_i leq s_i < -log_a p_i + 1 and so : a^{-s_i} leq p_i and : sum a^{-s_i} leq sum p_i = 1 and so by Kraft's inequality there exists a prefix-free code having those word lengths. Thus the minimal satisfies :begin{align} mathbb{E} S & = sum p_i s_i  & < sum p_i left( -log_a p_i +1 right)  & = sum - p_i frac{log_2 p_i}{log_2 a} +1  & = frac{H(X)}{log_2 a} +1  end{align} Extension to non-stationary independent sources  = Fixed Rate lossless source coding for discrete time non-stationary independent sources= Define typical set as: :A_n^varepsilon = left {x_1^n  :  left-frac{1}{n} log p left (X_1, cdots, X_n right ) - overline{H_n}(X)right < varepsilon right }. Then, for given , for large enough, . Now we just encode the sequences in the typical set, and usual methods in source coding show that the cardinality of this set is smaller than 2^{n(overline{H_n}(X)+varepsilon)}. Thus, on an average, bits suffice for encoding with probability greater than , where and can be made arbitrarily small, by making larger.

It is one of the earliest English history plays, and focuses on the relationship between King Edward II of England and Piers Gaveston, and Edward's murder on the orders of Roger Mortimer. Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). Frederick S. Boas believes that \\"out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed\\" Marlowe was drawn to \\"the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II\\" due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston. Boas elaborates, \\"Homosexual affection ... has (as has been seen) a special attraction for Marlowe. Jove and Ganymede in Dido, Henry III and his 'minions' in The Massacre, Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander, and all akin, although drawn to a slighter scale, to Edward and Gaveston.\\"Frederick S. Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 174f Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris, asserting that \\"it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi–xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II.\\" Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn (or Lucifer) as Edward's assassin. Publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death. The earliest extant edition was published in octavo in 1594, printed by Robert Robinson for the bookseller William Jones;Logan and Smith, p. 31. a second edition, issued in 1598, was printed by Richard Braddock for Jones. Subsequent editions were published in 1612, by Richard Barnes, and in 1622, by Henry Bell. The 1594 first edition of the play is very rare and was uncovered only in 1876.The Atheneum, No. 2562, 2 Dec. 1876. Only one copy, held at the Zentralbibliothek Zürich, was known to exist after a second was lost in the Second World War. In 2012, a third copy was discovered in Germany by Jeffrey Masten. The volume was bound with a treatise arguing against the execution of heretics and another on Turkey and Islam. Authorship The authorship of the play has never been in doubt. Dodsley included it in his Select Collection of Old Plays in 1744, but Marlowe's name was not even mentioned in the preface.Robert Dodsley.

Marlowe's play opens at the outset of the reign, with Edward's exiled favourite, Piers Gaveston, rejoicing at the recent death of Edward I and his own resulting ability to return to England. In the following passage he plans the entertainments with which he will delight the king: Upon Gaveston's re-entry into the country, Edward gives him titles, access to the royal treasury, and the option of having guards protect him. Although Gaveston himself is not of noble birth, he maintains that he is better than common people and craves pleasing shows, Italian masques, music and poetry. However, as much as Gaveston pleases the king he finds scant favour from the king's nobles, who are soon clamouring for Gaveston's exile. Almost as soon as he arrives, Gaveston and Edward's court begin to quarrel. Edward is forced to agree to this and banishes Gaveston to Ireland. Isabella of France, the Queen, who still hopes for his favour, persuades Mortimer, who later becomes her lover, to argue for his recall, though only so that he may be more conveniently murdered. The nobles accordingly soon find an excuse to turn on Gaveston again, and eventually capture and execute him. Before executing Gaveston, Edward requests to see Gaveston one more time. Arundel and Pembroke agree to Edward's request. However, Warwick attacks and kills Gaveston while he is being taken to Edward. Edward in turn executes two of the nobles who persecuted Gaveston, Warwick and Lancaster. Edward then seeks comfort in new favourites, Spencer and his father. This alienates Isabella, who takes Mortimer as her lover and travels to France with her son in search of allies. France, however, will not help the queen and refuses to give her arms, although she does get help from Sir John of Hainault. Edward, both in the play and in history, is nothing like the soldier his father was – it was during his reign that the English army was disastrously defeated at Bannockburn – and is soon . Edward takes refuge in Neath Abbey, but is betrayed by a mower, who emblematically carries a scythe. Both Spencers are executed, and the king himself is taken to Kenilworth. His brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, after having initially renounced his cause, now tries to help him but realizes too late the power the young Mortimer now has. Arrested for approaching the imprisoned Edward, Edmund is taken to court, where Mortimer, Isabella, and Edward III preside. He is executed by Mortimer, who claims he is a threat to the throne, despite the pleading of Edward III. The prisoner king is then taken to Berkeley Castle, where he meets the luxuriously cruel Lightborn, whose name is an anglicised version of \\"Lucifer\\". Despite knowing that Lightborn is there to kill him, Edward asks him to stay by his side. Lightborn, realizing that the king will not fall for delay, has him restrained by four men, and murders him by burning out his bowels from the inside with a red hot poker (so as not to leave external marks of violence). Maltravers and Gurney witness this, before Gurney kills Lightborn to keep his silence. Later, however, Gurney flees, and Mortimer sends Maltravers after him, as they fear betrayal. Isabella arrives to warn Mortimer that Edward III, her son with Edward II, has discovered their plot. Before they can plan accordingly, her son arrives with attendants and other lords, accusing Mortimer of murder. Mortimer denies this, but eventually is arrested and taken away. He tells Isabella not to weep for him, and the queen begs her son to show Mortimer mercy, but he refuses. Edward III then orders Mortimer's death and his mother's imprisonment, and the play ends with him taking the throne.  Themes  =Homoeroticism= Edward and Gaveston's homoerotic relationship provides the backdrop for the play. When Gaveston plans to produce his masque, he describes \\"a lovely boy in Dian's shape… / And in his sportful hands an olive tree / To hide those parts which men delight to see\\" (1.2.60–63). Gaveston is deeply aware of the theatre's ability to eroticize young male actors. The Queen feels jealous of Gaveston and Edward's relationship, noting: \\"For now my lord the king regards me not, / But dotes upon the love of Gaveston. / He claps his cheeks and hangs about his neck, / Smiles in his face and whispers in his ears\\" (2.2.49–52). Much of the criticism on Edward II focuses on homoeroticism and power. For example, Emily Bartels's Spectacles of Strangeness—which focuses on how Marlowe depicts \\"others\\" and how that depiction exposes \\"demonization of the other as a strategy for self- authorization and self-empowerment\\"—has a chapter on Edward II entitled \\"The Show of Sodomy.\\"Bartels, Emily. Spectacles of Strangeness. University of Pennsylvania Press,1993.P.XV. In this chapter, Bartels focuses on how sodomy is politicized, exposed, and defined, stating, \\"In Marlowe, sodomy is finally neither unseeable nor unspeakable. Rather it is exposed as a subject obscured and displayed as beyond display by those who would maintain a hegemonic hold over 'what the matter meant.'\\"Bartels, Emily. Spectacles of Strangeness. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993. P.145. In order to show how sodomy works in Marlowe's plays, Bartels places particular attention to the tension between how sodomy is hidden in the play and then sanctioned as the means of killing Edward.Bartels, Emily. Spectacles of Strangeness. University of Pennsylvania, 1993, 143-73 Bartels pays close attention to the fact that Lightborn's murder of the king leaves no marks on his body. She concludes that \\"sodomical leanings...are not politically corrupt. Though largely unspoken, they are not unspeakable.\\"Bartels, Emily. Spectacles of Strangeness. University of Pennsylvania, 1993. p.172. Sodomy was not a clearly defined act in the early modern period. Jonathan Goldberg asserts that sodomy was \\"invisible so long as homosexual acts failed to connect with the much more visible signs of social disruption represented by unorthodox religious or social positions.\\"Goldberg, Jonathan. \\"Sodomy and Society:The Case of Cristopher Marlowe.\\" Staging the Renaissance: Reinterpretations of Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama. Edited by David Kastan and Peter Stallybrass, Routledge, 1991. David Stymeist reconciles two opposing critical approaches to Edward II—one that views the play as subversive towards sexual norms and one that upholds sexual norms—by paying attention to how the play presents alternative sexuality and how it punishes sexual transgressions.Stymeist, David. \\"Status, Sodomy, and the Theatre in Marlowe's 'Edward II.'\\" Studies in English Literature, 1590-1900, vol.44, no.2, 2004, pp.233-253. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844628 =Religion= Edward II presents tension between the church and the state. When Edward and Gaveston strip the Bishop of Coventry of his lands and possessions, they joke subversively about religious traditions. Edward and Gaveston mock the Bishop as they attack him. Before the play takes place, the Bishop advocates for Gaveston's exile. As Edward and Gaveston attack the Bishop, they mock Catholic symbols as they assert their power over the Bishop: Gaveston: Saving your reverence, you must pardon me. [He lays hold of him.] Edward: Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole, And in the channel christen him anew (1.1.185–89). Edward and Gaveston attack the symbols of the church—baptisms, pardons, and church attire—to humiliate the Bishop. After Edward allows Gaveston to take the Bishop's possessions, Gaveston states, \\"A prison may beseem his holiness\\" (1.1.206). Later in the play, the Archbishop of Canterbury threatens to \\"discharge these lords / Of duty and allegiance to [Edward],\\" and Edward asks, \\"Why should a king be subject to a priest?\\" (1.4.61–62, 96). In her essay \\"Marlowe, History, and Politics,\\" Paulina Kewes asserts that Edward II uses religious history to comment on politics: \\"Marlowe...[invites] the audience to consider the contingent religious colouring of the conflict between the crown and the nobility...Marlowe's target is the widespread use of religion to justify political heterodoxy.\\"\\"Marlowe, History, and Politics.\\" Kewes, Paulina. Christopher Marlowe in Context, edited by Emily Bartels and Emma Simth, Cambridge UP, 2013. pp.138-154. =Social status= Edward II is a play that is deeply aware of social status and its relationship to birthrights. Mortimer is deeply resentful of Gaveston's social mobility and repeatedly claims that Gaveston is \\"hardly a gentleman by birth\\" (1.4.29). Later, when Mortimer Senior asserts that \\"the mightiest kings have had their minions\\" (1.4.390), Mortimer responds that Gaveston's \\"wanton humour grieves [him] not, but this [he scorns], that one so basely born / Should by his sovereign's favour grow so pert / And riot it with the treasure of the realm\\" (1.4.401–04). The nobility's treatment of Spencer and Spencer Senior mirrors their treatment of Gaveston. When Spencer and Lancaster start arguing about treason, Pembroke responds by calling Spencer a \\"base upstart\\" (3.3.21). The nobility also call Spencer a flatterer multiple times. However, in Edward II, social mobility, social status, and power come with consequences. Clifford Leech shows how the play ties together themes of power, social status, and suffering, stating, \\"In Tamburlaine [Marlowe] had already contemplated power, and saw the spectacle inevitably involved suffering. Here the suffering, still consequential on the exercise and the dream of power, is the major fact.\\"Leech, Clifford. \\"Marlowe's 'Edward II': Power and Suffering.\\" The Critical Quarterly,Vol. 1. Spring 1959. pp. 181-197 Leech notes that each of the characters who strives for power or holds a powerful position in the play—Edward, Gaveston, the Queen, and Mortimer—each meets a tragic end as they vie for power Stage history and adaptations According to Andrew Gurr, the first known performance of Edward II was in 1592 by the Earl of Pembroke's Men, possibly at the Theatre.Gurr, Andrew. The Shakespearean Stage 1574-1642. Cambridge UP,2009 Roslyn Knutson has speculated on the original performance for Edward II. In her essay, \\"Marlowe, Company Ownership, and the Role of Edward II,\\" she argues that Edward II was written for Edward Alleyn and Strange's Men; however, Pembroke's Men performed Edward II with Richard Burbage (the most prominent actor in William Shakespeare's playing company) as Edward.Knutson, Roslyn. \\"Marlowe, Company Ownership, and the Role of Edward II.\\" Medieval & Renaissance England, Vol. 18. (2005) Rosemont Publishing & Printing Corp DBA Associate University Press, 2005. pp.37-46 Knutson uses the number of lines assigned to players, Marlowe's familiarity to the different play companies, and the role of Isabella to provide evidence for her argument. She concludes that Burbage's performance in Edward II influenced how Shakespeare designed roles for Burbage. The first quarto of 1594 states that the play had been performed by the Earl of Pembroke's Men. According to E.K. Chambers, Edward II was one of three plays sold to booksellers—along with The Taming of A Shrew and The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York—and was probably the only one of those three not worked on by Shakespeare. Mathew Martin argues that the Roger Barnes's 1612 version of Edward II—while traditionally seen as a corrupt publishing of the play—reveals how the play was received in Jacobean England and how the play was revised to draw attention to King James's controversial promotion of male favorites.Martin, Mathew. \\"Accidents Happen: Roger Barnes's 1612 Edition of Marlowe's 'Edward II'.\\" Early Theatre, Vol.16.No.1., 2003. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43499695Italic text' The title page of the 1622 edition states that the play was performed by Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre, showing that Edward II was still in the active repertory well into the seventeenth century.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 425. Since the twentieth century, the play has been revived several times, usually in such a way as to make explicit Edward's homosexuality. Marlowe's play was revived in November 1961 in a student performance at the University of Nottingham.Taken from the Nottingham University Dramatic Society programme A 1969 production directed by Clifford Williams for Theatre Toronto featured prominent Stratford Festival actors, including William Hutt as Edward II and Richard Monette as Gaveston. It was frequently revived in the 1970s. The Prospect Theatre Company's production of the play, starring Ian McKellen and James Laurenson, caused a sensation when it was broadcast by the BBC during the 1970s (as it included the first gay kiss transmitted on British television). Numerous other productions followed, starring actors such as Simon Russell Beale and Joseph Fiennes. In 1995 a ballet adaptation was created for Stuttgart Ballet. In 1977, the 26-episode BBC radio drama Vivat Rex included an abridged version of the play as its first two episodes. John Hurt portrayed Edward. In 1986, Nicholas Hytner directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Ian McDiarmid, Michael Grandage, Iain Glen and Duncan Bell. In 1991, the play was adapted into a film by Derek Jarman which used modern costumes and made overt reference to the gay rights movement and the Stonewall riots. The Washington, D.C.'s Shakespeare Theatre Company 2007 staging used mostly fascist-era and jazz age costumes. The production strongly emphasized the gay relationship between Edward II and Gaveston and was one of two Marlowe works inaugurating the company's new Sidney Harman Hall. In 2011, EM-LOU Productions staged the play at The Rose Theatre, Bankside, returning it for the first time in 400 years to the space where it may have had its very first production. The production was directed by Peter Darney. In October 2013, the New National Theatre Tokyo staged the play in Japanese, featuring Mori Shintaro as a director. In July 2016, an adaptation opened at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, Australia, directed by Matthew Lutton and written by Anthony Weigh. In January 2019, An Other Theater Company in Provo, Utah staged the play for the first time in the state. The production was co-directed by Jessamyn Svensson and Kailey Azure Green. In December 2019, the play was once again revived by the Nottingham New Theatre at the University of Nottingham, 59 years after the first revival. https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Nottingham/The-Nottingham-New- Theatre/Edward-II-by-Christopher-Marlowe/13674527/ =Bertolt Brecht's adaptation= The play was adapted by Bertolt Brecht and Lion Feuchtwanger\\"I wrote this play with Lion Feuchtwanger\\"; Dedication page from Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England, 1924. in 1923 as The Life of Edward II of England (Leben Eduard des Zweiten von England). The Brecht version, while acknowledging Marlowe's play as its source, uses Brecht's own words, ideas, and structure, and is regarded as a separate work. The German premiere took place in 1924 under Brecht's direction at the Munich Kammerspiele with Erwin Faber and Hans Schweikart as Edward and Baldock; the New York premiere of Brecht's The Life of Edward II of England took place in 1982, staged by W.

Entering service in 1941, the ship was on loan from the Royal Navy. Early in her career, Norman participated in Operation Vigorous and the Madagascar campaign, but spent most of the time between 1942 and the start of 1945 on uneventful patrols of the Indian Ocean. In January 1945, the destroyer was involved in the Burma campaign, before being transferred from the British Eastern Fleet to the British Pacific Fleet. During April and May, Norman was involved in the Battle of Okinawa, but then spent the rest of World War II as the duty destroyer at Manus Island. Norman was returned to the Royal Navy in October 1945. The ship was not reactivated, and was broken up for scrap in 1958. Design and construction The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,773 tons at standard load, and 2,550 tons at full load.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 69 Norman was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to the ship's two propellers. Norman was capable of reaching . The ship's company consisted of 226 officers and sailors. The ship's armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, two Pentad torpedo launcher tube sets (with 10 torpedoes carried), two depth-charge throwers and one depth-charge chute (with 45 charges carried). The 4-inch gun was removed later in Normans career. The destroyer was laid down by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Southampton, England on 27 July 1939. She was launched on 30 October 1940. Norman was commissioned into the RAN on 29 September 1941; although operated as an Australian warship, the vessel remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship takes her name from the Normans, with her ship's badge depicting a Norman warrior's helmet. She was the only N-class destroyer to be given a motto: \\"Cedere Nescio\\" or \\"I Know Not How To Yield\\".Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 71 Construction cost 402,939 pounds. Operational history The destroyer's first mission after completing sea trials in October 1941 was to deliver a British trade union delegation from Iceland to Russia.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 70 Norman then spent some time as an escort ship, then sailed to Southampton for minor modifications. At the start of 1942, the destroyer was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet. From January until May, Norman served as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean, before being recalled to participate in the convoy escort screen for Operation Vigorous, one of two major convoys attempting to supply the island of Malta. After this, she returned to the Indian Ocean, and during September was involved in the Madagascar campaign. The destroyer spent the remainder of 1942, all of 1943, and the early part of 1944 on uneventful patrols of the Indian Ocean. In late March 1944, Norman sailed to Sydney for a two-month-long refit. This concluded in late June, and Norman returned to the Eastern Fleet. In January 1945, Norman became involved in the campaign to free Burma from the Japanese. On 21 January, the ship helped land Indian troops on Ramree Island as part of Operation Matador, then bombarded Cheduba Island five days later prior to the landing of Royal Marines. On 1 March, the ship sailed to Australia to join the British Pacific Fleet. As part of the Pacific Fleet, Norman was involved in the Battle of Okinawa during April and May, but left before the operation's conclusion to escort the collision-damaged destroyer as she was towed to Leyte for repairs. After delivering her charge, Norman joined the United States Fifth Fleet for a short period, then sailed for Australia, arriving in Sydney on 6 June. The destroyer returned to service in early July, and was assigned to Manus Island as the general duty destroyer until the end of World War II. After the war's end, Norman sailed to Japan, but did not arrive to participate in the Japanese surrender. The destroyer's wartime service was recognised with the battle honours \\"Indian Ocean 1942–44\\", \\"East Indies 1944\\", \\"Burma 1944–45\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\".

Bredero, Amstelredammer\\", and sometimes he is called Breero or Brederode. He was the third child of Marry Gerbrants and Adriaen Cornelisz Bredero, who was a shoemaker and a successful real estate agent. Bredero was born in the Nes, nowadays number 41, and in 1602 he and his family moved to a house on Oudezijds Voorburgwal, now number 244, which his father had bought. Bredero lived in this house for the rest of his life. Both houses are now restaurants in Amsterdam's famous red light district. At school Bredero learned French and possibly also some English and Latin. Later he was educated as an artist by the Antwerp painter Francesco Badens, but none of his paintings have survived. In 1611 he became a member of the rederijkerskamer d'Eglantier, where he was an active member and became friends with Roemer Visscher and P.C.Hooft. Together with Hooft he joined Costers Nederduytsche Academie. Around this time he wrote the play \\"De Spaanschen Brabander Jerolimo\\". The only public position Bredero achieved was as vaandrig or standard bearer of the civic guard. On 23 August 1618, at the age of 33, Bredero suddenly died, shortly after he had recovered from pneumonia that he had contracted after falling through ice. He never married.

The village is situated 7 miles south west of Royal Tunbridge Wells and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from Crowborough; the parish covers approximately . Geography Withyham parish lies on the edge of Weald, in the valley of the River Medway, where a group of tributaries enter from the south, and to the north of Ashdown Forest. The B2110 road passes Dorset Armsthrough the village, between Groombridge and Forest Row. Much of the area is rural; the hamlet of Buckhurst, part of the parish, contains Buckhurst Park, the home of Lord De La Warr. New Groombridge is also within the parish, and Old Groombridge is in the Speldhurst District of Kent. Withyham village itself is very small, containing a few houses, the church, a bed and breakfast, and the Dorset Arms (a village pub which was once a farmhouse). History =Buckhurst and Gildredge= Withyham is not included in the Domesday Book, although the manor of Buckhurst is, as \\"Biochest\\" (probably from the Saxon \\"boc hyrst\\" or beech wood. There have been two houses at Buckhurst for many centuries: the older Buckhurst House, now no more, and the present day Buckhurst Park: both remained in the hands of the Sackville family for generations. Buckhurst Park is the family seat of the De La Warr earldom, and William Sackville, 11th Earl De La Warr continues to live there. Outside Buckhurst, many of the houses in the village were probably built to contain estate workers. A significant number of council houses were built in the post- war period at Balls Green, near a now-closed railway station. Withyham was also home to the Gildredge family, who later moved to Eastbourne, acquiring a large share of the town's land by purchase and through marriage. \\"Gildredge House and estate was formerly the property and residence of the family of the same name,\\" says Thomas Walker Horsfield in his history of Sussex, \\"who afterwards (temp. Henry VIII) removed to and became lords of the manor of Eastbourne.\\" Today's Gildredge Park in Eastbourne is named after the family. The Gildredge family was related to the Eversfield family, who eventually owned much of St. Leonards-on-Sea, as well as to the Levetts. According to the Sussex historian Mark Antony Lower, the ancient house and estate of Gildredge \\"gave name to a family of considerable antiquity, who subsequently had their chief residence at Eastbourne, and gave their name to the manor of Eastbourne- Gildredge.\\" Later the Gildredge lands were carried by marriage into the Gilbert family (today's Davies-Gilbert family), who continue to own much of Eastbourne. Withyham parish is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. =Withyham church= Much of the oldest available historical information concerning the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey, with records going back to 1288, relates to the parish church, St. Michael's. St Michael and All Angels Church, Withyham The village church is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels; the present rector is the Reverend Canon James Campbell. According to early records, the church was almost completely rebuilt in the 14th century to contain a Sackville chapel. On 16 June 1663 the church was struck by lightning, which melted the bells and caused a great deal of damage; few parts of the building survived. The rebuilding of the church does not seem to have been finished until 1672, and the Sackville Chapel was not completed for a further eight years. Of the old church, only the lower part of the tower, the west wall from the belfry door to the north-west corner, and the north and south-east walls remained to be incorporated into the new building. It was also around this time that the rectory was built. Later important alterations were carried out in the 19th century, including a new south aisle, the removal of the low ceiling, and the construction of a new south porch. In 1849, a set of four paintings was donated to the church: it is thought they are the work of Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (c. 1340–1414). The paintings were sold at Sotheby's in London in 2012. There are eight bells in the tower. Five bells were recast after the rebuilding in 1674, and a sixth (treble) bell was added in 1715. These bells remained until 1908, when they were recast and a further two added. The ashes of David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir are buried at the church. Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset is buried there as well. The Church is also a filming location used in the 1976 concert film The Song Remains the Same (film) featuring the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the location for the night time fantasy scene starring Led Zeppelin's Bass and Keyboard Player John Paul Jones (musician). Governance Withyham is a large parish, and is therefore divided into three electoral wards: Groombridge; Withyham, including Blackham; and St Johns (Withyham). Landmarks Penn's Rocks is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the parish. This is a site of biological interest. Its sandstone outcrops providing a rare habitat for many ferns and bryophytes.

Milne in his Winnie-the-Pooh stories, is part of the Buckhurst Estate The millennium in Withyham To celebrate the millennium in Withyham, the 11th Earl De La Warr planted a yew sapling taken from a tree said to be 2,000 years old – i.e. from the time of Christ. The sapling was uprooted by vandals, but was replanted by Earl De La Warr. A millennium map was also commissioned by the Church to commemorate almost 1,000 years of Withyham. Public transport The village has a regular bus service. The Metrobus 291 bus route serves East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells, and Crawley – as well as neighbouring villages. In nearby Ashurst there is a railway station. Ashurst station is on the Uckfield to London line via Oxted and East Croydon. Trains are hourly in each direction.

The name POEMS is an acronym for some of the disease's major signs and symptoms (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, myeloma protein, and skin changes), as is PEP (polyneuropathy, endocrinopathy, plasma cell dyscrasia). The signs and symptoms of most neoplasms are due to their mass effects caused by the invasion and destruction of tissues by the neoplasms' cells. Signs and symptoms of a cancer causing a paraneoplastic syndrome result from the release of humoral factors such as hormones, cytokines, or immunoglobulins by the syndrome's neoplastic cells and/or the response of the immune system to the neoplasm. Many of the signs and symptoms in POEMS syndrome are due at least in part to the release of an aberrant immunoglobulin, i.e. a myeloma protein, as well as certain cytokines by the malignant plasma cells. POEMS syndrome typically begins in middle age – the average age at onset is 50 – and affects up to twice as many men as women. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of POEMS syndrome are highly variable. This often leads to long delays (e.g. 13–18 months) between the onset of initial symptoms and diagnosis. In addition to the signs and symptoms indicated by the POEMS acronym, the PEST acronym is used to describe some of the other signs and symptoms of the disease. PEST stands for Papilledema, evidence of Extravascular volume overload (ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lower extremity edema), Sclerotic bone lesions, and Thrombocytosis/erythrocytosis (i.e. increased in blood platelets and red blood cells). Other features of the disease include a tendency toward leukocytosis, blood clot formation, abnormal lung function (restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired lung diffusion capacity), very high blood levels of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and an overlap with the signs and symptoms of multicentric Castleman disease. =Common features= The more common features of the disease are summarized in the acronym POEMS: Papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) often but not always due to increased intracranial pressure) is the most common ocular sign of POEMS syndrome, occurring in ≥29% of cases. Less frequent ocular findings include cystoid macular edema, serous macular detachment, infiltrative orbitopathy, and venous sinus thrombosis. Pulmonary disease/ Polyneuropathy: The lungs are often affected at more severe stages of the illness, although since by then physical exertion is usually limited by neuropathy, shortness of breath is unusual. Pulmonary hypertension is the most serious effect on the lungs, and there may also be restriction of chest expansion or impaired gas exchange. Organomegaly: The liver may be enlarged, and less often the spleen or lymph nodes, though these organs usually function normally. Edema: Leakage of fluid into the tissues is a common and often severe problem. This may take several forms, including dependent peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, effusions such as pleural effusion or ascites, or generalized capillary leakage (anasarca). Endocrinopathy: In women, amenorrhea, and in men, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction and testicular atrophy, are common early symptoms due to dysfunction of the gonadal axis. Other hormonal problems occurring in at least a quarter of patients include type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Monoclonal paraprotein: In most cases a serum myeloma protein can be detected, although this is not universal. This may represent IgG or IgA, but the light chain type is almost always lambda. This is in contrast to most paraproteinemic neuropathies, in which the paraprotein is usually an IgM antibody. Skin changes: A very wide variety of skin problems have been reported in association with POEMS syndrome. The most common is non-specific hyperpigmentation. The fingernails may be clubbed or white. There may be thickening of the skin, excess hair or hair in unusual places (hypertrichosis), skin angiomas or hemangiomas, or changes reminiscent of scleroderma. =Possible features= Some features have been observed in patients with POEMS syndrome but are not yet certain to form part of the syndrome itself. These include a predisposition to forming blood clots, joint pain, cardiomyopathy (systolic dysfunction), fever, low vitamin B12 levels, and diarrhea. Pathogenesis While the main features of this paraneoplastic disease have been described, the exact mechanism behind its development, progression, and manifestations remain elusive. Overproduction of the myeloma protein and VEGF may underlie some, but are insufficient to explain all, of the multi-organ features of the disease. It is suggested that various other cytokines produced by the clonal plasma cells, perhaps working in concert with each other as well as with VEGF and the myeloma proteins, mediate many of the features of POEMS syndrome. The other cytokines detected in, and suspected of contributing to, POEMS syndrome include interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and TNFα. Nonetheless, it seems likely that some of these paraneoplastic factors, operating individually, make a major contribution to certain features of the disease. For example, VEGF, given its ability to stimulate blood vessel formation, would seem likely to be the major contributor to the pathologic hyper-vascularization changes seem in many tissues, such as lymph nodes, afflicted by POEMS syndrome. Diagnosis The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is based on meeting its two mandatory criteria, meeting at least one of its 3 other major criteria, and meeting at least one of its 6 minor criteria. These criteria are: *Mandatory major criteria **Plasma cell dyscrasia: This is evidenced by 1) the presence of a serum myeloma protein, typically an IgG or IgA isotype (occurs in nearly 100% of cases; in >95% of instances the myeloma proteins contain a λ chain that is restricted to either of two V lambda 1 subfamily members viz., IGLV1-40*01 and IGLV1-44*01 (see V lambda family); 2) any, but often a small, increase above the normal value of <1.5% in the percentage of nucleated bone marrow cells that are clonal plasma cells (occurs ~67% of cases); and/or 3) presence of a plasma cell tumor (i.e. plasmacytoma) usually in bone (occurs in ~33% of cases). **Polyneuropathy: The nerve damage is usually symmetrical, located in distal extremities, and due to the nerve losing its fatty myelin coating and axonal damage. Neurons of the Sensory, motor and autonomic nervous systems are all affected. The typical symptoms are therefore numbness, tingling, and weakness in the feet, later affecting the legs and hands. Pain is unusual, but the weakness may eventually become severe and disabling. The autonomic neuropathy may cause excessive sweating and erectile dysfunction; hormonal changes may also contribute to the latter. It is usually the symptoms of neuropathy which prompt a person with POEMS syndrome to seek medical attention. *Other major criteria **Castleman disease: The lymphoproliferative disorder Castleman disease associated with POEMS syndrome is multicentric and occurs in ~15 of cases. It is characterized by a morphology in lymph nodes termed angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; an overly activate immune system; excessive production of cytokines including particularly IL-6 and to lesser extents, proliferation of immune B cells and T cells, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, capillary leak syndrome, anasarca, evidence of extravascular fluid overload, and organ failure. Patients with Castleman disease without a plasma cell dyscrasia and peripheral neuropathy but having other signs and symptoms of POEMS syndrome can be classified as a Castleman disease variant of POEMS syndrome. **Sclerotic bone lesions: These lesions consist of plasma cell tumors encased within or associated with abnormally dense bone structures; in different studies, they have been observed to occur in 27% to 97% of cases. **Elevated VEGF: VEGF is a cytokine that stimulates angiogenesis (i.e. capillary formation), increases capillary permeability, and contributes to polyneuropathy. It is elevated in almost all cases of POEMS syndrome and has become a clinically useful marker for the syndrome's presence, severity, and response to treatment. However, its role in mediating the symptoms of this disease are unclear. A second cytokine, IL-12, is similar to VEGF in being highly correlated with the disease activity level in POEMS syndrome. *Minor criteria **Organomegaly: Enlargement spleen, liver, and/or lymph nodes occurs in 45% to 85% of cases. **Extravascular volume overload: Ascites, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and/or lower extremity edema occur in 27% to 89% of cases. **Endocrinopathy: Gynecomastia occurs in 12% to 18% of cases; endocrine abnormalities involving the regulation of gonadotrophins, adrenal gland corticosteroids, and prolactin occur in 55% to 89%, 16% to 33%, and 55 to 20% of cases, respectively. Diabetes and hypothyroidism also occur in 3% to 36% and 9% to 67%, respectively, of cases but are not considered to be criteria for the presence of POEMS syndrome because of their frequent occurrence in the general population. **Skin changes: Skin changes occur in 68% to 89% of POEMS syndrome patients. These changes most commonly are hyperpigmentation and/or hypertrichosis (abnormal amount of hair growth over the body) but less commonly include glomeruloid hemangioma, signs or symptoms of Hypervolemia (e.g. edema and ascites), acrocyanosis (blue discoloration of the extremities due to blood flow abnormalities), flushing, and/or white nails. **Papilledema: Papilledema (swelling of retinal optical discs) occurs in 29% to 64% of cases. Papilledema in POEMS syndrome patients may occur with or without visual disturbances, increased intracranial pressure, or changes in cerebral spinal fluid protein levels. **Thrombocytosis/polycythemia: Thrombocytosis (increase in blood platelet count) and polycythemia (increase in red blood cells) occurs 54% to 88% and 12% to 19%, respectively, of POEMS syndrome patients and may be may underlying causes of these patients to experience thrombosis events. =Laboratory findings= In addition to tests corresponding to the above findings (such as EMG for neuropathy, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy to detect clonal plasma cells, plasma or serum protein electrophoresis to myeloma proteins, other tests can give abnormal results supporting the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. These included raised blood levels of VEGF, thrombocytes, and/or erythrocyte parameters. =Differential diagnosis = Patients diagnosed as having Castleman disease but also exhibiting many of the symptoms and signs of POEMS syndrome but lacking evidence of a peripheral neuropathy and/or clonal plasma cells should not be diagnosed as having POEMS syndrome. They are better classified as having Castleman disease variant of POEMS syndrome. These patients may exhibit high blood levels of the interleukin-6 cytokine and have an inferior overall survival compared to POEMS syndrome patients. Treatment of patients with this POEMS syndrome variant who have evidence of bone lesions and/or myeloma proteins are the same as those for POEMS syndrome patients. In the absence of these features, treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody preparation directed against B cells bearing the CD20 antigen, or siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody preparation directed against interleukin-6, may be justified. Treatment As reported by Dispenzieri et al. Mayo Clinic treatment regimens are tailored to treat the clinical manifestations and prognosis for the rate of progression of the POEMS syndrome in each patient. In rare cases, patients may have minimal or no symptoms at presentation or after successful treatment of their disorder. These patients may be monitored every 2–3 months for symptoms and disease progression. Otherwise, treatment is divided based on the local versus systemic spread of its clonal plasma cells. Patients with one or two plasmacytoma bone lesions and no clonal plasma cells in their bone marrow biopsy specimens are treated by surgical removal or radiotherapy of their tumors. These treatments can relieve many of the syndromes clinical manifestations including neuropathies, have a 10-year overall survival of 70% and a 6-year progression-free survival of 62%. Patients with >2 plasmacytoma bone lesions and/or increases in bone marrow clonal plasma cells are treated with a low-dose or high-dose chemotherapy regimen, i.e. a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone plus an alkylating agents such as melphalan. Dosage regimens are selected on the basis of patient tolerance. Hematological response rates to the dexamethasone/melphalan regimens have been reported to be in the 80% range with neurological response rates approaching 100%. Patients successfully treated with the high-dose dexamethasone/melphalan regimen have been further treated with autologous stem cell transplantation. In 59 patients treated with the chemotherapy/transplantation regimen, the Mayo Clinic reported progression-free survival rates of 98%, 94%, and 75% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Other treatment regiments are being studied. Immunomodulatory imide drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide have been used in combination with dexamethasone to treat POEMS syndrome patients. While the mechanism of action of these immunomodulators are not clear, they do inhibit the production of cytokines suspected of contributing to POEMS syndrome such as VEGF, TNFα, and IL-6 and stimulate T cells and NK cells to increase their production of interferon gamma and interleukin 2 (see immunomodulatory imide drug's mechanism of action). A double blind study of 25 POEMS syndrome patients found significantly better results (VEGF reduction, neuromuscular function improvement, quality of life improvement) in patients treated with thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared to patients treated with a thalidomide placebo plus dexamethasone. Since VEGF plays a central role in the symptoms of POEMS syndrome, some have tried bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF. While some reports were positive, others have reported capillary leak syndrome suspected to be the result of overly rapid lowering of VEGF levels. It therefore remains doubtful as to whether this will become part of standard treatment for POEMS syndrome. History R. S. Crow, working in Bristol, first described the combination of osteosclerotic myeloma, polyneuropathy and various unusual features (such as pigmentation and clubbing) in two patients aged 54 and 67.

Early years Champion was born in Geneva, Illinois, the son of John W. Champion and Beatrice Carlisle. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from Fairfax High School. He studied dance from an early age and, at the age of fifteen, toured nightclubs with friend Jeanne Tyler billed as \\"Gower and Jeanne, America's Youngest Dance Team.\\" In 1939, \\"Gower and Jeanne\\" danced to the music of Larry Clinton and his Orchestra in a Warner Brothers & Vitaphone film short-subject, \\"The Dipsy Doodler\\" (released in 1940). Career During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Champion worked on Broadway as a solo dancer and choreographer. After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, Champion met Marjorie Belcher, who became his new partner, and the two were married in 1947. In the early 1950s, Marge and Gower Champion made seven film musicals: Mr. Music (1950, with Bing Crosby), the 1951 remake of Show Boat (with Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson), 1952's Lovely to Look At (a remake of Roberta, also with Keel and Grayson), the autobiographical Everything I Have Is Yours (1952), Give a Girl a Break (1953, with Debbie Reynolds and Bob Fosse), Jupiter's Darling (1955, with Keel and Esther Williams), and Three for the Show (1955, with Betty Grable and Jack Lemmon). All were made for Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer except Mr. Music (Paramount) and Three for the Show (Columbia). Throughout the 1950s, they performed on a number of television variety shows, and in 1957 they starred in their own short-lived CBS sitcom, The Marge and Gower Champion Show, which was based on their actual career experiences. Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of What's My Line. Mary Healy guessed who they were. In 1948, Champion had begun to direct as well, and he won the first of eight Tony Awards for his staging of Lend an Ear, the show that introduced Carol Channing to New York City theater audiences. During the 1950s, he worked on only two Broadway musicals — choreographing Make a Wish in 1951 and directing, staging, and starring in 3 For Tonight in 1955 — preferring to spend most of his time in Hollywood. However, in the 1960s, he directed a number of Broadway hits that put him at the top of his profession. He had a solid success in 1960 with Bye Bye Birdie, a show about an Elvis-like rock star about to be inducted into the army. The show starred relative unknowns Chita Rivera and Dick Van Dyke along with a youthful cast. It ran for 607 performances and won four Tony awards, including Best Musical and two for Champion's direction and choreography. Next came Carnival! in 1961, which ran for 719 performances and garnered seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion's direction. In 1964, he directed one of Broadway's biggest blockbusters, Hello, Dolly!. It ran for 2844 performances — almost seven years. Starring Carol Channing, it is best remembered for the title number, where Dolly is greeted by the staff of a restaurant after having been away for years. The show won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, as well as two for Champion's direction and choreography. Champion had his fourth consecutive hit musical with I Do! I Do! in 1966. It featured a cast of two — veterans Mary Martin and Robert Preston — playing a couple seen throughout the years of their marriage. The show ran for 560 performances and received seven Tony nominations, including one for Champion's direction. His next show, The Happy Time in 1968, broke his streak. It had a relatively disappointing run of only 286 performances. This would be followed by many more disappointments and worse. In the 1970s, Champion directed minor hits (Sugar in 1972 and the revival Irene in 1973), flops (Mack & Mabel in 1974) and complete disasters (Rockabye Hamlet — seven performances in 1976 — and A Broadway Musical, running only one night in 1978, not to mention Prettybelle, which closed out of town in 1971). On top of this, he and Marge were divorced in 1973. After the failures of the previous decade, Champion was able to make a comeback with his longest-running show. In 1980, he choreographed and directed a stage adaptation of the movie classic, 42nd Street. It won the Tony for Best Musical, and Champion was nominated for his direction and choreography, winning for the latter. The show ran for 3,486 performances, but Champion did not live to see one, having died in the morning on opening day. Personal life Champion was married in 1947 to actress Marjorie Celeste Belcher, with whom he had two sons: Blake and director Gregg Champion. In 1976 he married again to Karla Russell. Death Champion was diagnosed in early 1979 with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, a rare form of blood cancer, from his doctors at the Scripps Institute. He began treatment at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles and was advised not to take on work. Champion died at 10:00 am on August 25, 1980 in Manhattan at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center. Champion's death came only ten hours before the opening-night curtain of 42nd Street, the Broadway musical he directed. It would be his greatest success, running nine years. Producer David Merrick asked Champion's family to withhold the news from everyone, including the show's cast, until after the opening performance. During the enthusiastic curtain calls, Merrick came onstage and made the announcement to the stunned cast and audience amidst the wild applause. “This is tragic...Gower Champion died this morning.” Broadway credits * Count Me In (musical), performer (1942) * Lend an Ear, musical staging (1948) * Small Wonder (musical), choreographer (1948) * Make a Wish, choreographer (1951) * 3 for Tonight, director and performer (1955) * Bye Bye Birdie, director and choreographer (1960) * Carnival!, director and choreographer (1961) * Hello, Dolly!, director and choreographer (1964) * I Do!

He was born one of nine children of parents who came to the United States in 1903 from Croatia. In order to help with family expenses, Spudich worked nights and summers in a coal mine while attending high school in Benld, Illinois, and was graduated in 1929. He was a graduate of McKendree College, Lebanon, Illinois, in 1933, where he was named to the United Press International All-Star Football Team in 1932, and was All State fullback in 1931 and 1932. Moreover, he played professional football for the St. Louis Gunners, the Tulsa Oilers, and the Chicago Cardinals. Spudich earned his Masters Degree from the University of Missouri and did post-graduate work at Oxford in England and at Columbia University. He taught and coached in Sikeston, Missouri, Cairo and El Dorado Springs; then starting in 1942, at Freeport High School, Freeport, Illinois, where he was head football coach from 1951-1954. Spudich taught English and served as assistant principal. He was a soft-spoken man and had the respect and admiration of his students. Mr. Spudich always had time to help students, even if it was at the expense of his own plans. He was a very patient and kind man. He was also not only considered the High School's strongest man, his arms filling out his suit jackets, but was also considered the best dressed male teacher. Joe, as he was known to his students, would also plan field trips, such as taking them to Chicago to see such plays as Camelot, starring Richard Burton. He also assigned then contemporary books such as Patterns, by Rod Serling, as well as classics, such as Shakespeare's, Julius Caesar. After retiring at Freeport High School in 1964, he taught English and was chairman of the Humanities Division at Highland College, also in Freeport, Illinois. Mr. Spudich served on the Freeport Library Board, was a Freeport City Alderman, coached the Frogs Girls Softball Team, played slow pitch softball in his 1970s, helped move a log cabin to the Stephenson County Historical Society grounds in Freeport, and did all the stonework on his own house plus a lot of stonework for others. If Joe knew that his stonework for some people was unaffordable, he did it free of cost.

Located a couple of miles north of the River Wear, Crook lies about 9 miles (14.5 km) south-west of the historic city of Durham, 5 miles (8 km) north-west of Bishop Auckland and 2 miles (3.5 km) from Willington. The A690 road from Durham turns into the A689 leading up through Wolsingham and Stanhope into the upper reaches of Weardale (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). Located on the edge of Weardale, Crook is consequently sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway to Weardale\\". The centre of Crook, a designated conservation area, features a variety of shops and businesses with the market held on Tuesdays and a few stalls on a Saturday. There are two prominent churches, the centrally located St Catherine's CE and Our Lady Immaculate & St Cuthbert's RC on Church Hill. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club. Crook is the 10th largest settlement in County Durham and the 35th largest in the North East of England as of 2016. History Crook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts; Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea, Roddymoor and Helmington Row, were established much earlier. The development of Crook: some background history In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area, and by the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly in population and economy. However a lot of the population in the area had declined in the following century as the coal mines and industries closed with over 34% of the population being unemployed. Crook's football team, Crook Town F.C., have won the FA Amateur Cup five times, most recently beating Enfield F.C. in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook's near neighbours, Bishop Auckland F.C..

After a several year hiatus, the group announced their return with a new single at Above & Beyond's ABGT150 concert in September 2015. History The group's initial success was aided in part by popular trance musicians remixing their original work. Their first single, released in 2001, was the song \\"Clear Blue Water\\" which was remixed by several artists — the most successful of which was by Ferry Corsten. The track peaked at #48 in the UK Singles Chart in April 2002. The second single \\"Sky Falls Down\\" was released in 2002 and remixed by Armin van Buuren. The third single \\"Beautiful Together\\" was released in 2003 and was remixed by Seraque, Silvester and Signum. The single that is considered to be their break-through track is \\"Satellite\\" their fourth single which was released in 2004. It reached #19 in the UK chart in May 2004, higher than any other track released by the act, or Above & Beyond on their own. Its chart position was assisted by being playlisted on BBC Radio 1. On 24 August 2007, \\"Breaking Ties\\" (Above & Beyond's Analog Haven Mix), was featured on Trance Around the World Episode #178. Although Miracle was given as the title on the Above & Beyond official forum, at the time the title was unconfirmed.New OceanLab's topic at Above & Beyond official forum McGuinness and Siljamäki of OceanLab discussed the album during an interview in Riga, Latvia: We've been experimenting with a completely new sound - one of the tracks we're working on right now features a 56 piece mouse choir. We went diving in Formentera too to record some noises from the dolphins. On 14 March 2008, \\"Sirens of the Sea\\" (Above & Beyond Club Mix) premiered on Trance Around the World Episode #207. It was presented as one of the new singles for the upcoming album. Prior to this, \\"Sirens of the Sea\\" (Kyau & Albert Remix) was released on Above and Beyond's Anjunabeats Volume 3. On 7 April 2008, the single \\"Sirens of the Sea\\" was released. New remixes by Sonorous, Cosmic Gate, Maor Levi, as well as the Kyau & Albert remix were included.

The \\"Sirens of the Sea Remixed\\" album released in 2009 includes the most successful remixes of OceanLab's three most popular tracks that had only been released as singles - Satellite, Sky Falls Down and Clear Blue Water. On 30 January 2014, McGuinness and Siljamäki confirmed via Reddit that the artist name OceanLab would no longer be used on future productions, with Justine Suissa now being identified as a part of Above & Beyond.

It was arranged by theme.  Introduction  Soyinka introduces Poems of Black Africa as being different from other anthologies because it is arranged by themes that go beyond what Soyinka calls the \\"customary settings\\" of other ways of organizing such as \\"regions, period, style, [and] authorship.\\" He states that the purpose of this anthology was to put together poems that envelop the reality and sense of black Africa, both \\"modern and historic\\", through poetic expression.  Critical reception  Poems of Black Africa was well received by Ursula A. Barnett, who declared it a successful anthology, although acknowledging that the work focuses on quality rather than comprehensiveness, despite being described as encompassing \\"most of the experience of the African world\\". She notes in her review in World Literature Today that many of the poems included were written by African statesmen. According to Barnett the works vary from expressions of passion, pain, beauty, betrayal, nostalgia, revolutionary fervour, death, wit, humour and satire. The works represent traditional writings from a wide array of groups, encompassing the Swahili, Yoruba, Zulu and other sources, and including seven original poems from Soyinka himself. Michael Kelly of the University of Hull, Northumberside, criticizes the works in Poems of Black Africa for being not poetic in the way they treat themes of race, identity, and suffering, calling the poems \\"propagandist and rhetorical\\". In contrast to Barnett's review, Kelly notes a lack of quality writing throughout the selections; he calls the poems difficult to understand and says that they are full of overwriting and lack clarity, placing responsibility for this fault on the anthology and on Soyinka himself as editor. Kelly says that genuine feeling expressed in the poems is not enough to overcome the lack of structure and form. Ending his critique, he states that black poets would have been better served by an anthology that focused on quality rather than themes, calling Poems of Black Africa \\"provocative and embarrassing\\".

Of the 20,500 men engaged, approximately 3,000 were Union infantrymen. The Battle of Trevilian Station in 1864 was the largest all- cavalry battle of the war. According to the Civil War Trust Brandy Station was the largest battle of its kind on American soil. It was fought on June 9, 1863, around Brandy Station, Virginia, at the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign by the Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton against Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry. Union commander Pleasonton launched a surprise dawn attack on Stuart's cavalry at Brandy Station. After an all-day fight in which fortunes changed repeatedly, the Federals retired without discovering Gen. Robert E. Lee's infantry camped near Culpeper. This battle marked the end of the Confederate cavalry's dominance in the East. From this point in the war, the Federal cavalry gained strength and confidence. Background The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia streamed into Culpeper County, Virginia, after its victory at Chancellorsville in May 1863. Under the leadership of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the troops massed around Culpeper preparing to carry the war north into Pennsylvania. The Confederate Army was suffering from hunger and their equipment was poor. Lee was determined to strike north to capture horses, equipment, and food for his men. His army could also threaten Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and encourage the growing peace movement in the North. By June 5, two infantry corps under Lt. Gens. James Longstreet and Richard S. Ewell were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast of Culpeper, holding the line of the Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy.Salmon, pp. 193–94; Loosbrock, p. 272. Most of the Southern cavalry was camped near Brandy Station. Stuart, befitting his reputation as a \\"dashing cavalier\\" or beau sabreur,Longacre, p. 23. requested a full field review of his troops by Gen. Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and 4 batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (3 km) southwest of Brandy Station.Longacre, pp. 40–41; Sears, pp. 62–64; NPS website. (The review field currently remains much as it was in 1863, except that a Virginia police station occupies part of it.) Gen. Lee was not able to attend the review, however, so it was repeated in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations.Longacre, pp. 40–41; Sears, pp. 62–64. Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock River the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.Salmon, p. 193. Opposing forces and Pleasonton's plan Around Brandy Station, Stuart's force of about 9,500 men consisted of five cavalry brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Wade Hampton, W.H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee, Beverly H. Robertson, and William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones, and Colonel Thomas T. Munford (commanding Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's brigade while Lee was stricken with a bout of rheumatism), plus the six-battery Stuart Horse Artillery, commanded by Major Robert F. Beckham.Salmon, pp. 198–99; Kennedy, p. 202. Unknown to the Confederates, 11,000 Union men had massed on the other side of the Rappahannock River. Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, commanding the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, had organized his combined-armed forces into two \\"wings,\\" under Brig. Gens. John Buford and David McMurtrie Gregg, augmented by infantry brigades from the V Corps.Longacre, p. 62. Buford's wing, accompanied by Pleasonton, consisted of his own 1st Cavalry Division, a Reserve Brigade led by Major Charles J. Whiting, and an infantry brigade of 3,000 men under Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames. Gregg's wing was the 2nd Cavalry Division, led by Col. Alfred N. Duffié, the 3rd Cavalry Division, led by Gregg, and an infantry brigade under Brig. Gen. David A. Russell. The commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, interpreted the enemy's cavalry presence around Culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid of his army's supply lines. In reaction to this, he ordered Pleasonton's force on a \\"spoiling raid,\\" to \\"disperse and destroy\\" the Confederates.Kennedy, p. 204. NPS website. Pleasonton's attack plan called for a two-pronged thrust at the enemy. Buford's wing would cross the river at Beverly's Ford, two miles (3 km) northeast of Brandy Station; at the same time, Gregg's would cross at Kelly's Ford, six miles (10 km) downstream to the southeast. Pleasonton anticipated that the Southern cavalry would be caught in a double envelopment, surprised, outnumbered, and beaten. He was, however, unaware of the precise disposition of the enemy and he incorrectly assumed that his force was substantially larger than the Confederates he faced.Longacre, pp. 62–63. Battle thumb400pxOverview of the Battle of Brandy Station About 4:30 a.m. on June 9, Buford's column crossed the Rappahannock River in a dense fog, pushing aside the Confederate pickets at Beverly's Ford. Pleasonton's force had achieved its first major surprise of the day. Jones's brigade, awakened by the sound of nearby gunfire, rode to the scene partially dressed and often riding bareback. They struck Buford's leading brigade, commanded by Col. Benjamin F. Davis, near a bend in the Beverly's Ford Road and temporarily checked its progress, and Davis was killed in the ensuing fighting. Davis's brigade had been stopped just short of where Stuart's Horse Artillery was camped and was vulnerable to capture. Cannoneers swung one or two guns into position and fired down the road at Buford's men, enabling the other pieces to escape and establish the foundation for the subsequent Confederate line. The artillery unlimbered on two knolls that were on either side of the Beverly's Ford Road. Most of Jones's command rallied to the left of this Confederate artillery line, while Hampton's brigade formed to the right. The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry (led by Major Robert Morris, Jr.) unsuccessfully charged the guns at St. James Church, suffering the greatest casualties of any regiment in the battle. Several Confederates later described the 6th's charge as the most \\"brilliant and glorious\\" cavalry charge of the war. (In many Civil War battles, cavalrymen typically dismounted once they reached an engagement and fought essentially as infantry. But in this battle, the surprise and chaos led to a mostly mounted fight.)NPS; Loosbrock, p. 272; Kennedy, p. 204; Salmon, pp. 194, 198; Eicher, p. 492. Buford tried to turn the Confederate left and dislodge the artillery that was blocking the direct route to Brandy Station. However, Rooney Lee's brigade stood in his way, with some troops on Yew Ridge and some dismounted troopers positioned along a stone wall in front. After sustaining heavy losses, the Federals displaced the Confederates from the stone wall. Then, to the amazement of Buford's men, the Confederates began pulling back. They were reacting to the arrival of Gregg's Union cavalry division of about 2,800 men, which was the second major surprise of the day. Gregg had intended to cross at Kelly's Ford at dawn, in concert with Buford's crossing at Beverly's, but assembling the men from dispersed locations and Duffié's division getting lost on the way cost them two hours. They had intended to proceed on roads leading directly into Brandy Station, but discovered the way blocked by Robertson's brigade. Gregg found a more circuitous route that was completely unguarded and, following these roads, his lead brigade under Col. Percy Wyndham arrived in Brandy Station about 11 a.m. Between Gregg and the St. James battle was a prominent ridge called Fleetwood Hill, which had been Stuart's headquarters the previous night. Stuart and most of his staff had departed for the front by this time and the only force on Fleetwood when Gregg arrived was a howitzer, left in the rear because of inadequate ammunition. Major Henry B. McClellan, Stuart's adjutant, called Lt. John W. Carter and his gun crew (of Captain Robert P. Chew's battery) to ascend to the crest of the hill and go into action with the few shells available, as he sent an urgent request to Stuart for reinforcements. Carter's few shots delayed the Union advance as they sent out skirmishers and returned cannon fire. When Wyndham's men charged up the western slope of Fleetwood and neared the crest, the lead elements of Jones's brigade, which had just withdrawn from St. James Church, rode over the crown.Longacre, pp. 75–76Salmon, pp. 199–201 Gregg's next brigade, led by Col. Judson Kilpatrick, swung around east of Brandy Station and attacked up the southern end and the eastern slope of Fleetwood Hill, only to discover that their appearance coincided with the arrival of Hampton's brigade. A series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across the hill. The Confederates cleared the hill for the final time, capturing three guns and inflicting 30 casualties among the 36 men of the 6th New York Light Artillery, which had attempted to give close-range support to the Federal cavalry. Col. Duffié's small 1,200-man division was delayed by two Confederate regiments in the vicinity of Stevensburg and arrived on the field too late to affect the action.NPS; Kennedy, p. 204; Salmon, p. 202. While Jones and Hampton withdrew from their initial positions to fight at Fleetwood Hill, Rooney Lee continued to confront Buford, falling back to the northern end of the hill. Reinforced by Fitzhugh Lee's brigade, Rooney Lee launched a counterattack against Buford at the same time as Pleasonton had called for a general withdrawal near sunset, and the ten-hour battle was over.NPS; Salmon, p. 202; Eicher, p. 492. Aftermath Union casualties were 907 (69 killed, 352 wounded, and 486 missing, primarily captured); Confederate losses totaled 523. Some 20,500 men were engaged in this, the largest predominantly cavalry battle to take place during the war.Kennedy, pp. 202–05. Of the 20,500, approximately 3,000 were Union infantrymen. The Battle of Trevilian Station in 1864 was the largest all-cavalry battle of the war. Among the casualties was Robert E. Lee's son, Rooney, who was seriously wounded in the thigh. He was sent to Hickory Hill, an estate near Hanover Court House, where he was captured on June 26. Stuart argued that the battle was a Confederate victory since he held the field at the end of the day and had repelled Pleasonton's attack. The Southern press was generally negative about the outcome. The Richmond Enquirer wrote that \\"Gen. Stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy.\\" The Richmond Examiner described Stuart's command as \\"puffed up cavalry,\\" that suffered the \\"consequences of negligence and bad management.\\"Sears, p. 73; Salmon, p. 202. Subordinate officers criticized Pleasonton for not aggressively defeating Stuart at Brandy Station. Maj. Gen. Hooker had ordered Pleasonton to \\"disperse and destroy\\" the Confederate cavalry near Culpeper, but Pleasonton claimed that he had only been ordered to make a \\"reconnaissance in force toward Culpeper,\\" thus rationalizing his actions.Custer, p. 7. For the first time in the Civil War, Union cavalry matched the Confederate horsemen in skill and determination.Coddington, pp. 64–65; Sears, p. 74; Clark, p. 22; Loosbrock, p. 274; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, p. xviii. Stuart falling victim to two surprise attacks, which cavalry was supposed to prevent, foreshadowed other embarrassments ahead for him in the Gettysburg campaign.Salmon, p. 203; Loosbrock, p. 274. Battlefield preservation The site of the battle, seen in 2017 The Brandy Station Foundation (BSF) was formed to protect the Brandy Station Battlefield from development. According to Clark B. Hall, \\"a small group of citizens came together over coffee in a little home situated just south of the Rappahannock River in eastern Culpeper County, Virginia\\".Clark B. Hall, \\"Saving Brandy Station\\" , Civil War News, accessed January 1, 2014. Over time the organization grew to over 400 members and has been the cornerstone of efforts to save the battlefield from attempts to turn it into an office park, and a racetrack, as well as preserving the historic building known as Graffiti House. In 1990, the National Park Service completed mapping of historic resources at Brandy Station and recommended preservation of 1,262 acres (5.1 km²) at four separate engagement areas. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) has been the major preservation organization involved at Brandy Station. The Trust, supplemented by the BSF and other partners, has acquired and preserved of the battlefield in more than 15 separate acquisitions since 1997.Brandy Station Fleetwood Hill American Battlefield Trust Accessed May 25, 2018. In 2003, this led to the opening of Brandy Station Battlefield Park, which interprets the history of the site. This work has prevented a number of commercial enterprises from infringing on the battleground, including a proposed Formula One racetrack in the late 1990s. In 2013, the Trust achieved a major preservation success by purchasing a 61-acre tract at Fleetwood Hill, site of a number of significant cavalry charges during the battle. Nancy C. James, former rector of Christ Church, Brandy Station (the diocese rebuilding St. James Episcopal Church nearby and renaming it) and nearby Emmanuel Church, Rapidan, wrote a book describing some of the parish and civic unrest during the 1990-era development controversy, which included reburying at least one previously unidentified Civil War soldier whose original coffin had been made from pews of the destroyed church.Nancy C.

It is a way of describing the electric field strength at any distance from the charge causing the field. The electric field E can exert a force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field is proportional to the gradient of the voltage. Overview An electric \\"charge,\\" such as a single electron in space, has an electric field surrounding it. In pictorial form, this electric field is shown as a dot, the charge, radiating \\"lines of flux\\". These are called Gauss lines.Purcell, p5-6. The density of these lines corresponds to the electric field strength, which could also be called the electric flux density: the number of \\"lines\\" per unit area. Electric flux is proportional to the total number of electric field lines going through a surface. For simplicity in calculations, it is often convenient to consider a surface perpendicular to the flux lines. If the electric field is uniform, the electric flux passing through a surface of vector area is : Phi_E = mathbf{E} cdot mathbf{S} = ES cos theta, where is the electric field (having units of ), is its magnitude, is the area of the surface, and is the angle between the electric field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to . For a non-uniform electric field, the electric flux through a small surface area is given by :dPhi_E = mathbf{E} cdot dmathbf{S} (the electric field, , multiplied by the component of area perpendicular to the field). The electric flux over a surface is therefore given by the surface integral: :Phi_E = iint_S mathbf{E} cdot dmathbf{S} where is the electric field and is a differential area on the closed surface with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction. For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by: : where : is the electric field, : is any closed surface, : is the total electric charge inside the surface , : is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the \\"permittivity of free space\\") (ε0 ≈ 8.854 187 817... x 10−12 farads per meter (F·m−1)). This relation is known as Gauss' law for electric field in its integral form and it is one of the four Maxwell's equations. While the electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface, the net electric field, , in the Gauss' Law equation, can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface. While Gauss' Law holds for all situations, it is most useful for \\"by hand\\" calculations when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field. Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry. Electrical flux has SI units of volt meters (), or, equivalently, newton meters squared per coulomb (). Thus, the SI base units of electric flux are . Its dimensional formula is .

This huge continental plateau is at an average elevation of about high. Exploration This plateau was first sighted in 1903 during the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic, which was led by Robert Falcon Scott. Ernest Shackleton became the first to cross parts of this plateau in 1909 during his Nimrod Expedition, which turned back in bad weather when it had reached a point just 97 nautical miles from the South Pole. Shackleton named this plateau the King Edward VII Plateau in honor of the King of the United Kingdom. In December 1911, while returning from the first journey to the South Pole, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen decided to name this plateau the Haakon VII Plateau in honor of the newly elected King Haakon VII of Norway. The Antarctic Plateau was first observed and photographed from the air in 1929 from a Ford Trimotor airplane carrying four men on the first flight to the South Pole and back to the seacoast. The chief pilot of this flight was Bernt Balchen, a native of Norway, and the navigator and chief organizer of this expedition was Richard E. Byrd of Virginia, an officer in the U.S. Navy. The other two members of its crew were the co-pilot and the photographer. Climate The high elevations of the Antarctic or Polar Plateau, combined with its high latitudes, and its extremely long, sunless winters, mean that the temperatures here are the lowest in the world in most years, compare with central Siberia in the Northern Hemisphere. Fauna The nearly continuous frigid winds that blow across the Antarctic Plateau, especially in the long, dark wintertime, make the outdoor conditions there very inhospitable to life. Microbial abundance is low (<103 cells/ml of snowmelt). The microbial community is mainly composed of members of the Alphaproteobacteria class (e.g. Kiloniellaceae and Rhodobacteraceae), which is one of the most well-represented bacterial groups in marine habitats, Bacteroidetes (e.g. Cryomorphaceae and Flavobacteriaceae) and Cyanobacteria. Based on research, polar microorganisms should not only be considered as deposited airborne particles, but as an active component of the snowpack ecology of the lofty, icy Antarctic Plateau.Michaud L, Lo Giudice A, Mysara M, Monsieurs P, Raffa C, Leys N, et al. (2014) Snow Surface Microbiome on the high Antarctic Plateau (DOME C). PLoS ONE 9(8): e104505.

In his final year, the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette \\"Fabulous Five\\" team after also being named an all-City League player. =College= Benton continued his basketball career at the University of Vermont; he went on to have the most decorated career in Vermont's program's history during his tenure. He scored a still-standing school record 2,474 points, including a record 54-point game against Drexel on January 29, 1994. His point total was the second-highest in America East Conference history, and for his career he averaged 23.8 points per game. In three of his four seasons, Benton finished in the top 12 nationally. Benton scored his 1,000th career point during his sophomore season and became only the third NCAA Division I men's basketball player ever to record 1,000 points before his 19th birthday (others include LSU's Shaquille O'Neal and Duke's Mike Gminski). He was named a First Team All-America East Conference performer in all four seasons, becoming just the third player in conference history to achieve that. In 1995–96 Benton won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the best senior player under 6-feet tall (he is 5'11\\"). At the time of Benton's graduation in 1996, he held 15 different offensive category school records, including career field goals, free throws, three-pointers and scoring average. He also recorded 458 assists, the third-highest total in Vermont history as of his graduation. =Professional= Benton went undrafted in the 1996 NBA draft. He spent the 1996–97 season playing in the Continental Basketball Association for the Grand Rapids Hoops. Over the following two seasons he played internationally in leagues in Israel, the Netherlands, and Venezuela. Coaching career After his short-lived professional career, Benton returned to the United States and got into coaching. His first job came in 1999 for the men's team at La Roche College, a Division III school in his native Pittsburgh. Staying local, he then spent three seasons with the men's program at Robert Morris University. In 2004, La Roche hired Benton as the head women's basketball coach, where he would stay for eight years and compile 108 overall wins. He led La Roche to two consecutive Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) championships, back-to-back Division III Tournament appearances, and in 2012 was named the AMCC Coach of the Year. Benton spent the 2012–13 season as an assistant for the women's team at Saint Francis University before landing at Duquesne University in 2013–14. From 2013 to 2017, Benton served as an assistant coach for the women's team at Duquesne. After serving the 2017–18 season as an assistant coach of the women's basketball team at the University of Cincinnati, Benton accepted an assistant coaching position with Brown.

John Elisha Grimshaw was descended from one of the lines of Grimshaws at Abram, Lancashire, He was born in 1893 and was employed as a carpenter at Cross & Tetley’s Collieries in the Wigan coalfield before enlisting in the Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army in August 1912. He served with his battalion in India before the outbreak of the First World War. Grimshaw was 22 years old, and a Lance-Corporal signaller in C Company of the 1st Battalion, when he took part in the landing on W Beach on 25 April 1915 west of Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, at the opening of the Battle of Gallipoli. His job was to maintain communications between the units which had landed and the headquarters for the landing on HMS Euryalus. During the landing, the three companies and the Headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, were met by a very heavy and effective fire from the company of Ottoman Empire troops defending the beach. This caused 533 casualties out of the 950 men who attempted to land. The survivors, however, rushed up and cut the wire entanglements notwithstanding the terrific fire from the enemy and after overcoming supreme difficulties, the cliffs were gained and the position maintained. Grimshaw's own account said that, \\"In boats we got within 200 or 300 yards from the shore when the Turks opened a terrible fire. Sailors were shot dead at their oars. With rifles held over our heads we struggled through the barbed wire in the water to the beach and fought a way to the foot of the cliffs leaving the biggest part of our men dead and wounded.\\" Grimshaw was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the landing. Grimshaw, along with Cuthbert Bromley, William Kenealy, Alfred Joseph Richards, Frank Edward Stubbs and Richard Raymond Willis had originally been nominated for a Victoria Cross by Major Bishop, the battalion's commanding officer, after consulting 'the officers who happened to be with him at the time and who did not include either of the officers awarded the Cross'. The recommendation endorsed by Hunter-Weston and Hamilton but was not proceeded with by the War Office. In August, Hunter-Weston made a second recommendation for three of the men; under the original 1856 warrant establishing the award up to 4 VCs could be awarded as a result of balloting the units involved; and Keneally, Richards and Willis, were awarded the medal having been selected by the surviving privates, NCOs and officers respectively. However, Brigadier Owen Wolley-Dod, who was a member of Hunter- Weston's general staff and a Lancashire Fusilier himself, and who had landed on the beach shortly after noon continued pressing for more awards to be made. Eventually the other three men, including Grimshaw, were finally awarded the medal. The awards were published in the London Gazette on 13 March 1917, with an identical citation to the original three men. Grimshaw had his DCM cancelled and replaced with a Victoria Cross. The courage of the 6 men awarded the medal as a result of the landing was hailed in the Press as '6 VCs before breakfast'. Meanwhile, Grimshaw had been evacuated from Gallipoli suffering from frostbite and, in 1916, posted to Hull as a rifle instructor. Whilst at Hull, he married Margaret Stout, with whom he later had two children. He was subsequently sent with his battalion to France where, as a Sergeant, he was commissioned in 1917. In 1918 he was posted to the First Battalion of the 75th Carnatic Infantry in India, and promoted to Lieutenant, before rejoining the Lancashire Fusiliers in 1920 and retiring in 1921. In 1934 he was appointed the Army's Chief Recruiting Officer in the Northumbrian Area and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel; he later held the same appointment in East Anglia. He died 20 July 1980 at Isleworth, London and was cremated at the South West London Crematorium in Hanwell, Middlesex.

He appeared repeatedly and sometimes prominently in Melbourne news media because of suspicions, formal accusations, and some convictions related to a 1919 violent gang war, to his absconding from bail and hiding from the police in 1921–22, and to his involvement in a robbery where a bank manager was murdered in 1923. Taylor enjoyed a fearsome reputation in 1920s Melbourne. A \\"spiv\\", described as the Australian equivalent of the 'American bootleggers', his crimes ranged from pickpocketing, assault and shopbreaking to armed robbery and murder. He also derived income from sly-grog selling, two-up schools, illegal bookmaking, extortion, prostitution and, in his later years, is believed by some to have moved into cocaine dealing. His life and times came back into public attention, with the television series on the Nine Network in Australia, Underbelly: Squizzy, which is a loosely based biographic account of Taylor's life. Early life Born in Brighton, Victoria, on 29 June 1888, Taylor was the second youngest child of Benjamin Isaiah Taylor, coachmaker, and Rosina Taylor (née Jones).Australian Dictionary of Biography, http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120203b.htm The family struggled financially and, after the family coachmaking business was sold by creditors in 1893,See, e.g., The Argus (Melbourne), 28 October 1893, p.2 they moved to the inner-Melbourne working-class suburb of Richmond. With the death of his father in 1901, the 13-year old Taylor began working in the stables of a horse trainer and then as a jockey in Melbourne's inner-city pony circuit.Australian Dictionary of Biography at http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120203b.htm Taylor soon started to get into trouble with the police and in May 1905 at the age of 16 was arrested for insulting behaviour.Public Record Office Victoria, VPRS 1931, Vol 14 He was discharged without conviction by the local magistrates, but this was the first of many court appearances. His first criminal conviction was recorded in March 1906 at the age of 17 when he was sentenced to 21 days imprisonment for the theft of a \\"fly front grey Melton cloth overcoat\\".Victoria Police Gazette, 1906; Public Record Office Victoria, VPRS 1931, Vol 15 Although given the names \\"Joseph Leslie Theodore\\" by his parents, Taylor preferred to use the name 'Leslie'. As a youth, Taylor became known by the nickname \\"Squizzy\\" because of an ulcerated, droopy left eyelid. Career =Pickpocketing and Minor Offences (1907–1912)= His first prison sentence behind him, Taylor became part of a larrikin 'push' (or gang) that roamed the streets looking for trouble. His early convictions included theft, assault, inciting to resist arrest, offensive language, throwing missiles and vagrancy.The Truth (Melbourne), 5 November 1927, p.1. Under the alias \\"Michael McGee\\", he was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment for pickpocketing the watch and chain of an unsuspecting punter at the Ballarat races in January 1908.Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.6. After his release from prison Taylor continued to pickpocket, regularly moving from one place to another to avoid detection by the police. He was convicted of pickpocketing in Kapunda, South Australia, in January 1911The Advertiser (Adelaide), 28 January 1911, p.17. and under the alias \\"David Donoghue\\" in Christchurch, New Zealand, in November 1912. Taylor's first wife was Dolly Gray, although it is unclear whether they were ever legally married.Sydney Morning Herald, 3 March 2013. Dolly was more than just a girlfriend and wife—she is believed to have played an active role in some of Taylor's crimes, such as his schemes to decoy and extort money from married men.Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.10. =Robbery and murder of Arthur Trotter (1913)= Arthur Trotter, a commercial traveller from MacRobertson's confectioners, was robbed of £200 and murdered in front of his wife and five-year-old son at his home in Fitzroy, Victoria, in January 1913. Harold \\"Bush\\" Thompson, a criminal associate of Taylor's, was arrested and tried for the murder but found not guilty. The police believed that Taylor was Thompson's accomplice in the armed robbery and murder, although no direct evidence could be obtained against him. Thompson and Taylor were arrested for loitering at the Flemington racecourse with intent to commit a felony in July 1914. Taylor, alias \\"Leslie Grout\\", was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment with hard labour.Victoria Police Gazette, 1915; Public Record Office Victoria, VPRS 308, Vol.15. While Taylor was in Melbourne Gaol, his wife Dolly supported herself by operating a brothel at her house in Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne.Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.34. One night in December 1914 she was admitted to hospital with a bullet wound in her head, received under mysterious circumstances. Although her condition was described as serious, she recovered from her injuries.The Argus (Melbourne), 24 December 1914, p.9. =Murder of William Haines (1916)= In 1916 Taylor and John Williamson were tried and acquitted of the murder of William Patrick Haines, a 21-year-old chauffeur employed by the Globe Motor & Taxi Company. On the evening of 28 February 1916, a man calling himself Lestrange had telephoned the taxi company to order a car for the following day to take him to Eltham, Victoria. Haines, who was dispatched to drive the customer, was found late on 29 February 1916, shot dead on the floor of his car at the junction of Bulleen and Templestowe Roads, Heidelberg. The police believed that Taylor and Williamson had intended to rob a bank manager who was taking bank money from one branch to another. The police found that a grave had recently been dug near Clayton, several miles away, in which they believed the body of the bank manager was to be buried. Haines had apparently refused to co-operate so was murdered and the armed robbery was aborted.The Argus (Melbourne), 28 October 1927, p15 While the murder charge failed, Taylor was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months on a charge of vagrancy and one month for obstructing the police in the execution of their duty. Figure in the \\"Fitzroy Vendetta\\", a violent feud between rival criminal gangs that lasted for several months in 1919. One gang, from Richmond, was headed by Taylor and the \\"two-up king\\" Henry Stokes, while the other gang was based in Fitzroy and included Edward \\"Ted\\" Whiting, Henry \\"Long Harry\\" Slater and Frederick Thorpe. The feud had its origins in a carefully planned robbery of £1,435 worth of diamond rings from Kilpatrick & Co, a Collins Street jewellers, in June 1918. The robbery, which Taylor is credited by some with orchestrating, was carried out by members of the Richmond and Fitzroy gangs.The Argus (weekend magazine) (Melbourne), 3 November 1950, p.6. When three of their members were arrested and faced trial over the robbery, the Fitzroy gang became suspicious that someone from Richmond had tipped off the policeThe Argus (Melbourne), 20 August 1918, p.4; The Argus (Melbourne), Weekend Magazine, 3 November 1950, p.6. and suspicions were raised further when Stokes, a member of the Richmond gang, gave evidence for the prosecution in exchange for the police withdrawing charges against him. The two men were found not guilty, but that was not the end of the matter. Outside court after the trial, angry words were exchanged by the opposing factions and both Stokes and Taylor were struck by punches.The Argus (Melbourne), 7 August 1918, p.10; Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.55. To add to the tensions, some members of the Fitzroy gang were dissatisfied with the division of the proceeds from the Kilpatricks robbery. The final catalyst for the vendetta came some months after the robbery when Taylor's wife, Dolly, was drugged at an underworld party in Fitzroy, maltreated and robbed of £200 of jewellery that she was wearing. Some of the other guests considered the jewellery was part of the proceeds from the Kilpatrick's robbery and thus rightly belonged to them.The Argus (Melbourne), Weekend Magazine, 3 November 1950, p.6; The Argus (Melbourne), 28 October 1927, p.15. The Richmond gang, led by Taylor, retaliated against those responsible for taking Dolly's jewellery. One of the first men targeted was Whiting, who was shot six times in the head when gunmen invaded his home in Webb Street, Fitzroy, late one night in February 1919. The newspapers reported that the life of Whiting, a former boxer, was only saved by his \\"exceptionally thick skull\\".The Argus (Melbourne), 19 February 1919, p.8. More attacks and counter-attacks followed. The victims never sought the help of the police and, when they were so seriously injured that the police could interview them, they maintained an obstinate silence about the identity of the perpetrators. The violence peaked in May 1919. Within a space of days, a Richmond gang member was shot seven times, a man was brutally beaten by members of the Fitzroy gang, and shots were again fired at Whiting and into the house of another Fitzroy gang member.The Argus (Melbourne), 7 May 1919, p.9; 8 May 1919, p.7; 9 May 1919 p.6. A few days later there was a violent confrontation between Stokes and Slater in Little Collins Street, Melbourne, which ended in Slater's admission to hospital with five bullet wounds to his body and Stokes under arrest for attempted murder.The Argus (Melbourne), 13 May 1919, p.5. Stokes claimed he shot Slater in self-defence and when tried was found not guilty.The Argus (Melbourne), 16 July 1919, p.13. Taylor was arrested over a shooting incident in Fitzroy in August 1919. The police had seen him jumping into a moving car immediately after shots were fired into a \\"sly grog\\" shop in Fleet Street, Fitzroy, injuring a woman and two men. Taylor was initially convicted of loitering with intent to commit a felony and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, however the conviction was overturned on appeal due to a lack of evidence.The Argus (Melbourne), 28 August 1919, p.5; 15 October 1919, p.11. By late 1919 the feud had died down. Whiting was in prison serving a nine-month sentence for occupying a house frequented by reputed thieves,The Argus (Melbourne), 22 May 1919, p.5. while Slater and Thorpe had left for interstate. In September 1919 before leaving Melbourne, Thorpe was seen throwing a home-made bomb at the house of a police detective involved in the investigation of the vendetta shootings and the Kilpatricks robbery. Thorpe was subsequently arrested in Sydney and, after his return to Melbourne, sentenced to five years' imprisonment for the bombing and declared a habitual criminal to be detained at the Governor's pleasure.The Argus (Melbourne), 1 October 1919, p.15; 7 October 1920, p.5. The Fitzroy Vendetta also marked the end of Taylor's relationship with his first wife, Dolly. Although there is no record of a divorce, he married Lorna Kelly in Fitzroy on 19 May 1920,Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.89. and soon afterwards Dolly left Melbourne and moved to Adelaide.The Truth (Melbourne),24 June 1922, p.2. =In hiding (1921–1922)= Taylor was believed responsible for a series of burglaries throughout 1920 and into 1921.Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.85-88. He was unsuccessfully prosecuted over the theft of £323 from the Thornbury branch of the Commercial Bank in February 1921,The Argus (Melbourne), 4 March 1921, p.8. but otherwise his activities went on unimpeded by the police. His luck finally ran out in June 1921 when one night he was caught seemingly red-handed in a bonded warehouse in King Street, Melbourne. He was committed to stand trial for breaking and entering the warehouse and released on bail of £600. However, when Taylor's trial date arrived, he failed to appear at court and the bail money was forfeited.The Argus (Melbourne), 11 August 1921, p.6. For more than a year the police searched for Taylor without success. At the time Taylor absconded from bail, tensions were again rising in Fitzroy. Within days of his disappearance, Taylor's authority was openly challenged by Fitzroy gunman, Joseph Lennox Cotter, who riddled the door of Taylor's Bourke Street gambling club with bullets and shot the barman in the leg in crowded Bourke Street.The Argus (Melbourne), 31 August 1921, p.5. Some weeks later Cotter fought one of Taylor's men at the Ascot races and the violence continued until, in October 1921, Cotter shot and killed John Thomas 'Fivo' Olson in Regent Street, Fitzroy. Cotter claimed he acted in self-defence in shooting Olson, whom he said was part of mob who had come to Fitzroy a few days before to shoot him. Cotter was found not guilty of Olson's murder.The Argus (Melbourne), 24 November 1921, p.10; 25 November 1921, p.9. The police came close to catching Taylor in March 1922, when he and two other men were spotted fleeing from a women's clothing shop in Elsternwick carrying bundles of stolen goods. The three men sped away in a car in which a driver and Taylor's girlfriend, Ida 'Babe' Pender, had been waiting. A series of police raids located Taylor's two accomplices, Pender and the driver, but not Taylor. The police did, however, find some of his personal belongings, including clothes, photographs and a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings.The Argus (Melbourne), 11 March 1922, p.9. Pender gave the police a witness statement and was rushed away to a safe location, however soon she too disappeared.The Argus (Melbourne), 18 March 1922, p.9. Taylor's two accomplices and the driver were charged with housebreaking but, without Pender's evidence, the prosecutions failed.The Argus (Melbourne), 13 March 1922, p.7; 17 July 1922, p.9. Posters for the arrest of Taylor and Pender were circulated to all police stations across Victoria.The Argus (Melbourne), 25 March 1922, p.20. Pender was arrested by police in July 1922 after she was spotted window shopping in Flinders Street, Melbourne.The Argus (Melbourne), 29 July 1922, p,19. Squizzy Taylor surrenders to the police in September 1922 While in hiding, Taylor wrote letters to the Herald newspaper saying he would give himself up when he was ready. The police were sceptical about Taylor's promises, however in September 1922 he kept his word and surrendered to the police.The Argus (Melbourne), 22 September 1922, p.12. He told the incredulous police detectives that he spent most of his time in a flat in East Melbourne and that he had often come out of hiding in disguise, sometimes dressed as a woman but more often as a schoolboy, which was convincing due to his small stature. Taylor was again committed for trial on the charge of breaking into the warehouse and released on bail. On the evening before the trial, three shots were fired at Taylor as he was stepping out of a car in Bourke Street, Melbourne. Taylor was wounded once in the right leg. Cotter was arrested and charged with shooting at Taylor,The Argus (Melbourne), 4 October 1922, p.11. although the charge failed due to a lack of evidence. He was sentenced to two months' prison for possessing an unregistered firearm.The Argus (Melbourne), 13 October 1922, p.7. On the day of his trial for warehouse breaking, Taylor limped into court on crutches. In his defence, he told a dramatic story about how an enemy of his called Lou 'the Count' Sterling (aka Louis Henri Stirling) had challenged him to fight. Taylor explained that later in the same evening he had been drinking heavily and, believing that Sterling and his men were pursuing him, he had hidden in the warehouse which was already unlocked. The jury failed to agree, so a second trial was held. At the re-trial Taylor was found not guilty.The Argus (Melbourne), 5 October 1922, p.7; 4 November 1922, p.25. =Glenferrie robbery & murder of Thomas Berriman (1923)= Thomas Berriman, the manager of the Hawthorn branch of the Commercial Bank, was robbed of £1,851 and fatally wounded outside Glenferrie Station, Hawthorn, in October 1923. While en route to Glenferrie Station with a small suitcase of bank money, Berriman was approached by two men, one of whom offered to carry the suitcase. When Berriman refused to hand over the suitcase, one of the men drew a revolver and shot him in the chest. The men grabbed the suitcase and, pursued by bystanders, escaped on foot to a waiting car.The Argus (Melbourne), 9 October 1923, p.11. Berriman was admitted to hospital in a serious condition and died two weeks later.The Argus (Melbourne), 22 October 1923, p.11. From police photographs, witnesses identified the man who shot Berriman as Richard Buckley and his accomplice as Angus Murray, an escapee from Geelong Gaol. The police raided a house in Barkly Street, St Kilda, a few mornings after the robbery and arrested Murray, Taylor and his girlfriend, Ida Pender.The Argus (Melbourne), 12 October 1923, p.11. The police believed that Taylor was the organiser of the robbery. He was initially charged with being the occupier of a house frequented by thieves and harbouring the escaped prisoner Murray. Murray was charged with escaping from Geelong Gaol and with the robbery and wounding of Berriman. With the death of Berriman, the charges against Murray were upgraded to murder and Taylor was charged as an accessory.The Argus (Melbourne), 23 October 1923, p.11. The police were unable to locate Buckley despite numerous raids, an appeal for public assistanceThe Argus (Melbourne), 25 October 1923, p.11. and the offer of a £500 reward. The inquest into the death of Berriman proceeded in Buckley's absence and the coroner returned the verdict of wilful murder, with Buckley and Murray as the principals and Taylor as an accessory.The Argus (Melbourne), 27 November 1923, p.9. After almost two months of remands in custody, Taylor was granted bailThe Argus (Melbourne), 14 December 1923, p.4. and soon began to intimidate key witnessesThe Argus (Melbourne), 29 December 1923, p.11. and devising a plan to rescue Murray from prison. The rescue plans involved the attempted bribery of a prison warder and Murray climbing over the prison wall with a rope made from towels. After the plans came to the knowledge of prison authorities, Taylor and four others were charged with conspiring to assist Murray to escape from Melbourne Gaol.The Argus (Melbourne), 1 February 1924, p.11. Murray was tried and convicted of the murder of Berriman and sentenced to death, even though it was Buckley who fired the fatal shot.The Argus (Melbourne), 23 February 1924, p.35. He unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Criminal AppealThe Argus (Melbourne), 15 March 1924, p.36. and was refused leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.The Argus (Melbourne), 21 March 1924, p.7. The Trades Hall Council led a spirited campaign for a commutation of Murray's death sentence. Deputations were sent to the Attorney GeneralThe Argus (Melbourne), 29 March 1924, p.26. and Premier,The Argus (Melbourne), 11 April 1924, p.11. a petition with 70,000 signatories was sent to the GovernorThe Argus (Melbourne), 14 April 1924, p.9. and public meetings were held to protest against Murray's pending execution.The Argus (Melbourne), 9 April 1924, p.19. Efforts to obtain a reprieve failed, and Murray was executed on 14 April 1924 at Melbourne Gaol, with 2,000 protesters demonstrating outside.The Argus (Melbourne), 15 April 1924, p.19. The charges that Taylor was an accessory to the murder of Berriman were withdrawn;The Argus (Melbourne), 1 March 1924, p.31. however, he still faced charges of conspiring to rescue Murray from prison, harboring Murray, and of occupying a house frequented by thieves. Taylor was found not guilty of the conspiracy charge.The Argus (Melbourne), 27 March 1924, p.7. Three trials were held on the charge of harbouring Murray; at the first and second trials, the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict and at the third trial he was acquitted.The Argus (Melbourne), 9 May 1924, p.18; 17 May 1924, p.30; 7 June 1924, p.19. Squizzy Taylor on his release from Pentridge Prison in December 1924 Taylor was convicted of the less serious charge of being the occupier of a house frequented by thieves and sentenced to six months' prison in June 1924. He was also ordered to show cause why he should not be imprisoned indefinitely under the Indeterminate Sentences Act;The Argus (Melbourne), 26 June 1924, p.10. however, the Supreme Court declined to order an indeterminate sentence, concluding that Taylor's criminal record was not sufficiently serious to warrant one.The Argus (Melbourne), 29 August 1924, p.7. Taylor was released from Pentridge Prison in December 1924.Police Gazette (Victoria), 1925, p.12. The police were relentless in their search for Buckley. Almost seven years after the murder of Berriman, the police traced him to a house in Moonee Ponds, Victoria, where he was arrested in October 1930. Rarely venturing outside the house where he lived with his great granddaughter, the ageing Buckley had grown a beard to change his appearance.The Argus (Melbourne), 2 October 1930, p.8. Finally brought to trial, Buckley was convicted of Berriman's murder and sentenced to death,The Argus (Melbourne), 29 November 1930, p.21. although this was soon commuted to life imprisonment.The Argus (Melbourne), 10 December 1930, p.7. In 1946, 83-year- old Buckley was released from prison on compassionate grounds—he was dying and his family did not wish him to die in prison.The Argus (Melbourne), 26 December 1946, p.4. Death =Fatal gunfight= Taylor was wounded in a gunfight with a rival gangster, John \\"Snowy\\" Cutmore, at a house in Barkly Street, Carlton, and died at St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, on 27 October 1927. Cutmore, a standover man associated with the Razor Gang of Sydney, was also fatally wounded. John \\"Snowy\\" Cutmore Cutmore was an old foe of Taylor's. The animosity dated back to the Fitzroy Vendetta in 1919 when Cutmore was a member of the rival Fitzroy gang. Well known to the police as a violent criminal, Cutmore had a string of convictions in Victoria and NSW for assault, stealing and resisting arrest. In 1927 Cutmore was living in Sydney, then the scene of a 'razor gang war' between opposing factions of the Sydney underworld. Cutmore joined standover man Norman Bruhn, also originally from Melbourne, in a notorious razor gang who stole the illicit gains of their underworld peers, knowing their crimes would never be reported to the police. Bruhn was murdered in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst in June 1927. Cutmore returned to Melbourne with his wife in October 1927 and began staying at his mother's house in Barkly Street, Carlton. Within a few days of his arrival, Cutmore was confined to bed with a severe bout of influenza. Meanwhile, Taylor, hearing of Cutmore's return from Sydney, set out to find him. On the evening of 27 October 1927, Taylor and two men hailed a taxi to take them to Carlton. They stopped at several Carlton hotels in search of Cutmore and, finally, Taylor told the driver to take them to Barkly Street, Carlton. In Barkly Street, Taylor and the two men got out of the taxi and headed for Cutmore's house. Taylor and one of his companions let themselves into the house and went to the room where Cutmore was lying ill in bed. Words were exchanged by the men, followed by a series of gunshots in quick succession. Cutmore, still lying in bed, was fatally wounded. His mother, who rushed to the room after hearing the shooting, was also wounded in the shoulder. Taylor was shot in his right side below the ribs. He staggered outside towards the waiting taxi, while one of his companions fled out the back door of the house. Taylor was helped into the taxi and taken to St Vincent's Hospital. When stuck in traffic on the way to the hospital, Taylor's other companion jumped from the taxi and ran off. Taylor was unconscious by the time he arrived at the casualty ward and died soon afterwards.The Argus (Melbourne), 28 October 1927, p.15; 22 November 1927, p.13. Taylor was survived by his wife Ida, their young daughter Gloria, and a daughter Patsy from his previous marriage to Lorna Kelly. He was buried with Anglican rites in Brighton Cemetery. On the morning of the funeral, the police were needed to control a large crowd of onlookers who gathered at Taylor's house, swarming around the waiting hearse in morbid curiosity. Cutmore was buried in Coburg Cemetery. Taylor's gravesite in the Brighton Cemetery has become a major attraction since the television series was announced and as a consequence, his great-great nephew, Brett Hinch, has recently restored the headstone and surrounds to their original condition. =Inquest= Police enquiries into the death of Taylor and Cutmore led to the arrest of four men. On the day after the shooting Roy Travers, an associate of Cutmore, was detained at Albury on a Sydney-bound train. The following day, the police intercepted three other men, Thomas Kelly, his brother Sidney Kelly and Norman Smith, also on their way back to Sydney. The police suspected that two of these men had accompanied Taylor to Cutmore's house on the night of the shooting.The Argus (Melbourne), 31 October 1927, p.21. The Kelly brothers were well known to police for their role in the recent 'razor gang war' in Sydney. Thomas Kelly had just been acquitted of shooting Frank 'Razor Jack' Hayes with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Hayes together with Norman Bruhn and Cutmore, were central figures in a notorious razor gang that preyed on their peers in the Sydney underworld.The Sydney Morning Herald, 17 August 1927, p.11. The police recovered three handguns believed to be connected with the shooting of Taylor and Cutmore. An automatic pistol was found in Taylor's pocket after he arrived at hospital and two other pistols were discovered in the vicinity of Cutmore's house, one was hidden in the cistern of a toilet in the backyard and the other was found in a right-of-way some distance away. This suggested that a third person was involved in the shooting. A coronial inquiry was held into the deaths of Taylor and Cutmore. The coroner returned an open verdict due to a lack of evidence. He concluded that \\"... Cutmore died from bullet wounds in the heart and lungs. There is not sufficient evidence to say who fired the shots ... Taylor died from a bullet wound in the liver. There is not sufficient evidence to determine who fired the shot.\\" Even though the coroner had heard forensic evidence suggesting the pistol found in Taylor's possession was used to shoot Cutmore and the pistol used by Cutmore had fired the fatal shot at Taylor, there remained a number of unanswered questions. There was no evidence of the motive for the shooting, the identity of the third person involved or explaining the discovery of Cutmore's pistol in a right-of-way some distance from the scene of the shooting. The four arrested men were discharged without conviction.The Argus (Melbourne), 22 November 1927, p.13. =Theories= Several theories soon emerged about the deaths of Taylor and Cutmore. An early police theory was that the enmity between the two men resulted from jealousy over a woman.The Argus (Melbourne), 28 October 1927, p.15. Other police enquiries suggested the shooting was a sequel to the murder of Norman Bruhn by an unidentified assailant in Sydney four months earlier.The Argus (Melbourne), 29 October 1927, p.33. The Melbourne Truth newspaper printed multiple theories on the Taylor-Cutmore shooting. One was that the shooting was an accident and Taylor, who was more bravado than bite, had only intended to \\"put the wind up\\" Cutmore not realising that he was armed. Another theory was that an unknown third person had lured Taylor and Cutmore to the Barkly Street house and murdered one or both of them. Yet another theory was that Taylor murdered Cutmore as payback for the death of Norman Bruhn. It reported that the police believed Cutmore had murdered Bruhn because he had robbed a friend of his.The Truth (Melbounrne), 5 November 1927, p.9. Over the years, more theories have surfaced including: * Cutmore's mother, Bridget Cutmore, murdered Taylor after he fatally wounded her son.Anderson, Hugh. Larrikin Crook. Jacaranda Press, 1971, p.220. *Taylor's former criminal associate Henry Stokes organised the murder of Taylor, clearing the way for him to take control of the Melbourne underworld.Morton, James, & Lobez, Susannah. Gangland Melbourne. Victory Books, 2011, p.35. * Prominent Melbourne businessman and Australian Labor Party power-broker John Wren ordered the death of Taylor because he had supposedly threatened to shoot Wren. Perpetuated by Frank Hardy's controversial 1950 novel, Power Without Glory, this theory was strongly disputed by some, including veteran journalist Hugh Buggy who maintained that Wren was not involved in Taylor's death. Buggy wrote that the fatal confrontation between Taylor and Cutmore was the product of Cutmore celebrating his arrival back in Melbourne by smashing up a St Kilda beerhouse and punching its female proprietor.Buggy, Hugh. The Real John Wren. Widescope, 1977, p.239-244. * Another theory is that Joseph Lennox Cotter (aka \\"Brownie\\" Cotter) followed Squizzy to Cutmore's house on that fatal day to finally complete the hit, that he had failed to complete previously. Rumours suggest that he may have been paid by Stokes or by corrupt police for the job. While there is a wealth of often speculative theories, there has never been a decisive explanation of what happened inside the Barkly Street house on 27 October 1927 or the reason for the shootings. The only consensus is that the official version of events is incomplete and that an unidentified third person was present at the fatal gunfight. Documentary In 1969, a documentary about Taylor was released. The Rise and Fall of Squizzy Taylor, directed by Nigel Buesst,Tenille Hands, \\"Squizzy Taylor, the reel-life gang-star\\", National Film and Sound Archive 26 July 2013 accessed 10 March 2014 was privately funded and screened at the Carlton Cinema in Melbourne and Union Theatre in Sydney. It was later screened on Channel Nine on television.Bruce Hodson, \\"The Carlton Ripple and the Australian Film Revival\\", Screening the Past accessed 10 March 2014 Cultural references In Frank Hardy's 1950 novel Power Without Glory, Taylor is portrayed as the character Snoopy Tanner. A fictionalised account of the life of Melbourne businessman and Australian Labour Party power-broker John Wren, Power Without Glory depicted Taylor as an associate of Wren and suggested that, together with John Jackson, Taylor was involved in the 1915 Melbourne Trades Hall burglary in which a Constable David McGrath was shot and killed. While some people continue to suspect Taylor's involvement in the Trades Hall burglary, Uphold the right.com Retrieved 29 November 2007 there is no known evidence of this or an association between Taylor and Wren.Buggy, Hugh. The Real John Wren. Widescope, 1977. In 1976 Frank Howson and Barry Ferrier wrote an opera based on Taylor's life, titled Squizzy, which was broadcast by ABC Radio and 3CR and received much media attention. The title role was performed by Men At Work's Colin Hay. A major stage production was in the early stages of being mounted, to be directed by Nigel Triffitt of Tap Dogs fame, when a film version by a rival producer was announced, causing the stage production to fall over. The film, titled Squizzy Taylor and loosely based on Taylor's life, was released in 1982 but flopped with critics and public alike. Taylor is the subject of Touch The Black: The Life and Death of Squizzy Taylor, a fictional account of his life and death by Melbourne poet and writer Chris Grierson. Taylor's life was also the subject of the musical play Squizzy, featuring songs by Faye Bendrups and a script by acclaimed Australian playwright Barry Dickins. It premiered at La Mama Theatre on 10 June, 2010, and ran for 15 shows. It was later revived in 2010 for a production that was staged at the Trades Hall Ballroom in Melbourne, running from 17 to 27 November. The 2005 book Runner by Robert Newton, follows a fictional teenager who is hired as a runner for Taylor. Underbelly television series Taylor was featured in the Australian series Underbelly: Razor, a 13-part series covering the Razor war which occurred in Sydney during the twenties and thirties, which was broadcast in 2011. In the fourth season of the Australian true crime series, Taylor was portrayed by actor Justin Rosniak. The sixth season, Underbelly: Squizzy, was based on his life. The eight-part series aired on the Nine Network (as with the previous series of Underbelly), with actor Jared Daperis replacing Rosniak in the title role.

He is best known for his commentary on the Talmud. Chananel is often referred to as Rabbeinu Chananel - Hebrew for \\"our teacher, Chananel\\" (in Hebrew, רבנו חננאל, or abbreviated, ר\\"ח). Biography Rabbeinu Chananel was born in 990 in Kairouan (modern Tunisia), at the time under the rule of Zirid Emirs on behalf of the Fatimids. R. Chananel studied under his father, Chushiel, head of the Kairouan yeshiva and through correspondence with Hai Gaon. He is closely associated with Nissim Ben Jacob in the capacity of rabbi and Rosh yeshiva of Kairouan. His most famous student is probably Isaac Alfasi. R. Chananel was also successful in business and was said to be very wealthy. He died in 1053, leaving nine daughters. Works R. Chananel wrote the first complete commentary on the Talmud, today embedded in the Vilna edition Talmud page on certain tractates. The commentary only addresses the orders Moed, Nashim and Nezikin, in other words the topics relevant to practice at the time of writing, and some sections have been lost. Some further fragments have been recovered from the Cairo Genizah and are published in B. M. Levin's Otzar ha- Geonim, and there is now an edition published by Vagshal covering tractate Berachot and order Moed, which also includes the Sefer ha-Mafteaḥ of his colleague Nissim Gaon. The commentary presents a paraphrased summary of the main arguments in the gemara, omitting most of the non-legal sections (Aggada). A distinctive feature of the commentary is the presentation of the parallel passages from the Jerusalem Talmud. He is one of the most widely quoted commentaries by all the rishonim including Rashi, Tosafot and the Rif. His opinion is highly regarded in halacha and correct versions of the texts which is used as a basis for Maimonides and many other later halachic authorities. in places where we don't have his commentary, his opinion is usually known from other sources due to mass quotation from all the rishonim. He also authored a commentary on the Torah, cited by many later Biblical commentators, chiefly Bahya ben Asher. This commentary is to some extent directed against the Karaites. While no full copy of this work survives, we possess many fragments of it; it has recently been published by the Mosad Ha- Rav Kook as a separate work, as well as in the Torat Hayyim Torah edition with commentaries. Other works by Rabbeinu Chananel include a collection of responsa, as well as \\"Sefer ha-Miktzo'ot,\\" decisions on ritual law, both quoted by various rishonim.

St. Peter's was built in 1788 by Rev A.B. MacDonald of the Order of St Benedict (O.S.B.); the area was mostly rural at the time. The church survived as a Catholic building until 1976, after which it served the local Polish community for a short time. For this reason it is affectionately known as 'the Polish Church'. Until its closure, St. Peter's was the oldest Catholic Church in Liverpool. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The exterior of former St Peter's Church Some milestones in St Peter's history include: *7 September 1788 - opening of St Peter's. *11 September 1788 - The 'Liverpool Advertiser' reports that \\"On Sunday last, a new Roman Catholic Chapel in Seel St. was opened with high Mass: and a sermon by the Rev.

Fr Glover had served the Parish for 22 years. *1845 - A major extension to the church takes place. Next to St. Peter's Church stood the house in which the priests had lived for over 60 years. The main part of the floors were removed and the wall between the church and the house was taken down. The result created the Sanctuary (the Altar area of the current church). The front room of the house then became the Sacristy (apparently currently used by the Alma de Cuba restaurant as a storeroom). The extension was carried out under the auspices of Fr James Francis Appleton, O.S.B., the Parish Priest at the time. *1847 - In 1846 and 1847 hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants landed in Liverpool to escape the famine, and they swarmed to the poorer quarters of the town.

One example of the damage can be found in Fr Louis D’Andria’s letter of 22 December 1940 to the Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey (Fr Kevin H Byrne, O.S.B.). Referring to the previous night D’Andria wrote: ‘To the Guild Room – doors blown in, big balk of timber across the entrance, stairs covered with sticky chemicals and heaps of rubbish…. To sacristy where sacristans were carrying on as usual despite a hole in the sacristy roof, and other damage. In the church Frs. Bruno and Chad were in the gallery examining a hole in the roof on the street side of the organ. Two more holes in the Lady Chapel, and a big stone in the sanctuary which had come through the skylight’. In D’Andria’s letter of 6 May 1941 he recounts events of Sunday 4 May 1941: ‘So it seemed the fire would spread to the church and the house. Bruno said we must clear out so we took the registers etc. into the road….I saw our roof definitely on fire.’ In his letter of 9 May 1941 D’Andria tells Fr Abbot (i.e. Fr Byrne, O.S.B.): ‘Church has notice ‘closed till further notice. Mass on Sunday at [Notre Dame Convent] Mount Pleasant.’ Suggest carrying on at St Peter’s but Bruno said it was impossible.’ The Church Notice Book recorded that ‘The church was too wrecked a condition for Mass after the first raids of the first week of May.’ D'Andria went on to quote his Rector, Fr Francis Bruno Dawson, O.S.B. who announced 'No Church, no congregation, no house, no school, no good staying here.' Masses were eventually restored, with one weekday Mass from 25 May 1941 at 08:00, rising to two Masses the following week, and by 12 June (The Feast of Corpus Christi), three Masses were said.\\"LRO 282 PET. St Peter’s Seel Street Notice Book, 1939-1943. 11, 18, 25 May, 1, 8 and 15 June 1941.\\" Damage to the priests’ house (St Peter’s Priory, 55 Seel Street) included complete destruction of the 3rd floor of the building and partial damage to the 2nd floor, and the repairs which were finally undertaken reinstated the 2nd floor, and not the 3rd floor. In total 7 bedrooms were destroyed, and only 3 remained, ‘two with rain pouring in, in bad weather’. On 11 September 1944 The [Liverpool] City Architect and Director of Housing reported that the 2nd floor was covered with a temporary lean-to corrugated iron roof which was \\"leaking badly\\", and that \\"the domestic servants’ sleeping accommodation is deplorable (one sleeps in the Kitchen and one in the Basement Air Raid Shelter).\\"Liverpool Records Office document 720KIR/2900 Photographs which were taken in May 1941 by Dom Louis D’Andria, OSB, show significant damage to the PresbyteryLiverpool Records Office Photos 352PSP/32/298/17 and 352PSP/32/298/18 and show the Sanctuary (Altar area)Liverpool Records Office Photo 352PSP/32/294/9 covered in debris following an air raid. St Peter's Church Guildhall was located on Park Lane, and was completely destroyed during a bombing raid in 1941. Documents held by the Liverpool Records Office show the problems that the priests had in getting repairs to St Peter’s Church, school and the Presbytery completed following the war damage. There are correspondence with various builders and the War Damage Commission. These include correspondence showing differences of opinion between the Parish Priest, Fr Dawson, OSB, and some of those undertaking work which led (on one occasion in January 1945) to Fr Dawson throwing some men off site. Whether Fr Dawson was justified in his actions is not clear, but in a letter written to Fr Dawson on 28 January 1945 Fr Dawson is told that \\"My plaster left on Saturday, and refuses to return to the job. He wants his cards if I send him back.\\" In the case of the school roof repairs, leaks were evident in the school roof apparently due to faulty repairs. A letter written to Fr Dawson on 4 February 1945 states that \\"the fault is due not so much to faulty slates as to the fact that the roof timbers were not set and aligned previous to slating…the roll and drip gutter between the schools and church building should definitely have been renewed….the ridge lead still shows shrapnel holes.…to put the roof right by stripping, resetting and reslating would ….be a bigger job than the original one.\\" During the 8 nights of the 1941 Liverpool Blitz beginning on 1 May 1941, almost 1,750 people in Liverpool were killed, ~90,000 houses were destroyed, and ~ 75,000 people made homeless. Many areas close to St Peter's were destroyed, specifically the area around Paradise Street.Liverpool Echo: Liverpool May Blitz 1941 Background The following is an extract from the Press Account on the Centenary of St Peter's in 1888, and explains some of the history of Catholic churches in Liverpool leading up to the founding of St Peter's: \\"In 1701, Father Gillibrand, S. J., Chaplain of the Squire of Crosby, established the first religious services held in the city for Catholics for upwards of a century. In 1707, he came to reside permanently in Liverpool. In 1736, Father Hardisty, S. J., built the first Catholic Chapel, in Edmund Street. It was demolished by a mob in 1746. While a new chapel was being built, under the guise of a warehouse, by a wealthy merchant, named Pippard, the Catholics met stealthily for worship in the house of a Mr. and Mrs. Green in Dale Street, and the only friends of the proscribed ones were two large-hearted and tolerant Presbyterians who lived in adjoining houses, and who helped the Papists to gain, without observation, access to their temporary place of meeting. The Mission was and is still called St. Mary's. In 1783, it passed out of the hands of the Jesuits into those of another learned Order, that of St. Benedict. In 1758, the chapel in Edmund Street had been destroyed during a riot, and a new building took its place in Lumber Street, of which no trace remains, its place now being held in Highfield Street by the fine Church planned by Augustus Welby Pugin, when that great designer's influence was beginning to be felt in the revival of Gothic architecture. Father Archibald MacDonald, O.S.B., was the first Benedictine attached to St. Mary's, in 1783, and it was he, who in 1788, founded St. Peter's. One hundred years ago, the site of St. Peter's, now pressed by closely clustered dwellings, factories and warehouses, had a rural environment. The choice of the spot on which to build the new church incurred for the zealous monk the mild displeasure of his superiors, who suggested it was too far out of town. Still, there St. Peter's was built, and there it still stands to-day. Prominent on the venerable church are white marble memorials of departed Priests, who have ministered there. On the Founder's monument we read: \\" In the vaults of this chapel are deposited the remains of the Rev. Archibald MacDonald, who departed this life on the 29 July 1814, aged 78 years. The founder of this chapel, and for a period of 26 years its liberal, intelligent and revered pastor, to whose memory the Catholicks of Liverpool erect this monument.—R.I.P.\\" The other monuments are those of Father William Tarleton, O.S.B., who died in 1816 of typhus fever, caught while consoling the sick; Dr. James Appleton, O.S.B., D.D., who died a martyr of charity, in 1847; Father John Robinson, O.S.B, who died, deeply mourned by his flock, in 1837, and Father Vincent Glover, O.S.B, who died in 1840, aged 49. Anecdote There is a story retold concerning Fr Basil Primavesi who was Parish Priest at St Peter's from 1929 until his death in 1937. One night during his tenure: \\"The church was even threatened with destruction by a great fire which seemed likely to cross Back Seel Street. Fr Basil, roused from sleep, went down, placed a medal of St. Benedict on the church wall and returned to bed. A change of wind followed and materially aided the task of the fire-engines which had arrived.\\" Historical note Church Street in Liverpool takes its name from the former St Peter's Church (now demolished) which was \\"the first church built in Lancashire after the Reformation\\".St Peter's Church - Church Street Students of history should not confuse this church with St Peter's R.C. Church in Seel Street. Alma de Cuba Restaurant area on the first floor of Alma de Cuba (This specific view is no longer possible due to the installation of The Vestry mezzanine floor in December 2018) St. Peter's Church is now the home of the Alma de Cuba (Spanish: \\"Soul of Cuba\\") restaurant and bar, which officially opened in September 2005. Alma de Cuba is focused on the food and culture of Cuba, although it also draws influence from other Hispanic and Latin American countries. Besides serving as a restaurant and bar, Alma de Cuba is also a popular live music and late night venue being situated near to the hub of Liverpool's nightlife - Concert Square. Alma de Cuba has seen international acclaim and has been awarded 'Best Bar', 'Best Restaurant' and 'UK's Best Venue' in 2008 and 2009. Art and artefacts within St Peter's Church and the Alma de Cuba When St Peter's Church was converted into the Alma de Cuba, much of the interior was left as it was because of it being a Grade II Listed Building. Under the rules, if the removal of artefacts threatened damage to the integrity of the building it was forbidden. Thus much of the interior of St Peter's Church remains, as do the memorial tablets and (most significantly) the murals which were painted alongside the large picture of St Peter behind the altar. Behind the altar in St Peter's there used to be a large picture of St Peter. This was removed from the church and is now stored at the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King.Private communication with the Liverpool Archdiocesan Archivist at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King The area where the picture was located has been replaced by a large mirror in the Alma de Cuba. The statue of St Peter which was in the church, seated (in marble and bronze) is now displayed in the Crypt Chapel at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King. This statue is a small copy of the much larger original in St Peter’s in Rome. The free standing statue of St Benedict (which was in the church) is now located with the Benedictines at St Begh’s Priory in Whitehaven, Cumbria, whilst the large pieta is now installed at St Mary's Church in Chorley. A photographic record of the interior of St Peter's during its conversion was made by Joe McLoughlin on 8 January 2004.Liverpool Records Office document 779.9942753 MACL - \\"The Roman Catholic Church of St. Peter, Seel Street, Liverpool, built in 1788 by the Benedictine Monks\\" As mentioned above, St Peter’s was dominated by a large picture of St Peter. Photographic evidence shows that the words on the pediment above the picture have changed at least three times in the last century. In 1920 the booklet produced for the Grand Bazaar shows a photograph of the church with the wording on the pediment as \\"I am the Good Shepherd\\". A newspaper cutting from the Catholic Times from 4 March 1932 shows a sketch of the Sanctuary with the words \\"CHRIST THE KING\\" appearing on the pediment, and these words were certainly still in place for the 150th Anniversary in 1938 (as is evidenced by the photos taken by Fr D’Andria at the time). These specific words remain until at least the 1960s, and possibly beyond. Exactly when the wording changed to \\"TU ES PETRUS\\" (You are Peter) is not clear. The words \\"TU ES PETRUS\\" still appear on the pediment in the Alma de Cuba today. It is not clear if the words have changed more than the three times referenced, and evidence for further changes is being sought. The puzzles of the Church Extensions There appears to be no clear account of when the main extension to the church (listed as 1845 above) actually took place. This is remarkable as it is such a notable change in the Parish history. The situation is neatly summed in \\"A Century and a Half - Notes on St. Peter's (Seel Street) 1788-1938\\" by an author who clearly has access to the Parish Records: \\"Even the year (of the extension) has been variously stated. AllansonObituary of the English Benedictine Historian Fr Athanasius Allanson, O.S.B. says 1845.\\" (Fr Allanson wrote volumes on the English Benedictine History, and these were made available to the author by the then Abbot of Ampleforth). \\"The Centenary Commemoration says 1843. A note made about 1850 in a private account book mentions 1845. The Seel Street Guide (1868) gives 1846. However, the Church Notices book seemed decisive. On the last Sunday of Pentecost, 1845, the following was read: 'After to-day there will be no Mass either on Sundays or week-days in this chapel until the Sunday before Christmas when it will be again reopened for Divine Service...The Vestry will be opened every Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock as usual for baptisms.' The next notices are dated 4th Sunday of Advent, 1845. So between November 23 and December 21 is the time of the building of the new sanctuary.\\" The \\"Official Handbook\\" of the Grand Bazaar (1920) makes no note of an extension around 1845, though this could just be an omission. The \\"Official Handbook\\" of the Grand Bazaar also mentions an apparently earlier extension: \\"1817 - Opening of New extension of St Peter's, previously a part of Presbytery. Sermon preached by Father Baines, O.S.B., of Bath, regarded as principal pulpit orator of his day (Burke, p. 35).\\" In \\"A Century and a half...\\" the author states that Fr Robinson, O.S.B.'s, tenure (which began in 1816) saw many changes to the parish. \\"In his second year\\" therefore 1818 \\" the church was 'enlarged' according to several brief notices, but judging by the picture of 1810, this can only mean the addition of the porch and of the gallery. However, the alteration was important enough to cause a solemn reopening on November 27, 1812...\\". The date here of 1812 makes no sense, so is likely to be a typo for 1818. The author of \\"A Century and a half...\\" is unaware of any part of the Presbytery being used for the 1818 extension, though the authors of the Bazaar Handbook may have simply have made an error. It is also worth noting that the author of \\"A Century and a half...\\" again quotes Allanson's volumes regarding the extension around 1818 which state that \\"gallery enlarged and organ built over the altar.\\" It would appear then that there are at least two extensions to the church, one ~ 1818, and a later more significant one ~ 1845. However, the lack of clarity in the documents available and those referenced by the authors is a puzzle.

It is also known as İzmir üzümü (grape of İzmir) in Turkey since this variety has been extensively grown region around İzmir. It is assumed to originate from (Asia Minor), which later became part of the Ottoman Empire. In some countries, especially Commonwealth countries, it is also the name given to the raisin made from it or from larger seedless grapes; such sultana raisins are often called simply sultanas or sultanis. These are typically larger than Zante currants (which are also a kind of dried grape, not currants in the botanical sense), and the Thompson variety is smaller than many seeded raisins. In the US and Canada, the name \\"raisin\\" is applied to all dried grapes, so that the breakfast cereal known as \\"sultana bran\\" in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom is called raisin bran in the United States and Canada. Thompson sultana raisins are small and sweet, and have a golden colour. Another seedless grape variety from the former Ottoman Empire, the round-fruited Kishmish, is also dried to make a larger sultana raisin. History The sultana raisin was traditionally imported to the English-speaking world from the Ottoman Empire. Turkey and Australia are major producers. American sultana grapes are almost invariably Thompson Seedless, a name that refers to William Thompson, a viticulturist who was an early grower in California and is sometimes credited with introducing the variety. According to the US Code of Federal Regulations, the two names are synonymous. Virtually all of California raisin production (about 97% in 2000) and roughly one-third of California's total grape area is of this variety, making it the single most widely planted variety. The Ottomans took the sultana grape variety to the island of Crete in the 19th century. Raisins In the US, most raisins, including those with the typical dark brown colour, are made from the sultana grape, the Thompson Seedless. The term \\"sultana\\" refers to golden-coloured dried grapes, which may also be called \\"golden raisins\\" (such as marketed by Sun-Maid, a California- based raisin grape growers' co-op and legacy brand). Any kind of grape may be used to produce golden raisins, and any kind of golden raisins from any kind of grape may be marketed as \\"sultanas\\". Moreover, the golden colour may come from a treatment with sulfur dioxide rather than traditional drying and preservation methods. Most nonorganic sultana grapes in California and elsewhere are treated with the growth-inducing plant hormone gibberellin. In other grapes, gibberellin is released by the seeds.Gibberellin and Flame Seedless grapes from a University of California, Davis website Retrieved on 2009-04-13 In some jurisdictions, seedless dried grapes are classified as sultana and Thompson raisins according to the drying method used. Sultanas are steeped in a solution of water, potassium carbonate, and vegetable oil to hasten the drying process. Thompson raisins are not treated with this solution, but are dried naturally, thus they require more drying time than sultanas. Because of this, Thompsons are a darker colour than sultanas.Metis Broker article Other uses Sultana raisins are eaten as a snack food without further processing and are used in a variety of dishes, such as fruitcake and Bath buns, sometimes prepared by soaking in water, fruit juice, or alcohol. The sultana grape is also used to make white wine, in which use it is known for its \\"sweet blandness\\". It is referred to as a \\"three-way grape\\" because it is used as table grape, to make raisins, and to make wine. In the United States it is the base for wine generically called \\"chablis\\". This wine is named for the Chablis region of France, but it is not a true Chablis wine. In the EU, \\"Chablis\\" wine must be made from the Chardonnay grape produced in the region of the Yonne département. End uses include:Sultanas - Bestsultanas.com, London, England * Manufacturing industries such as bakeries and breakfast cereal producers * Supermarkets * Dairy products such as yogurt and ice-creams * Salads and desserts Thompson Seedless is the most planted grape in California due to its triple use. Sultana grape juice was fraudulently sold as being of Chardonnay grapes in Australia for wine making, due to the lower cost of Sultana grapes. The fraud was discovered in 2003 by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It was considered the largest case of wine deception in Australian history.Winery sold sultanas as chardonnay Adelaide Advertiser, April 8, 2010 =Sultaniye wines= Sultaniye wines are dry and semi-dry, light-bodied wines produced in Turkey. Sultaniye grapes used in winemaking are mainly grown at Denizli and Manisa, in the Aegean Region of Turkey. Sultaniye grapes are consumed as table grapes and raisins, as well as used in wine making. The Semillon and Sultaniye wines from the Marmara Region of Turkey attract attention not only in the local market, but also in international markets.

This term has been officially used for female monarchs in some Islamic states, and historically it was also used for sultan's consorts. Nomenclature The term sultana is the feminine form of the word sultan (), an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\". Later, sultan came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms, albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. Usage =Ruling sultana= Some Muslim female monarchs chose to adopt the title of Sultana/Sultanah when they ascended to the throne. North Africa In the former Kingdom of Touggourt, now part of Algeria, there was one ruling sultana: Aïsha. Southeast Asia In Samudera Pasai Sultanate (now part of Indonesia), Sultana Seri Ratu Nihrasyiah Rawangsa Khadiyu (r. 1406-1427) became the sole ruler. In Aceh Darussalam (now part of Indonesia and Malaysia), there have been four ruling sultanas: * Sultana Seri Ratu Ta'jul Alam Syafiatuddin Syah of Aceh (1641-1675) - daughter of Sultan Iskandar Muda the Great, and wife of Sultan Iskandar Tani. She spoke 6 languages, Acehnese, Malay, Spanish, Dutch, Arabic, and Persian. * Sultana Seri Ratu Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah (1675-1678). * Sultana Seri Ratu Zakiatuddin Inayat Syah (1678-1688). * Sultana Seri Ratu Kamalat Syah (1688-1699). Replaced by her husband, under pressure from the Mufti of Mecca. In Maldives, there have been five ruling sultanas: * Khadijah (1347–1363, 1364–1374, 1376–1380) * Raadhafathi (1380) * Dhaain (1383–1388) * Kuda Kala Kamanafa’anu (1607–1609) * Amina I (1753–1754) * Amina II (1757–1759) On 5 May 2015, Hamengkubuwono X, Sultan and Governor of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, appointed his eldest child, Lady Nurmalita Sari (henceforth titled Princess Mangkubumi), as his heiress presumptive. If she does succeed her father, she will become the first Javanese woman to become a Sultan in her own right. =Sultana consort= Sultana is also used for sultan's wives. Between 1914 and 1922, monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty used the title of Sultan of Egypt, and their wives were legally styled as sultanas. Two women held the title of sultana during the short-lived Sultanate of Egypt: Melek Tourhan, the wife of Sultan Hussein Kamel, and Nazli Sabri, the wife of Sultan Fuad I. Nazli Sabri became queen (malika) following the establishment of the Kingdom of Egypt in 1922, and it is with the latter title that she is almost always associated. Melek Tourhan, on the other hand, legally retained the title of sultana even after Egypt became a kingdom, and is often referred to simply as Sultana Melek. Sultana is also title for consort of ruler in some Malaysian states. Some consorts who hold this title are * Sultanah Kalsom binti Abdullah, second consort of Ahmad Shah of Pahang. She became Sultanah of Pahang on 30 September 1992. * Sultanah Nur Zahirah, consort of Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu. She became Sultanah of Terengganu on 12 July 1998. * Sultanah Haminah Hamidun, second consort of Abdul Halim of Kedah. She became the Sultanah of Kedah on 21 November 2003 after her predecessor's death. * Sultanah Maliha, consort of Sallehuddin of Kedah. She become Sultanah of Kedah on 12 September 2017 after his husband proclaimed as the Sultan of Kedah. Claim In the west, the title of sultana is also used to refer to many female Muslim monarchs who don't hold this title officially. In medieval Egypt, Shajar al-Durr, a former slave of Turkic origin, ascended the throne in 1250. Although several sources assert that she took the title of sultana, The Cambridge History of Islam disputes the claim, stating that \\"a feminine form, sultana, does not exist in Arabic: the title sulṭān appears on Shajar al-Durr's only extant coin.\\" Raziya al-Din, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary.Gloria Steinem (Introduction), Herstory: Women Who Changed the World, eds. Deborah G. Ohrn and Ruth Ashby, Viking, (1995) p. 34-36. She was the first female ruler of the Delhi Sultanate.Table of Delhi Kings: Muazzi Slave King The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 2, p. 368.. She refused to be addressed as Sultana because it meant \\"wife or consort of a Sultan\\" and would answer only to the title \\"Sultan.\\" Like Shajar al-Durr, Raziya was also often referred as sultana by westerners, very possible to distinguish her from male sultans. Sultana was also often used to refer to women relatives of a sultan and other Muslim monarch or female members of Muslim dynasties, especially mothers and chief wives. In fact, many sultanates used other title for sultan's chief consort, some of which derived from non-Arabic language. Permaisuri, a title for a chief wife of a sultan in many sultanates and Muslim kingdoms in southeast Asia, is derived from Tamil பரமேஸ்வரி (paramēsvari), from Sanskrit परमेश्वरी (parameśvarī), 'supreme lady'. This title is still used for the consort of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, monarch and head of state of Malaysia. The formal way of addressing her is Raja Permaisuri Agong. In Brunei, official title for a chief wife of the sultan is Seri Baginda Raja Isteri, derived from Sanskrit raja (राजा, equivalent with \\"king\\") and isteri (equivalent with \\"women\\" or \\"lady\\"). The official title for sultan's mother is Seri Suri Begawan Raja Isteri. Shahbanu, title for the wife of Iran's monarch, is derived from Persian shah (شاه, equivalent with \\"king\\") and banu (بانو, translated as \\"lady\\"). Upon assuming the title in 1967, Farah Pahlavi, the third wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was the first shahbanu to be crowned in Iran since the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. Shahbanu often translated in English as \\"empress\\". Some Muslim monarchs also used the title malika (Arabic: ملكة), a feminine form of the word malik, for their wives. This title is still used in many Muslim kingdoms, like Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan =Ottoman royalty= Since 16th century, Ottoman used the title sultan for imperial princesses after their given names (e.g. Mihrimah Sultan and Hatice Sultan). They were all non-ruling royalty; in the western sense, princesses, not queens or empresses. The monarch's mother, who had more power, had the title Valide Sultan (e.g. Hafsa Sultan). She was referred to by this title alone, without her given name. Principal consort had the title Haseki Sultan (e.g. Hürrem Sultan). Non-principal consorts had the title hatun, equivalent to lady. This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative. Nevertheless, westerners often translated their official title, sultan, to sultana, possibly to distinguish them from the Ottoman ruler.

Biography Willeke Alberti and Joop Oonk getting married on 27 December 1965 Willeke Alberti started her career at the early age of eleven in the musical Duel om Barbara and she recorded her first single in 1958 together with her father. During the 1960s, she was a well-known singer in the Netherlands and had at least one No. 1 hit with \\"De winter was lang\\" (\\"It was a long winter\\"), however there was no official Dutch chart at the time. Willeke and her father had a television show between 1965 and 1969. Her singing career from 1970 onwards is less active, however Alberti still releases singles and albums at an irregular interval and plays minor roles in television programs and movies. From 1964 to 1974 she was married to musician Joop Oonk and they had a daughter. She married John de Mol in 1976, and they had a son, Johnny de Mol. The couple divorced in 1980, and Alberti married a third time, with football player Søren Lerby. Another son was born from that marriage. Søren Lerby and Willeke Alberti separated in 1996. In 1994 she represented the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Waar is de zon?\\" (\\"Where is the sun?\\"), which claimed a meagre four points from the international juries, all coming from Austria. Through the years Alberti has become embraced in the Netherlands as a gay icon, due to a combination of her song repertoire, her durability and her performances in support of many gay causes.Foot and Hand Prints in Rotterdam.

Permeance is usually represented by a curly capital P: mathcal{P}. Electromagnetism In electromagnetism, permeance is the inverse of reluctance. In a magnetic circuit, permeance is a measure of the quantity of magnetic flux for a number of current-turns. A magnetic circuit almost acts as though the flux is conducted, therefore permeance is larger for large cross-sections of a material and smaller for smaller cross section lengths. This concept is analogous to electrical conductance in the electric circuit. Magnetic permeance mathcal{P} is defined as the reciprocal of magnetic reluctance mathcal{R} (in analogy with the reciprocity between electric conductance and resistance): : mathcal{P} = frac{1}{mathcal{R}} which can also be re-written: : mathcal{P} = frac{Phi_B}{NI} using Hopkinson's law (magnetic circuit analogue of Ohm's law for electric circuits) and the definition of magnetomotive force (magnetic analogue of electromotive force): : mathcal{F} = Phi_B mathcal{R} = NI where: : ΦB, magnetic flux, : I, current, in amperes, : N, winding number of, or count of turns in the electric coil. Alternatively in terms of magnetic permeability (analogous to electric conductivity): : mathcal{P} = frac{mu A}{ell} where: : μ, permeability of material, : A, cross-sectional area, : ell, magnetic path length.

It is also known as Lake Azuéi (Lac Azuéi); its Taíno name was Yainagua. The Étang Saumâtre, the brackish water lake is a twin of Lake Enriquillo, is east of Port-au-Prince on the fertile Plaine du Cul-de-Sac. The lake supports over 100 species of waterfowl, flamingos and American crocodiles, one of the few lakes of its type in the world to harbour such fauna. The colour of the lake is an intense shade of blue and this picturesque lake is skirted by brush and cacti. Geography Étang Saumâtre is located on the arid part of the valley Cul-de-Sac, east of Port-au-Prince in the Ouest department. Its eastern side is part of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; the Dominican city of Jimaní is at less than 1 km from the southeast end of the lake. Etang Saumâtre, also known as Lake Azuei, is the largest lake in Haiti. Its waters are mostly brackish, and in contrast to its twin Lake Enriquillo, the lake is expanding. The lake itself is part of a chain of nearby saline lakes that lie within the valley known as the Cul-de-Sac Depression in Haiti and the Hoya de Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic. Because the region was a former marine strait, several areas of the valley are below sea level. While the lake created in a depression is long and wide, however, during heavy rainfall years it merges with another lake to its east known as the Enriquillo or Xaragua in the Dominican Republic, which is long, wide and fairly deep; the two together would have a water spread stretching to length, at an elevation of , larger than the Lake Geneva. It is away from the sea and Haitians call it the 'Etang Sale'. Étang Saumâtre is landlocked as it has no surface outlet. It is fed by springs emanating from calcareous rocks. The western part of the lake has slightly saline water while the eastern part has fresh water. Hispaniola border road The lake has a length, from northwest to southeast, of ; its maximum width is . The total area is . The lake water has an elevation of with maximum water depth being . A sandy shore, shallow lagoons and mudflats form the eastern shore line, while the western shores have small fresh water springs and marshes. The eastern shore is state-owned, but parts of the western side of the lake are privately owned. Salinity of the lake water is now reported as 15‰ (parts per thousand). Lake water fluctuations are minimal, at about , except during the drought period, when the water level could go down by . Conversely, the water level rises about above the average during heavy rainfall years. However, it was once inferred that Azuéi’s level in Haiti and the Enriquillo lake level in the adjoining Dominican Republic had registered a drop, since Columbus had visited the area more than 500 years ago. The present assessment is that the level of the lake has been rising in recent years, forcing Haitians who live in plantation residential areas (\\"bateyes\\") around the edge of the lake to seek higher ground. Another inference drawn by a comparison between the two lakes – Azuéi and Enriquillo – which are in the same area and have the same origin (and which also become one water body during years of high rainfall) is that though they are considered \\"twins,\\" they are two dissimilar bodies of water. Azuéi has a stable shore line, its waters are azure blue in colour, salinity level is low (11‰) and its surface area is relatively stable. However, Enriquillo’s water looks white- greyish in colour, its salinity levels are very high (they have risen from 36‰ to 110‰) and current water surface area ( compares to in 1968. The climatic conditions for both lakes are similar (low rainfall in the range of ), within similar geological setting. Azuéi's salinity is about one fifth (1/5) the salinity of sea water. A few small rivers flow into the lake. Fauna and flora The lake and its surrounding land are habitat for flora and fauna of several endemic species, including invertebrates, fishes and reptiles. This endemism is also common to the twin lakes, due to proximity and common history. =Fauna= Hispaniolan slider The lake supports over 100 species of waterfowl (including flamingos), as well as American crocodiles; fresh water species of turtle, including the Hispaniolan slider and rhinoceros iguana. Some fishes, such as tilapia, are also found. Its recognized importance is as a breeding, passage and wintering area for numerous bird species: as many as 300–400 breeding pairs of wading birds in the Ciconiiformes can be found in the eastern zone of the lagoon. Important avian raptor species of the lake include the osprey, Pandion haliaetus. American crocodiles American crocodiles, Crocodylus acutus, are found in this land-locked, brackish lake in large numbers, and have instilled fear among the local community. It is one factor responsible for the poor development of the lake as an ecotourism project. Extensive studies have been reported on this species of American crocodile, as opposed to the Central American Crocodylus moreletii and the South American Crocodylus intermedius. American crocodile C. acutus is widely distributed in the coastal region of the neotropics; however, it is conjectured to be surviving on the island of Hispaniola only in the salt water lakes of Enriquillo and Lake Azuéi. In 1984, there were estimated to be more than 400 individuals in and around Azuéi. It is also reported that this population is nearing extinction due to excessive hunting and poaching. American crocodiles generally achieve a length of , though long or long specimens have been reported in the Étang Saumâtre. The lake is known for the high concentration of crocodiles at 9.6/km in certain zones, with average density of 6.3/km for all crocodile size classes. The density varies in its habitat zones, over a distance of and length from the shore line. In the rocky shores, the density was reported to be 0.2/km. However, from from the shore line called the conocarpus fringe, the density was recorded as 14.5/km. They grow in size up to the age of 2 years when their size is in the range of . They are found in shallow water zones also and feed on Cichlids (Nandopsis haitiensis). They remain mostly at the bottom of the lake and during bird nesting season they are found around a heron rookery to catch falling eggs of birds. Their foraging techniques vary from an active to a passive mode and they forage on non-aquatic invertebrates and also odonate larvae. Birds and fish (Cichilidae) are the common items of their diet. Adults also eat domestic animals such as dogs and goats, and turtles. They nest in a stretch within a range of from the shoreline, of the uninhabited eastern lake shore, near charcoal-making sites and in coralliferous limestone outcrops. Aquatic fauna Aquatic fauna of the lake consists of small Poeciliidae (Gambusia dominicensis , Limia melanonotata , Limia nigrofasciata ) and Cichlidae (Nandopsis haitiensis). In the past, 17,000 mirror carp fingerlings and 50,000 Tilapia mossambica fingerlings (a figure of 6,000 is also mentioned) were reportedly stocked in the lake. Fish productivity figures of the lake are not available. However, the actual catches are reported to be small, as fishing is done only on a small scale. Boats do not ply the lagoon; fishing methods are primitive and no nets are used. Ducks are hunted for food as well. =Flora= The lake is in the region of dry subtropical forest and hence the vegetation around the lake is sparse, with cacti and scrub-type shrubs. Typical vegetation consists of dry-forest plants endemic to the island of Hispaniola. They include trees, shrubs and cacti: caguey (Neoabbottia paniculata), melon espinoso (Melocactus lemairei), palo blanco (Croton poitaei), pitahaya (Harrisia nashii) and oreganillo (Lantana cifferiana). The lagoon itself has several species of algae. In the fringes of the lake, Conocarpus erectus are reported and Typha domingensis are seen in the marshy region and fresh water streams and canals that have inlet into the lake. The lake has halophytic algae laid out as mattresses growing on its lake bed. Buttonwood mangroves (Conocorpus erectus) trees have large growth in the periphery of the lake. These are felled extensively to make charcoal. Threats to the lake Deforestation and soil erosion have occurred and are occurring in the catchment of Lake Azuéi. Its water level has remained relatively stable. Increased levels of eutrophication in the form of increased growth of algae have been noted due to urban growth which is chiefly in Fonds Parisien. During heavy afternoon winds deposit periodically dropped or dumped plastics from the shore. Publicly taxed waste disposal and management rarely operate around the lake, an area which also has little law enforcement of minor littering. Conservation measures Haiti and the Dominican Republic and many international agencies are aware of the status of the two water bodies and the catchments drained by them. While Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic has become the first Dominican Ramsar Site and is also a national park since 1996, its twin lake, the Etang Saumâtre has only been studied and is yet to receive the constructive attention for conservation of its American crocodiles and to promote ecotourism in general. However, a transboundary environmental program covering the watershed of the two lakes has been identified by the two governments to jointly initiate measures to improve the condition of the lakes and their respective catchments. This team, with professionals drawn from both countries, and with financial support from the European Union, could ensure that steps are taken to “create wise use practices for both lakes and their corresponding watersheds”.

Nissim our teacher; 990–1062), was a rabbi best known today for his Talmudic commentary ha-Mafteach, by which title he is also known. Biography Rav Nissim studied at the Kairouan yeshiva, initially under his father - Jacob ben Nissim (\\"Rav Yaakov Gaon\\") who had studied under Hai Gaon - and then under Chushiel, whom he succeeded as head of the Yeshiva. Nissim himself later became head of the yeshiva; in this capacity he is closely associated with Chananel son of Chushiel. His most famous student is probably Isaac Alfasi (the \\"Rif\\"). Rav Nissim maintained an active correspondence with Hai Gaon and with Shmuel Hanaggid, whose son Joseph married Nissim's only daughter (1049 CE). Works The commentary Sefer mafteaḥ le-manʻ ūlei ha-talmūd (Hebrew: \\"The book of the key to unlocking the Talmud\\"; often, simply ha-Mafteach, (The Key), linked here) is essentially a Talmudic cross-reference. In it Rav Nissim identifies the sources for Mishnaic quotes, identifying obscure allusions to other places in Talmudic literature. He quotes from the Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifre, Sifra, and from the Jerusalem Talmud, the explanations of which he sometimes prefers to those of the Babylonian Talmud. Nissim did not confine himself to quoting references, he also discusses these in connection with the text; this work is thus also a commentary. The work was written on several tractates, and is printed, in many editions, on the page itself. Nissim also wrote other works, some of which have been lost, but which are quoted by later sages: *\\"Siddur Tefillah\\", a siddur (prayerbook) *A commentary on the Torah (now lost) *A \\"Sefer ha-Mitzvot\\" on the commandments (now lost) * \\"Hilkhot Lulav\\" a polemic against the Karaites (now lost) *\\"Megillat Setarim\\": a collection of notes concerning halakhic decisions, explanations, and midrashim, primarily a note-book for the author's private use, and published by his pupils probably not until after his death. *A collection of tales, \\"Sefer Ma'asiyyot ha-Hakhamim wehu Ḥibbur Yafeh meha-Yeshu'ah\\": about sixty tales, based upon the Mishnah, Baraita, the two Talmuds, and the midrashic writings; and written at the request of Nissim's father-in-law, Dunash, on the loss of his son. This is translated into English as \\"An Elegant Compilation concerning Relief after Adversity\\" (Bibliography, below) Literary portrayals R. Nissim appears as a character in A Delightful Compendium of Consolation: A Fabulous Tale of Romance, Adventure and Faith in the Medieval Mediterranean, a novel by Burton Visotzky. The novel expands on the few known biographical facts (including the marriage of his daughter). Its title, A Delightful Compendium, derives from \\"Ḥibbur Yafeh\\".

It is an acronym for Real-time Multitasking eXecutive. Overview Intel developed iRMX in the 1970s and originally released RMX/80 in 1976 and RMX/86 in 1980 to support and create demand for their processors and Multibus system platforms.Real-time Elements, Donald J. Ewing, Professor Emeritus, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Toledo, EECS 4170/5170/7170 Class Notes The functional specification for RMX/86 was authored by Bruce Schafer and Miles Lewitt and was completed in the summer of 1978 soon after Intel relocated the entire Multibus business from Santa Clara, California to Aloha, Oregon. Schafer and Lewitt went on each manage one of the two teams that developed the RMX/86 product for release on schedule in 1980. Effective 2000 iRMX is supported, maintained, and licensed worldwide by TenAsys Corporation, under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Intel. iRMX is a layered design: containing a kernel, nucleus, basic i/o system, extended i/o system and human interface. An installation need include only the components required: intertask synchronization, communication subsystems, a filesystem, extended memory management, command shell, etc. The native filesystem is specific to iRMX, but has many similarities to the original Unix (V6) filesystem, such as 14 character path name components, file nodes, sector lists, application readable directories, etc. iRMX supports multiple processes (known as jobs in RMX parlance) and multiple threads are supported within each process (task). In addition, interrupt handlers and threads exist to run in response to hardware interrupts. Thus, iRMX is a multi-processing, multi-threaded, pre-emptive, real-time operating system (RTOS). =Commands= The following list of commands are supported by iRMX 86.iRMX™86 INTRODUCTION AND OPERATOR'S REFERENCE MANUAL For Release 6 * ATTACHDEVICE * ATTACHFILE * BACKUP * COPY * CREATEDIR * DATE * DEBUG * DELETE * DETACHDEVICE * DETACHFILE * DIR * DISKVERIFY * DOWNCOPY * FORMAT * INITSTATUS * JOBDELETE * LOCDATA * LOCK * LOGICALNAMES * MEMORY * PATH * PERMIT * RENAME * RESTORE * SUBMIT * SUPER * TIME * UPCOPY * VERSION * WHOAMI =Historical uses= iRMX III on Intel Multibus hardware is used in the majority core systems on CLSCS the London Underground Central line signals control system was supplied by Westinghouse (now Invensys) and commissioned in the late 1990s. The Central line is an automatic train operation line. Automatic train protection is by trackside and train borne equipment that does not use iRMX. It is the automatic train supervision elements that use a mix of iRMX on Multibus, and Solaris on SPARC computers. 16 iRMX local site computers are distributed along the Central line together with 6 central iRMX computers at the control centre. All 22 iRMX computers are dual redundant. iRMX CLSCS continues in full operation. Oslo Metro uses a similar, although less complex, Westinghouse-supplied iRMX control system through the central Common Tunnel tracks. This was expected to be decommissioned in 2011. Variants Several variations of iRMX have been developed since its original introduction on the Intel 8080: iRMX I, II and III, iRMX-86, iRMX-286, DOS-RMX, iRMX for Windows, and, most recently, INtime. While many of the original variants of iRMX are still in use, only iRMX III, iRMX for Windows, and INtime are currently supported for the development of new real-time applications. Each of these three supported variants of iRMX require an Intel 80386 equivalent or higher processor to run. A significant architectural difference between the INtime RTOS and all other iRMX variants is the support for address segments (see x86 memory segmentation). The original 8086 family of processors relied heavily on segment registers to overcome limitations associated with addressing large amounts of memory via 16-bit registers. The iRMX operating system and the compilers developed for iRMX include features to exploit the segmented addressing features of the original x86 architecture. The INtime variant of iRMX does not include explicit support for segmentation, opting instead to support only the simpler and more common 32-bit flat addressing scheme. Despite the fact that native processes written for INtime can only operate using unsegmented flat-mode addressing, it is possible to port and run some older iRMX applications that use segmented addressing to the INtime kernel. When Intel introduced the Intel 80386 processor, in addition to expanding the iRMX RTOS to support 32-bit registers, iRMX III also included support for the four distinct protection rings (named rings 0 through 3) which describe the protected-mode mechanism of the Intel 32-bit architecture. In practice very few systems have ever used more than rings 0 and 3 to implement protection schemes. =iRMX= The I, II, III, -286 and -86 variants are intended as standalone real-time operating systems. A number of development utilities and applications were made for iRMX, such as compilers (PL/M, Fortran, C), an editor (Aedit), process and data acquisition applications and so on. Cross compilers hosted on the VAX/VMS system were also made available by Intel. iRMX III is still supported today and has been used as the core technology for newer real-time virtualization RTOS products including iRMX for Windows and INtime. =DOS-RMX= DOS-RMX is a variant of the standalone iRMX operating system designed to allow two operating systems to share a single hardware platform. In simplest terms, DOS and iRMX operate concurrently on a single IBM PC compatible computer, where iRMX tasks (processes) have scheduling priority over the DOS kernel, interrupts, and applications. iRMX events (e.g., hardware interrupts) pre-empt the DOS kernel to ensure that tasks can respond to real-time events in a time- deterministic manner. In a functional sense, DOS-RMX is the predecessor to iRMX for Windows and INtime. In practice, DOS-RMX appears as a TSR to the DOS kernel. Once loaded as a TSR, iRMX takes over the CPU, changing to protected mode and running DOS in a virtual machine within an RMX task. This combination provides RMX real-time functionality as well as full DOS services. =iRMX for Windows= Like DOS-RMX, this system provides a hybrid mixture of services and capabilities defined by DOS, Windows, and iRMX. Inter-application communication via an enhanced Windows DDE capability allows RMX tasks to communicate with Windows processes.Rajamani K. et al.: \\"Windows Goes Real Time\\", pages 121-122. BYTE, April 1992 iRMX for Windows was originally intended for use in combination with the 16-bit version of Windows. In 2002 iRMX for Windows was reintroduced by adding these RMX personalities to the INtime RTOS for Windows, allowing it to be used in conjunction with the 32-bit protected-mode versions of Windows (Windows NT, Windows 2000, etc.).Merge the RMX operating system with Windows =INtime= Like its iRMX predecessors, INtime is a real-time operating system. And, like DOS-RMX and iRMX for Windows, it runs concurrently with a general-purpose operating system on a single hardware platform. INtime 1.0 was originally introduced in 1997 in conjunction with the Windows NT operating system. Since then it has been upgraded to include support for all subsequent protected-mode Microsoft Windows platforms, including Windows Vista and Windows 7. INtime can also be used as a stand-alone RTOS. INtime binaries are able to run unchanged when running on a stand-alone node of the INtime RTOS. Unlike Windows, INtime can run on an Intel 80386 or equivalent processor. Current versions of the Windows operating system generally require at least a Pentium level processor in order to boot and execute. The introduction of INtime 3.0 included several important enhancements. Among them, support for multi-core processors and the ability to debug real-time processes on the INtime kernel using Microsoft Visual Studio. INtime is not an SMP operating system, thus support for multi-core processors is restricted to a special form of asymmetric multiprocessing. When used on a multi-core processor INtime can be configured to run on one CPU core while Windows runs on the remaining processor core(s). Uses Use cases can be viewed on the TenAsysTenAsys website.

Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was the focal point of the movement's campaign of civil resistance, with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily.Andrew Wilson, \\"Ukraine's 'Orange Revolution' of 2004: The Paradoxes of Negotiation\\", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 295–316. Nationwide, the revolution was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience, sit-ins, and general strikes organized by the opposition movement. The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were rigged by the authorities in favour of the latter.Paul Quinn-Judge, Yuri Zarakhovich, The Orange Revolution, Time, 28 November 2004 The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by Ukraine's Supreme Court for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be \\"free and fair\\". The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych's 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kyiv, the Orange Revolution ended. In the following years, the Orange Revolution had a negative connotation among pro-government circles in Belarus and Russia.Ukraine is Not Russia:Comparing Youth Political Activism by Taras Kuzio, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006 «В оранжевых и радужных трусах» In orange and red shorts, Vzglyad (25 January 2013) In the 2010 presidential election, Yanukovych became Yushchenko's successor as Ukrainian President after the Central Election Commission and international observers declared that the presidential election was conducted fairly. Yanukovych was ousted from power four years later following the February 2014 Euromaidan clashes in Kyiv's Independence Square. Unlike the bloodless Orange Revolution, these protests resulted in more than 100 deaths, occurring mostly between 18 and 20 February 2014. Background =Gongadze assassination/Kuchmagate crisis= Georgiy Gongadze, a Ukrainian journalist and the founder of Ukrayinska Pravda (an Internet newspaper well known for publicising the corruption or unethical conduct of Ukrainian politicians) was kidnapped and murdered in 2000. Though no-one accused Ukrainian President Kuchma of personally murdering him, persistent rumours suggested that the President had ordered the killing. This murder sparked a movement against Kuchma in 2000 that can be seen as the origin of the Orange Revolution in 2004. After two terms of presidency (1994-2005) and the Cassette Scandal of 2000 that ruined his image irreparably, Kuchma decided not to run for a third term in the 2004 elections and instead supported Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential race against Viktor Yushchenko of the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. =Causes of the Orange Revolution= The state of Ukraine during the 2004 presidential election is considered an \\"ideal condition\\" for an outburst from the public. During this time Ukrainians were impatient while waiting for the economic and political transformation.Ukraine's Orange Revolution: Causes and Consequences by Taras Kuzio, University of Ottawa (28 April 2005) The results of the election were thought to be fraudulent and considered \\"a nail in the coffin\\" of the preceding events. = Factors enabling the Orange Revolution = The Ukrainian regime that was in power before the Orange Revolution created a path for a democratic society to emerge. It was based on a \\"competitive authoritarian regime\\" that is considered a \\"hybrid regime\\", allowing for a democracy and market economy to come to life. The election fraud emphasised the Ukrainian citizens' desire for a more pluralistic type of government. The Cassette Scandal sparked the public's desire to create a social reform movement. It not only undermined the peoples' respect for Kuchma as a president, but also for the elite ruling class in general. Because of Kuchma's scandalous behaviour, he lost many of his supporters with high ranking government positions. Many of the government officials who were on his side went on to fully support the election campaign of Yushchenko and well as his ideas in general. After a clear lack of faith in the government had been instilled in the Ukrainian population, Yushchenko's role had never been more important to the revolution. Yushchenko was a charismatic candidate who showed no signs of being corrupt. Yuschenko was on the same level as his constituents and presented his ideas in a \\"non-Soviet\\" way. Young Ukrainian voters were extremely important to the outcome of the 2004 Presidential election. This new wave of younger people had different views of the main figures in Ukraine. They were exposed to a lot of negativity from the Kuchmagate and therefore had very skewed visions about Kuchma and his ability to lead their country. The abundance of younger people who participated showed an increasing sense of nationalism that was developing in the country. The Orange Revolution had enough popular impact that it interested people of all ages.BBC News. \\"Ukraine Country Profile.\\" 2012. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102303.stm. 2 Dec 2012; Encyclopædia Britannica.

The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko won the October 2004 presidential election.Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine's Democratic Breakthrough by Anders Aslund and Michael A. McFaul, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2006, = Ukraine Presidential Election campaign 2004 = The 2004 presidential election in Ukraine eventually featured two main candidates: * sitting Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, largely supported by Leonid Kuchma (the outgoing President of Ukraine who had already served two terms in office from 1994 and was precluded from running himself due to the constitutional term limits) * the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko, leader of the Our Ukraine faction in the Ukrainian parliament and a former Prime Minister (in office 1999–2001) The election took place in a highly charged atmosphere, with the Yanukovych team and the outgoing president's administration using their control of the government and state apparatus for intimidation of Yushchenko and his supporters. In September 2004 Yushchenko suffered dioxin poisoning under mysterious circumstances. While he survived and returned to the campaign trail, the poisoning undermined his health and altered his appearance dramatically (his face remains disfigured by the consequences ). The two main candidates were neck and neck in the first-round vote held on 31 October 2004, winning 39.32% (Yanukovych) and 39.87% (Yushchenko) of the votes cast. The candidates who came third and fourth collected much less: Oleksandr Moroz of the Socialist Party of Ukraine and Petro Symonenko of the Communist Party of Ukraine received 5.82% and 4.97%, respectively. Since no candidate had won more than 50% of the cast ballots, Ukrainian law mandated a run-off vote between two leading candidates. After the announcement of the run-off, Oleksandr Moroz threw his support behind Viktor Yushchenko. The Progressive Socialist Party's Natalia Vitrenko, who won 1.53% of the vote, endorsed Yanukovych, who hoped for Petro Simonenko's endorsement but did not receive it.Ukrainiустафа Найем, \\"С Президентом на «вы» \\", Фокус, 2 April 2007, №13 In the wake of the first round of the election, many complaints emerged regarding voting irregularities in favour of the government-supported Yanukovych. However, as it was clear that neither nominee was close enough to collecting an outright majority in the first round, challenging the initial result would not have affected the final outcome of the round. So the complaints were not actively pursued and both candidates concentrated on the upcoming run-off, scheduled for 21 November. Pora! activists were arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (reportedly on President Kuchma's personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition.Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present edited by Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash, Oxford University Press, 2009, (page 345) Yushchenko's supporters originally adopted orange as the signifying colour of his election campaign. Later, the colour gave its name to an entire series of political labels, such as the Oranges (Pomaranchevi in Ukrainian) for his political camp and its supporters. At the time when the mass protests grew, and especially when they brought about political change in the country, the term Orange Revolution came to represent the entire series of events. In view of the success of using colour as a symbol to mobilise supporters, the Yanukovych camp chose blue for themselves.

While Yanukovych supporters have claimed that Yushchenko's connections to the Ukrainian media explain this disparity, the Yushchenko team publicised evidence of many incidents of electoral fraud in favour of the government-backed Yanukovych, witnessed by many local and foreign observers. These accusations were reinforced by similar allegations, though at a lesser scale, during the first presidential run of 31 October. The Yushchenko campaign publicly called for protest on the dawn of election day, 21 November 2004, when allegations of fraud began to spread in the form of leaflets printed and distributed by the 'Democratic Initiatives' foundation, announcing that Yushchenko had won – on the basis of its exit poll. Beginning on 22 November 2004, massive protests started in cities across Ukraine: the largest, in Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), attracted an estimated 500,000 participants,Veronica Khokhlova, New Kids On the Bloc, The New York Times, 26 November 2004 who on 23 November 2004, peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the colour of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. One of the most prominent activists of that time was Paraska Korolyuk, subsequently bestowed with the Order of Princess Olga. From 22 November Pora! undertook the management of the protests in Kyiv until the end of the demonstration. The local councils in Kyiv, Lviv,Kamil Tchorek, Protest grows in western city, The Times, 26 November 2004 and several other cities passed, with the wide popular support of their constituency, a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election results, and Yushchenko took a symbolic presidential oath.Yushchenko takes reins in Ukraine. BBC NEWS. 23 January 2005. URL Retrieved 17 November 2006 This \\"oath\\" taken by Yushchenko in half- empty parliament chambers, lacking the quorum as only the Yushchenko-leaning factions were present, could not have any legal effect. But it was an important symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the resolve of the Yushchenko campaign not to accept the compromised election results. In response, Yushchenko's opponents denounced him for taking an illegitimate oath, and even some of his moderate supporters were ambivalent about this act, while a more radical side of the Yushchenko camp demanded him to act even more decisively. Some observers argued that this symbolic presidential oath might have been useful to the Yushchenko camp should events have taken a more confrontational route. In such a scenario, this \\"presidential oath\\" Yushchenko took could be used to lend legitimacy to the claim that he, rather than his rival who tried to gain the presidency through alleged fraud, was a true commander-in-chief authorised to give orders to the military and security agencies. At the same time, local officials in Eastern and Southern Ukraine, the stronghold of Viktor Yanukovych, started a series of actions alluding to the possibility of the breakup of Ukraine or an extra-constitutional federalisation of the country, should their candidate's claimed victory not be recognised. Demonstrations of public support for Yanukovych were held throughout Eastern Ukraine and some of his supporters arrived in Kyiv. In Kyiv the pro-Yanukovych demonstrators were far outnumbered by Yushchenko supporters, whose ranks were continuously swelled by new arrivals from many regions of Ukraine. The scale of the demonstrations in Kyiv was unprecedented. By many estimates, on some days they drew up to one million people to the streets, in freezing weather.USAID Report Democracy Rising (PDF) In total 18.4% of Ukrainians have claimed to have taken part in the Orange Revolution (across Ukraine). Political developments Although Yushchenko entered into negotiations with outgoing President Leonid Kuchma in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke up on 24 November 2004. Yanukovych was officially certified as the victor by the Central Election Commission, which itself was allegedly involved in falsification of electoral results by withholding the information it was receiving from local districts and running a parallel illegal computer server to manipulate the results. The next morning after the certification took place, Yushchenko spoke to supporters in Kyiv, urging them to begin a series of mass protests, general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing it to concede defeat. In view of the threat of illegitimate government acceding to power, Yushchenko's camp announced the creation of the Committee of National Salvation which declared a nationwide political strike. On 1 December 2004, the Verkhovna Rada passed a resolution that strongly condemned pro-separatist and federalisation actions, and passed a non-confidence vote in the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, a decision Prime Minister Yanukovych refused to recognise. By the Constitution of Ukraine, the non-confidence vote mandated the government's resignation, but the parliament had no means to enforce a resignation without the co-operation of Prime Minister Yanukovych and outgoing President Kuchma. On 3 December 2004, Ukraine's Supreme Court finally broke the political deadlock. The court decided that due to the scale of the electoral fraud it became impossible to establish the election results. Therefore, it invalidated the official results that would have given Yanukovych the presidency. As a resolution, the court ordered a revote of the run-off to be held on 26 December 2004.Supreme Court of Ukraine decision regarding the annulment of 21 November vote. Full text in Ukrainian and Summary in English This decision was seen as a victory for the Yushchenko camp while Yanukovych and his supporters favoured a rerun of the entire election rather than just the run-off, as a second-best option if Yanukovych was not awarded the presidency. On 8 December 2004 the parliament amended laws to provide a legal framework for the new round of elections. The parliament also approved the changes to the Constitution, implementing a political reform backed by outgoing President Kuchma as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities and opposition. In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the elections was \\"taken away\\", he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed. \\"I didn't want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands.

J. Chivers, BACK CHANNELS: A Crackdown Averted; How Top Spies in Ukraine Changed the Nation's Path, The New York Times, 17 January 2005. Ukrainian security agencies played an unusual role in the Orange Revolution, with a KGB successor agency in the former Soviet state providing qualified support to the political opposition. As per the paper report, on 28 November 2004 over 10,000 MVS (Internal Ministry) troops were mobilised to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kyiv by the order of their commander, Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov.For question on ultimate source of orders and mobilisation details see Lehrke, Jesse Paul. The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988–2005. Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge (2013), 188–89. The SBU (Security Service of Ukraine, a successor to the KGB in Ukraine) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksander Galaka, head of GUR (military intelligence) made calls to \\"prevent bloodshed\\". Col. Gen. Ihor Smeshko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both claimed to have warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did, preventing bloodshed. In addition to the desire to avoid bloodshed, the New York Times article suggests that siloviki, as the security officers are often called in the countries of the former Soviet Union, were motivated by personal aversion to the possibility of having to serve President Yanukovych, who was in his youth convicted of robbery and assault and had alleged connection with corrupt businessmen, especially if he were to ascend to the presidency by fraud. The personal feelings of Gen. Smeshko towards Yanukovych may also have played a role. Additional evidence of Yushchenko's popularity and at least partial support among the SBU officers is shown by the fact that several embarrassing proofs of electoral fraud, including incriminating wiretap recordings of conversations among the Yanukovych campaign and government officials discussing how to rig the election, were provided to the Yushchenko camp., Ukrainska Pravda, 24 November 2004. These conversations were likely recorded and provided to the opposition by sympathisers in the Ukrainian Security Services. According to Abel Polese, Kuchma was concerned about its reputation in the West; because of lack of natural resources to finance his regime he had to show a commitment to democracy in order to be targeted for Western financial assistance.Russia, the US, “the Others” and the “101 Things to Do to Win a (Colour)Revolution”: Reflections on Georgia and Ukraine by Abel Polese, Routledge (26 October 2011) Internet usage Throughout the demonstrations, Ukraine's emerging Internet usage (facilitated by news sites which began to disseminate the Kuchma tapes) was an integral part of the orange revolutionary process. It has even been suggested that the Orange Revolution was the first example of an Internet-organised mass protest.McFaul, Michael. \\"Transitions from Postcommunism.\\" Journal of Democracy 16, no. 3 (2005): p. 12. Analysts believe that the Internet and mobile phones allowed an alternative media to flourish that was not subject to self-censorship or overt control by President Kuchma and his allies and pro-democracy activists (such as Pora!) were able to use mobile phones and the Internet to coordinate election monitoring and mass protests.Goldstein, Joshua.

The New Policy Institute. p. 14 2004 Ukrainian constitutional changes As part of the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainian constitution was changed to shift powers from the presidency to the parliament. This was Oleksandr Moroz's price for his decisive role in winning Yushchenko the presidency. The Communists also supported these measures. These came into effect in 2006 during which Yanukovych's Party of Regions won the parliamentary election, creating a coalition government with the Socialists and the Communists under his leadership. As a result, President Viktor Yushchenko had to deal with a powerful Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych who had control of many important portfolios. His premiership ended in late 2007 after Yushchenko had succeeded in his months-long attempt to dissolve parliament. After the election, Yanukovych's party again was the largest, but Tymoshenko's finished far ahead of Yushchenko's for second place. The Orange parties won a very narrow majority, permitting a new government under Tymoshenko, but Yushchenko's political decline continued to his poor showing in the 2010 presidential election. On 1 October 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional.Update: Return to 1996 Constitution strengthens president, raises legal questions, Kyiv Post (1 October 2010) 2010 presidential election A Circuit administrative court in Kyiv forbade mass actions at Maidan Nezalezhnosti from 9 January 2010 to 5 February 2010.

This research (also) showed that Ukrainians in total had a less positive view on the Orange Revolution in 2007 than they had in 2005. It has been suggested that since the Orange Revolution was impactful enough to interest people of all ages it increased the overall unity of Ukraine.

No first-run episodes were shown in 1994. The series was executive produced by Sydney Pollack and produced by Steve Golin and others. The theme song was written by Elmer Bernstein and the original music was written by Peter Bernstein. Period torch songs by performers like Patti Page and Billie Holiday were used periodically. In Europe, the show is known as Perfect Crimes and shown in France on Canal +, and in the United Kingdom. Series overview The series is set in somber Los Angeles right after World War II and before the election of American president John F. Kennedy. The episodes, although filmed in color, mimicked what had been done by Hollywood filmmakers during the film noir era of the 1940s and 1950s in terms of tone, look, and story content. The television program was produced using top-notch directors, well-known hard-boiled fiction writers, experienced screenplay writers, inventive cinematographers (who recreated the film noir images), and actors. The art direction gave the series the ambiance and historical look required of a show devoted to noir set in Los Angeles. A few known actors went behind the camera to direct a few episodes. They include: Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kiefer Sutherland. Each episode in season 1 begins with a cool and restrained jazz score as the sultry character Fay Friendly (Lynette Walden) explained to the audience what would develop in the episode. each episode in season 2 begins with a prologue voiced by Miguel Ferrer which explained to the audience the episode's events and who the main characters were.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0576498/trivia?tab=qt&ref;_=tt_trv_qu Her words are wistful, melancholic and foreshadowed the pain to come. Neo-noir novelist James Ellroy said of the show: \\"It's a roll call of tormented souls confronting their monsters within; it's a picaresque look at Los Angeles back in the forties.

Reception When it debuted, Fallen Angels received mixed to critical notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're asking a lot of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness\\". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, \\"Part of the problem is the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, \\"Fallen Angels\\" offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds\\". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, \\"uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level\\". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, \\"The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff\\". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, \\"Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, the look and feel of the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good\\". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, \\"no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short\\". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, \\"One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits\\". Home media In the United States the first season was released in a two volume VHS set. The second season was released in Europe (DVD region 2) in 1999 and Australia (DVD region 4) under the title Perfect Crimes. Other media Grove Press released a companion book, Six Noir Tales Told for Television, (1993) with all the original stories and the screenplays from the first season. A soundtrack was also released.

On 10 April 1855 at Sebastopol, in the Crimea, Boatswain's Mate Sullivan, as captain of one of the guns at Greenhill Battery, volunteered to place a flagstaff on a mound to act as an aiming point. He carried out this dangerous task undeterred by continuous fire from enemy sharpshooters, and his action enabled the battery to open fire on hitherto concealed enemy guns which were doing great damage to some of the advanced works.

Mints produced the coin from the beginning of the 13th century, based on a previously produced silver pfennig (Häller Pfennig, sometimes called Händelheller for its depiction of a hand on the front face), but its composition deteriorated with the mixing in copper little by little so that it was no longer considered to be a silver coin. There were red, white and black Hellers. Beginning in the Middle Ages it became a symbol of low worth, and a common German byword is \\"keinen (roten) Heller wert\\", lit.: not worth a (red) Heller, or \\"not worth a red cent\\". The term Heller came into wide use as a name for coins of small value throughout many of the German states up to 1873 when, after German unification, Bismarck's administration introduced the Mark and the pfennig as coinage throughout the German Empire. The German Heller saw a resurrection in 1904 when the government took over responsibility for the currency of German East Africa from the German East Africa Company. The Heller was introduced as 1/100 of a rupie instead of the pesa which had so far been a 1/64 of a rupie. In Austria-Hungary, Heller was also the term used in the Austrian half of the empire for 1/100 of the Austro-Hungarian krone (the other being fillér in the Hungarian half), the currency from 1892 until after the demise (1918) of the Empire. The term heller (, ) was also used for a coin valued at 1/100 of a koruna (crown) in the Czech Republic (Czech koruna) and Slovakia (Slovak koruna), as well as in former Czechoslovakia (Czechoslovak koruna). Only the currency of the Czech Republic continues to use Hellers (haléře), although they survive only as a means of calculation — the Czech National Bank removed the coins themselves from circulation in 2008 and notionally replaced them with rounding to the next koruna. Bills of 80 and 20 Hellers from 1920 and 1921.

Some classifications split the colobine monkeys into two tribes, while others split them into three groups. Both classifications put the three African genera Colobus, Piliocolobus, and Procolobus in one group; these genera are distinct in that they have stub thumbs (Greek κολοβός kolobós = \\"docked\\"). The various Asian genera are placed into another one or two groups. Analysis of mtDNA confirms the Asian species form two distinct groups, one of langurs and the other of the \\"odd-nosed\\" species, but are inconsistent as to the relationships of the gray langurs; some studies suggest that the gray langurs are not closely related to either of these groups, while others place them firmly within the langur group.  History  There are two major forms of the Colobinae, the Asian Presbytin and the African Colobinae. The African Colobinae are the closest living relative to apes. On the other hand, the Asian Presbytin are more geographically diverse and populated. However, through deforestation and hunting, the Colobinae are becoming an endangered species.  Characteristics  Colobines are mainly arboreal and folivorous primates. Colobines are medium-sized primates with long tails (except for the pig-tailed langur) and diverse colorations. The coloring of nearly all young animals differs remarkably from that of the adults. Most species are arboreal, although some live a more terrestrial life. They are found in many different habitats of different climate zones (rainforests, mangroves, mountain forests, and savannah), but not in deserts and other dry areas. They live in groups, but in different group forms. Colobines are folivorous, though their diet may be supplemented with flowers, fruits and the occasional insect. To aid in digestion, particularly of hard-to-digest leaves, they have multichambered, complex stomachs, making them the only primates with foregut fermentation. Foregut fermenters use bacteria to detoxify plant compounds before reaching the intestine, where toxins can be absorbed. Foregut fermentation is also associated with higher protein extraction and efficient digestion of fiber; it is the dominant form of digestions in diverse herbivore taxa, including most Artiodactyla (e.g., deer, cattle, antelope), sloths, and kangaroos. In contrast, lower diversity howler monkeys in the New World rely on hindgut fermentation – occurring lower in the colon or cecum – much like horses and elephants. Unlike the other subfamily of Old World monkeys, the Cercopithecinae, they do not possess cheek pouches. Gestation averages six to seven months. Young are weaned at about one year and are mature at three to six years. Their life expectancy is approximately 20 years.

The cars were operated and maintained by the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways.

From the royal coaches that served for King Leopold II and King Albert I are preserved the three most important royal coaches. From the royal coaches that served for King Leopold III and King Baudouin are preserved: the drawing room coach (with private rest compartment for the king), the dining coach (with big and private dining compartment and kitchen) and the sleeping coach for the king and queen (with small drawing room, sleeping compartments, bathing compartments with bathtub and compartments for the staff). = Modern use (from 2000) = For rail transport during visits of heads of state to Belgium, there is a possibility of using a first-class SNCB I11 coach with seats partially removed and a set of armchairs put in the middle of the coach. This arrangement was used for the first time on 30 May 2002 during the state visit of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, for a trip from Bruges to Brussels-South, and a second time during the state visit of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on 22 June 2006 for a trip from Schaarbeek to Liège-Guillemins. In October 2019 the Royal Family used a converted 1st class train to visit Luxemburg. They departed from the Brussels-Luxembourg railway station, to not hinder the busy train network around Brussels.

It was gifted to King Frederik VII by Peto, Brassey & Betts to the inauguration of the railway between Flensborg-Tønning. (Now in occupied Southern Schleswig) and as a result of the Second Schleswig War better known as the war of 1864, it was stranded on the Prussian side but returned to Denmark in 1865 in a barge. It was rebuilt several times first in 1883 where it was fitted with a vacuum brake, gaslighting and Mays heating system. It was rebuilt again in 1898 from a 3-axle to 2-axle car and classified Danish State Railways DSB SB 2, and 1903 reclassified for the last time as DSB S 2 and used as an inspection car until 1934 when it was withdrawn from service. In 1935 its wooden coach body was sold to greengrocer Møller and used as a summer house in Hurup Thy until 1983 when it donated to the DJK (Dansk Jernbane-Kub) Danish railway club. In 1985 it was given to the Aalholm collection at Aalholm Castle, and in 2011 it came to the Danish Railway Museum in Odense where it sits on display as an unrestored coach body to show what several other coaches looked like before restoration. For her 60th birthday in 2000, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark received a new royal coach with a drawing room, sleeping compartments and kitchen. She used this coach for her state visit to Belgium, travelling the night of 27–28 May 2002 from Denmark to Brussels-South and returning from there to Denmark on the evening of 30 May 2002. The coach and the accompanying sleeping car for the staff were hooked to normal trains, except for the part from Aachen to Brussels, where it ran as a special train to allow for the arrival on a reserved platform where the press were waiting. Ethiopia Emperor Menelik II was known to use a special first class saloon when travelling on the Franco-Ethiopian Railroad. In 1935 Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia received two carriages from the Société Franco- Belge in Raismes. Another two from the Decauville works were commissioned in 1954. As of its last use in 1973, prior to the Emperor's overthrow in a coup d'etat the following year, the Imperial train consisted of two locomotives, a baggage car with a diesel generator, four imperial carriages for the emperor and his family (lounge, sleeping compartments, offices, kitchen and restaurant), two 1st class salon-sleeper cars for guests of the Royal family and government officials, and two 2nd passenger cars.

In Potsdam Saloon No. 1 of Kaiser Wilhelm II., 1890s Germany consisted of more than 30 states – most of them monarchies – when railways came into existence. In the beginning the royalty used first class coaches or first class compartments within public coaches and trains. So prince Frederick of Prussia (later German Emperor) travelled in a first class compartment in 1851 when the train derailed in the vicinity of Gütersloh.German language Wikipedia: Eisenbahnunfall von Avenwedde. But soon most of these kings, great dukes and princes possessed their own private coaches or trains. In other cases the railway companies provided such coaches and rented them to royalty. Complementary to those private coaches and trains were private reception rooms in the station buildings and in some cases even private railway stations for the exclusive use of these privileged few. A well-preserved example is Potsdam Park Sanssouci railway station, a railway station for the use of Emperor Wilhelm II. near his summer palace, the New Palace in Potsdam.  Prussia  King Frederick William IV of Prussia purchased a set of royal coaches in 1857.Peter Bock, Alfred Gottwaldt: Regierungszüge. Salonwagen, Kaiserbahnhöfe und Staatsfahrten in Deutschland. München 2006, , p. 14. They ran on two and three axles and were painted in a chestnut brown. None of these have survived. After 30 years of use they became technically outdated, so in 1889 the new emperor, Wilhelm II, who was always very interested in engineering and technological developments started to order new coaches. Until the end of his reign in 1918 there were about 30 coaches.Alfred Gottwaldt: Der Hofzug sr. Majestät des Deutschen Kaisers, Königs von Preußen. Modelleisenbahner Verlag. [o.J., ca. 1992]; Helmut Schroeter: Der Hofzug des letzten deutschen Kaisers. In: Lok-Magazin 9 (1964), S. 37. These ran on bogies with either two or three axles and were painted in bright blue and ecru which contrasted significantly with ordinary coaches of the day which usually were painted green, grey or brown; only during World War I the imperial coaches were painted green. The private car of the emperor is on display in the German Museum of Technology, Berlin, the private car of the empress in the museum of former Linke-Hofmann-Busch GmbH (today: Alstom Transport Deutschland GmbH) who built the coach.

Two royal coaches of a most splendid design used by king Ludwig II of Bavaria are preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum, the king's personal coach as well as a terrace-coach, by half open-air.Ralf Romann Rossberg: König Ludwig II. auf Achse. In: Peter Bock, Alfred Gottwaldt: Regierungszüge. Salonwagen, Kaiserbahnhöfe und Staatsfahrten in Deutschland. München 2006, , p. 52. = Weimar Republic = The Weimar Republic inherited about 100 of these royal cars, a number far larger than useful for President and government. So no new cars were built but some of the old ones used. Others were used in luxury trains or in ordinary services, especially dining cars, or as sleepers. Lots of them were also converted to departmental vehicles.Walter Haberling: Reichsbahn - Salonwagen. Bauarten und Einsätze zur Reichsbahn- und Bundesbahnzeit. Freiburg 2010. = Nazi Germany = After 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power he and Hermann Göring ordered complete modern trains for their use. Other top officials and generals of the Wehrmacht were equipped with personal coaches. At least 78 such vehicles were built and intensively used. During World War II trains of this stock were used from time to time as movable headquarters, and some were damaged or destroyed. The saloon of Adolf Hitler e.g. was blasted by German troops in the last days of WW II.Andreas Burow: Die Flakwagen der Regierungszüge der Reichsregierung im Dritten Reich.

(Eisenbahnen und Museen 23) = Post War Period =  Federal Republic of Germany  The only newly built saloon coach for Deutsche Bundesbahn, 1974 After World War II quite a number of the saloon coaches built under Nazi rule proved fit for further use. So the Presidents of the Federal Republic of Germany as well as its Chancellors Konrad Adenauer, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt used them, as well as guests of state to the Federal Republic of Germany. The most prominent use of a whole set of these coaches was during the state visit of Elizabeth II when the queen toured for several days on a special train through the Federal Republic in 1965. The most prominent use of some of these coaches was the visit of Chancellor Willy Brandt to his East German counterpart Willi Stoph in Erfurt in 1970. One single saloon coach was built after WW II for Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1974, originally for the use of the Federal Chancellor,Fritz Engbarth: Der General vor der Rückkehr. In: Eisenbahn-Kurier. Nr. 395/Jahrgang 39/2005 (Augustheft). EK-Verlag, S. 34-35; Lok-Report. Ausgabe 01/2006; LokMagazin. Dezember 2007, p. 21. but it was always possible for private persons or parties to rent the coaches. From the 1980s on politicians used them less and less changing to air transport. Today most of the coaches are owned by railway museums or railway fan-clubs. During the 2009 electoral campaign, Angela Merkel also used a train that had been used by Konrad Adenauer in the 1950s for political purposes.  German Democratic Republic  In the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the head of state, government and top politicians of the reigning communist party used pre-war rolling stock for transport. In the late 1960s two special trains were newly constructed: One for the heads of party and state, another one for the army. The most prominent use of the government train was in 1970 when the prime minister of the GDR met the chancellor of West Germany on his return visit in Kassel. After the unification of Germany in 1990 these trains and coaches proved redundant and were sold to private hands.Klaus Bossig: Sonderfahrzeuge der Deutschen Reichsbahn. Die Führungszüge der Ministerien für Verkehrswesen und für Nationale Verteidigung. Freiburg 2008, Japan JR East E655 series EMU, the train used by the Japanese imperial family In Japan, trains for the emperor, the empress, or the empress dowager are called , literally meaning \\"trains that they use\\", albeit using an extremely polite word for \\"use\\". Trains for the other members of the imperial family are called , meaning \\"trains to ride\\" in slightly more common language. However, both Omeshi Ressha and Gojōyō Ressha refer to a non-scheduled service solely operated for the imperial family. Dedicated imperial carriages were owned by Japanese National Railways (JNR), and these came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) following privatization. The dedicated locomotive-hauled set was retired in the 2000s and replaced by the specially-built E655 series EMU, which can also be used as a VIP charter trainset. When the Emperor must travel on the Shinkansen or private railways, other trainsets may be used for Omeshi Ressha service, such as the Kintetsu 50000 series EMU for visits to Ise Grand Shrine. These trainsets are otherwise operated regularly for passenger service, but as is the case with the Kintetsu 50000 or the N700 Series Shinkansen, may have carriages retrofitted with bulletproof windows to accommodate the emperor. Additionally, when travelling to Ise, an additional carriage is reserved solely for the transport of the Three Sacred Treasures as they must accompany the emperor. In the modern period, imperial trains are used less and less, as the former emperor Akihito generally travels by air, or regular scheduled trains with a reserved carriage. In this case, bulletproof carriages will still be operated where available. Imperial trains are still operated occasionally, but they mainly function as a cordial reception for state guests, rather than transportation of the imperial family. Morocco The Moroccan royal train was composed of SPV-2000 railcars produced by Budd Company in the US and delivered in the early 1980s. The royal train consists of two self-propelled cars. After King Hassan II died, his successor, King Mohammed VI, stopped using the royal train. The Netherlands Dutch royal carriage at Utrecht Centraal railway station. The Dutch State Railways (NS) uses a single royal carriage to transport the king and his family. It was ordered by the Dutch royal family in 1991, and construction was finished in 1993. It replaced a previous two-carriage royal train built in 1930, which is currently on display in the Dutch Railway Museum.Page at the official site of the Dutch Royal Family about the royal train In 2012 two more carriages were added to the royal train. These former first class passenger carriages were slightly modified and painted blue for use in the royal train. However, they are not available for international use, unlike the royal carriage itself, which is an International Coach Regulations carriage allowed in 16 different countries. When the king travels by train, a single (diesel) locomotive travels ahead to explore the tracks. The train itself is composed of two ordinary locomotives of the Dutch State Railways (head and tail of the train), the royal carriage itself, and, since 2012, the two slightly modified first class passenger carriages for staff, press and other guests. Before 2012, instead of the two extra carriages, two ordinary first class passenger carriages were added. Usually those carriages were the most luxurious type NS had available. New Zealand The Royal Trains were special train carriages used by the New Zealand Railways during royal visits to New Zealand between 1901 and 1954. Norway The former royal carriage A1 24001 outside the Norwegian Railway Museum. The Norwegian Royal Train is a set of train carriages used by the Norwegian royal family and maintained by Norges Statsbaner (Norwegian State Railways). The current set was introduced in 1994 in connection with the Lillehammer Olympics and replaced a carriage from 1962. The current set contains a main sleeping compartment with dressing room and adjoining bathroom, two guest compartments, guest bathroom, kitchen, guard compartments and a combined dining and conference room.Dagbladet article on the new Royal Train The set is pulled by ordinary railway locomotives and most often ordinary passenger carriages for press and other guests are added. Romania The Romanian Royal Train was ordered by King Ferdinand I of Romania in 1926 to Ernesto Breda/Construzioni Meccaniche plants in Milan. It was delivered in 1928, one year after King Ferdinand's death. It was subsequently used by Queen Marie of Romania, King Michael I of Romania, Queen- Mother Elena of Romania and King Carol II of Romania. The train is composed of one steam-engine locomotive (under restoration, for the moment) and five railway cars: the Dining Car, the King's Car, the Queen's Car, the Guests Car and the Royal House Personnel's Car. On 3 January 1948 King Michael I and his mother, Queen Elena were forced into exile by the newly installed Communist authorities. After a thorough luggage search for values, the King left Romania (from Sinaia) for Austria, in the Royal Train, with tightly closed windows and under strict supervision. The Royal Family was in exile until 1997, when the post-1989 government of Victor Ciorbea revoked their loss of citizenship. During the Communist era, the train was used occasionally by the Communist rulers of Romania, especially by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In recent years, the Royal Train was gradually renovated by an NGO (the old steam locomotive is still under renovation and cannot be used). On 15 October 2012, ownership of the train line reverted from the state to ownership of King Michael I. Starting in 2012, the Royal Train is annually used by the Romanian Royal Family (Crown Princess Margareta, the eldest daughter and heir of King Michael) for public events, mainly trips with political and symbolic significance as well as travelling between the Balkan countries. For example, since 2013, the train has made regular trips. The first one was on 1 December (celebration of National Union of Romania) one the route Sinaia, Bușteni, Predeal, Brașov, Codlea, Făgăraş, Avrig and Sibiu and it was met with huge public appreciation and participation at stops; another trip was in remembrance of the Royal Family, Parliament and Government retreat from Bucharest to Iași in World War I, during the German occupation of Bucharest. The trips are met with great political and public enthusiasm as well as anticipation. King Michael I of Romania was given a State Funeral on 16 December 2017. At the conclusion of the ceremonies in Bucharest, the coffin was taken from Băneasa Railway Station to Curtea de Argeş Railway Station on board the Royal Train for burial in Curtea de Argeş. Russian Empire Borki, 1888 The late Romanov Tsars traveled by rail extensively over the expanse of their empire. The catastrophic derailment of the Russian Royal Train on 17 October 1888 killed 21 people, however Alexander III, along with his wife and children, survived. After this accident, a so-called Temporary Imperial Train was composed of several surviving cars of the wrecked train, with the addition of several converted passenger cars of the Nikolayevskaya Railway. The emperor also had at his disposal a standard gauge Imperial Train, used for traveling to Europe; this train set was purchased by the Russian Railway Ministry from Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée in the 1870s, and was deemed to be technologically obsolescent. Accordingly, new standard-gauge and broad-gauge trains for the use of the Imperial Court were constructed. The new broad-gauge Imperial Train for domestic travel became ready in time for the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896. Initially the train consisted of 7 cars, purpose-built at the Aleksandrovsky Railway Factory in St Petersburg. Later, the size of the train was increased to 10 cars. The old \\"temporary\\" train in the meantime was transferred for use of Empress Dowager Maria Feodorovna. The Russian Empire itself came to an end with Nicholas II's abdication in 1917 while aboard his Imperial Train at Dno. South Africa From 5 February to 10 April 1934, Prince George, Duke of Kent toured South Africa in a special train known as The White Train.The Herald Online The three-month-long British royal family tour of South Africa in 1947 saw the ordering of eight ivory-painted air-conditioned saloons from Britain, three of which were built to Blue Train sleeping car standards, while the remaining five were special saloons for use by the royal family and Field Marshal Jan Smuts, the South African prime minister.The Blue Train After the tour the Blue Train type saloons were painted in matching livery to serve on the Blue Train, while the remaining special saloons became part of the White Train used exclusively by the governor-general and later the president of South Africa. Part of the Royal Train is preserved in the Outeniqua Transport Museum, George, South Africa, with a SAR Class \\"GL\\" 2351 \\"Princess Alice\\" Garrett steam locomotive that actually was used to haul the White Train in 1947 Sweden Sweden's first royal train was put into service in 1874 for the use of King Oscar II. It consisted of five cars; an audience (meeting) car, a dining car, a saloon car, a sleeping car for the King and another sleeping car for Queen consort Sophia. In 1891 the cars were converted to bogie-cars and put together two and two: The King's sleeping car was joined with the saloon car, the Queen's sleeping car was joined with the dining car. The audience car was not converted. The different cars were rebuilt, refurbished and replaced continuously the years, and some of them are now on display at the Swedish Railway Museum in Gävle. The last royal train car to be built was in 1931 for King Gustav V. It was used on the King's many trips from Sweden to Nice in southern France as a through coach connected to regular trains. The King's royal car remained in use for several of his successors and was also used by the present King Carl XVI Gustaf and his family on their trips to the mountains in northern Sweden, as a through coach connected to regular trains. In the year 2001 the last royal car was taken out of regular service and is now on display at the Swedish Railway Museum, however it has been put back into service for special occasions since; the museum is connected by rail to the regular network and some of the cars on display can rather easily be brought back to service. United Kingdom Queen Victoria was the first British monarch to travel by train, on 13 June 1842, when she travelled on the Great Western Railway (GWR), which ran the line between London Paddington and Windsor (for Windsor Castle). She famously quoted, when the train was recording 30 mph, \\"This is too fast for a person to travel\\" Soon, other major British railway companies had their own carriage(s) dedicated for use by the royal family or other dignitaries. In 1948, upon the formation of British Railways, the individual regions continued to maintain their own royal train carriages. A single \\"Royal Train\\" was only formed in 1977 as a response to the demands of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. This train has been maintained since the privatisation of British Rail by DB Cargo UK at Wolverton Works, although the royal family has travelled on ordinary service trains more frequently in recent years to minimise costs.Royalty on the Rails Rail issue 462 28 May 2003 pages 36-43 Outside of monarchies Rail transport, in the form of special trains, have been widely used by the leaders of countries that are/were not monarchies (i.e., republics or dictatorships of various kinds) as well, while private rail cars attached to regular passenger trains have been maintained and used by the rich. For example, presidents of the USA often traveled in presidential railcars and Soviet leaders had special trains. (One of Leonid Brezhnev's rail cars is preserved at the Pokrovsk Station in Engels City and Volodymyr Shcherbytsky's car in Kiev.Станция Покровск. Правительственный вагон-салон (Pokrovsk Station. Government Railcar) , with photos) Leaders of North Korea, starting from Kim Il-Sung, had their own fleet of private trains. In Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito had the Blue Train. In the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos had the Presidential Carriage (PC) 286. This unit was decommissioned in 1986 but in 2020, this carriage is planned for refurbishment.

It is a development of the Remington 721 and 722 series of rifles, which were introduced in 1948. The M24 and M40 military sniper rifles, used by the US Army and USMC, respectively, are both based on the Model 700 design. The Remington 700 series rifles often come with a 3-, 4- or 5-round internal magazine depending on the caliber chambered, some of which have a hinged floor-plate for quick unloading, and some of which are \\"blind\\" (with no floor-plate). From 1978 to 1982 Remington offered the Sportsman 78 which is the same model 700 action but with cheaper features such as a plain stock without checkering. The Sportsman 78 was not included in the recall that affected the trigger group. The rifle can also be ordered with a detachable box magazine. The Model 700 is available in many different stock, barrel and caliber configurations, with many third-party and aftermarket variants in the market built on the same action footprint. Development After World War II, Remington Arms engineer Mike Walker began designing lower-cost alternatives to the Model 30, which resulted in the Model 721. These used a cylindrical receiver produced from cylindrical bar stock that could be turned on a lathe, rather than machined in a series of milling operations, which significantly reduced the cost of production. In addition, small metal parts, including the bottom metal, were stamped, and the stocks were not finished as highly as older models. Further developments of the basic 721 action under the direction of Walker produced the Model 722 and Model 725, and ultimately in 1962, the Model 700.van Zwoll, pp. 55–58 Walker sought to increase the accuracy of the rifles, by utilizing tight tolerances in the chamber and bore, a short leade, and a very fast lock time. Like the earlier 721, the Remington 700 action was designed for mass production.de Haas, pp. 249–251 Remington initially produced two variants of the Model 700, the ADL and BDL, in both long- and short-action rifles that allowed for the chambering of different cartridges. In 1969, Remington introduced several upgrades for the rifle, including a longer rear bolt shroud, a jeweled bolt and improved stock finishing. Four years later, production of left-handed versions of the rifle began, to compete with the Savage Model 110, which was at that time the only major rifle manufactured with a left-handed variant. Other versions of the rifle, including the titanium receiver 700ti, the 700 SPS (which replaced the ADL in 2005), and the CDL have since been introduced. In addition to its development as a hunting rifle, the Model 700 also provided the basis for military and police sniper rifles, starting with the M40 rifle in 1966, which was initially ordered by the United States Marine Corps. The US Army adopted the M24 Sniper Weapon System in 1986.van Zwoll, pp. 58–60 =Design= It is a manually operated bolt action with two forward dual-opposed lugs. The bolt face is recessed, fully enclosing the base of the cartridge, The extractor is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil spring. The bolt is of 3-piece construction, brazed together (head, body and bolt handle). The receiver is milled from round cross-section steel. The Remington 700 comes in a large number of variants. The symmetrical two-lug bolt body has a diameter. The long action designed for full-length cartridges up to in overall length, such as the .30-06 Springfield, and magnum cartridges such as the 7 mm Remington Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum, has a lock time of 3.0 to 3.2 milliseconds. The short action designed for cartridges having an overall length of or less, such as the .308 Winchester/7.62×51 mm NATO, has a lock time of 2.6 milliseconds.van Zwoll, p. 58Locktime by Randy Wakeman To these can be added various magazine configurations; a blind magazine which has no floorplate, a conventional magazine with detachable floorplate and a detachable box magazine. There are standard consumer versions as well as versions designed for military and police use. Some variants come with bipods, slings and other accessories. =Model 700: standard versions= Remington 700 SPS Varmint with Tasco scope Remington produces the Mountain LSS model with a stainless steel barrel and laminated stock. Heavy barrel versions with laminated stocks like the Model 700 SPS varmint are available for varmint hunting. The Model 700 ADL was replaced as the most economical Model 700 by the Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) in newer production. Remington produced a 700 ML muzzleloading rifle from 1996 onward. The EtronX electronic primer ignition system was implemented in the Model 700 EtronX introduced in 2000, though this model was a commercial failure and ceased production in 2003, along with the EtronX primers themselves.van Zwoll, p. 60 =Model 700P: police version= Remington Model 700P Remington markets the 700 to military forces and civilian law-enforcement agencies under the \\"Remington Law Enforcement\\" and \\"Remington Military\\" banners, with the military/law enforcement 700s being called the Model 700P (\\"Police\\"). The 700P series appears to have been influenced by the designs, features, and success of the M24 Sniper Weapon System and the M40 series, with one feature of the Model 700P series being the heavier and thicker barrel for increased accuracy and reduced recoil. The rifle was chambered for the .308 Winchester cartridge as well as the .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, 7 mm Remington Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, .300 Remington Ultra Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum. The 700P has a 26\\" barrel, an aluminium block bedding in its stock, which is made by HS Precision. The 700P is also marketed to the public. Remington also sells the standard U.S. Army-issue Leupold Mark IV M3 10x40 mm telescopic sight used by the Army's M24 as an optional feature. Remington offers similarly styled, less expensive versions under the Special Purpose Synthetic (or SPS) name. =Model 700 – military version= M24 SWS (right view) Both the U.S. Army's M24 Sniper Weapon System and U.S. Marine Corps' M40 sniper rifles are built from the Remington Model 700 rifle, in different degrees of modification, the main difference being the custom fitted heavy contour barrel and action length. The M24 utilizes the Long action and the M40 employs the short action bolt-face. The reason for this is that the M24 was originally intended to chamber the longer .300 Winchester Magnum round. The M40, however, was not intended to be chambered in the more powerful .300 Winchester Magnum round, yet the Marine Corps' intention was to migrate to the .300 Winchester Magnum cartridge. The Marine Corps' delay has led to a change in migratory direction, the current goal is for the M40 to become a rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum. The U.S. Army M2010 rifle (right view) The United States Army's Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center has awarded Remington a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract (W15QKN-10-R-0403) for the upgrade of up to 3,600 M24 Sniper Weapon Systems (SWS) currently fielded to the Army pending type classification as the “M24E1”. The major configuration change for this system is the caliber conversion from 7.62mm NATO (.308 Winchester) to .300 Winchester Magnum to provide soldiers with additional precision engagement capability and range. The contract is for a five (5) year period and has guaranteed minimum value of $192K with a potential value of up to $28.2 million. This award follows a full and open competitive evaluation lasting nine months, which began with the release of the Army's Request for Proposal (RFP) on January 13, 2010. The program will be executed under the authority of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, and managed by its subordinate unit, Product Manager Individual Weapons. In 2009 the U.S. Army has changed the weapon name from M24E1 to the XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle.

Remington received nearly 2,000 complaints from 2013 through 2016. 150 lawsuits have been filed against Remington alleging injury or death related to the trigger. Lawsuits have alleged that Remington covered up a design flaw in the trigger mechanism resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of serious injuries. A class action lawsuit alleges Remington knowingly sold a defective product. The Attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia objected to the proposed settlement in the class action, saying that Remington has \\"long known\\" of the defect and that the proposed settlement \\"fails to adequately protect public safety.\\" On October 20, 2010, CNBC televised the first in an ongoing investigative series, Remington Under Fire: a CNBC Investigation, reporting that the trigger mechanism used prior to 2007 on the Model 700 could fire without the trigger being squeezed. The report stated that Remington has received thousands of customer complaints since the firing mechanism was introduced in the 1940s and that nearly two dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries had been attributed to inadvertent discharges of 700 series rifles. Through internal Remington documents, the program showed that on multiple occasions the company considered recalling the product. The inventor of the firing mechanism, Merle \\"Mike\\" Walker, 98 years old at the time of the documentary, told CNBC he proposed what he called a safer trigger in 1948 while the product was still in the testing stage. Walker said his enhanced design was rejected because of the added cost, 5 1/2 cents per gun (adjusted for inflation: $). Critics of the documentary countered that every incident featured on the program involving loss of life was the result of firearms mishandling where owners pointed their rifles at other human beings. Remington responded with the Remington Model 700 Network which gave direct rebuttals to the program, and their perspective on the incidents the program describes. Remington dismisses the allegations, pointing out that in every case either trigger mechanisms of the rifles were adjusted or altered beyond recommended specifications, rifles were poorly maintained and left to rust, or was a result of misuse of the rifle. Those involved admitted to police they might \\"possibly\\" have pulled the trigger. Though Remington has since changed to a new, cheaper, trigger mechanism design, the original Walker trigger is still produced for the US military and buyers of custom rifles. On December 6, 2014, Remington announced that as part of actions put into place to settle multiple lawsuits and to avoid future legal actions, they are replacing all triggers in the Model 700s.\\"Remington agrees to replace millions of allegedly faulty triggers\\", 12/06/14, Scott Cohn, MSNBC Over 7.85 million rifles are included in this agreement, making all of them eligible for the replacements. On February 19, 2017, CBS News' 60 Minutes aired a segment on the Remington 700 trigger mechanism safety. The episode highlighted incidents of accidental deaths as a result of Remington 700s firing without the trigger being pulled, problems with Remington's trigger mechanism replacement program, and a class- action lawsuit filed by Remington owners.

A spin- off of Roach's popular Our Gang short subjects, the film stars George McFarland, Phillips Holmes, Rosina Lawrence, Billie Thomas and Carl Switzer. Directed by Fred Newmeyer and Gordon Douglas, it was originally released to theaters on December 11, 1936, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). This film, a Civil War period piece, was intended as an experiment to determine if Roach could move Our Gang into features, as the double feature and block booking were slowly smothering his short subjects production. The film was a box- office disappointment and, after another year of shorts production, Roach ended up selling the Our Gang unit to MGM in May 1938. When Roach bought the rights to the back catalog of Our Gang films he had produced from MGM in 1949, he did not buy back the rights to General Spanky. The film was part of the MGM catalog acquired in 1986 by Turner Entertainment, which holds the rights today as a subsidiary of Warner Bros. General Spanky was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1991. In 2016 it was released on DVD in Region 1 by Warner Bros. via their Warner Archive Collection. Plot Spanky (George McFarland), Alfalfa (Carl Switzer), Buckwheat (Billie Thomas) and others form an army called \\"The Royal Protection of Women and Children Regiment Club of the World and Mississippi River\\". The group sees unexpected action when Union troops approach, engaging in battles more farcical than fierce. Using clowning tactics instead of military tactics, the kids stop the advance . . . and later save an adult friend from the firing squad.

The album includes a rock rendition of \\"Political\\", one of the band's best known songs. During the concert tour to support this album, fans in one city actually presented the band with a petition requesting that they play the old version of that song. Despite earning a gold record, the album was only a modest success on the charts, however, peaking at #45 on RPM's Top 100 albums chart. A recurring theme throughout the album is disaffection with the government of then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. \\"D for Democracy\\", \\"Pulling Lame\\" and \\"Far Too Canadian\\" are all anti-Mulroney songs, reflecting the widespread popular opposition to Mulroney among the Canadian public which led to the 1992 defeat of the Charlottetown Accord and the Progressive Conservative decimation in the 1993 Canadian federal election.

Life and career Wildmon was born in Ripley, Mississippi, the son of Johnnie Bernice (née Tigrett), a schoolteacher, and Ellis Clifton Wildmon, a civil servant. Wildmon graduated from Millsaps College in 1960. In 1961, he married Lynda Lou Bennett, with whom he has two sons and two daughters. From 1961 to 1963, he served in the U.S. Army. He gained his Master of Divinity (MDiv.) from Emory University's Candler School of Theology in 1965.Donald Wildmon In June 1977, he moved to Tupelo, Mississippi, to establish the National Federation for Decency (NFD), the predecessor to the modern American Family Association, because after watching television one night in December 1976 he felt that no primetime television program was appropriate for his family with young children. With a membership of 1,400, NFD's first television advertiser boycott was during spring 1978 and against Sears for sponsoring All in the Family, Charlie's Angels, and Three's Company. Sears withdrew sponsorship of the latter two programs. In February 1980, Wildmon founded the Coalition for Better Television (CBTV), this time with the help of Jerry Falwell and claiming a nationwide membership of 5 million. However, CBTV disbanded and Wildmon started Christian Leaders for Responsible Television without Falwell's involvement. In 1986, the owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain pulled adult magazines from its stores after a boycott by the NFD. =Campaign for Decency= Throughout the late 1970s, Wildmon actively protested television series that he thought promoted immoral lifestyles. He spoke against such programs as Three's Company, M*A*S*H and Dallas. = Damned in the U.S.A. = In 1991, the British television documentary Damned in the U.S.A., made for Channel 4's Without Walls arts series and directed by Paul Yule, about the then current state of censorship in the United States, chronicled the battle between Wildmon and artists Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. The documentary won the International Emmy for Best Documentary, amongst several other awards. Wildmon sued the producers for $8 million in damages after a distributor got the rights to show the film in the United States, stating that he had signed a contract with the producers that prevented distribution in the USA. A federal court found that Wildmon's contract did not support his claim concerning distribution of the film and the documentary was released in 50 cities nationwide. = Illness and retirement = On August 18, 2009, Tim Wildmon released the news via email that his father had been admitted to the North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo over the weekend of August 15–16, with what was thought to be a serious case of meningitis. After running tests, however, doctors determined that he had St. Louis encephalitis, a disease usually contracted from mosquitoes. He spent 121 days in the hospital and rehab, and later underwent surgery for cancer on his left eye. On March 3, 2010, it was announced that Wildmon was stepping down as chairman of the American Family Association. His son Tim was expected to become the new chairman.

He was selected to represent the American League (AL) in the ill-fated 1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was scheduled for July 10 at Fenway Park but never played because of World War II restrictions on civilian domestic travel. Early life Born in Cárdenas, Matanzas, Cuba, Estalella earned the nickname \\"Tarzan\\" by his medium-frame, stocky and compact body. Standing tall and weighing , he threw and batted right-handed. Professional career Estalella's organized baseball career began in the minor leagues in 1934. After two brief trials with the 1935–1936 Senators, Estalella led the Class B Piedmont League in home runs (33) and batting average (.349) in 1937, and in 1938 he won the circuit's Triple Crown, pacing the Piedmont League in batting (.378), homers (38) and runs batted in (123), as well as in hits (180) and runs scored (134).

Although still a relatively traditional folk album, its release on a major label meant that it was the band's first album to expand their fan base significantly beyond the folk music scene. The title track, an energetically percussive environmental anthem, was a notable hit for the band on campus radio. However, despite earning a platinum record, the album was not a mainstream commercial breakthrough; the band would achieve that with its next album, 1991's Go Figure. The album's best-known song, however, is \\"Home for a Rest\\". While never a mainstream chart hit for the band, it has become by far their most famous song. Its joyous Pogues-like rhythm and lyrics about a drinking spree have made it an enduring frosh week anthem at Canadian colleges and universities.

Home to the school's men's and women's basketball teams, the facility opened in November 2004 and replaced the Hearnes Center as the school's flagship indoor sports facility. The arena also serves as the Columbia-Jefferson City market's venue for well-known 'arena' acts such as Rascal Flatts, Luke Bryan and the Eagles. The arched-roof building seats 15,061, and is located just south of Hearnes and Memorial Stadium. The arena is host to Missouri State High School Activities Association championships for basketball and wrestling. The arena was briefly known as Paige Sports Arena. About the arena Mizzou Arena from the Northwest side in 2014 Mizzou Arena also includes offices for the Men's and Women's basketball programs, the Athletic Administration and Mizzou Arena's Building Operations. For the basketball programs the arena also offers locker rooms, a 24-hour practice gym, weight and training facilities including a hydrotherapy pool, video classrooms with audio and video editing capabilities, and an academic study center. Missouri basketball coach from 1967 to 1999, Norm Stewart, is the namesake of the arena's playing court. History After protracted negotiations, a third of the venue's $75 million cost was donated by Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie and her husband Bill. It was initially named Paige Sports Arena after their daughter (who attended the University of Southern California rather than Mizzou, to much alumni and student criticism regarding the name), but the Lauries gave up their naming rights due to a term paper scandal involving that daughter shortly after the arena's dedication. The name of the arena's playing surface, Norm Stewart Court (in honor of Mizzou's longtime men's coach), was carried over from the basketball team's previous home at the Hearnes Center with the arena's opening in 2004. Attendance at men's basketball games has dropped somewhat, commensurate with the move of Mizzou in 2012 from the Big 12 Conference to the Southeastern Conference due to weak overall conference strength in the sport. With one conference game left to play in 2014, attendance was on track to be at its lowest since the 2007–08 season. In September 2014, the university announced renovations to the arena including new scoreboard infrastructure, improvements to the facility's entryway and upgrades to the team's locker room coming from a $1.5 million donation. In June 2017 a former Mizzou athletics staffer was arrested on two felony charges after he allegedly drove a Volkswagen Passat through Mizzou Arena and onto Norm Stewart Court early that morning, causing an estimated $100,000 in damages.

It extends the datalog language to allow the use of OR in rules. Briefly, disjunctive Datalog is a variant of Datalog where disjunctions may appear in the rule heads; advanced versions also allow for negation in the bodies, which can be handled according to a semantics for negation in disjunctive logic programming. A disjunctive Datalog rule is a clause of the form: :a_1 vee dots vee a_n leftarrow b_1 wedge dots wedge b_m quad 1 leq n, 0 leq m A disjunctive Datalog constraint is a clause of the form: :leftarrow b_1 wedge dots wedge b_m quad 0 leq m One of the most popular nonmonotonic logics is Reiter’s [1980] default logic. This logic was developed as a knowledge representation formalism and was originally not conceived as a database query language. However, a suitable setting was defined in which default logic can be used as a query language for relational databases (Default Query Language, DQL). From a practical point of view, in the context of deductive databases disjunctive Datalog seems to be the more suitable extension of DATALOG~ than DQL. Due to its plain syntax, DATALOGv,~ is amenable to automatic program analysis and optimization.

Born Gianoberto Maria Carlo Bugatti in Cologne, he was the eldest son of Ettore Bugatti. Soon after his birth the family moved to the village of Dorlisheim near Molsheim in Alsace, Germany, where his father built the new Bugatti automobile manufacturing plant. Born into a family of creative people, from boyhood he was interested in his father's business. His grandfather Carlo Bugatti had lived in France for several years when he relocated from his native Milan to live in Paris. The Bugatti family were multilingual and in France, Gianoberto became known as Jean. During World War I, the family lived in Milan, Italy. After the ceding of Alsace by Germany to France after the end of the war in 1919, the company became subject to French jurisdiction. By the late 1920s, young Jean Bugatti was an integral part of the company and had already demonstrated his vehicle design abilities. In 1932, at the age of twenty-three years, he did most of the design for the company's Type 41 Royale. His body designs complemented his father's engineering skill, making Bugatti one of the greatest names in automobile manufacturing. Additionally, Jean Bugatti designed four bodies for the Type 57, the Ventoux, Stelvio, Atalante and Atlantic models. Regarded as the finest of all the Bugatti touring models, the supercharged Bugatti 57 was debuted at the 1936 Paris Salon. Jean Bugatti also showed his engineering skills by working on new independent suspension systems to replace solid front axles and twin-cam engine applications. He frequently tested the company's prototypes. On 11 August 1939, while testing the Type 57 tank-bodied racer which had just won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race that year, not far from the factory on the road near the village of Duppigheim, 30-year-old Jean Bugatti was killed when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a tree after hitting a cyclist, who had got onto the track through a hole in a treefence. He is interred in the Bugatti family plot at the municipal cemetery in Dorlisheim. There is a monument to him at the site of his accident.

Morrison (August 21, 1937 – February 5, 1989) was an American football player and coach. He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants from 1959 to 1972. Morrison served as the head football coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga from 1973 to 1979, at the University of New Mexico from 1980 to 1982, and at the University of South Carolina from 1983 to 1988, compiling a career college football coach record of 101–72–7. Playing career Morrison was born in Lima, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati where he played both halfback and quarterback and also played on defense during his three varsity seasons. Morrison was drafted by the Giants in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft, where he mostly played at the positions of running back and wide receiver. He had a long career with the Giants, playing from 1959 to 1972. He is 3rd on the Giants' team record for receptions, with 395 catches, from seven different quarterbacks; over his career his plays gained 4,993 yards. His jersey number (#40) has been retired by the Giants. Morrison's best individual season as a receiver came in 1966 when the Giants won only one game. He caught 46 passes for 724 yards and scored six touchdowns. While the Giants fell on hard times, Morrison was one of the bright stars on the team. He also had five seasons of 40 receptions or more between 1964 and 1971. Because he played many positions as needed for the Giants, he was nicknamed \\"Old Dependable.\\" Coaching career Joe Morrison was a head coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, University of New Mexico, and University of South Carolina. He is one of the few major college head coaches to never work as an assistant coach. As the head coach at Chattanooga, Morrison turned around a Mocs program coming off four straight losing seasons, pacing them to three straight Southern Conference championships (1977-1979). His record at Chattanooga was 44-29-3 in seven seasons. Other than his NFL years, he is best remembered as the head coach at South Carolina. Morrison came to USC after three seasons with the Lobos of the University of New Mexico. He was a hot prospect, having gone 10-1 in 1982. Morrison took the Gamecocks to three postseason games (1984 and 1987 Gator Bowl and the 1988 Liberty Bowl) during his tenure. It was under Morrison in 1983 that South Carolina began the tradition of Einleitung from Also Sprach Zarathustra (theme from the movie \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\") as its pre-game anthem and entrance song. The idea had actually originated with former quarterback Tommy Suggs, who suggested it to then-coach and athletic director Jim Carlen in 1981. However, Carlen wanted the Carolina Band to play it rather than have it played over the stadium's sound system. When Carlen left after the season, Suggs took the idea to his successor as athletic director, Bob Marcum. While Marcum liked it, he suggested that they wait to play it until a brand-new sound system could be installed in 1982. The song was finally played for the first time in Morrison's first year, and partly because of his success the song is identified with him. Morrison's second season, 1984, was until the turn of the century reckoned as the greatest in school history. It was affectionately dubbed the \\"Black Magic\\" year by South Carolina fans because of the team's success and because of Morrison's famous all-black attire (cap, shirt, pants). The team ran a streak of nine consecutive wins (longest single season streak in school history) and was ranked #2 in the nation before being upset by Navy and later falling to Oklahoma State University in the Gator Bowl. Gaining victories against storied programs such as Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and arch-rival Clemson, the Gamecocks finished that season with a 10-2 record, which would remain a school record for wins until 2011. Morrison was named by the Walter Camp Foundation as the 1984 National College Football Coach of the Year. Morrison would also be named the Southern Independent Coach of the year in 1987. The 1984 squad also heralded two first team All-American players in James Seawright (linebacker) and Del Wilkes (offensive lineman), as well as future NFL players Sterling Sharpe (1984–1987), and Brad Edwards (1984–1987). Other notable players coached by Morrison included Harold Green, who spent several years with the Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL, current Gamecock football radio broadcaster Todd Ellis, who is the all-time passing leader at South Carolina, and Robert Brooks, who was part of the Green Bay Packers 1997 Super Bowl Championship team. During this time, Charlie Weis, former head coach of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Kansas, was an assistant coach under Morrison, his first coaching job in the college ranks. Also serving as an assistant during Morrison's tenure was Al Groh, who went on to be head coach of the New York Jets and the University of Virginia. After back-to-back 8-4 season in 1987 and 1988, expectations were high in Columbia for the 1989 campaign. However, it would not come to pass as Morrison collapsed after playing racquetball at the Solomon Blatt PE Center, and died on February 5, 1989, at age 51 from congestive heart failure. Morrison won his 100th game as a coach in 1988, when South Carolina beat N.C. State 23-7. Morrison's traditions at South Carolina Morrison's legacy still is in place at the University of South Carolina in various ways: * Black jerseys as part of uniform options are used in football and all sports. ** Morrison began the use of black jerseys as a uniform option and used them as the team's primary home jerseys during the 1987 and 1988 seasons * The use of Einleitung from Also sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30 (theme from \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\") was a tradition started by Morrison for the football team's pre-game entrance and is still done so today.

Irish Sign Language (ISL, ) is the sign language of Ireland, used primarily in the Republic of Ireland. It is also used in Northern Ireland, alongside British Sign Language (BSL). Irish Sign Language is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) than to BSL, though it has influence from both languages. It has influenced sign languages in Australia and South Africa, and has little relation to either spoken Irish or English. ISL is unique among sign languages for having different gendered versions due to men and women being taught it at different schools. Development The Irish Deaf Society says that ISL \\"arose from within deaf communities\\", \\"was developed by deaf people themselves\\" and \\"has been in existence for hundreds of years\\". According to Ethnologue, the language has influence from both LSF and BSL, as well as from signed French and signed English, BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816. The first school for deaf children in Ireland was established in 1816 by Dr. Charles Orpen. The Claremont Institute was a Protestant institution and given that Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of signed English based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - Catholic and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an oral approach. For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls moved to an oral approach in 1946 and St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956,Griffey 1994, Crean 1997 though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for Lent and sent to confession if caught signing).McDonnell and Saunders 1993 The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered- generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.LeMaster 1990, Leeson and Grehan 2004, Leeson 2005, Leeson and Saeed 2012, Leonard 2005, Grehan 2008 ISL was brought by Catholic missionaries to Australia, and to Scotland and England, with remnants of ISL still visible in some variants of BSL, especially in Glasgow, and with some elderly Auslan Catholics still using ISL today. In South Africa, the Dominican nuns who established Catholic Schools saw a need for a school for the deaf, but due to resource constraints were not in a position to do this immediately. Instead, they wrote back to their Mother House in Cabra requesting an experienced teacher of the deaf. A deaf teacher, Ms. Bridget Lynne, responded. Remnants of gendered generational Irish Sign Language are thought to still be visible in some dialects of South African Sign Language, which can probably be traced back to Ms. Lynne. Oireachtas bill The \\"Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016\\" passed all stages in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) on 14 December 2017, and was signed into law under the revised title, The Irish Sign Language Act 2017. The Act was signed into law by the President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on 24 December 2017. The Act, due to commence formally in December 2020, requires that public services are available through ISL and also outlines the need for greater access to education through sign language. Prior to the passage, there was no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter (except for criminal court proceedings). For the deaf community, recognition of ISL means more legal rights and better access to public services - including education, healthcare, media and banking. Language code The ISO 639-3 code for Irish Sign Language is 'isg'; 'isl' is the code for Icelandic.

He was recognized as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial foundation in 1971. Following the Austrian Anschluss, Grüninger saved about 3,600 Jewish refugees by backdating their visas and falsifying other documents to indicate that they had entered Switzerland at a time when legal entry of refugees was still possible. He was dismissed from the police force, convicted of official misconduct, and fined 300 Swiss francs. He received no pension and died in poverty in 1972.Who was Paul Grüninger? (in German)  Life and work  = Early life = Paul Grüninger attended a teacher preparatory school from 1907 to 1911. He also played football semi-professionally. In 1913 he joined SC Brühl and was part of the squad that won the 1915 Swiss first division title. Following completion of the military service, in 1919 he joined the police corps of the canton of St. Gallen. = Police commander of the Canton of St. Gallen in 1938 = Paul Grüninger was the police commander of the Canton of St. Gallen that borders with Germany and Austria. Following the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Switzerland had closed its border also to Jewish people arriving without proper entry permits, and in October 1938 negotiations between Switzerland and the Third Reich led to the stamping of the infamous \\"J\\" in passports issued to Jewish people. As the situation worsened and the number of refugees who tried to illegally enter Switzerland crossing the so-called green border to be secure from the Holocaust increased, the then 47-year-old Swiss official decided in summer 1938 not to send back the refugees to their country where violent antisemitism was the official state policy, facing the consequences of breaching the explicit instructions of his government and suffering the consequences. Moreover, in order to legalize the refugees' status, he falsified the refugees' visas, so that their passports showed that they had arrived in Switzerland before March 1938, when immigration to Switzerland had been restricted. The manipulations of dates enabled the newly arrived Jewish refugees to be treated as legals, and they had to be taken to the Diepoldsau camp. There, aided by the Jewish organizations, the refugees awaited their permits for temporary stay in Switzerland or their departure to a final destination. Grüninger turned in false reports about the number of arrivals and the status of the refugees in his district, and impeded efforts to trace refugees who were known to have entered Switzerland illegally. He even paid with his own money to buy winter clothes for needy refugees. The German authorities informed the Swiss authorities of Grüninger's exploits, and he was dismissed from the police force in March 1939. = So-called Grüninger case of 1938 = The Swiss Federal Government initiated an investigation, whereupon Grüninger was dismissed by the government without notice in March 1939. Grüninger's trial at the district court of St. Gallen opened in January 1939 and dragged over two years. In March 1941 the court found him guilty of breach of duty, official misconduct and forgery to a fine. His retirement benefits were forfeited, and he was cashiered, fined and had to pay the trial costs. The court recognized his altruistic motivations, but found that nevertheless, as a state employee, it was his duty to follow his instructions. = Late life = Ostracized and forgotten, Paul Grüninger lived for the rest of his life in difficult circumstances. Despite the difficulties, he never regretted his action on behalf of the Jews. In 1954 he explained his motives: \\"It was basically a question of saving human lives threatened with death. How could I then seriously consider bureaucratic schemes and calculations\\". In December 1970 as a result of protest in the media, the Swiss government sent Grüninger \\"a somewhat reserved letter of apology, but refrained from reopening his case and reinstating his pension\\". Ostracized and accused and slandered as a womanizer and corrupt fraudster, even as a Nazi by some people in the 2000s, the former chief of police for the rest of his life was no longer fixed point: Paul Grüninger died in 1972, nearly forgotten in Switzerland, without rehabilitation by the Swiss authorities.  Rehabilitation and Righteous Among the Nations  After his death, Paul Grüninger's fate was brought back partially into the public memory by some publications beginning in 1984, and steps to rehabilitate him were set into motion. The first attempt was rejected by the Swiss Council, and only as late as 1995, the Swiss federal Government finally annulled Grüninger's conviction: the district court of St. Gallen revoked the judgment against him and cleared him of all charges. Three years later the government of the Canton of St. Gallen paid compensation to his descendants, and in 1999 also the so-called Bergier Commission's report took part to Grüninger's rehabilitation, as well to rehabilitate the surviving people who had been convicted during the National Socialist period in Switzerland for their assistance to refugees – 137 women and men got public rehabilitation to 2009. In 1971, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial foundation in Israel honoured Grüninger as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. A street located in the northern Jerusalem neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev has been named after him.\\"Naming of Street in Jerusalem after Paul Grüninger  Honour in Switzerland  Paul Grüninger-Weg * The stadium of Brühl St. Gallen is named in his honour. * The Rhine bridge between Diepoldsau (Switzerland) and Hohenems in Austria, which was one of the locations in the film, was in summer 2012 named after Paul Grüninger. * Paul Grüninger-Weg in Zürich- Oerlikon  Paul Grüninger in film and television  * Grüningers Fall, a 1997 Swiss documentary film based on Stefan Keller's book Grüningers Fall.

During World War I, he volunteered for paramedical work at a military hospital in Antwerp, an experience that triggered in Bugatti the onset of depression, aggravated by financial problems, which eventually caused him to commit suicide on 8 January 1916 in Paris, France. He was 31 years old. Early life Born in Milan into an artistic family, Rembrandt Bugatti was the second son of Carlo Bugatti and his wife, Teresa Lorioli. His older brother Ettore Bugatti became a famous automobile manufacturer. He was given his first name by his uncle, painter Giovanni Segantini. His father was an Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer who also worked in textiles, ceramics, and silver metalware. As such, Rembrandt Bugatti grew up in an environment where a great many of his parent's friends were from the artistic world. In 1902, the family moved to Paris, where they lived in a community of artisans. As a child, he hung around his father's workshop and was encouraged to try sculpting in plasticine by a family friend, Russian sculptor Prince Paolo Troubetzkoy (1866–1938). Work Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp (1910) Rembrandt Bugatti was a young man when he began to work with the art foundry and gallery owner, Adrian Hébrard. He produced a number of bronzes, which were exhibited and promoted by Hébrard. Bugatti's love of nature led to him spending a great deal of time in the wildlife sanctuary near the Jardin des Plantes in Paris or at the Antwerp Zoo, where he studied the features and movement of exotic animals. His sculptures of animals such as elephants, panthers, and lions became his most well-known works. The elephant mascot that sits on top of the radiator of the Bugatti Royale was cast from one of Rembrandt's original sculptures. His art works are now highly priced. A cast of his 1909–1910 bronze, Babouin Sacré Hamadryas (Sacred hamadryas baboon), was auctioned at Sotheby's in 2006 for $2.56 million.Antiques Roadshow Insider, V.7, No.2, February 2007, p. 1. In May 2010, the Babouin reappeared at auction at Sotheby's (est. $2/3 million), along with a male and female Lion and Lionne de Nubie (est. $1.5/2 million and $1.2/1.8 million, respectively), a Grande girafe tête basse (est. $1/1.5 million) and seven other pieces from the S.

During World War I, he volunteered for paramedical work at a military hospital in Antwerp, an experience that triggered in Bugatti the onset of depression, aggravated by financial problems arising because now he was no longer able to give so much time to his artistic work. At the same time, Antwerp Zoo was forced, by feedstuff shortages, to start killing its animals, which deeply affected Bugatti because he had used many of them as subjects for his sculpture.

He played for Everton, Tonbridge Angels, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Watford and Charlton Athletic during a 16-year playing career, before moving into management. He managed seven clubs in 20 years, and he remains the only manager to have taken charge of Aston Villa, Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, the three rival clubs based in and around the city of Birmingham Saunders also managed Yeovil Town, Oxford United, Norwich City and Manchester City. He was involved in football for 36 consecutive years; he left his final managerial role, at West Bromwich Albion, at the age of 54. Playing career As a player, he was an old-fashioned, hard-shooting centre forward who \\"led the line\\"scoring 246 goals in 16 years for Everton, Tonbridge Angels, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Watford and Charlton Athletic. Saunders was leading goalscorer for six consecutive seasons at Portsmouth, and subsequent season pages. and his goals were a key factor in helping Pompey win the Third Division title in 1962. He remains their third highest goalscorer. He retired from full-time playing in 1967, when with Charlton. Managerial career =Early career= Saunders became player-manager at non-league Yeovil Town. =Norwich City= As a manager, Saunders first tasted success at Norwich City, guiding them to the Second Division title in 1972, which saw them promoted to the First Division for the first time in their history. Saunders steered Norwich City to survival in their first season in the top flight. They also reached the Football League Cup final, losing 1–0 to Tottenham Hotspur. He resigned as Norwich manager on 17 November 1973 following a boardroom row after a 3–1 home defeat to Everton. =Manchester City= Five days later, Saunders accepted an offer to take over at Manchester City. For the second season running Saunders managed a team to the Football League Cup final, but once again they lost – this time to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite their cup success, City's league form was shaky, and Saunders was dismissed three weeks before the end of the season, with the club outside the relegation places on goal average alone. He did not stay out of work for long however, and the following month joined Second Division side Aston Villa as manager. =Aston Villa= He guided Villa to promotion to the First Division (as runners-up in the Second Division) in his first season as manager, also winning the League Cup. He became the first manager to guide three clubs to the League Cup Final in three successive years. He re-established them as a top First Division club, winning the League Cup again in 1977. In 1980–81, he guided Villa to their first First Division title for 71 years. He resigned from Villa on 9 February 1982, due to a disagreement with the board over his contract. At the time, Villa were mid table in the First Division but in the quarter-final of the European Cup. His assistant Tony Barton took over, guiding them to European Cup glory four months later. =Birmingham City= He moved straight to Villa's local rivals, Birmingham City. They went down in 1984 but he got them back into the top flight at the first attempt. In January 1986, Saunders walked out on struggling Birmingham to take charge of local rivals and fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion. =West Bromwich Albion= He was unable to stop Albion from sliding into the Second Division and was dismissed in September 1987, after failing to get them back into the First Division. This was his last managerial role. =Retirement= In a friendly fixture staged as a testimonial for the recently deceased Tony Barton, Saunders appeared at Villa Park in 1994 as manager of a Villa side drawn mostly from players who had played in the European Cup final in 1982, against a West Midlands all- stars side. This was the first time he had returned to the club since his resignation some 13 years earlier. In December 2006, the 74-year-old Saunders was the guest of honour at Villa Park for the match between Aston Villa and Manchester United, invited by new chairman Randy Lerner. He returned to Villa Park shortly after, on 5 May 2007, for the 25th anniversary celebrations of the 1982 European Cup win. Death Saunders died on 7 December 2019, aged 87.

He appeared at some of the most important opera houses in Europe and America during what is commonly referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Opera\\". Career Ancona was born into a middle-class Jewish family at Livorno, Tuscany, on 28 February 1860. After embarking on a business career he decided to study voice with a local singing teacher named Matteini in his native city of Livorno. Later, he took lessons from Giuseppe Cima in Milan. Ancona is reputed to have made his debut as an amateur singer as far back as 1880; but according to The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera—from which many of the ensuing appearance dates, venues and career highlights are taken—his earliest known professional appearance in an opera did not occur until 1889, when he sang the role of Scindia in Massenet's Le roi de Lahore in Trieste. Not long afterwards, he appeared in another Massenet opera, Le Cid, at Italy's principal theatre—La Scala, Milan. His arrival at La Scala so soon after his debut reflects the excellence of the technical grounding that he must have received as an amateur performer. On 21 May 1892, Ancona was asked to create the part of Silvio in the first performance of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which took place at Milan's Teatro Dal Verme with Arturo Toscanini conducting. The next year, he appeared in the first London performance of Pagliacci at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. On this occasion, however, he sang the role of Tonio. (Soprano Nellie Melba and tenor Fernando De Lucia were also in the high-quality cast.) Ancona would appear regularly at Covent Garden until 1901, being held in high esteem by London audiences. He also sang as a guest artist in Cairo, Lisbon, Madrid, Warsaw, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Chicago, Boston and Buenos Aires. The New York Metropolitan Opera first engaged him in 1893. He sang successfully at the Met until 1897, when he went back to Europe. In 1906–1908, he returned to New York—this time to join the Manhattan Opera Company, where he was paid a generous fee. He became a special favourite of this company, which had been established by Oscar Hammerstein I in direct rivalry to the Met. His suave interpretation of Mozart's Don Giovanni was singled out for particular praise by newspaper reviewers and the Manhattan's audiences. Ancona sang in Paris in 1908, and again in 1914, at the Sarah Bernhardt theatre, where he was complimented by Bernhardt in person for his impressive singing. The illustrious French actress was not alone in her admiration for Ancona's vocal artistry. Music critics on both sides of the Atlantic commended Ancona on his elegant singing style and beautiful voice, with its easy top register and open-throated emission of homogenous tone. Indeed, the great tenor Jean de Reszke called him the best-schooled Italian baritone of his era. His histrionic skills were less developed however, and he was not considered to be an especially imaginative or exciting interpretive artist. Physically, he was said to resemble King Edward VII of England because of his pointed beard and ample waistline. The fact that Ancona was able to establish himself as a major singer in the face of intense competition from a host of other first-class baritones is a testament to his sheer quality as a vocalist. His main Italian rivals in the period between his debut in 1889 and the outbreak of World War I were: Mattia Battistini, Antonio Scotti, Giuseppe Pacini, Antonio Magini- Coletti, Giuseppe Campanari and Giuseppe Kaschmann (born Josip Kasman)—and, from a younger generation of verismo opera-influenced baritones, Titta Ruffo, Riccardo Stracciari, Pasquale Amato, Giuseppe De Luca, Eugenio Giraldoni, Mario Sammarco, Domenico Viglione-Borghesi and the promising newcomer Carlo Galeffi. Repertoire According to the critic Michael Scott, author of The Record of Singing, Ancona's smooth, fluent and refined method of singing pre- dated the verismo movement. His style and technique were particularly well suited to the operas of Verdi, and to the bel canto works composed by Bellini and Donizetti (such as I Puritani, Lucia di Lammermoor and La favorite). Ancona's repertoire of Verdi parts included Germont, Di Luna, Rigoletto, Amonasro and Iago, as well as Don Carlos in Ernani. Ancona also undertook roles composed by Leoncavallo (Silvio and Tonio), Puccini (Lescaut and Marcello), Mascagni (Alfio and David in L'amico Fritz), Giordano (Gerard in Andrea Chénier), Mozart (Don Giovanni and Figaro) and Wagner (Wolfram, Telramund and even, on occasion, Hans Sachs). He appeared, too, in French operas written by Meyerbeer, Gounod, Bizet and, as we have seen, Massenet, performing such parts as Nevers, Hoël, Scindia, Escamillo, Zurga and Valentin. Retirement, death and recorded legacy Ancona was still in good vocal shape when he elected to retire from the stage in 1916. World War One was then reaching its height in Europe, and Ancona was singing with the Chicago opera company at the time. In retirement, he devoted himself to teaching. He died of lung cancer in Florence, Italy, on 23 February 1931. An extensive collection of documents, photographs and other items relating to Ancona's career is preserved at Stanford University's Archive of Recorded Sound in California. Fortunately, however, Ancona's thoroughbred voice lives on in a series of gramophone recordings which he made during the first decade of the 20th century for Pathé in 1905–06 and, more rewardingly, for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1907–08. Twenty of his Victor recordings are now available on CD transfers (see below). They consist of several songs as well as operatic arias and duets by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Meyerbeer, Gounod, Bizet, Leoncavallo and Giordano.

D. Amaradeva, Premasiri Khemadasa to Athula Adhikari. His music is often characterised by simple melodies built around a melody that features the electric guitar – this style may be best illustrated by the song Malata Bambaraku Se.  Early life  Clarence Wijewardena was born on 3 August 1943, in Haputale, Sri Lanka, to an estate medical practitioner. His family moved to Batugedara, Ratnapura, and Clarence abandoned a budding career as a planter to pursue music full-time. He married Sheela Ramadasa and they had one daughter, Amila Priyadarshani.  Moonstones  Wijewardena formed the Moonstones at the age of 21 with Annesley Malewana as lead vocalist. Managed by an advertising icon, Sri Sangabo Corea, the group recorded several songs, which aired on the Saturday Star programme in 1966. The young musicians were mentored by Sri Sangabo Corea, together with veteran Radio Ceylon/SLBC broadcasters Vernon Corea and Vijaya Corea. Their 1968 debut EP Mango Nanda was released on the JVPC007 Philips label selling up to 5,000 copies. It included the songs \\"Mango Nanda,\\" \\"Ruwan Puraya,\\" \\"Seetha Ude\\" and \\"Menike.\\" Their second release More Hits by the Moonstones came out in November that year, on the Sooriya label and included the hits \\"Kalu Mama\\", \\"Rosa male\\", \\"Ramani\\" and \\"Goyam Kapanawa.\\" \\"Mango Nanda\\" was selected the best Sinhala song by the Hit Parade programme on Radio Ceylon. In 1969, the Moonstones welcomed female vocalist Indrani Perera who sang lead on the best selling \\"Dilhani.\\" Wijewardena himself only sang lead on \\"Dileepa Podi Puthu,\\" an adaptation of a poem written by Karunarathne Abesekara to his son. During the 'Moonstones' era, Wijewardena, who performed as a composer and music director, became a singer. Wijewardena took the initiative to start a three-member band, he was a self taught guitarist. However, later the 'Moonstones' were formed with Annesley Malawana playing the key role as lead singer. Since then this exceptional man and his music dominated the Sinhala pop music industry. He is regarded by many as a pioneering Sri Lankan musician in the realms of Sinhala popular music. After he left the Moonstones in 1970, he held a musical show in Moratuwa with Shanaka Perera and Wijith Peiris and the show was named as \\"Breakaways from the Moonstones\\". The late Mike Goonesekera took over the reins of the Moonstones after the departure of Clarence.  Golden Chimes  Wijewardena departed the Moonstones and formed a new music group called the Golden Chimes, with ex-Moonstones bassist Chanaka Perera and Lankika Perera in January 1971. Their first release included \\"Kimade Nawe\\", \\"Mage pelpathe\\", \\"Sihin Sinawai\\" and \\"Samanalayo.\\" Subsequently, English language vocalist Anil Bharati joined. The second EP on Philips label contained \\"Malai Velai\\", \\"Sihil Nuwan\\", \\"Surangana Vesvala\\" and \\"Mage Viyowen\\" and third EP contained \\"Iru Dina\\", \\"Sandai Tharui\\", \\"Muhudu Rella\\" and \\"Thakkita Tharikita.\\" At this time Wijewardena found a professional lead guitarist Dixon Gunaratne at a wedding. After evaluating Bharati's performance for one year, Wijewardena decided to enter him into the Sinhala pop music scene. Wijewardena composed \\"Ada Wei Iru Dina\\" for Bharati which became an all-time hit followed by the lovely Christmas song \\"Bethlehempure\\" and \\"Maa Adarai Nangiye\\". Clarence offered him another all-time hit \\"Tikirimalee\\" with \\"Ma Mulin Liyu Pem Pathe\\", \\"Desa Vidala\\", \\"Bambaraku Aduna\\", \\"Sarojini\\" and \\"Iru Dina Pamanak\\". In 1972, Wijewardena and Gunaratne left the Golden Chimes and they both formed a new band known as Super Golden Chimes also with the support of Annesley Malawana in 1973.  The Super Golden Chimes  Wijewardena formed the \\"Super Golden Chimes\\" back in the company of his lifelong friend Annesley Malawana.

Wijewardena introduced some of the guitar techniques through his songs via a single guitar harmony style in the introduction of \\"Dellepa podi puthu\\" and arpeggio styles in \\"Sihina Lowak\\" and \\"Malata Bambareku Se\\". Wijewardena composed a song Ma langin that was in the 1960s \\"Twist\\" style and released the song in \\"Ugayen ugayata\\" cassette in 1989. For \\"Dineka me nadee thira\\" he used mute guitar technique for the introduction. Some of the guitar techniques Clarence used in his songs are alternate picking, Chicken picking, Carter Family picking, Cross picking, Flat picking, Golpe, Hammer-on, legato, Pick tapping, Pinch harmonic, Pull-off, Slide guitar, Sweep picking and tap harmonic.  Tribute songs  Wijewardena has composed and directed music for a number of songs for the daughters and sons of his friends and relatives. He composed 'Piyaneni' in memory of the late Reverend Canon Ivan Corea who was the father of Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Vernon Corea. Wijewardena had met Corea in Maha Nuge Gardens in the 1960s during his visits to meet with Vernon Corea. The song became an instant hit in South Asia and to this day it is sung by Annesley Malewana on his world tours. Wijewardena composed a song for the son of Vijaya Corea and it was titled as \\"Viran Bilindhu Puthe\\" After that Wijewardena changed the chorus part of the song and sang that song as Kiri Muhuda Kalabala. Also Wijewardena composed a song for the son of Chanaka and Lankika Perera and it was titled as \\"Sihina Pathum Wimane\\" Also the song \\"Bethlehempure\\" which was written by Sri Lanka's famed lyricist, Mr Karunaratne Abeysekera, became an instant hit on the island. It was one of many songs capturing the Christmas spirit and the birth of Jesus. Wijewardena also composed 'Naththal Seeya' in the early 1970s. Wijewardena's first solo is 'Dileepa podi puthu' was written by Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Karunaratne Abeysekera for his own son.

The first film with music directed by Wijewardena was 'Sikuruliya' and the sound track was supplied by the Golden Chimes – the film includes a scene where Wijewardena and the Golden Chimes perform at a party. Also for the music of the songs of Sikuruliya film, Wijewardena used western musical instruments as well as eastern musical instruments. The song 'Wasanthaye Mal Kekulay' which was composed by Wijewardena was the first song that consists of five lines in the chorus part of the song. He directed music for the films in a different and unique style of his own. And also he composed music for \\"Apeksha\\" directed by H.D.Premarathne.  Outstanding skills  Super Golden Chimes LP.

Keep going, keep growing, keep glowing\\".

All of Wijewardena's compositions have been recorded at some of the island's best recording studios and under the best producing labels in Sri Lanka. Some of the early 1960s recordings were at Augie Ranaweera's studio in Bambalapitiya.  Later career  Clarence with 3 Sisters. Wijewardena organised three musical shows with his lifelong friend Annesley Malewana and Indrani Perera at BMICH in Colombo. Wijewardena proved to be quite a hit in London when broadcaster Vernon Corea broadcast his music on BBC Radio London 206 on his popular radio programme, London Sounds Eastern. Wijewardena and Annesley frequently toured the United Kingdom in the 1980s playing to huge audiences in London.  Controversy  However, due to the popularity of his songs (which has grown since his death), they have also become the subject of a lawsuit over illegally recorded renditions sampled by other Sri Lankan artists. Wijewardena's widow Sheela Wijewardana in 2001 filed suit against Rajiv Sebastian, hoping to recover a portion of the income earned through the use of her late husband's work. An action doomed to failure due to the non- availability of evidence on the part of the complainant. Since the lawsuit against Rajiv and Sarath Kothalawela, Sheela filed a wrongful lawsuit against Clarence's longtime friend and musical partner Annesley Malawana and lost it with no recourse. To this date, she has been unable to establish her rightful claims as the legitimate or legal heir to his intellectual property.  Music  Sri Lanka's musician, Clarence Wijewardena, composed and sang over 1000 of songs but 40% of them were not released because the master recordings were under the custody of record producers. Some of the songs were released to the market without any authorized label after his death. They did not get the attention of his fans because they were considered to be illegal and most of the FM broadcasting channels in Sri Lanka were not aware of them. It is unfortunate that most of these songs are not released officially and Wijewardena did not get the due credit for them. Wijewardena spent more of his composing time for his fellow singers and he had never been offered the credit for them. In the course of his career, Wijewardena wrote several songs that became classics in his own time – among these; Gamen Liyumak (Translated: A Letter From the Village), Hiruge Lowedi (Translated: In the World of the Sun), Kanda Surinduni (\\"O Lord God of the Mountain\\"), Piyaneni (\\"Father\\"), and Malata Bambaraku Se (Translated: Like a Bee To a Flower)  Death  Stone memorial (Tomb) of Clarance Wijewardana at Kanatte Cemetery. Wijewardena died on 13 December 1996, at the age of 53, in Sri Lanka after a long struggle against ruptured gastric ulcers and gangrene due to acute Diabetes. Legacy Many of his songs are considered classics, and continue to enjoy ample airtime on Sri Lankan television and radio broadcasts and on some overseas radio stations. The songs such as Rasa Pirunu Katha, Geeyakin Kese, Eatha Ran Wiman Yowun Sihina Loke, etc. are very popular among present generation which again demonstrated his talent in composing music (also as a lyricist) for the future.

The letters represent the district (prefecture) that issues the plates while the numbers range from 1000 to 9999. As of 2004 a blue strip was added on the left showing the country code of Greece (GR) in white text and the Flag of Europe in yellow. Similar plates but of square size with numbers ranging from 1 to 999 are issued for motorcycles which exceed 50 cc in engine size. With the exception of Athens and Thessaloniki which are represented by just the first letter of the three, all other districts are represented by the first 2 letters. The final one or two letters in the sequence changes in Greek alphabetical order after 8,999 issued plates. For example, Patras plates are \`ΑΧΑ-1000\`, where ΑΧ represents the Achaia prefecture of which Patras is the capital. When \`ΑΧΑ-9999\` is reached the plates turn to \`ΑΧΒ-1000\` and this continues until \`ΑΧΧ\` is finished. Only letters from the intersection of the Latin and Greek alphabets are used, specifically Α, Β, Ε, Ζ, Η, Ι, Κ, Μ, Ν, Ο, Ρ, Τ, Υ, Χ (in Greek alphabetical order). This is because Greece is a contracting party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which in Annex 2 requires registration numbers to be displayed in capital Latin characters and Arabic numerals. The rule applies in a similar way in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. Combinations used for overseas residents are \`L-NNNN\` (where L = letter and N = number) and are limited. Until 2003, taxis used \`L-NNNN\`; the plate was aligned with the prefecture and the letters were colored red. History 1972–1982 1982–2004 2004 to present =1911-1954= Up until 1954 Greek number plates were quite simple: black numbers on a white background, indicating the serial number shown on the car's license. These started at 1 and advanced to approximately 75-000 when the system was changed. The owner had to provide the plates and specifications were minimal: the size of the plates and numbers, as well as their respective colours. This meant that plates were not very uniform. Taxis had to indicate the initial of the city they were licensed in (e.g. \\"A\\" for Athens). In 1954 it was compulsory for all vehicles to change to a new system. =1954-1956= For just 2 years the system was \`L-NNN\`, \`L-NNNN\` or \`L-NNNNN\` with black characters on yellow background where L was the initial of the city they were licensed in (e.g. \\"A\\" for Athens, \\"Θ\\" for Thessaloniki etc.). All these plates display \\"1953-54\\" (the initial time period for the change - later revised) in black characters on a white background using a smaller typeface in the top left corner. These plates were compulsorily withdrawn in 1956. =1956-1972= In 1956 the system was again changed to just numbers \`NNNNNN\`. NNNNNN could be any number from one to six digits starting once again with \\"1\\" and ending this time at about \\"451000\\", though not all numbers were allocated. Characters were black on white background with a band at the top of both front and rear plates indicating city/district of registration and type of usage (private, commercial etc). Sometime after the early 60s the band on the front plate was abandoned and hence that plate became shorter in height, while the band at the rear became blue. This time it was not compulsory to change plates after 1972 when the newer system arrived. Hence these so-called \\"six-figure plates\\" can still occasionally (as of 2018) be spotted on a few old vehicles. =1972–1982= In 1972, they became lettered and the system was \`LL-NNNN\` while trucks used \`L-NNNN\`. Again, they were black characters on white background but with a different typeface. It was not compulsory to change these plates when the newer system arrived. =1982–2004= In 1982, the system changed to \`LLL-NNNN\` and the first two letters are prefecture letters (with the exception of the biggest prefectures Attica/Athens and Thessaloniki where only the first letter remained the same). Again, it was not compulsory to change to the newer \\"euro\\" plates in 2004. =2004 to present= In 2004 the euroband and international country code were added to the left and the typeface changed. In all other respects the previous system continued with the numbering allocation carrying on as from pre-2004.  Car designations  A Greek motorcycle licence plate = Prefectures (in Greek alphabetical order) = The first 2 of 3 letters (which are listed below) of a licence plate usually represent the prefecture (nomos) where the car was registered.

Entry to the headland is at Sutton while the village of Howth and the harbour are on the north-eastern face. Most of Howth Head is occupied by the Hill of Howth, though there are other regions, such as the tombolo at Sutton, extensive beaches on the northern shores, and small ones in other parts. The Baily Lighthouse is on the southeastern part of Howth Head. Nearby are the districts of Baldoyle and Portmarnock, and adjacent is the nature reserve of North Bull Island. History The earliest mention of the peninsula may be on a map attributed to Claudius Ptolemy, where it was called Edri Deserta or in Greek Edrou Heremos (Εδρου ἐρῆμος, Edar's isolated place). Here it was portrayed as an island, but it is not clear if this was due to actual separation from the headland or inaccurate information available to the cartographer. Other writers think that Edrou was actually Lambay Island, from Greek ἑδρα (hedra) \\"sitting place [for ships]\\".http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf The peninsula has been occupied since at least the 3rd millennium B.C.E., with two middens found, and a dolmen dating back to around 2200 B.C.E. It features in a range of Irish legends. A fishing settlement developed at Howth, and the area developed under the Norman St. Lawrence family, who owned most of Howth Head from the late 1100s until 2019. In the 19th century, an electric tramline made the whole hill more accessible. Location and topography Originally an island,Article from Dublin City Council (Dublin.ie) Howth Head is connected to the mainland via a narrow strip of land, or tombolo, and forms the northerly bound of the great crescent of Dublin Bay, roughly corresponding to Dalkey Hill and Killiney Hill in the south. Most of the headland is hilly, with peaks such as the 171 m Black Linn, by the Ben of Howth, on a side road beyond the Green Hill Quarries at the Loughereen Hills, Shielmartin Hill (163 m) overlooking Carrickbrack Road and Carrickbrack and Dun Hill. There are also craggy areas such as Muck Rock (Carrickmore), and Kilrock. Howth has an extensive and varied coastline, and there are steep sea cliffs around parts, especially on the north coast. Key points on the coast, clockwise from Sutton, include Cush Point, Claremont Strand, the small headland at Howth village, Balscadden Bay, Kilrock, the Great and Little Baily, Lion's Head, Doldrum Bay, the Needles, Drumleck Point, Red Rock and Sutton Strand. Due to the shape of the landform, and its rocky nature, with thin soil covering, Howth features multiple streams, several fast-running streams, due to hard rock under a thin soil layer. These include the Bloody StreamCoulcour Brook, the Boggeen Stream, and the Offington Stream, and the Whitewater Brook, the Balsaggart Stream, and the Carrickbrack and Santa Sabina Streams.Dublin: 2013, Doyle, J.W., \\"Ten Dozen Waters: The Rivers of County Dublin\\" - 8th edition Fauna and flora The cliffs support a large colony of seabirds, notably razorbills, common guillemots, fulmars, kittiwakes and cormorants. The scrubland above supports several heathland species including skylarks, meadow pipits, whitethroats, linnets, stonechats and whinchats. The most commonly seen birds of prey are kestrels, peregrine falcons and common buzzards. Gorse grows in many places on the headland. Fires are frequent during dry summers. Transport There are two railway stations on or near the head. Sutton station is on the northern edge of the tombolo between Sutton and Baldoyle, and Howth station is on the head in the village of Howth. Both are served by Dublin Area Rapid Transit trains and have regular services to and from Dublin city centre. Historically the Hill of Howth Tramway ran between the stations around the head between 1901 and 1959. Additionally Dublin Bus routes serve the headland. A full road network accesses most parts, although some are only reachable by some of the many footpaths.

Popular culture Howth Head is the location where Leopold Bloom proposes to Molly in James Joyce's Ulysses. In the short story Eveline, another work of James Joyce's from the collection, \\"Dubliners,\\" it is mentioned that Eveline and her family once had a picnic on the Hill of Howth. Howth Head is also central to Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake, in which one of the principal characters, HCE, is, among other things, representative of the mountain. Howth Head is mentioned in the lyrics of the title track of Kate Bush's 1989 album, The Sensual World: '...took six big wheels and rolled our bodies / off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes...'. The song is inspired by Molly Bloom's soliloquy in Joyce's Ulysses.

North Brother Island was once the site of a hospital, but is now uninhabited and designated as a bird sanctuary. It had long been privately owned, but it was purchased by the city in 2007. According to the New York City Parks Department, which oversees the islands, North Brother Island has about of land,Staff (November 21, 2001) \\"Daily Plant: Over 2001 Acres Gained by October 2001\\" New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and South Brother Island about .Staff (November 29, 2007) \\"The Daily Plant: South Brother Island Goes To The Birds\\" New York City Department of Parks and Recreation History Bodies from the General Slocum wash ashore on North Brother Island, 1904 Both North Brother Island and South Brother Island were claimed by the Dutch West India Company in 1614 and were originally named \\"De Gesellen\\", translated as \\"the companions\\" in English. The islands were both originally part of Queens County. On June 8, 1881, North Brother Island was transferred to what was then part of New York County (later to become the Bronx). On April 16, 1964, South Brother Island was also transferred to the Bronx. The islands had been incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, before the consolidation of New York City in 1898. =North Brother Island= The northern of the islands was uninhabited until 1885, when Riverside Hospital moved there from Blackwell's Island (now known as Roosevelt Island). Riverside Hospital was founded in the 1850s as the Smallpox Hospital to treat and isolate victims of that disease. Its mission eventually expanded to other quarantinable diseases. The last such facility to be established on the island was the Tuberculosis Pavilion, which opened in 1943. The Pavilion was rendered obsolete within the decade due to the increasing availability, acceptance, and use of the tuberculosis vaccine after 1945. The island was the site of the wreck of the General Slocum, a steamship that burned on June 15, 1904. Over 1,000 people died either from the fire on board the ship, or from drowning before the ship beached on the island's shores. According to Joseph Mitchell, a reporter for newspapers and for The New Yorker, the island was the site of many outings of \\"The Honorable John McSorley Pickle, Beefsteak, Baseball Nine, and Chowder Club\\" organized by John McSorley of McSorley's Old Ale House; photos of the outings are featured on the walls of the bar.Mitchell, Joseph (2015) Up in the Old Hotel and other stories (Kindle Edition) New York: Vintage. p.6. Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary, was confined to the island for over two decades until she died there in 1938. The hospital closed shortly thereafter. Following World War II, the island housed war veterans who were students at local colleges and their families. After the nationwide housing shortage abated, the island was again abandoned until the 1950s, when a center opened to treat adolescent drug addicts. The facility claimed it was the first to offer treatment, rehabilitation, and education facilities to young drug offenders. Heroin addicts were confined to this facility and locked in a room until they were clean. Many of them believed they were being held against their will. Staff corruption and cost forced the facility to close in 1963. The facility is said to have been the inspiration for the Broadway play Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?, which helped to launch the career of Al Pacino. Since the mid-1960s, New York City mayors have considered a variety of uses for the island. John Lindsay, for instance, proposed to sell it, and Ed Koch thought it could be converted into housing for the homeless. The city also considered using it as an extension of the jail at Rikers Island. Now serving as a sanctuary for herons and other wading shorebirds, the island is presently abandoned and off-limits to the public. Most of the original hospitals' buildings still stand, but are heavily deteriorated and in danger of collapse, and a dense forest conceals the ruined hospital buildings. In October 2014, New York City Council member Mark Levine, Chair of the City Council's Parks Committee, led a delegation to visit the island, and declared his desire afterward to open the island for limited \\"light-touch, environmentally sensitive\\" public access. In October 2016, New York magazine reported that the council had commissioned a study from the University of Pennsylvania's School of Design, followed by a public hearing, on how the island could be converted into a park with controlled access by the public. =South Brother Island= In the mid-19th century, Alfred W. White, who was in charge of public health for the city, used South Brother Island as the city's first dump, where garbage, manure, offal and carcasses were sent to help clean up the city, which consisted at that time of only Manhattan and its islands. However, the island is only about a half-mile from the Bronx and the country estates of the city's rich, such as William Ligett and Jacob Lorillard, both scions of tobacco families. It was also close enough to the shoreline villages of Queens County to be noxious to them as well, and the combination of Queens villages and wealthy Bronxites convinced the Queens County Supreme Court to stop the dumping. Jacob Ruppert, a brewery magnate and early owner of the New York Yankees, had a summer house on the island that burned down in 1909. No one has lived on the island since then, and there are no structures extant. Ruppert owned the island until the late 1930s, and in 1944 it was purchased by John Gerosa, president of the Metropolitan Roofing Supply Company, who had wanted to construct a never-built summer retreat for his workers on the island. A snowy egret displaying plumage. This species is one of the inhabitants of South Brother Island. In 1975, the City sold South Brother Island to Hampton Scows Inc., a Long Island investment company, for $10. Hampton Scows paid property taxes every year but did not develop the island. In November 2007, the island was purchased in a complicated transaction in which $2 million of Federal grant money from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program was allocated to the Wildlife Conservation Society and The POINT Community Development Corporation. The Trust for Public Land then acquired the island on behalf of those organizations, and then donated it to the city's Parks Department as a wildlife sanctuary. It is managed by the city's Parks Department and the Bronx Zoo. South Brother Island was the 13th island to come under the Parks Department's jurisdiction. Wildlife North Brother Island is a designated wildlife sanctuary. From the 1980s through the early 2000s, North Brother Island supported one of the area's largest nesting colonies of black-crowned night heron. However, as of 2008 this species has abandoned the island for unknown reasons. Barn swallows use the abandoned structures for nesting, and can be seen flying over the island. On South Brother Island, dense brush supports a major nesting colony of several species of birds, notably black- crowned night heron, great egret, snowy egret, and double-crested cormorant. New York City Audubon has monitored nesting colonies on the island for over twenty years. In popular culture In June 2009, North Brother Island was featured in episode 8 (\\"Armed and Defenseless\\") of Life After People on the History Channel. It was used as an example of what would happen to structures after 45 years without humans. It was featured in the Broad City episode \\"Working Girls\\" and was mentioned in the episode \\"Twaining Day\\", It was also featured in the Unforgettable episode \\"The Island\\". It is also a location inhabited by women and children in Victor LaValle's 2017 novel, The Changeling.

It began as a small settlement on the property of Harry Theophilus Toulmin, who served as Sheriff of Mobile County in the 1830s. During the American Civil War, Toulminville was mapped along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad as a significant settlement, northwest of Mobile (see map). In 1945, the remainder of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile. The area of Toulminville has varied over the past decades from being an upper-middle class suburb to having a serious crime problem during most of the 1980s and 1990s, although the trend has been reversed in recent years. Annexation by Mobile Toulminville remained a largely rural settlement until after the Civil War, when it slowly took on the character of a suburb to Mobile. It remained largely exurban in character until the 20th century, when growth within the city of Mobile spilled over into Toulminville. Part of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile in the 1920s, and the whole of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile in 1945, in the annexation which tripled the size of Mobile's corporate limits. By World War II, Toulminville had become an upper-middle class suburb, with many affluent neighborhoods built along Stanton and Summerville streets. Professional baseball player Hank Aaron grew up in Toulminville as a young boy. White flight Suburbanization started after World War II, as highways were built and new houses were built outside the city. Middle and upper-class whites began to move out of the city to newer housing, especially after desegregation following civil rights advances of the 1960s. A perceived upsurge of crime on Mobile's north side contributed to this white migration. (In 1966 a white nun was raped by a black man in a notorious incident at Catholic Cemetery on Stone Street, now Martin Luther King Avenue.) The district was majority white in 1960 and became nearly 80% black by 1975. Toulminville was the heart of the district that elected John LeFlore to the Mobile County Commission; he was a Mobile NAACP leader and the first African American elected to the county commission. Upper-class neighborhoods along Stanton and Summerville streets retained their white population for some time. In the 1980s they became majority black and retained high property values. While Stanton and Summerville are middle-class areas, most of Toulminville is lower-class. During most of the 1980s and 1990s with its economic and drug problems, this area had a serious crime problem. That trend has reversed due to a concerted effort by the Mobile Police Department and community leaders in Toulminville. Toulminville was the birthplace of United States Surgeon General William Crawford Gorgas, who worked to control yellow fever and malaria during World War I. Several streets and an elementary school were named after him. Figures Park, named for Senator Michael Figures, an influential African- American politician of the 20th century, was originally named Gorgas Park, in honor of the general. This neighborhood was the adolescent home of baseball legend Hank Aaron. Education Toulminville is within the Mobile County Public School System. Washington Middle School is in Toulminville. LeFlore Magnet High School (originally Toulminville High School) is a performing arts magnet school named in honor of John L. LeFlore. Toulminville High School was renamed LeFlore High School in honor of LeFlore. In the 1980s, it was converted into a magnet school, which under Mobile County Public School policy to increase diversity, is ideally to have a 50/50 black white mix. The county is majority white and the school has a 75/25 black-white mix.

He was one of the principal followers of Heinrich Schenker, and did much to refine and explain Schenkerian analysis after Schenker's death. He was born in Vienna to Max Salzer (a doctor) and Helene Wittgenstein (a daughter of Karl Wittgenstein). He studied musicology with Guido Adler at the University of Vienna, finishing his Ph.D. in 1926 with a dissertation on sonata form in the works of Franz Schubert. At the same time he studied music theory and analysis with Heinrich Schenker and Hans Weisse. In 1939 Salzer emigrated to the United States, and became a citizen in 1945. While in the US he taught at several schools, including the Mannes College of Music, and Queens College of the City University of New York. His contributions to Schenkerian theory were twofold: first, he brought Schenker's ideas to the attention of American music theorists and musicologists, and second, he applied the analytical technique to music outside of the common- practice era music in which Schenker had exclusively worked, particularly to the music of the Renaissance, the Middle Ages, and to some music of the 20th century. Later theorists applied Schenkerian techniques to popular music as well. Some of the specific refinements Salzer made to Schenkerian theory involve aspects of voice leading, and the differentiation of chords into structural versus contrapuntal categories. Salzer's works include Structural Hearing (1952 and 1962), Counterpoint in Composition: The Study of Voice Leading (with Carl Schachter, 1969), and the periodical The Music Forum (initiated 1967). Salzer married Hedwig Lindtberg (the sister of Leopold Lindtberg) in 1939. She died on February 29, 2000. They had no children.

A breadbox (chiefly American) or a bread bin (chiefly British) is a container for storing bread and other baked goods to keep them fresh. They were a more common household kitchen item until bread started being made commercially with food preservatives and wrapped in plastic. Breadboxes are still used by many people to store commercially purchased bread, but are used more especially by people who bake bread at home. Newer ones are usually made of metal. In the past they were often made of wood or sometimes pottery (pottery breadboxes are also called bread crocks). Old breadboxes can be collectible antiques. Breadboxes are most commonly big enough to fit one or two average size loaves of bread—up to about 16 inches wide by 8 to 9 inches high and deep (40 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm). Working theory Stale bread is colloquially called \\"dry\\", but drying and staling are distinct processes. Stale bread can weigh the same as \\"fresh\\" bread, indicating almost no loss of water; conversely, bread can be dried out without going stale. Staling is a process of retrogradation, in which the starch transposes to a crystalline form in the presence of the water contained within the bread itself. The process speeds up at cooler temperatures,Cereals in breadmaking: a molecular colloidal approach, Ann-Charlotte Eliasson, Kåre Larsson, CRC Press, 1993, pages: 128-129, , such as under refrigeration, and thus bread stored at room temperature remains fresher for longer periods than refrigerated bread. Frozen bread, however, traps the moisture as ice, and prevents the staling process.Freeze, Don’t Refrigerate Your Bread Heat Keeper Common. August 2007 Breadboxes are thus designed to: *keep their contents at room temperature, prolonging edible storage time; *have a lid loose enough to allow airflow, reducing condensation, which helps to prevent the formation of mold; *have a lid tight enough to slow the drying process as well as to protect the contents from mice and all other pests, including ants and flies.

Versions were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear, and MS-DOS. Versions were also planned for the Sega CD and Master System, but ultimately were not released. A separate version was released on the Amiga and was developed by The Dome. The MS-DOS version was developed by Psygnosis and offers full motion video cut scenes from the film; the never- released Sega CD version was planned to include this feature as well. Gameplay An overhead driving sequence from the MS-DOS version Last Action Hero is based on the film of the same name. Taking the form of a side- scrolling beat-'em-up, in the SNES and Genesis version players have a strict time limit to defeat each level of the game. Every version of the game has the climactic showdown with Mr. Benedict (the movie's primary villain), except for the NES, Game Boy, and Game Gear versions. There are two car chase stages: one in Jack Slater's \\"movie\\" world and another in Danny Madigan's \\"real\\" world. The NES and Amiga versions however do not feature any car levels. The NES version has an original element that none of the other versions have: a stage that portrays Danny Madigan's \\"version\\" of the classic Shakespeare play Hamlet.Last Action Hero at Hardcore Gaming 101 Development and release Last Action Hero was released for seven platforms: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear, Amiga and MS-DOS. None of the versions feature guns or any other weapons. Most of these games were developed by Bits Studios, while the Amiga version was developed by The Dome. Sony Imagesoft published the game across most platforms, and Sony's Psygnosis published the Amiga version. Rich Robinson, executive producer at Sony Imagesoft, oversaw the filming of Last Action Hero as well as the development of the game adaptation, to ensure consistency between the two. Sony's Columbia Pictures, which produced the film, had an interest in the game throughout its development. Initially, the studio provided the various developers with a script for the film to help form the basis of the game. Columbia also provided stills from the film which helped the game artists. Later, the developers of the Amiga version saw some rough cuts of the film and then made small alterations to their game to keep it faithful to the film. Versions of the game were planned for the Sega CD and Master System, but these ultimately were not released. The Sega CD version was in development by a team of 11 people, led by producer Steve Riding of Psygnosis. The Sega CD version was to include motion video footage from the film. However, because of limited film footage, the team had to create some of their own footage for the CD version, using Silicon Graphics computers. Regarding the lack of weapons in the game, Riding stated that the film's star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, \\"feels that if children are constantly subjected to these violent images on the screen, they will identify with the violence and project it through to their real lives.\\" According to Riding, the lack of weapons did not present any major challenges in creating the game. Development of the Amiga version commenced in July 1993, at which point the Sega CD version was already three months into development. The Sega CD version would be a slightly upgraded version of the Amiga game. As with the other versions of the game, the Amiga developers were restricted from depicting the playable character with any offensive weapons, and therefore chose to make it a beat 'em up game. Tony Parkes, the game's producer, said the team used \\"the comic element that was present throughout the film\\" and made the entire game \\"very cartoony in a 'Tom and Jerry' kind of way.\\" The film's character of Danny Madigan was excluded as a playable character in the games because Columbia felt that a child in a beat 'em up game would not go over well. The Amiga version was to include a multiplayer option in which a second player could play as Jack Slater's daughter Whitney or as an animated cat police officer, both of whom appeared in the film. In the United States, the Genesis and SNES versions were released on January 26, 1994, coinciding with the home video release of the film. Each copy of the Genesis and SNES versions had an unusually high wholesale price of $60-$70, with a resulting $100 retail price, which was too high for most consumers. As a result, the two game versions were originally only available as rentals for a minimum seven-month period. After the seven-month rental period was up, the two game versions would be repriced for consumer retail. The Amiga version, released in 1994, is compatible with Amiga 500, Amiga 600, and Amiga 1200 computers. Reception Last Action Hero received negative reviews. Amiga Action called the Amiga version \\"utter trash\\" and wrote about the beat 'em up gameplay, \\"It's been done a million times before and each one of those million has been better executed than this.\\" Stephen Bradley of Amiga Format criticized the game and the large number of enemy respawns. The One Amiga criticized the repetitive gameplay and background scenery, and called it \\"without a shadow of a doubt, the worst game ever.\\" The magazine also considered the gameplay simplistic, writing that enemies could be \\"easily dispatched by simply sidling up to them and holding down the fire button,\\" sending the player into a \\"punch-frenzy\\". Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power had the same complaints about repetitive scenery and the use of the fire button to easily dispatch enemies. Campbell wrote that Psygnosis and The Dome \\"should be utterly ashamed of themselves\\" for their involvement in the game. Game Players called the SNES version a \\"dull, lifeless, and frustration-filled\\" fighting game. The magazine was also critical of the Game Gear version, writing that it lacked action and would likely only appeal to fans of puzzle video games. In later reviews for the website AllGame, Brett Alan Weiss heavily criticized the Genesis and SNES versions, believing they were rushed through development in order to capitalize on the film.

With his mother, Florence Greenwell, the daughter of a miner, he soon moved to Leeds. With four children, she struggled and he was fostered at a few months old. His childhood was spent in a succession of orphanages. Thompson took up rugby league when working near Hunslet. In 1951, the Rugby commentator, Eddie Waring wrote: “If Cec Thompson is not chosen for the Great Britain squad to face New Zealand, the selectors must be racists”. Four years after his potential was spotted by a Hunslet scout, he played for Great Britain in 1951, only the second black player to do so (the first was Roy Fisher). However, his debut in the game with New Zealand was headlined in the Daily Herald as \\"Hunslet's Darkie one of Britain's heroes.\\" In 1953, he transferred to Workington Town in Cumbria.

Nicknamed Chirola, Yazalde scored 46 goals in one single season with Sporting CP, being awarded that season's European Golden Shoe. Club career Born in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires Province, Yazalde's beginnings in football were hazardous: he was visiting a friend who played with Club Atlético Piraña, an amateur club in the Argentine capital. He asked to join the training session, immediately causing a stirring impression and signing the very day; from there, he moved to Club Atlético Independiente, going on to help the team win two Primera División championships. In the 1971–72 season, Yazalde signed with Sporting CP, helping the Lisbon side to the 1974 Primeira Liga by scoring 46 goals in just 29 matches, both a domestic and European record, and the 1973 and 1974 Portuguese Cups. The following campaign, with the Lions finishing third, he netted 30, league's best and Europe's second. As a prize for the European Golden Shoe, Yazalde received a Toyota car which he sold, then sharing the money with his teammates. After his Portuguese spell, he successively represented Olympique de Marseille, Newell's Old Boys and Club Atlético Huracán, retiring in 1981 and becoming a player's agent in his country. International career Yazalde earned ten caps for Argentina, appearing at the 1974 FIFA World Cup where he scored twice in three matches (both against Haiti, 4–1 win). Personal life Yazalde married Portuguese model/actress Maria do Carmo de Deus (nicknamed Carmizé) on 16 July 1973. In addition to modeling, Carmen (as he referred to her in Spanish, which stuck) had a brief career in acting in European cult films under the name Britt Nichols, however she's rarely spoken about this stage of her life since marrying Yazalde. Carmen came with him to Argentina to settle down, but the couple separated 14 years later, though they never got legally divorced. They had one son, Gonzalo. After Héctor's death, Carmen has remained an occasional fixture in Argentine television and tabloid news. Death Yazalde died in Buenos Aires on 18 June 1997, from hemorrhage and heart failure.

Not as popular as its predecessor, the series aired for a single 24-episode season and was cancelled by CBS. Synopsis The Golden Palace begins where The Golden Girls had ended, in the quartet's now-sold Miami house. With Dorothy Zbornak having married and left in the previous series finale, the three remaining roommates (Sophia Petrillo, Rose Nylund, and Blanche Devereaux) decide to invest in a Miami hotel that is up for sale. The hotel, however, is revealed to have been stripped of all of its personnel in an effort to appear more profitable, leaving only two employees: Roland Wilson, the hotel's manager, and Chuy Castillos, the hotel's chef. This requires the women to perform all the tasks of the hotel's staff. The series focused on the interactions between guests at the hotel and the hotel's staff, as well as between the women and the previous hotel staff. Guest stars were frequent, including recurring characters that had previously appeared on The Golden Girls, such as Debra Engle and Harold Gould as Rebecca Devereaux and Miles Webber, and other celebrities. Bea Arthur also reprised her Dorothy Zbornak role for a two-part storyline in which she visits the hotel to check up on her mother. Following the cancellation of the series, Sophia returns to the rebuilt Shady Pines retirement home (which had burned down in the previous series), appearing as a cast member in the later seasons of Empty Nest. What became of Rose, Blanche, and the hotel is left unresolved. Broadcast history and reception The Golden Palace aired on CBS, changing networks from NBC, which had aired The Golden Girls on Saturday nights for its entire run. Susan Harris, Paul Junger Witt, and Tony Thomas all pitched their Golden Girls successor series to NBC in early 1992, as a way to continue the saga of Blanche, Rose, and Sophia after Bea Arthur's departure from the role of Dorothy. NBC entertainment chief Warren Littlefield originally committed to airing The Golden Palace, with a 13-episode order for the 1992–93 season. However, CBS soon entered the picture and fueled a bidding war for the new series, offering a full season (24 episode) order. Witt, Thomas, and Harris tried to get Littlefield to improve his NBC deal, but he refused to extend his episode order, citing that the declining ratings of The Golden Girls in its seventh season made it risky to give the spin-off a longer commitment. The producers thus went with CBS, which agreed to market The Golden Palace as a show with its own voice separate from that of its parent show. CBS used The Golden Palace as one of four comedies assembled on Friday night in an effort to combat ABC's TGIF comedy block; The Golden Palace was grouped with Major Dad, Designing Women, and Bob, all of which were either successful comedies prior to the move, or in the case of Bob, featured a previously successful sitcom star (Bob Newhart). The premiere garnered solid ratings, and the show won its timeslot for its first few weeks, but viewership fell steadily for the entire block as the season progressed. CBS had scheduled the show for a second season, but cancelled the show (and the entire block) the night before they announced their 1993 fall schedule. The only one of the four aforementioned shows to get picked up for the 1993–94 season was Bob, which hired Betty White to join its revamped cast. Twenty-four episodes of The Golden Palace were produced. The Carlyle hotel in 2017 British comedian Alexei Sayle was originally hired for the series in the role of the hotel's chef, who initially was to be portrayed as Eastern European. Sayle was replaced by Cheech Marin before the pilot was shot. The idea of having a Latino chef as a comic foil to the rest of the cast had originally been proposed at the beginning of The Golden Girls; the original chef, Coco (portrayed by Charles Levin), appeared in the first episode of The Golden Girls but was written out due to concerns about how to work him into later scripts with a cast of four women with strong personalities. With Arthur gone and the core group down to three, the concept was revived. The Carlyle hotel on Miami Beach's Ocean Drive was used for exterior shots depicting the Golden Palace hotel, while the rest of the series was taped at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California. Syndication of the series is handled by Disney–ABC Domestic Television. Although the series has never been syndicated as a stand-alone series, Lifetime, during the time it owned the rights to The Golden Girls, carried The Golden Palace on several occasions, running the series in rotation as a de facto eighth season of The Golden Girls. (The current rights holders to The Golden Girls have, to date, have not picked up The Golden Palace.) Ratings Cast * Betty White as Rose Nylund is a jack-of-all-trades in the hotel. This series has Rose being of a notably stronger will than her previous incarnation (as Dorothy Zbornak noted in her guest appearance, \\"When did she become the strong one?\\"). * Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux served as the main operator of the hotel. Her character traits, particularly her promiscuity and vanity, are significantly toned down in this series, although she retains her Southern charm and generally chipper demeanor. * Estelle Getty as Sophia Petrillo is the hotel's 87-year-old co-chef. In this series, her character is beginning to show signs of senile dementia, and is somewhat kinder and gentler than in the original series. (In real life, other members of the cast had noticed Getty's increased difficulty in remembering lines and relying on cue cards during this series and toward the end of the previous one; she would not be formally diagnosed with dementia until 2000.) * Don Cheadle as Roland Wilson is the hotel's manager and a straight man to the rest of the cast. He is one of only two staff members retained from the previous ownership. * Cheech Marin as Chuy Castillos, is the other co-chef, and the other staff member held on from the previous ownership. He nearly quits after getting into a fight with Sophia over Italian vs. Mexican food, but comes back and remains with the staff for the rest of the series run. * Billy L. Sullivan as Oliver Webb is Roland's foster child for episodes one to six and fourteen. A streetwise, arrogant preteen, Oliver was written out of the series fairly early on, with the character's birth mother (Joely Fisher) retaking custody of him in episode 14.

Often considered as the \\"The Prince of Sinhala Pop\\", Malewana is well known for being a master of contemporary Baila worked with popular musical bands The Moonstones and Super Golden Chimes. Personal life Malewana was born on 13 June in Ratnapura and attended St. Joseph's College, Colombo. He is married to Swarnamali and the couple has one son and one daughter. Musical career Upon leaving school, he met Clarence Wijewardena, and the two formed the group Moonstones in 1966. In the early 1960s, the Moonstones began performing songs composed by Wijewardena and sung by Malewana. Their first hit was Mango Nanda, a song written about the maid who once worked at the home of Clarence's wife in the early days of their relationship. The Moonstones were managed by the advertising man Sri Sangabo Corea and were mentored by the Radio Ceylon broadcaster Vernon Corea and his cousin Vijaya Corea. They first featured on a program called \\"Saturday Star\\" on Radio Ceylon. Their music was featured for the very first time on the English Services of Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. They became household names as a result of the airplay on Radio Ceylon throughout the 1960s. After few years, Wijewardena formed \\"Golden Chimes\\" and left \\"The Moonstones\\". However, later all reunited again and formed the band \\"Super Golden Chimes\\". The band produced many popular songs such as Udarata Niliya and Gamen liyumak. During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the songs of the 'Moonstones' and the 'Super Golden Chimes' were on the top of popularity. His songs topped the charts on both the English Service and the Sinhala Service on Radio Ceylon for decades. In 1977, he got a job at a Private company and temporarily left the band. Malewana and Wijewardena remained friends and reunited in the 1970s to form a group dubbed the Super Golden Chimes - this group would, similarly, produce a string of popular songs that included Udarata Niliya, Sihina Pathum, Wana Bambaro, and Sathuta Senasuma. The Super Golden Chimes performed for another eight years until, in 1978, Malewana married, and announced his retirement from music. Despite his retirement, Malewana returned in 1988 as a solo artist, and continued to record songs particularly for CDs released in Sri Lanka. In 2005 he formed the band Annesley & The Super Chimes. His song Kageda Gon Wassa was censored between 1970-1977 by the prevailed government because people started hinting at the government with this song. In 1984, he made playback singing with the film Shirani directed by M. H. Gafoor. Sri Lankan music Superstar, Annesley Malewana, at the Edirimanne Corea Family Union Sing- A-Long charity event held in the Grand Ballroom of the Galadari Hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka in November 2011. In 27 July 2013, he organized a musical show \\"Sing Along with Annesley Malewana\\" at Hotel Taj Samudra Rooftop as a fundraiser for Lion Sight First Hospital. On 6 August 2016, Malewana celebrated 50 years of his singing career with a grand musical show titled ‘50 Year Reflection’ which was held at the BMICH at 7pm. Controversy In 2009, Wijewardena's wife and daughter filed a case against Malewana by citing that Clarence's songs were sung without permission. They said some of the songs such as Kalu Mama, Goyam Kapanawa, Rosa Male and Sudu Menike were first claimed to be theirs. Then they made a list of about 27 songs and told Malewana that he had no right to sing them. But those songs have been sold to Wickramasooriya and company. In the same contracts that were sold Malewana have signed for \\"Moonstone\\" and \\"Super Golden Chimes\\". The summons in this case was handed over on December 23, 2010. An enjoining order had been imposed so that not a single song could be sung. However, his innocence has been proved justified in court. Legacy The songs performed by Malewana and Clarence over their three decades have recently been credited, by the group Pahan Silu, as having served to influence them in crafting their unique musical style. His voice has been heard by Londoners over BBC Radio London 206 on the London Sounds Eastern radio program and on community radio in the United States and in Australia.

The tissue is skin from a patient with Pemphigus vulgaris. Note the intercellular IgG deposits in the epidermis and the early intraepidermal vesicle caused by acantholysis. Pemphigus ( or ) is a rare group of blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes. The name is derived from the Greek root \\"pemphix\\", meaning \\"pustule\\". In pemphigus, autoantibodies form against desmoglein. Desmoglein forms the \\"glue\\" that attaches adjacent epidermal cells via attachment points called desmosomes. When autoantibodies attack desmogleins, the cells become separated from each other and the epidermis becomes detached, a phenomenon called acantholysis. This causes blisters that slough off and turn into sores. In some cases, these blisters can cover a significant area of the skin.International Pemphigus & Pemphigoid Foundation: What is Pemphigus? Originally, the cause of this disease was unknown, and \\"pemphigus\\" was used to refer to any blistering disease of the skin and mucosa. In 1964, researchers found that the blood of patients with pemphigus contained antibodies to the layers of skin that separate to form the blisters. In 1971, an article investigating the autoimmune nature of this disease was published. Types There are several types of pemphigus which vary in severity: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. Skin lesions caused by pemphigus can lead to fatal infections, so treatment is extremely important. *Pemphigus vulgaris (PV - ICD-10 L10.0) is the most common form of the disorder and occurs when antibodies attack Desmoglein 3. Sores often originate in the mouth, making eating difficult and uncomfortable. Although pemphigus vulgaris may occur at any age, it is most common among people between the ages of 40 and 60. It is more frequent among Ashkenazi Jews. Rarely, it is associated with myasthenia gravis. Nail disease may be the only finding and has prognostic value in management. Abreu-Velez AM, Calle-Isaza J, Howard MS. Autoimmune epidermal blistering diseases. Our Dermatol Online. 2013;4(Suppl.3):631-646 * Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is the least severe of the three varieties. Desmoglein 1, the protein that is targeted by the autoantibody, is enriched in the upper skin layers. PF is characterized by crusty sores that often begin on the scalp, and may move to the chest, back, and face. Mouth sores do not occur. This form is also frequent among Ashkenazi Jews. It is not as painful as pemphigus vulgaris, and is often mis-diagnosed as dermatitis or eczema Abreu Velez AM, Calle-Isaza J, Howard MS. Autoimmune epidermal blistering diseases. Our Dermatol Online. 2013;4(Suppl.3):631-646. DOI: 10.7241/ourd.20134.158 *Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis is characterized histologically by intraepidermal bullae with neutrophils, some eosinophils, and acantholysis.Abreu Velez AM, Calle-Isaza J, Howard MS. Autoimmune epidermal blistering diseases. Our Dermatol Online. 2013; 4(Suppl.3): 631-646. DOI: 10.7241/ourd.20134.158 * The least common and most severe type of pemphigus is paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). This disorder is a complication of cancer, usually lymphoma and Castleman's disease. It may precede the diagnosis of the tumor. Painful sores appear on the mouth, lips, and the esophagus. In this variety of pemphigus, the disease process often involves the lungs, causing bronchiolitis obliterans (constrictive bronchiolitis). Though much less frequent, it is still found the most in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Complete removal of and/or cure of the tumor may improve the skin disease, but lung damage is generally irreversible. *Endemic pemphigus foliaceus, including the Fogo Selvagem, the new variant of endemic pemphigus folaiceus in El Bagre, Colombia, South America, and the Tunisian endemic pemphigus in North Africa.1. Abréu Vélez AM, Hashimoto T, Tobón S, Londoño ML, Montoya F, Bollag, WB, Beutner, E., is a unique form of endemic pemphigus in Northern Colombia. J Am Acad Dermatol. Oct(49),4:609-614,2003 Hailey-Hailey disease, also called familial benign pemphigus, is an inherited skin disease, not an autoimmune disease. It is therefore not considered part of the Pemphigus group of diseases. Diagnosis Pemphigus defines a group of autoimmune interepithelial blistering diseases that are characterized by loss of normal cell-cell adhesion (acantholysis), and by the presence of pathogenic (predominantly IgG) autoantibodies reacting against epithelial adhesion molecules.16. Abreu Velez AM, Calle-Isaza J, Howard MS. Autoimmune epidermal blistering diseases. Our Dermatol Online. 2013; 4(Suppl.3): 631-646. DOI: 10.7241/ourd.20134.158 Pemphigus is further divided in two major subtypes: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). However, several other disorders such as IgA pemphigus, IgE pemphigus, pemphigus herpetiformis, drug induced pemphigus, Senear Usher syndrome and endemic pemphigus foliaceus exist; recognized by a dermatologist from the appearance and distribution of the skin lesions. It is also commonly diagnosed by specialists practicing otolaryngology- head and neck surgery, periodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons and eye doctors, as lesions can affect the eyes and mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Intraorally it resembles the more common diseases lichen planus and mucous membrane pemphigoid.also here Definitive diagnosis requires examination of a skin or mucous membrane biopsy by a dermatopathologist or oral pathologist. The skin biopsy is taken from the edge of a blister, prepared for histopathology and examined with a microscope. The pathologist looks for an intraepidermal vesicle caused by the breaking apart of epidermal cells (acantholysis). Thus, the superficial (upper) portion of the epidermis sloughs off, leaving the bottom layer of cells on the \\"floor\\" of the blister. This bottom layer of cells is said to have a \\"tombstone appearance.\\" Definitive diagnosis also requires the demonstration of anti-desmoglein autoantibodies by direct immunofluorescence on the skin biopsy. These antibodies appear as IgG deposits along the desmosomes between epidermal cells, a pattern reminiscent of chicken wire. Anti-desmoglein antibodies can also be detected in a blood sample using the ELISA technique. = Classification = Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that may be classified into the following types: :* Pemphigus vulgaris :* Pemphigus vegetans :*Pemphigus vegetans of Hallopeau :*Pemphigus vegetans of Neumann :* Pemphigus foliaceus, of which there several forms: :* Pemphigus erythematosus or Senear–Usher Syndrome :* Endemic pemphigus foliaceus with its three variants, Fogo Selvagem, the new variant endemic pemphigus Foliaeus and Tunisian endemic pemphigus foliaceus :* Paraneoplastic pemphigus :* IgA pemphigus, of which there several forms: :* Subcorneal pustular dermatosis :* Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis :*Drug induced pemphigus Treatment If not treated, pemphigus can be fatal, usually from overwhelming opportunistic infection of lesions. The most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids, especially prednisone, often in high doses. The side effects of corticosteroids may require the use of so-called steroid-sparing or adjuvant drugs. One of the most dangerous side effects of high-dosage steroid treatments is intestinal perforations, which may lead to sepsis. Steroids and other medications being taken to treat pemphigus may also mask the effects of the perforations. Patients on high dosages of oral steroids should closely monitor their gastrointestinal health. As lesions are usually terribly painful, it is likely that pain medication can complicate and exacerbate the gastrointestinal issues caused by steroids. = Treatment options = * topical steroids, such as clobetasol * intralesional injection of steroids, such as dexamethasone * immunosuppressant drugs, such as CellCept (mycophenolic acid)In recent years, adjuvant drugs, especially biologics, have shown great promise. British Association of Dermtologists, Steroid sparing (or adjuvant) drugs * serum or plasma pooled products, like Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) may be useful in severe cases, especially paraneoplastic pemphigus * biologics such as Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, which was found to improve otherwise severe cases of recalcitrant Pemphigus vulgaris. All of these drugs may cause severe side effects, so the patient should be closely monitored by doctors. Once the outbreaks are under control, dosage is often reduced, to lessen side effects. A meta-analysis of the literature found insufficient evidence to determine the optimal treatment regimen for treating pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. However, it found that adding cyclophosphamid and azathioprine to a glucocorticoid regimen reduced the amount of glucocorticoid needed to treat, and topical epidermal growth factor significantly reduced lesion healing time. If skin lesions do become infected, antibiotics may be prescribed. Tetracycline antibiotics have a mildly beneficial effect on the disease and are sometimes enough for Pemphigus Foliaceus. In addition, talcum powder is helpful to prevent oozing sores from adhering to bedsheets and clothes. Wound care and treatment is often akin to that used in burn units, including careful use of dressings that don't stick to the wounds, etc. If paraneoplastic pemphigus is diagnosed with pulmonary disease, a powerful cocktail of immune suppressant drugs is sometimes used in an attempt to halt the rapid progression of bronchiolitis obliterans, including methylprednisolone, ciclosporin, azathioprine, and thalidomide. Plasmapheresis may also be useful. Animals affected Pemphigus foliaceus skin eruption on the abdomen of a dog Pemphigus foliaceus has been recognized in pet dogs, cats, and horses and is the most common autoimmune skin disease diagnosed in veterinary medicine. Pemphigus foliaceus in animals produces clusters of small vesicles that quickly evolve into pustules. Pustules may rupture, forming erosions or become crusted. Left untreated, pemphigus foliaceus in animals is life-threatening, leading to not only loss of condition but also secondary infection. Pemphigus vulgaris is a very rare disorder described in pet dogs and cats. Paraneoplastic pemphigus has been identified in pet dogs.

The vessel was built by Kiangnan Dockyard and Engineering Works, Shanghai, China, and launched on 10 November 1927. She was sponsored by Mrs. Ellis S. Stone and commissioned on 10 September 1928, with Lieutenant Commander James Mackey Lewis in command. Service history Built for duty in the Asiatic Fleet on the Yangtze River, Panay had as her primary mission the protection of American lives and property frequently threatened in the disturbances that the 1920s and 1930s brought to a China struggling to modernize, create a strong central government, and later counter Japanese aggression. Throughout Panay’s service, navigation on the Yangtze was constantly menaced by bandits and soldier outlaws, and Panay and her sister ships provided protection for American shipping and nationals, as other foreign forces did for their citizens. Panay in 1928 Often detachments from Panay served as armed guards on American steamers plying the river. In 1931, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander R. A. Dyer, reported, \\"Firing on gunboats and merchant ships have [sic] become so routine that any vessel traversing the Yangtze River sails with the expectation of being fired upon. Fortunately,\\" he added, \\"the Chinese appear to be rather poor marksmen and the ship has, so far, not sustained any casualties in these engagements.\\" As the Japanese moved through south China, American gunboats evacuated most of the embassy staff from Nanking during November 1937. Panay was assigned as station ship to guard the remaining Americans and take them off at the last moment. Panay evacuated the remaining Americans from the city on 11 December, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News’ Eric Mayell, the New York Times's Norman Soong, Collier's Weekly correspondent Jim Marshall, La Stampa correspondent Sandro Sandri and Corriere della Sera correspondent Luigi Barzini jr. Panay moved upriver to avoid becoming involved in the fighting around the doomed capital. Three American merchant tankers sailed with her. The Japanese senior naval commander in Shanghai was informed both before and after the fact of this movement. =Sunk by the Japanese= On 12 December 1937, Japanese naval aircraft were ordered by their Army to attack \\"any and all ships\\" in the Yangtze above Nanking. Knowing of the presence of Panay and the merchantmen, the Imperial Japanese Navy requested verification of the order, which was received before the attack began about 13:27 that day. Although there were several large American flags flown on the ship under the command of Lieutenant Commander James J. Hughes, as well as one painted atop the cabin, the Japanese planes continued strafing and bombing. Panay was hit by two of the eighteen bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters. The bombing continued until Panay sank at 15:54. Storekeeper First Class Charles L. Ensminger, Standard Oil tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded. Two newsreel cameramen were present on Panay, Norman Alley (Universal News) and Eric Mayell (Movietone News), and were able to take considerable film during the attack and afterward from shore as Panay sank in the middle of the river. The newsreels are now available online at usspanay.org (see external links below). A formal protest was immediately lodged by the American ambassador. The Japanese government accepted responsibility, but insisted the attack was unintentional. They claimed that the pilots could not distinguish between Chinese and American flags from the distance of 300 or more yards that the pilots attacked. A large indemnity was paid (approximately $2,000,000, which is equal to $ today) on 22 April 1938 and the incident was officially settled; however, further deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States continued. Fon Huffman, the last survivor of the incident, died in September 2008.

He was the son of Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, who was the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies, based in New York province. He inherited his father's baronetcy and lands in 1774. Sir John moved to Canada during the American Revolutionary War with family and allies, as he was at risk of arrest by rebel authorities. He led the King's Royal Regiment of New York and was promoted to brigadier general in 1782. That year Sir John Johnson was also appointed as Superintendent General and Inspector General of Indian affairs of First Nations in Canada, including the four Iroquois nations that had relocated there. After the war, he was appointed by the Crown to distribute lands in Upper Canada to exiled Loyalists, and estimated he helped resettle nearly 3800 in 1784. He also served in the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. Early life Johnson was born near Amsterdam, New York on 5 November 1741. He was the only son of Colonel Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, and his common-law wife, Catherine Weissenberg, a Palatine German immigrant. As his parents never married, he was baptized John Wysen Bergh by Rev. Henry Barclay February 7, 1741/2 as an Anglican in the chapel at Fort Hunter. His father was a military commander during the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) who had promoted the British settlement of the Mohawk Valley and trading with the Mohawk, and founded the community of Johnstown in Tryon County in the Province of New York. His paternal grandparents were Christopher Johnson and Lady Anne Warren, brother of Vice Admiral Sir Peter Warren (who married his eventual wife's aunt, Susannah Delancey, a daughter of Stephen Delancey), descendants of King William the Conqueror. From 1757 until 1760, John studied sporadically at The Academy and College of Philadelphia. From 13 years of age, he accompanied his father on military expeditions and conferences with the Indians.assnat.qc.ca: \\"John JOHNSON (1741-1830)\\" Career In 1771, Johnson became the last Provincial Grand Master of Masons in the colonies of Province of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.The Chancellor Robert R Livingston Masonic Library of New York: The History of the Grand Lodge of New York, New York Masonic Library. In 1774, at his father's death, Johnson succeeded to the baronetcy and inherited his father's title and extensive estates, making him a wealthy landowner. In 1775, he was appointed doorkeeper of the New York General Assembly. =American Revolution= In January 1776, nine months after the outbreak of the American Revolution, Johnson gathered several hundred armed supporters at Johnstown. He sent a letter to Governor William Tryon, through Captain John McDonell, saying that he and his Loyalist neighbors had conferred about raising a battalion for the British cause. He also said he could raise 500 Indian warriors who, when used with his regular troops, could retake all of the forts captured by the rebels. On January 20, 1776, General Schuyler, with a force of Continental troops and the Tryon County militia numbering around 3,000, disarmed Johnson and about 300 of his Loyalist supporters; Schuyler paroled Johnson. Hearing in May 1776 of another force being sent to arrest him, Johnson decided to flee with his family and supporters to Canada. He led about 170 of his tenants and allies among the Iroquois Confederacy to Montreal, Quebec. Sir John's loyalty to the King cost him his home in Johnstown and extensive property in the Mohawk Valley, all of which was confiscated after the war by the State of New York.The Mohawk Valley During the Revolution, by Harold Frederic, 1877. Johnson and his followers formed the core of the British military regiment known as the King's Royal Regiment of New York, which had substantial action against the New York colonials under his command throughout the revolutionary war. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1782. On March 14, 1782, he received the appointment of Superintendent General and Inspector General of Indian affairs from Sir Frederick Haldimand, due to the dismissal of his cousin Guy Johnson.\\"White Savage: William Johnson and the Invention of America\\", Fintan O'Toole, 2005. In 1781, General MacLean reported that Guy Johnson's wartime accounts were \\"Extravagant, wonderful & fictitious, and the quality of articles so extraordinary, new & uncommon\\". Guy Johnson was suspended as superintendent and summoned to Montreal, where Haldimand criticized his conduct as \\"reprehensible\\". Guy Johnson was disgraced and departed for London to defend his reports to the government, but met with no success. Sir John took over Fort Niagara as superintendent of Indian affairs in his cousin's absence, later to be appointed in full. The authority of the position extended over all northern First Nations allied with the Crown, including four of the Iroquois League nations, most of whom had relocated to Canada after having been allies of the British during the revolution.Sir John Johnson at Montreal and Niagara, Haldimand Collection. =Post-war years= John Johnson's Manor House in Williamstown, Ontario In 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, establishing the independence of the American Colonies. Johnson and thousands of other Loyalists were in permanent exile in Canada. The British had transported some Loyalists from New York and New England for resettlement to Nova Scotia, including more than 3,000 Black Loyalists: African-American slaves whom they had freed as promised for their service during the war. In 1784, Haldimand appointed Johnson to distribute Crown lands (purchased from First Nations) along the St. Lawrence River and the north shore of Lake Ontario including Amherst Island (what became known as Upper Canada) to Loyalists who had come to Canada, as some compensation for their losses in the colonies. The government wanted to encourage development of this part of Canada, as it was lightly settled. The exiles faced severe conditions in the early years, as they struggled to create settlements out of frontier lands, and the British were not able to get adequate supplies to them on time. Johnson estimated that he had arranged the settlement of 3,776 Loyalists during the first years. In 1791, Lord Dorchester recommended Johnson as lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, but London turned this recommendation down. In 1796, Johnson moved back to Montreal, then the seat of government, where he served in the Legislative Council of Lower Canada and as head of the Department of Indian Affairs for Lower Canada. He owned land in both Upper and Lower Canada, including the seigneuries of Monnoir and Argenteuil in Quebec. Personal life Lady Mary Johnson, copied by Henderson, of Montreal, from a family painting From 1765 to 1773, Johnson took as a common-law wife, fifteen year old Clarissa Putman (1751–1833), daughter of Arent V. Putman, of Dutch ancestry, and Elizabeth Peek of Tribes Hill, New York. Before their relationship ended and he married Mary Nicoll Watts, John and Clarissa were the parents of a daughter and a son: * Margaret Johnson (1765–), who married James Van Horne, the son of Sheriff Abraham Van Horne, in 1791. * William Johnson (1770–1836), who was taken to Canada by Johnson where he was educated and became the lock master at The Cascades in Lower Canada. On June 30, 1773, Johnson married Mary Nicoll \\"Polly\\" Watts (1751–1815), a daughter of Hon. John Watts, President of the King's Council, of New York. After he escaped to Canada in May 1776 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Lady Johnson was detained that year by the Whigs of New York as a hostage for the good conduct of her husband. After she was freed to join Sir John in Canada, the couple lived in Montreal during the winter and spent the summers on their seigneury at Argenteuil, Ottawa on the Ottawa River. The couple also visited in England. Together, Mary and Sir John had ten sons, eight of whom served in the British army and navy, and eight daughters, including: * Anne Nancy Johnson (1774–1848), who married Colonel Edward MacDonnell (1766–1812), the Deputy Quartermaster General to the Forces in Canada who served as an aide-de- camp to the Duke of Wellington. * William Johnson (1775–1811), who married Sarah Delancey, granddaughter of Oliver Delancey. * Warren Johnson (1777–1802), a major in the 60th regiment. * Adam Gordon Johnson (1781–1843), who succeeded his father to the baronetcy. * John Johnson (1782–1841), who married Mary Diana Dillon (1809–1861). * James Stephen Johnson (1785–1812), who was killed at the 1812 Siege of Badajoz. * Catherine Maria Johnson (1786–1850), who married Major-General Barnard Foord Bowes in 1805. Bowes died at the Siege of the Salamanca Forts in 1812. * Robert Thomas Johnson (1787–1812), who drowned in the St. Lawrence River in 1812. * Charles Christopher Johnson (1787–1864), who became a vice-admiral and married Susan Griffith Colpoys, daughter of Sir Edward Griffith Colpoys. * Archibald Kennedy Johnson (1792–1866), who married Jenet Robertson and Maria Langham. Their last surviving child, an unmarried daughter, died in London on 1 January 1868. Lady Johnson died in Montreal on August 7, 1815. Sir John died, at the age of 88, in Montreal, while still Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on January 4, 1830. Both are buried at Mount Johnson, near Chambly, Quebec. =Descendants= His grandson, James E. Van Horne, and great-grandson, William Van Horne, from his relationship with Clarissa Putnam, were both elected mayor of Schenectady, New York. As his eldest surviving son died without issue, his grandson William George Johnson (1830–1908), became the 4th Baronet. Legacy and honors Mount Johnson, 1885 * The Sir John Johnson House in Williamstown, Ontario, was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1961. * Lac Sir John, a small lake near Lakefield, Quebec (and as is the road Chemin Lac Sir John) is named after him.

An IR is designed to be conducive for further processing, such as optimization and translation. A \\"good\\" IR must be accurate – capable of representing the source code without loss of information – and independent of any particular source or target language. An IR may take one of several forms: an in-memory data structure, or a special tuple- or stack-based code readable by the program. In the latter case it is also called an intermediate language. A canonical example is found in most modern compilers, where the linear human-readable text representing a program is transformed into an intermediate graph structure that allows flow analysis and re-arrangement before creating a sequence of actual CPU instructions. Use of an intermediate representation such as this allows compiler systems like the GNU Compiler Collection and LLVM to be used by many different source languages to generate code for many different target architectures.  Intermediate language  An intermediate language is the language of an abstract machine designed to aid in the analysis of computer programs. The term comes from their use in compilers, where the source code of a program is translated into a form more suitable for code-improving transformations before being used to generate object or machine code for a target machine. The design of an intermediate language typically differs from that of a practical machine language in three fundamental ways: * Each instruction represents exactly one fundamental operation; e.g. \\"shift- add\\" addressing modes common in microprocessors are not present. * Control flow information may not be included in the instruction set. * The number of processor registers available may be large, even limitless. A popular format for intermediate languages is three-address code. The term is also used to refer to languages used as intermediates by some high-level programming languages which do not output object or machine code themselves, but output the intermediate language only. This intermediate language is submitted to a compiler for such language, which then outputs finished object or machine code. This is usually done to ease the process of optimization or to increase portability by using an intermediate language that has compilers for many processors and operating systems, such as C. Languages used for this fall in complexity between high-level languages and low-level languages, such as assembly languages. = Languages = Though not explicitly designed as an intermediate language, C's nature as an abstraction of assembly and its ubiquity as the de facto system language in Unix-like and other operating systems has made it a popular intermediate language: Eiffel, Sather, Esterel, some dialects of Lisp (Lush, Gambit), Haskell (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), Squeak's Smalltalk-subset Slang, Cython, Seed7, SystemTap, Vala, and others make use of C as an intermediate language. Variants of C have been designed to provide C's features as a portable assembly language, including C-- and the C Intermediate Language. Any language targeting a virtual machine or p-code machine can be considered an intermediate language: * Java bytecode * Microsoft's Common Intermediate Language is an intermediate language designed to be shared by all compilers for the .NET Framework, before static or dynamic compilation to machine code. * While most intermediate languages are designed to support statically typed languages, the Parrot intermediate representation is designed to support dynamically typed languages—initially Perl and Python. * TIMI is a high-level language that targets the IBM System i platform. * O-code for BCPL * MATLAB precompiled code * Microsoft P-Code The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) uses several intermediate languages internally to simplify portability and cross-compilation. Among these languages are * the historical Register Transfer Language (RTL) * the tree language GENERIC * the SSA-based GIMPLE. (Lower-level than GENERIC; input for most optimizers; has a compact \\"bytecode\\" notation.) GCC supports generating these IRs, as a final target: * HSA Intermediate Layer * LLVM Intermediate Representation (converted from GIMPLE in the now-defunct llvm-gcc which uses LLVM optimizers and codegen) The LLVM compiler framework is based on the LLVM IR intermediate language, of which the compact, binary serialized representation is also referred to as \\"bitcode\\" and has been productized by Apple. Like GIMPLE Bytecode, LLVM Bitcode is useful in link-time optimization. Like GCC, LLVM also targets some IRs meant for direct distribution, including Google's PNaCl IR and SPIR. The ILOC intermediate language \\"An ILOC Simulator\\" by W. A. Barrett 2007, paraphrasing Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon, \\"Engineering a Compiler\\", Morgan Kaufmann, 2004. . is used in classes on compiler design as a simple target language.\\"CISC 471 Compiler Design\\" by Uli Kremer  Other  Static analysis tools often use an intermediate representation.

Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head. The head of a death mask  Human head  The human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae. The term \\"skull\\" collectively denotes the mandible (lower jaw bone) and the cranium (upper portion of the skull that houses the brain). The skull can also be described as being composed of the cranium, which encloses the cranial cavity, and the facial skeleton (includes the mandible). There are eight bones in the cranium and fourteen in the facial skeleton. Sculptures of human heads are generally based on a skeletal structure that consists of a cranium, jawbone, and cheekbone. Though the number of muscles making up the face is generally consistent between sculptures, the shape of the muscles varies widely based on the function, development, and expressions reflected on the faces of the subjects. Proponents of identism believe that the mind is identical to the brain. Philosopher John Searle asserts his identist beliefs, stating \\"the brain is the only thing in the human head\\". Similarly, Dr. Henry Bennet-Clark has stated that the head encloses billions of \\"miniagents and microagents (with no single Boss)\\". View of a Skull III.jpgMid-sagittal section of a human skull, by Leonardo da Vinci, c. 1489 Bartholin head transect.jpgTransection of a human head, by Thomas Bartholin, 1673  Other animals  The evolution of a head is associated with the cephalization that occurred in Bilateria some 555 million years ago. = Arthropods = In some arthropods, especially trilobites (pictured at right), the cephalon, or cephalic region, is the region of the head which is a collective of \\"fused segments\\".  Insects  Head of a Nomada-species bee A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth. As these components differ substantially from insect to insect, they form important identification links. Eyes in the head found, in several types of insects, are in the form of a pair of compound eyes with multiple faces. In many other types of insects the compound eyes are seen in a \\"single facet or group of single facets\\". In some cases, the eyes may be seen as marks on the dorsal or located near or toward the head, two or three ocelli (single faceted organs). Antennae on the insect's head is found in the form of segmented attachments, in pairs, that are usually located between the eyes. These are in varying shapes and sizes, in the form of filaments or in different enlarged or clubbed form. Insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits. Labrum is the \\"upper lip\\" which is in the front area of the head and is the most exterior part. A pair of mandible is found on backside of the labrum flanking the side of the mouth, succeeded by a pair of maxillae each of which is known as maxilliary palp. At the back side of the mouth is the labium or lower lip. There is also an extra mouth part in some insects which is termed as hypopharynx which is usually located between the maxillac. = Vertebrates and the \\"new head hypothesis\\" = Though invertebrate chordates – such as the tunicate larvae or the lancelets – have heads, there has been a question of how the vertebrate head, characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body, might have evolved from the head structures of these animals. According to Hyman (1979), the evolution of the head in the vertebrates has occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments, in the same manner as in other \\"heteronomously segmented animals\\". In some cases, segments or a portion of the segments disappear. The head segments also lose most of its systems except for the nervous system. With the progressive development of cephalization, \\"the head incorporates more and more of the adjacent segments into its structure, so that in general it may be said that the higher the degree of cephalization the greater is the number of segments composing the head\\". In the 1980s, the \\"new head hypothesis\\" was proposed, suggesting that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of neural crest and cranial placodes.Gans, C. & Northcutt, R. G. Neural crest and the origin of vertebrates: a new head. Science 220, 268–273 (1983)Diogo, R., et al. (2015). A new heart for a new head in vertebrate cardiopharyngeal evolution. Nature, 520(7548), 466. In 2014, a transient larva tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural crest-derived cartilage which forms the vertebrate skull, suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire headspace could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head.  In society and culture  = Heraldry = The heads of humans and other animals are commonly recurring charges in heraldry. Heads of humans are sometimes blazoned simply as a \\"man's head\\", but are far more frequently described in greater detail, either characteristic of a particular race or nationality (such as Moors' heads, Saxons' heads, Egyptians' heads or Turks' heads), or specifically identified (such as the head of Moses in the crest of Hilton, or the head of St. John the Baptist in the crest of the London Company of Tallowchandlers). Several varieties of women's heads also occur, including maidens' heads (often couped under the bust, with hair disheveled), ladies' heads, nuns' heads (often veiled), and occasionally queens' heads. The arms of Devaney of Norfolk include \\"three nun's heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper,\\" and the bust of a queen occurs in the arms of Queenborough, Kent. Infants' or children's heads are often couped at the shoulders with a snake wrapped around the neck (e.g. \\"Argent, a boy's head proper, crined or, couped below the shoulders, vested gules, tarnished gold,\\" in the arms of Boyman). File:Flag of Corsica.svgThe flag of Corsica displays a head in profile view = Art = One of the ways of drawing sketches of heads—as Jack Hamm advises—is to develop it in six well-defined steps starting with the shape of the head in the shape of an egg. Female head, in particular, is sketched in a double circle design procedure with proportions considered as an ideal of a female head. In the first circle, the division is made of five sections on the diameter, each section of five eyes width. It is then developed over a series of ten defined steps with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at the lower end at the fourth stage. Eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to form the head. Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the world’s greatest artists who drew sketches of human anatomy using grid structures. His image of the face drawn on the grid structure principle is in perfect proportion. In this genre, using the technique of pen and ink, Leonardo created a sketch which is a \\"Study on the proportions of head and eyes\\" (pictured). = Idiomatic expressions = An idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning. * \\"To be big- headed\\" - to be overly full of oneself * \\"To come to a head\\" – to reach a critical stage and require immediate action * \\"To bite someone's head off\\" – to criticize someone strongly * \\"Can't make head or tail of something\\" – cannot understand something * \\"A head start\\" – an early start that provides an advantage over others * \\"Head and shoulders above someone or something\\" – better than someone or something in some way * \\"To want someone's head on a platter\\" – to want someone severely punished * \\"To bang your head against a brick wall\\" – to continually try to achieve something without success * \\"To have one's head in the clouds\\" – to not pay attention to what is happening around one because one is so absorbed by one's own thoughts =Engineering and scientific fields= The head's function and appearance play an analogous role in the etymology of many technical terms. Cylinder head, pothead, and weatherhead are three such examples.

Yeltsin era By the end of the Soviet era in 1991 and during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika (-1991), many businessmen in Russia imported or smuggled goods such as personal computers and jeans into the country and sold them, often on the black market, for a hefty profit. Anatoly Chubais, the man most credited with the Yeltsin-era privatization that led to the growth of the oligarchs During the 1990s, once Boris Yeltsin became President of Russia in July 1991, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and became rich through participation in the market via connections to the corrupt, but elected, government of Russia during the state's transition to a market-based economy. The so-called voucher- privatization program of 1992-1994 enabled a handful of young men to become billionaires, specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities (such as natural gas and oil) and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in private Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, they were dubbed \\"kleptocrats\\".Johanna Granville, \\"The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime\\".

Some members of these groups achieved vast wealth by acquiring state assets very cheaply (or for free) during the privatization process controlled by the Yeltsin government of 1991–1999.

Although the majority of oligarchs were not formally connected with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there are allegations that they were promoted (at least initially) by the communist apparatchiks, with strong connections to Soviet power-structures and access to the monetary funds of the Communist Party.Virtual Politics – Faking Democracy in the Post-Soviet World, Andrew Wilson, Yale University Press, 2005Braguinsky, Serguey, and Roger Myerson. \\"A macroeconomic model of Russian transition.\\" Economics of Transition 15.1 (2007): 77–107.

During Yeltsin's presidency (1991–1999) oligarchs became increasingly influential in Russian politics; they played a significant role in financing the re-election of Yeltsin in 1996. With insider information about financial decisions of the government, oligarchs could easily increase their wealth even further. The 1998 Russian financial crisis hit some of the oligarchs hard, however, and those whose holdings were still based mainly on banking lost much of their fortunes. The most influential and exposed oligarchs from the Yeltsin era include:British Paper Names Banking Clique at The Moscow Times, November 5, 1996 (archived)Dmitry Butrin. \\"The Results of 10 Years of Capitalism\\".

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin apparently engaged in a power struggle with some oligarchs, reaching a \\"grand bargain\\" with them.

Some had been imprisoned, such as Mikhael Mirilashvili. During Putin's presidency, a number of oligarchs came under fire for various illegal activities, particularly tax evasion in the businesses they acquired. However, it is widely speculated and believed that the charges were also politically motivated per these tycoons falling out of favor with the Kremlin.European Court Rules That Khodorkovsky's Rights Were Violated, Radio Free Europe, 31 May 2011.\\"Khodorkovsky speaks out on plight of Russia's political prisoners\\".

The term 'oligarch' has also been applied to technology investors such as Yuri Milner, although without involvement in Russian politics.Wired Magazine: \\"How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley\\" by Michael Wolff October 21, 2011 Defenders of the out-of- favor oligarchs, often associated with Chubais's party—the Union of Right Forces, argue that the companies they acquired were not highly valued at the time because they still ran on Soviet principles, with non-existent stock- control, huge payrolls, no financial reporting and scant regard for profit. They turned the businesses around and made them profitable for shareholders. They obtain little sympathy from the Russian public due to resentment over the economic disparity they represent. An economic study distinguished 21 oligarchic groups as of 2003. Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg in 2015 In 2004, Forbes listed 36 billionaires of Russian citizenship, with a note: \\"this list includes businessmen of Russian citizenship who acquired the major share of their wealth privately, while not holding a governmental position\\". In 2005, the number of billionaires dropped to 30, mostly because of the Yukos case, with Khodorkovsky dropping from #1 (US$15.2 billion) to #21 (US$2.0 billion). A 2013 report by Credit Suisse found that 35% of the wealth of Russia was owned by the wealthiest 110 individuals. Billionaire, philanthropist, art patron and former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has criticized the oligarchs, saying \\"I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing.

Capitalism without capital. Springer, 2009. The fall in the oligarchs' wealth relates closely to the meltdown in Russia's stock market, as by 2008 the RTS Index had lost 71% of its value due to the capital flight after the Russo- Georgian War of August 2008. Billionaires in Russia and Ukraine have been particularly hard-hit by lenders seeking repayment on balloon loans in order to shore up their own balance sheets. Many oligarchs took out generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares. One of the first to get hit by the global downturn was Oleg Deripaska, Russia's richest man at the time, who had a net worth of US$28 billion in March 2008. As Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral, the collapse in share price forced him to sell holdings to satisfy the margin calls.

The male protagonist Hjalmar and his duel for Ingeborg figures in the Hervarar saga and in Orvar-Odd's saga, as well as in Gesta Danorum, Lay of Hyndla and a number of Faroese ballads. Hjalmar never lost a battle until meeting a berserker wielding the cursed sword Tyrfing. A tale of two heroes Orvar-Odd and Hjalmar bid each other farewell, by Mårten Eskil Winge (1866).Hjalmar was one of the mythical Swedish king Yngvi's housecarls at Uppsala. He and princess Ingeborg were in love, but the king said no to his requests for marriage, since he hoped for a suitor with a better pedigree. Hjalmar's reputation as a courageous and valiant warrior was great and it reached the most remote parts of Norway, where the Norwegian hero Orvar-Odd felt a desire to test his fighting skills with Hjalmar. Thus Orvar-Odd sailed to Sweden with five ships and met Hjalmar who had fifteen ships. Hjalmar could not accept such an uneven balance of strength and sent away ten of his own ships so that the forces would be even. The two warriors fought for two days with a lot of blood-letting and poetry, but it was a draw. Finally, they realized that they were equals and decided to become Blood brothers by letting their blood flow under a strand of turf raised by a spear. Then the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations. Orvar-Odd accompanied Hjalmar back to Uppsala, where he soon discovered the feelings between Hjalmar and Ingeborg. Orvar-Odd offered to help Hjalmar elope with Ingeborg, but Hjalmar declined and suffered patiently until a suitor arrived that Hjalmar could not tolerate. The sons of Arngrim Further south, on Bolmsö, lived the feared berserker Arngrim and his twelve sons. They were all infamous berserkers who spread fear and destruction throughout the North. The eldest was a head taller than the rest and his name was Angantyr, and it was to him that Arngrim had entrusted the sword Tyrfing, which had been cursed by its makers, the Dwarves Dvalinn and Durin. This sword would cause three evil deeds and one man had to die every time it was unsheathed.The fantastical legend of the sword Tyrfing and its dwarfen make is found at the beginning of the later H text of Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, but lacking in the older R text. The R text contains more detail on Hjalmar's death duel at Samsø. (). In Örvar-Odds saga, Angantyr does mention his Tyrfingr was forged by dwarfs (;\\"Tyrfingr heitir, er dvergar hafa smidat\\", Boer ed., p.100) The next eldest was Hjorvard and one Yule, when everyone was at home and bragged about what they would accomplish the following year, Hjorvard declared that he was to marry princess Ingeborg at Uppsala. The proposal \\"Orvar Odd informs Ingeborg about Hjalmar's death\\" (1859) by August Malmström. In the spring, the twelve brothers arrived at Uppsala and Hjorvard asked for Ingeborg's hand, but this was something Hjalmar would not tolerate. Hjalmar stepped forth and said that he deserved the princess more than a strange berserker. The king who was uncomfortable with having twelve infamous berserkers in his hall declared that he could not possibly choose between two so great men, and thus he preferred to let Ingeborg make the choice herself. Naturally, Ingeborg chose Hjalmar and this vexed Hjorvard who challenged the happy Hjalmar to a duel on Samsø, and reminded that Hjalmar would be niðingr, if he did not turn up. The duel on Samsø On the designated day, Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd arrived to Munarvágr on Samsø, and immediately stepped ashore to search for their adversaries. They soon found the scattered and gory remains of the crewmen, who had been slaughtered by the twelve berserkers. Orvar-Odd immediately went to the forest and cut himself a huge club (according to Saxo, he took a rudder), whereupon the two companions continued their search for the twelve brothers. The decision was that one of the pair would fight Angantyr who wielded the sword Tyrfing, leaving the other to contend with the other eleven berserkers including the rival suitor Hjorvard. Orvar-Odd wore a silken (or silverAccording to the inserted verse, the shirt is made of silk in ASE but silver in MBC. The prose part of M says it is silken, contradicting the verse. ( )) shirt () which nothing could pierce, thus offered to take on Angantyr, but Hjalmar would hear none of it, accusing his sworn brother of taking away the better part of the glory.Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks (H text) has Odd saying \\"I will fight against Angantyr.. I have more faith in the protection of my shirt than in that of your-mail coat\\" to which Hjalmar objects () The variant description in Odd's saga is as follows: Angantyr reckons himself equal to three of his brothers when armed with his sword, forged by dwarfs and which will \\"bite anything, even iron or rock.\\" Hjalmar is eager to fight him nevertheless, thinking that his four-ringed mailcoat will afford him sufficient protection, even though Odd warns against the folly of it.. Odd's saga explains in detail about the shirt of magical protection made by Olvor (Ölvör). Orvar-Odd quickly defeated Hjorvard and ten of the brothers, and started to look for Hjalmar. He found Angantyr dead, but Hjalmar was lethally wounded by Tyrfing. In his dying breath, Hjalmar composed a poem which was meant to be communicated to his beloved princess Ingeborg back in Uppsala. Hjalmar's death song The composed poem, commonly known as \\"Hjalmar's death song\\" is found inserted in the older text of Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks as well as in Örvar-Odds saga, though the texts diverge considerably.. In the German it has been dubbed Hiálmars Sterbelied, and classed by Andreas Heusler as one of the so-called Eddica minora. Aftermath \\"Ingeborg\\" (1857) by Herman Wilhelm Bissen. Orvar-Odd buried all the slain men in barrows and Tyrfing. The agreement made beforehand that the slain would be given dignified burial together with their slain arms, Hjalmar with his mail-shirt, Angantyr with Tyrfing, and Odd too, had he been killed, with his shirt of protection and arrows (presumably the magic arrows named Gusir's Gifts). Perhaps it was so as to ensure that it would not cause a second and third malicious deed, after Hjalmar's death. Then he sailed alone back to Uppsala with Hjalmar's corpse. Odd remembers in his own death-poem that he piggybacked Hjalmar's corpse to Sigtuna in Uppsala.. When Ingeborg learned of Hjalmar's death, she fell dead also. The two lovers were buried in the same barrow. Tyrfing would not remain buried. For its continued adventures, see Hervor.

Background  By 1900 most commercial sailing vessels were struggling to turn a profit in the face of competition from more modern steam ships which had become efficient enough to steam shorter great circle routes between ports instead of the longer trade wind routes used by sailing ships. Ships were built larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were simplified to reduce manning costs and speed was no longer a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their date of arrival (which steam ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the Panama Canal was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate: principally on *the Chilean nitrate trade (for fertilizers and explosive production in Europe), and on *the Australian grain trade. Both Chile and Australian ports were difficult to supply with coal for steamships to refuel. Also, both routes to Europe went round Cape Horn. The end of the First World War saw a brief return to profitability as all ship types were in scarce supply due to wartime losses but that boom became bust as many new steam ships were built to replace the sailing ships that were lost.  Genesis in the 1930s  Italian navy training ship Amerigo Vespucci, launched in 1931. While many countries of the world operated sailing ships as training vessels for officers in their Merchant Marine in the 1920s and 30s, several sailing ship owners such as Carl Laeisz and Gustaf Erikson determined that there was still a profit to be made from the last of the sailing ships. Erikson purchased existing ships that required the minimum of capital investment and repaired them with parts cannibalised from other ships. Identifying the bulk cargo routes that would still offer paying freights, he manned the ships with a smattering of paid experienced officers. Some of the deckhands were apprentices from steamship lines and other adventurous youth who had paid a premium to sail while being trained, some recruited for very modest salaries. The apprentices were considered trainees and were the first formalization of sail trainers with crew drawn from members of the public who just went for the adventure, as opposed to a career. With manning costs netted out on Erikson's balance sheet, the ships continued to return a paper profit. However Erikson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the depreciation on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound hulls and rigs. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after World War II. While the shipping companies of Erickson and F. Laeisz gradually turned to steam, the next generation of captains were climbing up the hawsehole and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo. From 1932 through 1958, Irving Johnson and his wife Electa \\"Exy\\" Johnson circumnavigated the world 7 times with amateur youth crews on board their vessels named Yankee. Over the years, their voyages were featured in books they authored, and in National Geographic magazines and TV specials like \\"Irving Johnson, High Seas Adventurer\\". Their archives are at Mystic Seaport, Connecticut. Australian Alan Villiers purchased the old school ship George Stage from Denmark in 1934. Renaming her the Joseph Conrad, he sailed her round the world with no paying cargo and a crew of youth who had paid to be there. He also took as many non- paying youth as he could afford to fit in the budget, those he considered at risk on the streets of their inner cities and in need of what was then called \\"character building\\". These trips were the genesis of current modern sail training, using manually operated ships and the harsh discipline imposed by the sea to further personal development and taking those disadvantaged by circumstance to benefit from the experience. By the end of World War II, the numbers of traditionally rigged sailing ships left were dwindling and public interest waned. After the German school ship Niobe had sunk in 1932, killing 69, the loss of the Pamir in 1957 and the Albatross in 1961 drew further ill will and seemed to signal the end of an era.  Modern sail training  Eagle In what was conceived to be last great gathering of square-riggers under sail, Bernard Morgan and Greville Howard persuaded a number of ship owners to join together in a sort of farewell salute in 1956, organizing a race from Torbay on the South Coast of England to race informally across the Bay of Biscay to Lisbon in Portugal. Five square rigged school ships entered the race, Denmark's Danmark, Norway's Christian Radich and Sorlandet, Belgium's Mercator and Portugal's first Sagres. The vessels would meet again the following year and every year since in an annual series that would astonish its original organizers today. Old vessels were saved or repaired and new purpose built sail training vessels were commissioned. With renewed interest in the age of sail, national sail training associations affiliated to Sail Training International (STI) (formerly \\"Sail Training Association\\") were organized and large summer events find upwards of 100 ships racing across the oceans. Crew exchanges allow young people from one country to sail with those from another. Long before the end of the Cold War, ships from Russia and Poland (which in some cases had been built in Germany) joined the International Fleet in 1974. A limited exchange between the East and West was initiated. One of the largest of the affiliate organizations of the STI is the American Sail Training Association (ASTA). Founded in 1973 with a handful of vessels, it has since grown to encompass an international organization with more than 250 tall ships representing 25 different countries. The UK National Member of STI is the Association of Sail Training Organisations (ASTO) Founded in 1972, http://www.asto.org.uk Square rigged seamanship was in danger of becoming a lost art. As the 1997 restoration of the USS Constitution neared completion, the United States Navy called on the crew of HMS Bounty to train her sailors to sail the vessel as originally intended. Many boats are historical vessels and replicas which require coordinated manual labor to sail, operating in the original tradition proposed by Alan Villiers and Irving Johnson such as the Picton Castle while others are purpose built educational platforms carrying out scientific research under sail such as the Robert C. Seamans and the Corwith Cramer of the Sea Education Association. Another new direction is the development of floating maritime heritage centres, connected to a sail training organisation, and often in co-ordination with land based maritime museums. Tall Ship Atyla is one such example of this, with visitors to the Bilbao Maritime Museum enjoying free entry to the ship during the winter months when she is moored nearby. As the crew of the Irving Johnson and the award-winning program at the Los Angeles Maritime Institute like to say \\"We do not train youth for a life at sea ... we use the sea to educate youth for life\\".  Vessel classifications  Tall ships have been found to be effective platforms for sail training as they combine many elements fundamental to sail training. A \\"Tall ship\\" is not a strictly defined type of vessel. \\"Tall ship\\" is commonly used today to define a large, traditionally rigged vessel, whether or not is it technically a ship. For example, the USCGC Eagle is technically a barque and not a full rigged ship. A tall ship is usually defined by the topmast and topsails she carries as opposed to the modern high aspect ratio rigs and marconi mains carried by the sloops and yawls seen in every harbor today. For the purpose of classification and race rating, the STI divides Tall ships into the following classes : :Class A: All vessels over 160 feet in length overall, regardless of rig, and square rigged vessels over 120 feet in length. :Class A; Division II: All square rigged vessels less than 120 feet in length. :Class B: Fore-and-aft rigged vessels between 100 feet and 160 feet in length :Class C: All other fore-and-aft rigged vessels at least 30 feet long at the waterline. The United States Coast Guard classifies vessels based on their intended use and structure, prescribing requirements for captain and crew manning, waters the vessel may operate in, number of passengers allowed and minimum safety equipment required. With the exception of uninspected vessels, all such vessels are inspected annually and issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which must be displayed on the vessel and spells out the requirements that vessel must maintain. :Sailing School Vessel (SSV): Inspected under Title 46, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). An SSV is a vessel of less than 500 gross tons carrying six or more sailing school students or instructors, primarily propelled by sail, and operated by a nonprofit educational organization exclusively for the purpose of sailing education. :Passenger Vessel: Certified according to the size and number of passengers (not engaged in educational activities or in the operation of the vessel) carried under Title 46 of the CFR. ::Subchapter C: Uninspected vessels which operate with no more than six passengers. ::Subchapter T: Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than six passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment. ::Subchapter K: Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than 150 passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment. ::Subchapter H: Passenger vessels of more than 100 gross tons that carry passengers for hire and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment. :Attraction Vessel: Certification is required whenever a vessel is open to public boarding or conducts dockside programs. The vessel may be permanently moored to a pier, or it may be certified under one or more of the above subchapters, but the Attraction Vessel COI certifies its safety for dockside and visitation only. :Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV): Certified under Subchapter U of Title 46 of the CFR. An ORV is a vessel employed exclusively in either oceanographic (saltwater) or limnologic (freshwater) instruction and/or research, and is not necessarily equipped for passengers or other non-professionals.

Army career Brayley was Welsh by birth, having been born in Pontypridd, Glamorgan. He went to the local grammar school. At the age of 17 he joined the Royal Artillery and later became a physical training instructor. He was an enthusiastic boxer and became Army Boxing Champion. During the war he served in the Parachute Regiment, winning the Military Cross in 1942 for action in the North African desert campaign. He was part of a unit – a forerunner for today's special forces, set up to train soldiers to parachute behind enemy lines and cause as much disruption to the enemy as possible. He also served in Sicily and Crete and was mentioned in despatches (23 September 1943). Business and political career In 1946 he joined Phoenix Glass Co Ltd, Bristol which did well through his discovery of markets for its glass bottles. He then moved to manufacturing in Canning Town Glassworks Group, where he became chairman in 1961. He never claimed to know anything about glass, only how to run a team and he built up the company, which made substantial profits for some years. He shared with George Wigg, Labour's Paymaster General an enthusiasm for horse-racing and owned several of his own horses. He was introduced to Harold Wilson and they became friends. On the Prime Minister's defeat in 1970 Sir Desmond made his personal chauffeur, Rolls-Royce and London home available to Harold Wilson, who later recommended Brayley for a Knighthood. On 22 June 1973 Sir Desmond was created for a life peer as Baron Brayley of the City of Cardiff in the County of Glamorgan. He was awarded government office in March 1974 as Under Secretary for the Army. At this point he resigned as chairman of his company, and sold his shares for over £1 million. After inquiries were made into a company with which he had been involved, he signed a letter of resignation rather than cause the Prime Minister any embarrassment. Despite an initial but extensive enquiry into his business dealings nothing was ever proved before his death in 1977 while awaiting trial at the Old Bailey on fraud charges. He became a Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London in 1970, was a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and at one time chairman and trustee of the Saints and Sinners Club in London. Lifestyle Brayley was a wealthy self-made man who lived in some style and had a penthouse in Arlington House, Piccadilly, and also Hailey House, a country house in Oxfordshire. He was noted as a free spending extrovert by some, and enjoyed returning to Cardiff for social occasions and to watch Wales play rugby from the balcony of his apartment. He was a keen yachtsman and owned 'Natalie' a 527 tonne, 177-foot classic motor yacht. He was also a keen angler, and civilian air pilot. Despite his considerable wealth he never forgot his roots and was deeply affected by the poverty surrounding him when he grew up as a boy in the Rhondda.[citation?] Philanthropy As well as being a Freemason, he was on the board of The Royal Artillery Association and was a member of The Grand Order of Water Rats, the show business charity organisation. He was a Freeman of the City of London, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, President of the Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, Patron of the Royal Masonic Hospital, and President of the Amateur Boys Boxing Club. Death Lord Brayley died in Cardiff after a short illness in March 1977 aged 60. His marriage was dissolved in 1960 and he was survived by two daughters, two grandsons and two grand daughters.

It followed the training of Canadian journalist and actor Andrew Younghusband on an 18-month sail training voyage around the World, on the barque Picton Castle. Originally, a new episode was aired approximately once per month. Some of the people in the show are the ship's professional crew, while many are trainees who joined the ship to travel or learn about tall ship sailing. The number of crew when the ship began its voyage from Nova Scotia, Canada, was approximately four dozen. Some of the trainees had only booked one leg of the voyage while others had signed on for the entire 18 months. Some left early because they fell in love while on board -- or because of personality conflicts -- while others decided to stay on board longer than they'd initially planned. The show follows the interpersonal relations between many of the people on board while also showing a bit about the various islands the ship visits during the voyage. This was the Picton Castle's second sail- training voyage around the World. The vessel contained a supply of text books in her hold, which she distributed to a number of isolated communities in the South Pacific, including The Cook Islands, Pitcairn Island, Tonga, French Polynesia, Samoa, and Fiji.

Booth's work, along with that of Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, influenced government policy regarding poverty in the early 20th century and helped initiate Old Age pensions and free school meals for the poorest children. Biography Charles Booth was born in Liverpool, Lancashire on 30 March 1840 to Charles Booth and Emily Fletcher. His father was a wealthy shipowner and corn merchant as well as being a prominent Unitarian. He attended the Royal Institution School in Liverpool before being apprenticed in the family business at the age of sixteen. He joined his brother, Alfred Booth, in the leather trade in 1862 and they subsequently established a successful shipping firm together, and Charles remained actively involved with it until his retirement in 1912. Booth became alienated from the dominant, nonconformist business class of Liverpool into which he had been born, and, following his marriage in 1871 to Mary Macaulay, the couple settled in London. The niece of the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, she was a cousin of the Fabian socialist and author, Beatrice Webb. They had 7 children, 3 sons and 4 daughters His eldest daughter Antonia married the Hon Sir Malcolm Macnaghten, and others married into the Ritchie and Gore Browne families. Career Booth's father died in 1860, leaving him in control of the family company. He entered the skins and leather business with his elder brother Alfred, and they set up Alfred Booth and Company with offices in Liverpool and New York City using a £20,000 inheritance. In 1865 Booth ran for Parliament as the Liberal candidate for Toxteth, Liverpool, but was unsuccessful. After learning the shipping trades, Booth was able to persuade Alfred and his sister Emily to invest in steamships and established a service to Pará, Maranhão and Ceará in Brazil. Booth himself went on the first voyage to Brazil on 14 February 1866. He was also involved in the building of a harbour at Manaus which overcame seasonal fluctuations in water levels. Booth described this as his \\"monument\\" (to shipping) when he visited Manaus for the last time in 1912. Social Research Part of Booth's map of Whitechapel, 1889. The red areas are \\"well- to-do\\"; the black areas are \\"semi-criminal\\". Colour key for Booth's poverty map. Influenced earlier by positivism, he embarked in 1886 on the major survey of London life and labour for which he became famous and is commonly regarded as initiating the systematic study of poverty in Britain. Booth was critical of the existing statistical data on poverty. By analysing census returns he argued that they were unsatisfactory and later sat on a committee in 1891 which suggested improvements which could be made to them. Due to the scale of the survey, results were published serially but it took over fifteen years before the full seventeen volume edition was published. His work on the study and his concern with the problems of poverty led to an involvement in campaigning for old-age pensions and promoting the decasualization of labour. Booth publicly criticised the claims of H. M. Hyndman, the leader of the Social Democratic Federation, Britain's first socialist party. In the Pall Mall Gazette of 1885, Hyndman stated that 25% of Londoners lived in abject poverty. The survey of life and labor began with a pilot study in Tower Hamlets. Booth then hired numerous researchers to assist with the full study of the whole of London, which investigated the three main topics of poverty, occupations, and religion. Among his researchers were his cousin Beatrice Potter (Beatrice Webb) and the chapter on women's work was conducted by the budding economist Clara Collet. This research, which looked at incidences of pauperism in the East End of London, showed that 35% were living in abject poverty – even higher than the original figure. This work was published under the title Life and Labour of the People in 1889. A second volume, entitled Labour and Life of the People, covering the rest of London, appeared in 1891. Booth also popularised the idea of a 'poverty line', a concept conceived by the London School Board. Booth set this line at 10 to 20 shillings a week, which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of 4 or 5 people to subsist. After the first two volumes were published Booth expanded his research. This investigation was carried out by Booth himself with his team of researchers. Nonetheless, Booth continued to oversee his successful shipping business which funded his philanthropic work. The fruit of this research was a second expanded edition of his original work, published as Life and Labour of the People in London in nine volumes between 1892 and 1897. A third edition (now expanded to seventeen volumes) appeared 1902–3. Booth used his work to argue for the introduction of Old Age Pensions which he described as \\"limited socialism\\". Booth argued that such reforms would help prevent a socialist revolution from occurring in Britain. Booth was far from tempted by the ideals of socialism, but had sympathy with the working classes and, as part of his investigations, he took lodgings with working-class families and recorded his thoughts and findings in his diaries.www.nationalarchives.gov.uk The London School of Economics keeps his work on an online searchable database.Booth Poverty Map & Modern map (Charles Booth's London) LSE. Retrieved 5 January 2017. =Methodology= For the purposes of poverty measurement, Booth divided the working population into eight classes, from the poorest to the most well-off and he labeled these A—H. These categories summarized economic circumstances but also had a moral dimension, with ‘A’ representing the ‘feckless, deviant or criminal’ groups. According to Professor Paul Spicker,www.unesco.org \\"it is important to note that Charles Booth's studies of poverty are widely misrepresented in the literature of social policy. His work is commonly bracketed with Rowntree's, but his methods were quite different. His definition of poverty was explicitly relative; he based the description of poverty on class, rather than income. He did not attempt to define need, or to identify subsistence levels of income on the basis of minimum needs; his “poverty line” was used as an indicator of poverty, not a definition. His approach was to identify the sorts of conditions in which people were poor, and to describe these conditions in a variety of ways. To this end, he used a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods in an attempt to add depth and weight to his descriptions of poverty.\\" =Criticisms= The survey has been negatively criticized for its methodology. Booth used school board visitors — those who undertook to ensure the attendance of children at school - to collect information on the circumstances of families. However, his extrapolation from these findings to families without school-age children was speculative. Moreover, his ‘definitions’ of the poverty levels of household ‘classes’ were general descriptive categories that did not equate to specific criteria. Although the seventeen volumes were dense with often fascinating detail, it was primarily descriptive rather than analytical. Booth's 1902 study included antisemitic references to the impact of Jewish immigration, comparing it to the \\"slow rising of a flood\\" and that \\"no Gentile could live in the same house with these poor foreign Jews, and even as neighbours they are unpleasant; and, since people of this race, though sometimes quarrelsome amongst themselves, are extremely gregarious and sociable, each small street or group of houses invaded tends to become entirely Jewish\\". Influence of his work Life and Labour of the People in London can be seen as one of the founding texts of British sociology, drawing on both quantitative (statistical) methods and qualitative methods (particularly ethnography). Because of this, it was an influence on Chicago School of Sociology (notably the work of Robert E. Park) and later the discipline of community studies associated with the Institute of Community Studies in East London.www.ukdataservice.ac.uk Booth's poverty maps revealed that there is a spatial component to poverty as well as an environmental context of poverty. Before his maps, environmental explanations of poverty mainly interested health professionals; Booth brought environmental issues into empirical sociological investigation. In addition to Booth's influence on the field of sociology, he influenced other academics as well. Hubert Llewellyn-Smith's repeat London survey was inspired by Booth. Booth's work served as an impetus for Seebohm Rowntree's; he also influenced Beatrice Webb and Helen Bosanquet. The importance of Booth's work in social statistics was recognised by the Royal Statistical Society, when in 1892 he was elected President and was awarded its first Guy Medal in Gold. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1899. Politics Booth had some involvement in politics, although he canvassed unsuccessfully as the Liberal parliamentary candidate in the General Election of 1865. Following the Conservative Party victory in municipal elections in 1866, his interest in active politics waned. This result changed Booth's attitudes, and he foresaw that he could influence people more by educating the electorate, rather than by being a representative in Parliament. He declined subsequent offers from PM William Ewart Gladstone of elevation to the peerage with a seat in the House of Lords. Booth engaged in Joseph Chamberlain's Birmingham Education League, a survey which looked into levels of work and education in Liverpool. The survey found that 25,000 children in Liverpool were neither in school or work.www.liberalhistory.org.uk While Booth's attitudes towards poverty might make him seem fairly left-wing, Booth actually became more conservative in his views in later life. Some of his investigators such as Beatrice Webb became Socialists as a result of this research, however Booth was critical of the way in which the Liberal Government appeared to support Trade Unions after they won the 1906 General Election.www.warwick.ac.uk Later life The blue plaque to Charles Booth at 6 Grenville Place, London SW7. Booth purchased William Holman Hunt's painting 'The Light of The World', which he donated to St Paul's Cathedral in 1908. Early in 1912 Booth stood down as chairman of Alfred Booth and Company in favour of his nephew Alfred Allen Booth, but in 1915 returned willingly to work under wartime exigencies despite growing evidence of heart disease. In later life, Booth retired to Grace Dieu Manor near Thringstone, Leicestershire. He died on 23 November 1916 and was buried in Saint Andrew's churchyard. A memorial dedicated to him stands on Thringstone village green, and a blue plaque has been erected on his house in South Kensington: 6 Grenville Place.

A. Salvatore, the first book in his series The Hunter's Blades Trilogy. In it, Drizzt Do'Urden is separated from his friends while orcs, giants, and a few drow are determined to destroy everything in their path. Plot summary In The Thousand Orcs, a clan of frost giants led by Gerti Orelsdottr allied with the orc King Obould Many-Arrows to send a massive army against the towns of the North. On the sidelines, four drow from the Underdark orchestrate events behind the scenes, playing each side against the other for their own advantage. Drizzt is separated from his friends during the siege at the town of Shallows. He witnesses the apparent death of the other Companions of the Hall, and turns his attention to slaughtering all of the orcs he can find, whilst reverting again to the Hunter. The other companions meet warrior dwarves of Mirabar who left because of their leader Marchion Elastuls dislike and borderline hatred for the dwarves of Mithral Hall. Publication history The first printing of The Thousand Orcs was 200,000 copies. Reception The Thousand Orcs debuted on The New York Times bestseller list at number 11. Reviews were generally positive. Publishers Weekly described it as a \\"rousing tale of derring-do and harrowing escapes\\", although in doing so they acknowledged that it was a \\"light-hearted sword and sorcery novel\\", which gained some depth through Drizzt's philosophical ponderings about human frailties. Similarly, Paul Brink, writing for the School Library Journal, acknowledged the author's use of Drizzt to \\"reflect on issues of racial prejudice\\". James Voelpel from mania.com commented on The Thousand Orcs, calling it \\"a welcome return to the beginnings of Salvatore's fantasy writing, though it seems to be lacking in some respects. All the characters that fans have been clamoring for are here but the sheer number of secondary stories and characters sometimes drowns them out. Even the would be love affair between Catti-brie and Drizzt seems underdone and somewhat glossed over. Characters such as Bruenor, Wulfgar and Regis are almost afterthoughts with some development to their personalities seemingly tacked on. The plot itself is rock solid and the story points with Obould and Gerti's alliance as well as the rift between the dwarves and humans in Mirabar are really well done. Salvatore is always noted for his ability to write action that you can picture and he doesn't disappoint here. The battles are stupendously done and vividly portray a comic book feel to them. For then fans of Salvatore this is a welcome edition to the Drizzt legacy, albeit lacking a bit, soon enough it will rocket up the bestseller list and have its following clamoring for the follow ups.\\" References 2002 American novels Forgotten Realms novels Novels by R.

The company was formed in 1959 by a merger of Bristol Aero-Engines Limited and Armstrong Siddeley Motors Limited. In 1961 the company was expanded by the purchase of the de Havilland Engine Company and the engine division of Blackburn Aircraft. Bristol Siddeley was purchased by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966. History Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited was formed by the 1 April 1959 merge of Bristol Aero-Engines and Armstrong Siddeley Motors. These were the aero engine manufacturing companies of the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the Hawker Siddeley Group. The share capital of Bristol Siddeley was held in equal proportions by these two parent organisations. At around the same time Bristol's aircraft manufacturing was being subsumed into the British Aircraft Corporation along with those of English Electric and Vickers-Armstrong. Armstrong Siddeley Motors had been producing aero-engines and motor-cars since it had been formed in 1919 with the merger of Siddeley-Deasy and the Armstrong Whitworth Company. Bristol Aero-Engines had been formed in 1920 when the Bristol Aeroplane Company had taken over the assets of the Cosmos Engineering Company.Barnes 1988, pp. 30-31 On 6 May 1958 Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited was formed as a pilot company to bring about an alliance between the Bristol and Coventry concerns, and a full merger took effect from the beginning of April 1959. The purpose of the new company was to combine the research, engineering and manufacturing resources of the two great component companies to meet the changing demands of the aviation industry. The company was further strengthened in November 1961 when it acquired the full share capital of the de Havilland Engine Company Limited and Blackburn Engines Limited, both of which were formerly operating within the Hawker Siddeley Group. The aircraft side of Blackburn became part of Hawker Siddeley.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%201663.html Both of these companies had long histories in the aero-engine industry. The de Havilland Engine Company Limited had the de Havilland Sprite which was a rocket engine with a military type test certificate. In 1954, the company had produced the axial turbojet Gyron of thrust, from which was descended the Gyron Junior series. The de Havilland Engine Company's portfolio included the (licensed) Gnome turboshaft. The Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Company had entered the aero engine field in 1934 when the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering Company became part of the Blackburn and this became the Engine Division of Blackburn Aircraft and subsequently Blackburn Engines Limited. In 1952 an agreement was signed which enabled Blackburn Engines Limited to produce engines based on the Turbomeca range of small gas turbine engines. These were developed for use as airborne auxiliary power units for large aircraft and they were also used as a ground starter unit in the British services. Bristol Siddeley was bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966 for £63.6 million in order to prevent competition from a planned collaboration between BSEL, Pratt & Whitney and Snecma.Gunston 1989, pp.37-38. Bristol Siddeley retained its own identity and marketing organization.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201775.html Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited is still a listed but dormant company within the Rolls Royce group.English Company No. 00604105 BRISTOL SIDDELEY ENGINES LIMITED Products The company was one of the largest of its kind in the worldFlight 6 Feb 1959Flight 28 August 1959 and offered a wider range of engines than any other manufacturer. Aero engines produced by the company included piston engines, turboprops, turboshafts, turbojets, turbofans, auxiliary power units, ramjets and liquid propellant rocket engines. Outside the aeronautical field its products were gas turbines for marine and industrial use, diesel engines, and automatic transmissions. =Aero engines= The Patchway factory in South Gloucestershire produced military aeroplane engines including the Olympus two-spool turbojet (from which the engine for Concorde was developed), the Orpheus turbojet for the Folland Gnat light fighter/trainer aircraft, the Pegasus two shaft medium bypass ratio vectored thrust turbofan for the Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel/Harrier VSTOL ground attack aircraft, the Proteus turboprop for the Bristol Britannia airliner and the Viper turbojet for the Hawker Siddeley HS.125. Bristol Siddeley had under development another vectored thrust turbofan, the \\"plenum chamber burner\\" (similar to an afterburner) equipped BS100, which was intended for the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154 VSTOL fighter, but the project was cancelled in 1965. The two shaft BS143 was proposed for the MRCA (later the Tornado), but the takeover by RR caused the adoption of the three shaft RB199 instead. Hypersonics were explored in a shock tube near the High Altitude Test Plant (HATP) at Bristol, in support of BS1012 hypersonic engine thinking. High supersonic ramjets for long range defensive missiles were tested in the HATP (Ref TJ102 and TJ151/2). =Diesel engines= Bristol Siddeley also manufactured diesel engines under licence from the German company Maybach. These were for installation in British Rail Class 42 and Class 52 locomotives which were themselves based on licensed German designs but with as much British-built content as possible. The Maybach Diesel (MD) MD650, MD655 and MD870 series engines built by Bristol Siddeley were sophisticated in design, running at much higher speeds than normal diesels of their size and featured advanced construction such as a disc-webbed crankshaft that ran in large roller bearings, telescopic pipes to deliver cooling oil to the pistons and detachable piston crowns. The MD engines produced by BSEL included 16 basic engines in the range, which covered powers from 380 to 3,000 horsepower, and includes 4- and 6-cylinder in-line units, and 8, 12 and 16 V units. Each of these were pressure-charged, with or without intercooling. They were used with hydraulic transmission systems, in the Type 4 locos (with two MD650 engines of 1,152 bhp each) hauled the express trains of the Western Region of British Railways - e.g. the Bristolian and the Cornish Riviera. Several hundred more orders were placed by British Rail.(Ref TJ102). MD series engines were widely used in base load, intermittent and standby electricity generating sets, and were transported by rail up to the nominal 1200 kW size for a complete generator set. They were also employed in oil rigs and pumping sets.(Ref TJ151/2). =Motor cars= When the company was formed it also included the motor car companies Armstrong Siddeley Motors and Bristol Cars. It was soon decided to stop production of Armstrong Siddeley cars, as it was becoming uneconomic, with production of the only product, the Star Sapphire, ending in July 1960. In September 1960 Bristol Cars was sold. See also References Sources * Barnes, C.H. Bristol Aircraft since 1910. London, England. Putnam. 1988. * Gunston, Bill. World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines.

The facility is located just north of the village Paradeisi, about 14 km southwest of the capital city, Rodos. Rhodes International Airport was the fourth busiest airport in Greece as of 2019, with 5,542,567 passengers utilizing the airport.  History  Check-in at Rhodes Airport Civil aviation on Rhodes started after the Second World War, on the location of the nearby military Rhodes Maritsa Airport. This was the island's main airport until 1977, when the new Rhodes International Airport was opened. The need for a new facility was big, as the 'old' Maritsa airport did not meet the needs for a modern civil airport. The new \\"Diagoras\\" airport was built in 1977. It was decided that, on this location, it would meet the needs of the island better. Improvements have been made to the airport, like expansion of taxiways, platform and airport buildings. The most recent upgrade is a new passenger terminal, opened in 2005, to accommodate the growing number of charter flights and passengers. The airport's plants currently cover a total area of 60,000 m2 In 2015, Rhodes Airport was closed for 14 hours after a 'sinkhole' appeared in the runway. Flights were diverted to surrounding airports such as Kos and Heraklion as well as Athens and the runway was fixed and reopened shortly afterwards. In December 2015, the privatisation of Rhodes International Airport and 13 other regional airports of Greece was finalised with the signing of the agreement between the Fraport AG/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund. \\"We signed the deal today,\\" the head of Greece's privatisation agency HRADF, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. According to the agreement, the joint venture will operate the 14 airports (including Rhodes International Airport) for 40 years as of autumn 2016. Facilities =Terminal= Rhodes Airport terminal is actually 2 separate buildings with a joined corridor in the middle. Departures are served both in ground (check-ins, baggage checks) and first floor (passenger screening, gates, shops) while arrivals are served only in ground floor's southern corner where passport control, customs and baggage reclaim operate. Airport does not have air bridges so boarding and disembarking require the use of buses. Both terminals are and will be under renovations for the next couple of years from Fraport as a series of chronic problems need to be addressed. Toilets and air conditioning system were first to be fixed while more complicated works including new check in facilities that will eliminate double checks for baggage as well interior remodeling will proceed gradually during low traffic winter months. Airport also hosts all necessary services such as a police station, a medical clinic, airline and handlers offices, rent-a-car and tour operators kiosks, VIP halls as well recently refurbished duty free shops, cafes and restaurants. =Runway= The airport's single runway direction is 070/250, having a length of 3,306 meters and a width of 60 meters. There are six taxiways connecting the runway with the terminal. Tarmac can accommodate up to 14 airplanes simultaneously and up to A380. New parking spots as well rearrangements on airplanes' parking patterns engaging ground vehicles is expected to increase capacity.  Future of the Airport - Fraport Greece’s investment plan  On 22 March 2017, the Fraport-Greece presented its master plan for the 14 regional airports including the International Airport of Rhodes.\\"Fraport Greece’s Development Plan for the New Era at the Greek Regional Airports\\", fraport-greece.com The following summarizes the enhancement changes that started in November 2017 and will be implemented for Rhodes International Airport under Fraport Greece’s investment plan: Immediate actions that were implemented at the airports as soon as Fraport Greece took over operations and before the launch of the 2017 Summer season included: *General clean-up *Improving lighting, marking of airside areas. *Upgrading sanitary facilities *Enhancing services and offering new free Internet connection (WiFi) *Implementing works to improve fire safety in all the areas of the airports *Remodeling the current terminal *Reorganizing the airport apron area *New fire station *13 percent increase in the number of check-in counters (from 40 to 45) *13 percent increase in the number of departure gates (from 16 to 18) *71 percent in the number of security-check lanes (from 7 to 12) *25 percent increase in the number of baggage reclaim belts (from 4 to 5) Airlines and destinations Traffic figures Figures are taken from the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) \\"RODOS AIRPORT\\", ypa.gr until 2016 and since 2017 from the official website of the airport.\\"Air Traffic statistics\\", rho-airport.gr { - valign=\\"top\\"  {class=\\"toccolours\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse\\" - style=\\"background:#f2f2f2;\\" !

Her role was to prevent smuggling and to collect customs duties. She was retired and sold in 1773 when unrest in Britain's American colonies required larger, better armed patrol craft. Career Sultana was built in the yard of renowned Boston Shipwright Benjamin Hallowell in 1767, probably as a yacht. She made one voyage from Boston to England. The Royal Navy purchased her for £292 9s 0d from Sir Thomas Hesketh on 18 March 1768. She underwent fitting by John Randall, of Rotherhithe between 19 March and 25 August. At the time of purchase, her lines were taken off and a draught of the hull filed at the Admiralty. She was one of six Marblehead schooners that the Royal Navy bought. The navy named her HMS Sultana and commissioned her in July under the command of Lt John Inglis, who would end his service to the crown as Vice Admiral of the Blue. Sultana's logbook began on 15 July 1768. Sultana left Dungeness on the morning of 27 August 1768. Her assignment was to enforce the Townshend Acts (and to enforce tea taxes) by stopping smugglers. The schooner’s master was David Bruce. Sultana's first assignment once she reached Halifax was to proceed to Boston to help land General Gage’s troops in Boston for the protection of customs officials. Following that, she sailed up and down the coast of the Colonies, visiting Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia and many spots in the lower Chesapeake tidewater region. On 10 October 1772 Sultana set off to England. Fate Sultana was paid off in December. She was sold at auction in Portsmouth on 11 August 1773 to John Hook Jr. for £85. Modern replicas The replica Sultana on the Chester River in 2013 A new Sultana, launched in Chestertown, Maryland, in 2001, serves as an educational vessel for schoolchildren as it travels around the Chesapeake Bay. Each year there are public excursions out of Chestertown and other ports. \\"Downrigging Weekend\\" in Chestertown is always the first weekend in November. Replica sailing ships from all around the mid-Atlantic participate in sailing excursions and allow the public on board. The replica vessel is not an exact reconstruction. It has a diesel auxiliary engine and otherwise conforms to Coast Guard regulations in order to carry passengers. The modern version is framed with osage orange and planked with oak; there is a lead ballast keel which the original did not have. She has only four guns, rather than the original eight. All work and can be fired. Within modern safety requirements, however, she was built following traditional methods as much as possible. The Howard I. Chapelle drawings of Sultana, traced from the Admiralty draughts, also inspired another modern vessel, the schooner Larinda. Her design is loosely based on Sultana but with a junk-rig and fantasy woodwork featuring whimsical details such as a frog for a figurehead.

She then vanished from the music scene for decades, returning in 2007 to record her first solo album with Norton Records. Background Growing up in Queens, Weiss, her older sister Elizabeth (known as Betty) and her older brother George lived in Cambria Heights. She sang in school plays and church choirs. Additionally, she listened to her brother and his friends perform popular songs of the day; George being an Elvis fan. Mary appreciated such performers as Neil Sedaka and the Everly Brothers; she attended her first Everly Brothers concert in 1963 at Freedomland U.S.A. at the age of 14.  Early recordings  After Weiss and her sister Betty became good friends with twins Mary Ann and Margie Ganser in grammar school, the four of them sang at local dances and hops. That brought them to the attention of local producer Artie Ripp, who later signed them on to Kama Sutra Productions. After recording demos and making it to the Brill Building in 1964 (and signing with Red Bird Records), they recorded songs: \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\", which was their first hit, and \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1964. With their growing popularity, the Shangri-Las became a leading girl group in the 1960s. After several years of the grind, they split in 1968 and went their separate ways. Weiss went to San Francisco to try a different lifestyle. She later came back to New York and occasionally gave shows with the Shangri-Las during the 1970s which led to a comeback attempt with Sire Records in 1977. In 1989, the Shangri-Las reunited one last time for Cousin Brucie's Palisades Park Reunion show at The Meadowlands in New Jersey.  New career  Weiss took a job as purchasing agent in New York City in Manhattan, as she recalled, \\"I went to work for an architectural firm, and I was seriously into it. Then I got into commercial interiors, huge projects, buildings.\\" She later moved up to be the chief purchasing agent and ran the commercial furniture dealership. In the late 1980s, she managed a furniture store and was an interior designer. By 2001, she was a furniture consultant to New York businesses.  Going solo  In 2005, Weiss left her job in commercial interiors to get back to music. In March 2007, Norton Records released Dangerous Game, a critically acclaimed solo album, on which she was backed by The Reigning Sound. She has been performing elsewhere in the United States, and in Spain and France.

A. Salvatore's book series, The Hunter's Blades Trilogy. In this novel, Drizzt Do'Urden is mourning what he believes is the death of his closest friends. He is helped to regain his sense of purpose after two elves and their pegasus decide to help. He goes around killing orcs and preventing new clans from joining the army that has been gathering. While this happens, Drizzt's friends are fighting desperately against the horde. Plot summary In The Lone Drow, Drizzt Do'Urden is mourning what he believes to be the death of his closest friends. Drizzt only regains his sense of purpose after two elves (Tarathiel and Innovindil) and their two pegasi (Sunrise and Sunset) decide to help. The dwarven druid Pikel Bouldershoulders loses his left arm at the elbow by a piece of slate thrown by a frost giant. Tarathiel, however, meets his demise at the hands of King Obould Many-Arrows. Later the orc shaman Arganth Snarrl proclaims Obould a god. Meanwhile, the remaining Companions of the Hall, who survived the attack that Drizzt earlier witnessed, are fighting an increasingly desperate battle against Obould's forces. Reception The Lone Drow debuted on The New York Times bestseller list at number 7. Staff Reviewer Tom Gafkjen from d20zines.com awarded the book a \\"B\\" grade. He praised the well-written combat sequences (a point that was also acknowledged by Jackie Cassada when she commented on the first novel in the series) but he did not enjoy the repetitious writing about the character Drizzt brooding over the death of a moon elf. He noted the exceptional writing although preferring the first book of the trilogy. A similarly mixed review came from Publishers Weekly - while mostly negative, the reviewers acknowledged that the novel did (occasionally) rise above the cliché, and that \\"a few characters do achieve some complexity\\". Cassada, on the other hand, seemed taken by the second novel in the trilogy, praising the \\"tense battles, vivid landscapes and memorable characters\\". The Lone Drow debuted at #7 on the New York Times Best Seller list in October 2003. Publishers Weekly felt that The Lone Drow was clichéd, but that some of the characters did achieve \\"some complexity\\". They singled out two characters for praise: Innovindel, an elf who talks \\"pensively\\" of her long life in contrast to the short lived humans, and Obould the orc king.

Its form (and modern name) are derived from the Greek letter Koppa (Ϙ ϙ). Koppa was used as a numeral character in the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts, representing the value 90 (exactly as its Greek ancestor did). It was replaced relatively early by the Cyrillic letter Che (Ч ч), which is similar in appearance and originally had no numeric value. Isolated examples of Ч used as a numeral are found in the East and South Slavonic areas as early as the eleventh century, though Koppa continued in regular use into the fourteenth century. In some varieties of Western Cyrillic, however, Koppa was retained, and Ч used with the value 60, replacing the Cyrillic letter Ksi (Ѯ ѯ). Cyrillic Koppa never had a phonetic value and was never used as a letter by any national language using Cyrillic. However, certain modern textbooks and dictionaries of Old Church Slavonic language insert this character among other letters of the early Cyrillic alphabet, either between П and Р (to reproduce the Greek alphabetical order) or at the very end of the list.

After six months he abandoned his studies and returned to Sri Lanka, and changed his name to Ananda Samarakoon, embracing Buddhism. Then he served as the music teacher of Mahinda College, Galle from 1938 to 1942. =Composer= In 1937, the popular music of Sri Lanka consisted of songs derived from the North Indian Ragadhari music. These songs lyrics often contained meaningless phrases with little or no literary merit. Samarakone set out to create a form of a music that can be classified as Sri Lanka's own and came out with the song Ennada Menike (එන්නද මැණිකේ) (1940) that paved the foundation for the artistic Sinhala music. In 1940, he composed Namo Namo Mata to instill patriotism and love for one's country, in his students at Mahinda College.It was first sung by little Mahindians at the prestigious Olcott Hall. That song was later selected as the National anthem of Sri Lanka by the Sri Lankan government. The love themed song Endada Menike unfolds in the form of a dialogue between a young village boy and a girl. Poetic and beautifully rustic, it became a success and Samarakone followed it with a string of successful songs in the early to mid-1940s, the period considered his golden age. Among his best known works are: *Podimal Etano (පොඩීමල් එතනෝ) *Vilay Malak Pipila *Poson Pohoda *Asay madura *Sunila Guvanay *Punchi Suda *Nilvala Gangay *Sumano *Pudamu Kusum *Siri Saru Saara Ketay =Painter= In 1945 Samarakoon's only son died at the age of five, and the grieving Samarakoon left Sri Lanka for India where he pursued a painting career and held eleven art exhibitions there. Though his painting were critically acclaimed, he returned to music in 1951 back in Sri Lanka. =National anthem= One of Samarakoon's early compositions, Namo Namo Mata was nominated as the national anthem and was officially adopted as the national anthem of Ceylon on 22 November 1951, from a committee headed by Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne. Critics attacked Namo Namo Mata, particularly the \\"Gana\\" significance of the introductory words (Namo Namo Matha) which designate disease and ill luck. Samarakone was not a believer in \\"Gana\\" and the criticism caused him to write numerous articles counterattacking his critics to defend his composition. However, without his consent, the introductory words were changed to \\"Sri Lanka Mathaa\\" so that the \\"Gana\\" significance now would designate victory and prosperity. =Death= On 5 April 1962, at the age of fifty one, Samarakoon committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping tablets, and the motive is said to be because the lyrics of the Sri Lankan National Anthem was changed without his consent.

Their most successful recording was \\"A Lover's Concerto\\" (1965), which sold over two million copies and reached the number two spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Members The trio consisted of: * Barbara Harris (born Barbara Ann Harris, August 18, 1945, Elizabeth City, North Carolina), who sang lead most of the time. * Barbara Parritt (born October 1, 1944, Wilmington, North Carolina). * June Montiero (born July 1, 1946, Queens, New York). Career Barbara Harris started singing in her hometown churches at an early age and moved to Queens, New York at the age of eleven. In high school, Harris joined a group with four other young singers: Barbara Parritt (later Toomer), June Montiero, Betty Stokes and Betty Blocker. Stokes and Blocker eventually left the group, and Harris, Parritt and Montiero formed a trio. Bobby Uri, a manager and friend, named the group The Charlettes and got them work doing background vocals for several recording artists. At a talent show in Brooklyn, they met Eddy Chase, who in turn introduced them to manager Vince Marc and songwriter/recording executive Bob Crewe. The group became the Toys and landed their first recording contract on Crewe's DynoVoice Records. Marc introduced them to songwriters Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell. Linzer and Randell wrote most of the songs they recorded. They took a piano piece from a Bach exercise book (\\"Minuet in G major\\" by Christian Petzold), put a Motown bassline to it, and \\"A Lover's Concerto\\" was born; the song soon rose to number two on the U.S. charts. The band followed that up with another hit, \\"Attack!\\" also written by Linzer and Randell, which reached the Top 20. They also produced the group's 1965-66 recordings on the DynoVoice record label. Global sales of this disc exceeded two million copies, with a gold record awarded by the R.I.A.A. in 1965. Their first U.S. tour was with Gene Pitney. In 1967, the group changed labels and producers, moving to Pitney's label, Musicor Records, but charted only one more minor single (a cover of Brian Hyland's \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\") before breaking up. The Toys appeared on most of the major TV rock programs, like Hullabaloo and Shindig!.

Crawford was the named author of the book The Little Princesses, which told the story of her time with the royal family. After the book was published in 1950,Originally published in the UK by Cassell & Co Ltd and in the US by Harcourt, Brace and Company. Current US edition: The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny [sic], Marion Crawford. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2003. . The current US title is erroneous; Crawford is quite clear that she was never the \\"nanny\\" for the princesses (a position held by a woman named Clara Knight, called \\"Alla\\"), but was instead their governess, responsible for their education outside the nursery. Crawford was socially ostracised and left Nottingham Cottage, her grace and favour house, which had been granted to her for life. Neither the Queen nor any other member of the Royal Family ever spoke to her again. Early life and royal governess Crawford was born, the daughter of a mechanical engineer's clerk, at Gatehead, East Ayrshire, on 5 June 1909. She was raised in Dunfermline, Fife and taught at Edinburgh's Moray House Institute. While studying to become a child psychologist, she took a summer job as the governess for Lord Elgin's children. This led her to take a role in the household of the Duke and Duchess of York (later known as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), as the Duchess was a distant relative of Lord Elgin. After one year the arrangement was made permanent. Crawford became one of the governesses of Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. Following the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, the Duke of York ascended the throne as King George VI, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive. Crawford remained in service to the King and Queen, and did not retire until Princess Elizabeth's marriage in 1947, Crawford herself having married two months earlier. Crawford had already delayed her own marriage for 16 years so as not to, as she saw it, abandon the King and Queen. Retirement and authorship Upon her retirement in 1948, Crawford was given Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, as a grace and favour home. Queen Mary, the princess' grandmother, also provided it with antique furniture and flower prints as a mark of her appreciation. After their wedding, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh conducted an overseas tour, visiting Canada and the United States of America. Shortly afterwards, Bruce and Beatrice Gould, editors of the large circulation American magazine Ladies' Home Journal, contacted Buckingham Palace and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to seek stories for publication across the Atlantic. Although the approach was refused by the Palace, the British government proved keen on the idea and suggested Marion Crawford, as the recently retired governess of the princesses. In April 1949, having heard of the offer, Queen Elizabeth wrote to Crawford, saying: \\"I do feel, most definitely, that you should not write and sign articles about the children, as people in positions of confidence with us must be utterly oyster. If you, the moment you finished teaching Margaret, started writing about her and Lilibet, well, we should never feel confidence in anyone again.\\" However, the Queen did give a carefully qualified approval for her to anonymously provide some assistance, writing: \\"Mr Morrah (the man chosen to write the articles), who I saw the other day, seemed to think that you could help him with his articles and get paid from America. This would be quite all right as long as your name did not come into it. Nevertheless, I do feel most strongly that you must resist the allure of American money and persistent editors and say No No No to offers of dollars for articles about something as private and as precious as our family.\\" However, the contract with the Goulds stipulated: \\"You will further consider publication of the articles without Her Majesty's consent (possibly with only the consent of Princess Elizabeth, or no consent) and under your own name, on terms to be arranged.\\" In October 1949, Lady Astor sent a copy of the manuscript from the Goulds to Queen Elizabeth for her approval. The Queen was deeply distressed, finding it shockingly frank, especially Crawford's revelations of the King's moods and the Queen's chilly relationship with Wallis Simpson. She replied to Lady Astor saying: \\"The governess has gone off her head\\", and had her private secretary send a further letter to Lady Astor. This contained the Queen's annotations on the manuscript with the request that passages of particular concern be removed. The Goulds were taken aback as they considered the account sympathetic, but they kept the response from Crawford. The first intimation Crawford had that something was wrong was when she did not receive a Christmas card that year from the Palace. Crawford's unauthorised work was published in Woman's Own in the UK and in the Ladies' Home Journal in the United States, becoming a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic. A book, The Little Princesses, also sold exceptionally well. Later she wrote stories about Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She also put her name to Woman's Own's \\"Crawfie's Column\\", a social diary written by journalists several weeks in advance. As the first servant to cash in on the private lives of the royals, Crawford was ostracised by the royal family, and they never spoke to her again. Later life and death Courtiers believed that Crawford was deeply under the influence of her husband George Buthlay whom she married after her retirement, and that he pressured her to capitalise on her royal connections, as he himself did. Buthlay boasted of it in his business transactions, and had her ask the royal family to change their bank account to Drummonds, the bank for which he worked. Crawford's writing career came to a crashing halt when the column to which her name was attached was exposed as a fraud. It carried details of a Trooping the Colour ceremony and the Ascot races, when in fact they had been cancelled that year because of a strike. As the stories were written in advance, it was too late to stop their publication. Crawford retired to Aberdeen, buying a house from the road to Balmoral. Although the royal family regularly drove past her front door on their way to Balmoral Castle, they never visited. When her husband died in 1977, she descended into depression and attempted suicide, leaving a note saying: \\"The world has passed me by and I can't bear those I love to pass me by on the road.\\" Crawford died at Hawkhill House (a nursing home in Aberdeen) on 11 February 1988. Neither the Queen, the Queen Mother nor Princess Margaret sent a wreath to her funeral. Her story was featured in a 2000 Channel 4 documentary The Nanny Who Wouldn't Keep Mum.

Bennett was a member of the girl group The Ronettes, along with her sister Ronnie and cousin Nedra Talley. Early life Bennett and her sister, Veronica (later known as Ronnie Bennett), grew up in New York City. They were children of an Irish-American father and African-American/Cherokee mother; they said they were bullied at school because of being light-skinned African Americans. Bennett attended George Washington High School in Manhattan where she was valedictorian. Studious and interested in fashion, she studied at Manhattan's Fashion Institute of Technology. Career When Bennett was 14, she and her sister Ronnie, and their cousin Nedra Talley started singing together. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, the trio reinvented themselves as the Ronettes. Signed up by 23-year-old Phil Spector, Ronnie was made lead, with Estelle and Nedra as backing. The Ronettes broke up in 1966. Bennett recorded a single for Laurie Records, \\"The Year 2000/The Naked Boy\\". She quit the music business and was rarely seen afterwards. In 2007, when the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it was decided that she was too fragile to perform with them. She spoke two brief sentences during her acceptance speech: \\"I would just like to say, thank you very much for giving us this award. I'm Estelle of the Ronettes, thank you.\\" She did, however, come back onstage for a final bow with the rest of the Ronettes after the performance of \\"Be My Baby\\". Personal life and death Bennett dated musicians Mick Jagger and George Harrison. She married the group's road manager, Joe Dong, and they had a daughter, Toyin. Her mental health deteriorated in the following years. It was reported that, during a visit to fellow former Ronette Nedra Talley, she slept through her own baby daughter's crying. She was reported to have had periods of homelessness, during which she would approach strangers in the streets of New York, telling people that she would be singing with the Ronettes in a jazz club. Bennett died of colon cancer, aged 67, in Englewood, New Jersey. Her body was discovered on February 11, 2009. A week after her death, it was revealed that she had suffered from anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia in the years after the Ronettes' breakup and that she had subsequently been homeless in New York.

She is of African American, Native American and Puerto Rican descent. In 2007, the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1967, Talley and Estelle Bennett left the Ronettes, reportedly due in part to interference from the group's producer Phil Spector, who later married Ronnie Bennett. Talley said that when she met Scott Ross, her future husband, she became a born-again Christian. Talley also decided to leave the Ronettes because she felt there was little place for Christian-inspired music. In 1977, Talley recorded several Christian songs written by her church's music director, Ted Sandquist. These were released on the album The Courts of the King: The Worship Music of Ted Sandquist. One of the cuts, a medley, \\"Love of My Lord\\" / \\"Redwood Tree\\" was released as a 45 promo single. Guitarist Phil Keaggy played on at least two of the album cuts with her. For its 30th anniversary, this album was finally released on CD. In 1978, Talley recorded Full Circle, a solo contemporary Christian music album, on which she was musically backed by Keaggy. The album was produced by her husband, Ross. The album's inner sleeve featured Talley's bio (and salvation story), but also a photo taken in the mid-'60s aboard a plane with Talley and fellow Ronette, Estelle Bennett, sharing seats with The Beatles' John Lennon and George Harrison, who were great fans of the Ronettes. The album has to date, never been re-released.

He is known under the pseudonyms Daniel à Jesu, Hermannus Loemelius, and George White (also Annosus Fidelis Verimentanus, Flud, and the initials J. R.) under which he published. He was known both as a preacher and teacher, and was frequently arrested in England. Life He was a brother of Henry Floyd, and was born in Cambridgeshire in 1572. After studying in the school of the English Jesuits at Eu, Normandy, he was admitted on 17 March 1588 to the English College, Reims, where he studied humanities and philosophy. Next he went to the English College, Rome, admitted there 9 October 1590, and joined the Society of Jesus on 1 November 1592. On 18 August 1593 Floyd received minor orders, at Reims or Douai, and on the 22nd of the same month he was sent back to the English College at Rome with nine companions, where he taught philosophy and theology, and became known as a preacher. In 1609 he became a professed father of the Jesuit order. He worked for a long time on the English mission. Having visited Edward Oldcorne in Worcester gaol in 1606, he was detained, and he was unable either by entreaties or bribes to escape Sir John Popham. After a year's imprisonment he was sent into exile with forty-six other priests, and he spent four years in preaching at St. Omer and composing controversial works. Then he returned to England, where he was often captured, and frequently contrived to pay off the pursuivants. His last years were spent at Leuven, where he was professor of theology. He died suddenly at St. Omer on 15 September 1649.

Poem of the End (usually given in English without an article) is the best known poem by Russian poet Vasilisk Gnedov. One of the most radically experimental poets of Russian Futurism, Gnedov's Poem of the End consisted of its title alone on a blank page. Gnedov would perform the poem on stage using a silent gesture. The collection from which it came, Death to Art (1913), contained fifteen very short poems that gradually reduced in size from one line, to one word, one letter, and ultimately to Poem of the End. The poem has been compared to Kazimir Malevich's painting Black Square (1915), John Cage's silent composition 4'33\\" (1952), and to Minimalism in general. A \\"recreation\\" of the performance of the poem was realized in 2007 by Miguel Molina, and released on cd by Recommended Records (ReR Megacorp) in a limited edition of 150 in 2009. The recording for the cd consists of approximately one hour of \\"silence\\" as captured via a wax cylinder, a recording device appropriate to the time. The Poem of the End (with \\"The\\" in the title) is a major poem by the White Russian symbolist poet Marina Tsvetaeva. Written in Prague in 1924, the poem details the end of a passionate affair with Konstantin Boeslavovich Rozdevitch, a former military officer.

He was 26 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, (Victoria), Australian Imperial Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 8–9 August 1915, at Lone Pine, Gallipoli, Turkey, Symons was in command of a section of newly captured trenches and repelled several counter-attacks with great coolness. An enemy attack on an isolated sap early in the morning resulted in six officers becoming casualties and part of the sap being lost, but Symons retook it, shooting two Turks. The sap was then attacked from three sides and this officer managed, in the face of heavy fire, to build a barricade. On the enemy setting fire to the head cover, he extinguished it and rebuilt the barricade. His coolness and determination finally compelled the enemy to withdraw. (Victoria Cross) On 2 February 1916, Lt. Col. (later Major-General) Harold (Pompey) Elliott, commanding the 7th Battalion, wrote to his wife Kate about the action at Lone Pine when the 7th won four Victoria Crosses, including Symons. He describes the infiltration of the Australian trenches by the attacking Turks and the exchange of shots and grenades. Captain Bastin was shot through the arm and stretchered out of the trench but the Turks entered the trench a second time. Elliott writes that when the Australian's waivered he got together a few fresh men and placed Symons in charge with the order to charge the Turks at bayonet point. In a trench described as being full of dead men, blood and brains, Symons succeeded to Elliott's admiration.McMullin, Ross, Pompey Elliott at War - In his own word, Scribe, Brunswick Victoria, 2017, p. 114 Even though Elliot promoted the bravery of his men, he was concerned about being over looked for his promotion and awards. Whilst on English convalescence leave an interested King George V presented Symons with his VC. Symons told the King about the action and the award of four Victoria Crosses. During the conversation he asked why Elliott has never been even mentioned in dispatches after being through the Gallipoli campaign and been wounded. The King’s secretary took Elliot’s name and in his letter to Kate, on 18 February 1916, Elliott announced his promotion to Brigadier-General. Symons later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel during the Second World War. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia.

Continuity Star Trek spin-off fiction frequently fills in \\"gaps\\" within the televised show, often making use of backstage information or popular fan belief. Although officially licensed spin-off material will often maintain continuity within itself (particularly within books by the same authors), elements often contradict each other irreconcilably. For example, the end of Kirk's five-year mission has been depicted in several different incompatible ways. Much fiction is set in a second five-year mission of Kirk's Enterprise, which the Okuda chronology dates after Star Trek: The Motion Picture (although novels often placed it before). Backstories and fates of characters are often elaborated on, an example being Leonard McCoy's divorced status, and his daughter, Joanna, originally intended to appear in what became the TOS episode \\"The Way to Eden\\". Several original series characters are established as still being alive in the TNG era, including McCoy, Spock, and Scotty. In the books written by William Shatner, these are joined by a revived Captain Kirk. Several novels depict the careers of the younger members of the Enterprise crew after Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Captain Sulu and his daughter Demora Sulu appear in Peter David's novel The Captain's Daughter. In the novel The Sundered, Chekov serves as Sulu's first officer on . The novel Federation has Chekov eventually becoming an admiral. Uhura is shown, in the novel Catalyst of Sorrows, to be Chief of Starfleet Intelligence in 2360. The 2006 novel Vulcan's Soul: Exiles has an Admiral Pavel Chekov, and Uhura is still serving as head of Starfleet Intelligence in 2377, at the age of 138. Peter David's novel Imzadi explores the backstory between Riker and Troi, and its sequel Triangle: Imzadi II covers the cooling of the Worf/Troi relationship, which was left unexplained on screen. Spin-off fiction will often use re-use characters who appeared only once or twice in the actual show. Dr. Selar has appeared in more TNG novels than television episodes, and she and Elizabeth Shelby, who appeared in the two-part episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" are major characters in the Star Trek: New Frontier series. The cast of the Starfleet Corps of Engineers series largely comes from such guest parts. Similarly, the IKS Gorkon series features Klingon characters drawn from a variety of TNG and DS9 episodes. The spin-off fiction has also engaged in world building. Novels in the 1980s by Diane Duane and John M. Ford established a complex backstory and culture for the Romulans (Rihannsu) and Klingons respectively, which were later not taken up by TNG. Technical and reference manuals A large range of fictional reference books have been produced over the years. More recent books of this sort have been by production staff and, whilst not binding on the series, nonetheless reflect the thinking of the production office, and are used as sourcebooks by writers. *The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual (Franz Joseph, 1975) *Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology (Fred & Stan Goldstein, with Rick Sternbach, 1980) *The Klingon Dictionary (Marc Okrand, 1985 (1st ed.), 1992 (2nd ed.)) *Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise (Shane Johnson, 1987) *Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach, 1991) *Star Trek Chronology (Michael & Denise Okuda, 1993, 1996) *Star Trek Encyclopedia (Michael & Denise Okuda, Debbie Mirek, 1994, 1996, 1999) *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual (Rick Sternbach, Herman Zimmerman, Doug Drexler, 1998) *Star Trek Star Charts (Geoffrey Mandel, 2002) Similar material has also been published in the Star Trek Fact Files and the Star Trek Magazine. Prose fiction Since 1967, hundreds of original novels, short stories, and television and movie adaptations have been published. The first original Star Trek novel to be published was Mission to Horatius by Mack Reynolds, which was published in hardcover by Whitman Books in 1968. Geared for younger readers, the novel became a collectible and in the 1990s, Pocket Books issued a facsimile edition. The first publisher of Star Trek fiction aimed at adult readers was Bantam Books, which initially produced a bestselling series of novelizations of the original 79 episodes by James Blish that began in 1967. Later adaptations were done by Blish's wife, J. A. Lawrence, some of these were credited to Blish with others appearing under Lawrence's name. In 1970, Blish wrote the first original novel published by Bantam, Spock Must Die!, although subsequent novels did not appear until 1976. From 1974, Ballantine Books published a 10-volume series of novelizations based upon episodes of Star Trek: The Animated Series, all written by Alan Dean Foster. Bantam also published a number of fotonovels based on episodes. In the late 1970s, Bantam published a number of original Star Trek novels, including two written by noted science fiction author Joe Haldeman, and one by original series scriptwriter David Gerrold. Pocket Books began publishing Star Trek fiction in 1979, starting with a novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture by Gene Roddenberry himself, although the company's second Trek novel did not appear until 1981 due to Bantam being allowed to complete its publishing contract first. Eventually, Pocket Books would publish novels based upon every Trek series. From around 1987 and with the debut of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Paramount took a closer role in supervising the books, disallowing story elements that were said to conflict with Gene Roddenberry's idea of Star Trek. In particular, recurring characters between books were discouraged, as was the use of concepts introduced in The Animated Series. This era saw disputes between authors and the Star Trek production office – specifically Roddenberry's \\"assistant\\", Richard Arnold – with many novels being rejected for not focusing directly on the main TOS cast. Some novels were, in lieu of rejection, heavily edited, resulting in being disowned publicly by their authors, such as with the novel Probe by Margaret Wander Bonanno. A change of personnel at the Star Trek offices in the early 1990s – specifically the firing of Arnold immediately following the death of Gene Roddenberry in 1991 – led to a relaxation of policies regarding tie-in novels. Under editor John J. Ordover, many authors including Bonanno returned as Star Trek novelists in the 2000s after encouragement from fans, which continued under later editor Marco Palmieri, who has admitted being unaware of any prior blacklisting of authors resulting from the period of interference from Richard Arnold. Prolific Star Trek novelists include Peter David, Diane Carey, Keith R.A. DeCandido, J.M. Dillard, Diane Duane, Michael Jan Friedman, and Judith and Garfield Reeves- Stevens. Several actors and writers from the television series have written books: William Shatner has written a series with the Reeves-Stevenses featuring a revived Captain Kirk in the 24th century, and John de Lancie, Andrew J. Robinson, J. G. Hertzler, and Armin Shimerman have written or co- written books featuring their respective characters. Voyager producer Jeri Taylor wrote two novels featuring backstory for Voyager characters, and screen authors David Gerrold, D. C. Fontana, and Melinda Snodgrass have also penned books. The Reeves-Stevenses were later hired as writers for Enterprise. None of the Star Trek novels are considered \\"canon\\", meaning that producers of the television series feel free to contradict events and facts from the novels (although Pocket Books coordinates with the Star Trek offices to minimize the chances of this happening).For example, the character of Commander Shelby was effectively \\"reserved\\" for the New Frontier series, and after her name was dropped in a DS9 episode, producer Ronald D. Moore \\"sheepish[ly ...] explained\\" this to Pocket and Licensing. Paula Block, director of CBS Consumer Products, is quoted in Voyages of the Imagination as saying, \\"Jeri Taylor's books were considered quasi-canon for a while because our licensees really wanted some sort of background structure\\". =New series= Starting from the mid-1990s, several ranges of books were created based upon original continuing characters and situations set in the Star Trek universe. The first of these, Star Trek: New Frontier by Peter David, focuses on the crew of the starship Excalibur. Some characters in this series were guest stars from episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, while others were from previous Star Trek titles by the same author, and still others were created originally for the series. New Frontier takes place in Sector 221-G, where the Excalibur is dispatched to help with the chaos created by the crumbling Thallonian Empire. Michael Jan Friedman's Stargazer series features the adventures of Captain Picard on the Stargazer, and reuses characters he established in his 1992 TNG novel Reunion. Another series, Star Trek: Challenger, created by Pocket editor John J. Ordover and writer Diane Carey, was planned as a continuation of the six-book storyline Star Trek: New Earth. Thus far only one book in the series has been published, Chainmail, part of the Gateways crossover series. The Starfleet Corps of Engineers series is a series of eBooks by various authors, set in the same general time frame as the Next Generation series. This series features a group of highly trained engineers stationed aboard and their adventures on various planets. The eBooks are eventually released in paperback collections. No new Corps of Engineers novels have been published since 2007. From 2005 to 2012, a Star Trek: Vanguard series ran, set on Starbase 47, known as \\"Vanguard\\". It is set during The Original Series, and attempts to flesh out that particular period of fictional Star Trek history. I.K.S. Gorkon was a brief series of novels by Keith R. A. DeCandido, the first Star Trek novel series to feature the Klingons instead of Starfleet. This series tells of the adventures of an all-new Qang (Chancellor)-class war cruiser, on a mission to conquer new planets for the Klingon Empire. The series grew from DeCandido's TNG Ambassador Worf-focused novel Diplomatic Implausibility. =Relaunch series= Pocket Books has also depicted events after the end of television series, allowing greater freedom in storytelling. The Deep Space Nine relaunch takes place after the end of the series. New characters have been added to compensate for the loss of those who left at the end of the show. (Some books published after the end of the series, but before the official relaunch stories began, have been retroactively added to the relaunch, including the anthology The Lives of Dax and the novel A Stitch in Time. The Star Trek: Voyager relaunch series, written by Christie Golden, is set after the end of the Voyager series. In the final episode of the series, \\"Endgame\\", the characters return home, and the books deal with their homecoming and further adventures. After the release of the movie Star Trek Nemesis, which sees William Riker about to take command of a new ship, , the Star Trek: Titan series was launched, depicting these adventures. As of 2014, several books have been set post-Nemesis, including several books dealing with the Borg. The Enterprise series was also relaunched (see Star Trek: Enterprise relaunch), starting with the novel The Good That Men Do. The Enterprise novel Last Full Measure retcons the death of Trip, recounted in \\"These Are the Voyages...\\". Trip's death is shown in a holodeck program in the time frame of the TNG episode \\"The Pegasus\\", and The Good That Men Do establishes that the historical record has been altered. Nine Star Trek novels, in the form of three thematic trilogies, have been written by William Shatner with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. These novels, starting with the second book, feature a Captain Kirk revived after Star Trek Generations. However, these novels are set in a different continuity to the rest of the Star Trek novels, receiving the nickname the Shatnerverse. A fourth Shatner/Reeves-Stevens trilogy, focusing on Kirk's time at Starfleet Academy and based on an idea pitched to Paramount for a TV series was launched in October 2007. =Crossover events= The Star Trek book ranges have since the mid-1990s featured various crossover events, with books published in multiple series. The first of these was the Invasion! series, published in 1996, featuring entries from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager series. 1997's event was the Day of Honor, with novels in all four series. In a rare example of a novel concept being adopted into the TV series, the Voyager episode \\"Day of Honor\\" tied into this. 1998 saw six books published in the Star Trek: The Captain's Table crossover, including the four regular series, as well as one from Star Trek: New Frontier and another based on Captain Pike, the captain from the original Star Trek pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\". An anthology, entitled Tales from the Captain's Table, was published in 2005 following up the concept, with tales from new captains. 1999's Double Helix was a six-book series, nominally part of the numbered TNG book range, featuring characters from TNG, DS9, TOS, Voyager, New Frontier, and Stargazer. The Star Trek: Gateways crossover was published in 2001, featuring entries from TOS, Challenger, TNG, DS9, Voyager, and New Frontier. These stories all end in a single finale anthology, What Lay Beyond. 2001's Star Trek: Section 31 was a thematic crossover, with each of the four books (TOS, TNG, DS9, and Voyager) featuring Section 31. Later in 2014, Section 31 became a standalone DS9 spinoff series of its own with the novel Disavowed. In 2003, Star Trek: The Lost Era began exploring the underutilized part of the Star Trek timeline between Kirk's death in Star Trek Generations and the start of Star Trek: The Next Generation. =Short story collections= Various collections of Star Trek short stories have been published by Pocket Books. The Strange New Worlds competition, open to entries from the public, runs annually, and results in the publication of an anthology featuring the winning short stories. Pocket has also published themed original short story anthologies, including: *The Lives of Dax (1999, stories for each incarnation of Dax) *Enterprise Logs (2000, a collection of stories about various captains of ships named Enterprise) *No Limits (2002, a New Frontier anthology, featuring the first stories to focus on NF characters that were not written by Peter David) *Prophecy and Change (2003, a 10th anniversary DS9 anthology) *Tales of the Dominion War (2004, featuring various characters and the Dominion War) *Tales from The Captain's Table (2005, featuring stories by new captains from the Captain's Table) *Distant Shores (2005, a 10th anniversary Voyager anthology) *Constellations (2006, a 40th anniversary TOS anthology) *The Sky's the Limit, (2007, a 20th anniversary TNG anthology) =Status= A small but vocal minority of fans consider the novels to be fan fiction, although, being publications authorized by Paramount Pictures, they do not fit the general definition. A number of novels have been written or co-written by series actors, such as John de Lancie, J. G. Hertzler, Andrew J. Robinson, William Shatner, and Armin Shimerman. There have also been many unlicensed, privately published works which do fit the definition of fan fiction, such as The Doctor and the Enterprise by Jean Airey which merged the universes of Star Trek and Doctor Who, or writings referred to as \\"Mary Sue\\" stories featuring the author and their personal acquaintances as major characters in the plot of their stories. Comics Almost continuously since 1967, a number of companies have published comic book series based on Star Trek and its spin-off series. =Whitman 1967–1979= Gold Key The initial publisher of Star Trek comic adaptations and tie-in comics was Gold Key, part of Whitman Publishing. The series ran for 61 issues between July 1967 until March 1979, and is noted for the first nine issues of the series being published with photo covers, made up from promotional photographs supplied by Paramount, some of which were taken from various episodes of the original series. Although Gold Key never gave creative credits in the pages of their comics, Len Wein, Arnold Drake, George Kashdan, Marty Pasko and Doug Drexler are known to have worked on numerous issues of the books, and have since come forth and identified which issues they specifically worked on. The first two issues of the Gold Key run was illustrated by Italian artist Nevio Zaccara, and the first half of the series was drawn by Alberto Giolitti, who being based in Rome did not see any of the Star Trek TV episodes until several years after he retired. The remainder of the series was illustrated by Alden McWilliams, with a few fill-ins by George Kashdan. Gold Key and Whitman ceased publishing in 1979, with Star Trek No. 61 being one of the last comics produced by the company, and one issue in pre-production that never saw print. Enterprise Log Series Golden Press, another division of Western Publishing, reprinted several of the Gold Key Star Trek comics in four volumes. Entitled Enterprise Logs, these four books reprinted the first 35 issues between 1976 and 1977, and included some new material as part of a Psycho-Files feature in the first and third volumes. Dan Curtis In 1974, Dan Curtis produced a set of nine 6\\" x 3\\", 22-page color miniature comics. These were intended to be sold with bubble gum, like baseball cards, and each comic reprinted a story from one of the Gold Key comics. The set has been listed since 1977 as \\"Dan Curtis Reprints\\" in the \\"Giveaway Comics\\" section of Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. Dynabrite Whitman also produced a series of 16 different comic reprints between 1978 and 1979 under the Dynabrite banner. These were 10\\" x 7-1/8\\" reprints of several of the Gold Key issues, with cardboard covers with blank inside covers. Gold Key Reprints In 2004, Checker Book Publishing Group was granted license from Paramount to reprint the Gold Key Star Trek comics in volumes under the name Star Trek: The Key Collection. Note that these new reprint editions do not contain the new material that was created especially for the previous Enterprise Log reprint editions, such as the Psycho-Files or Scotty's Diary. As of May 2007, seven editions have been printed, with the eighth edition expected in 2010 but as of this writing had not been scheduled. =UK newspaper strip= A weekly strip ran in the United Kingdom from 1969 to 1973 in the pages of TV21. Added as part of a revamp of the popular British magazine by City Publications, the strip ran for 118 issues, ending with the December 29, 1973 issue. Creators for this strip included numerous artists who worked on other TV21 and Valiant Magazine strips, such as Harry Lindfield, Mike Noble, Roland Turner, Carlos Pino, and Jim Baikie. =Marvel 1979–1982= In 1979, with the launch of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Marvel started publishing Star Trek comics, starting with an adaptation of that movie by Marv Wolfman and Dave Cockrum. Through a misunderstanding between Paramount and Marvel, the writers had been misinformed that they could not use any previously used characters from the TV series or the movie except for the main crew of the Enterprise. The series only lasted a total of 18 issues, ending in 1981 with Marvel choosing not to renew the license. =Newspaper strip 1979–1983= A newspaper strip, initially written and illustrated by Thomas Warkentin also ran from 1979 to 1983, and was syndicated by the Los Angeles Times Mirror Syndicate. Warkentin stayed with the series until April 1981, penning a total of eight tales. During his tenure, Warkentin was aided by artists Mark Rice, Dan Spiegle, and Ron Harris. Among the highlights of Wartenkin's strips was his final story, a Harry Mudd adventure featuring his view of a rare glimpse at the news media of the Star Trek universe. During the series remaining fifteen months, creative teams changed twice, beginning with writer Marty Pasko and artist Padraic Shigetani, with Bob Myers replacing Shigetani. The strip concluded with Gerry Conway and Dick Kulpa sharing writing credit, with Ernie Colón handling the art. =DC Comics 1984–1996= After the release of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, DC Comics became the Star Trek comic licensee, publishing stories from 1984 set in the movie era (see Star Trek DC comics). In 1988, the series ended when Paramount withdrew its license at the advice of Richard Arnold following a series of disputes between Arnold and DC Comics, specifically with the comic's main author, Peter David. After a year's hiatus DC's second Star Trek series was launched with an adaptation of Star Trek V. Original stories took place in the large gap between Star Trek V and Star Trek VI, but did not continue from the previous series, so storylines from that series were either ignored or rewritten. Although more limited in scope than the first series due to restrictions from Paramount – which included a prohibition by Richard Arnold against the creation and use of original and non-series-related ongoing characters in the comic stories – and the controversial removal of Peter David as head writer, the series still lasted 80 issues. Howard Weinstein, who like David was also a Star Trek novelist, took over writing the comic with issue No. 20, and used the opportunity to flesh-out some of the changes between Star Trek V and VI, such as Sulu's promotion to captain of the Excelsior. DC also published Star Trek: The Next Generation comics, starting with a mini-series in 1988. An ongoing monthly series was launched from October 1989, and was mainly written by Star Trek: The Next Generation novelist Michael Jan Friedman. The series would run until 1996, when DC chose not to renew the license due to declining sales and an increase in licensing fees from Paramount. =Malibu 1993–1995= Beginning in 1993, Malibu Comics published an ongoing series based upon Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Before DC Comics' relinquishing the license, Malibu and DC worked together to publish a DS9/TNG crossover comic. In addition, Malibu also published an annual and several one- shot special issues of the DS9 comic, and reportedly was preparing a Star Trek: Voyager comic that later saw print after the merger with Marvel Comics in 1996. =Marvel 1996–1998= As part of the merger with Malibu Comics in 1996, Marvel obtained the Star Trek license, publishing comics under the \\"Marvel Paramount Comics\\" banner. Helping to launch the franchise were the comic adaptation of the film Star Trek: First Contact and the one-shot crossover Star Trek/X-Men. The quarterly Star Trek Unlimited series covered TOS and TNG. Marvel published monthly comics based upon Deep Space Nine and Voyager. They also introduced two new series, Star Trek: Early Voyages which dealt with Captain Pike's adventures as captain of the Enterprise (as depicted in the rejected TOS pilot \\"The Cage\\") and Star Trek: Starfleet Academy which dealt with a group of cadets, including Deep Space Nine's Ferengi, Nog. Finally, a five-issue limited series, Star Trek: Untold Voyages, followed Kirk on his second five-year mission following the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (similarly to the first Marvel series, but ignoring the original comics' stories). The ongoing series were canceled in 1998 due to sales being below expectations, with Early Voyages leaving an unresolved story by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. =Wildstorm 1999–2002= Wildstorm were the next licensee. Wildstorm decided to not do an ongoing series, but instead a series of miniseries and trade paperback graphic novels from 1999 onwards. Writers included Nathan Archer, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith, Keith R.A. DeCandido. Scott Ciencin, Kevin J. Anderson, K. W. Jeter, John Ordover and David Mack. Due to poor sales and issues involving Wildstorm's merger with DC Comics, the license was allowed to expire in 2002 without renewal. =Tokyopop 2004–= In October 2004, Tokyopop announced plans to publish an anthology of Next Generation-based stories presented in the style of Japanese manga. Since then, the company has produced several anthologies of Star Trek manga stories starting in 2006 with Shinsei Shinsei. The first two books contained five manga stories and a prose short story from a recently released anthology by Pocket Books, with Pocket printing a manga story in the respective anthology to cross promote both companies products. The third book featured four, slightly longer, manga stories and an extra from a recent Pocket anthology of short novels. Tokyopop originally planned their first book to be a collection of tales in the Star Trek: The Next Generation era but at the bequest of Paramount they chose to develop a Star Trek: The Original Series book instead, to be released for The Original Series' 40th Anniversary. After publishing their third TOS manga book the company announced plans for two TNG anthologies in late 2008 and early 2009. The first TNG book was delayed and saw publication in April 2009. =IDW Publishing= On November 9, 2006, IDW Publishing announced that they had secured the publishing rights to Star Trek from CBS Consumer Products. IDW's first title was the six-issue miniseries, The Space Between, written by David Tischman and drawn by Casey Maloney. IDW followed up with the series Star Trek: Klingons: Blood Will Tell, along with other mini-series and one-shots, and is still regularly publishing new Star Trek-based material. Games =Star Fleet Universe= Developed over the last two decades and more as an expansive development of the background as supplied in the Original Series as well as in The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual, the Star Fleet Universe introduces a range of new races and storylines (such as the Interstellar Concordium and the General War) as well as drawing from the Animated Series for inspiration – a modified version of the Kzinti are a major part of the SFU, for example – unlike the Paramount universe. This universe lives and thrives in the range of works from Amarillo Design Bureau Inc. and (formerly) Task Force Games, as well as providing a fount for the unique merging of Star Trek continuities seen in the Star Fleet Command series of PC games.

The attraction regularly selected 10 volunteers from the audience and placed them into a Star Trek story line. The participants were dressed in Star Trek costumes and placed on sets, and coached to deliver scripted dialogue in several scenes. The scenes, which were recorded on video by Lilly, were quickly edited into a short film, the storyline of which was loosely based around material from the Star Trek films. The finished video was then shown to the audience, and the \\"actors\\" had the opportunity to purchase a copy of their video. This attraction closed after several years of operation. Several copies of these videos had been seen YouTube. Great American Adventure Amusement Park, Santa Clara near San Jose, Calif. : In the '80's Paramount Pictures Inc. bought the theme park operating company, Great American Theme Parks. After this corporate owner's change, the San Jose property added many major Star Trek elements to entertain the park's patrons. There were several costumed Star Trek characters entertaining patrons near the large Star Trek transplanted movie sets brought up from the studio. A Klingon starship command bridge and other interior set elements along with other Star Trek sets were delivered and installed in this property. There were costumed Star Trek characters 'meeting and greeting' the parks visitors. Fan productions Several fan-made or unofficial films have been produced, using Star Trek characters or settings. Notable examples include: *Starship Exeter, made in the style of the 1960s original series and set on a sister ship of the Enterprise. *Star Trek: Phase II, formerly known as Star Trek: New Voyages, which depicts the fourth year of Kirk's five-year mission. George Takei and Walter Koenig have made guest appearances, and D. C. Fontana, original series script editor and writer, has written an episode. *Star Trek: Of Gods and Men, directed by Tim Russ and featuring many Star Trek actors, produced as a \\"gift\\" to the fans.

It forms part of the Wicklow Mountains and is a popular spot with hillwalkers. At the top of the head is a concrete cross which was placed there in 1950 during the holy year. Every Good Friday, hundreds of local people climb to the top of the head in a Good Friday procession marking the stations of the Cross as they go along, with the final station being held at the holy year cross. The headland and adjacent lands were designated under a Special Amenity Area Order in March 2008. The most direct way to reach the cross at the top (about 190m above sea level) is via an ascending footpath that begins just outside the free car park on the lower, northern slopes, to the south of Bray Esplanade. This is a half- hour walk for a fit person. The footpath, after the initial section with cut steps, is a rough path formed by rainwater and ascending through natural woodland. A more gradual route can be taken from the Southern Cross, by Bray Golf Club, which is easier underfoot. There is also a route which ascends from the Greystones side of the cliff walk; this route leads quite directly up the east side of the hill and as a result is quite steep, Upon reaching the top you can then walk the path along to the cross. The Dublin-Wicklow railway line runs outside of Bray Head along the coast, sometimes travelling within feet of the cliffs. This line, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is referred to as Brunel's Folly, due to the ongoing maintenance costs associated with maintaining a cliff-face line. The line had to be diverted on three occasions in 1876, 1879, and 1917. A serious accident occurred on 9 August 1867 when a passenger train derailed on nearby Brandy Hole Viaduct, causing the deaths of two passengers. The rail trip between Dublin and Bray Daly railway station, the nearest station to Bray Head, takes approximately 45 minutes. On the morning of the 14th of April 2012 a waterspout was observed just off the coast of Bray Head. The slate sea-cliffs at Bray Head have been established as a minor rock-climbing location since the 1970s, though a few of the climbs were originally recorded in the 1940s. The 2009 guidebook lists 27 single-pitch climbs, generally in the lower grades, up to HVS.

These methods sample from the environment, like Monte Carlo methods, and perform updates based on current estimates, like dynamic programming methods. While Monte Carlo methods only adjust their estimates once the final outcome is known, TD methods adjust predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future before the final outcome is known. (A revised version is available on Richard Sutton's publication page ) This is a form of bootstrapping, as illustrated with the following example: : > \\"Suppose you wish to predict the weather for Saturday, and you have some > model that predicts Saturday's weather, given the weather of each day in the > week. In the standard case, you would wait until Saturday and then adjust > all your models. However, when it is, for example, Friday, you should have a > pretty good idea of what the weather would be on Saturday – and thus be able > to change, say, Saturday's model before Saturday arrives.\\" Temporal difference methods are related to the temporal difference model of animal learning.  Mathematical formulation  The tabular TD(0) method is one of the simplest TD methods. It is a special case of more general stochastic approximation methods. It estimates the state value function of a finite-state Markov decision process (MDP) under a policy pi. Let V^pi denote the state value function of the MDP with states (s_t)_{tinmathbb{N}}, rewards (r_t)_{tinmathbb{N}} and discount rateDiscount rate parameter allows for a time preference toward more immediate rewards, and away from distant future rewards gamma under the policy pi : :V^pi(s) = E_{a sim pi}left{sum_{t=0}^infty gamma^tr_t(a_t)Bigg s_0=sright}. We drop the action from the notion for convenience. V^pi satisfies the Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman Equation: : V^pi(s)=E_{pi}{r_0 + gamma V^pi(s_1)s_0=s}, so r_0 + gamma V^pi(s_1) is an unbiased estimate for V^pi(s). This observation motivates the following algorithm for estimating V^pi. The algorithm starts by initializing a table V(s) arbitrarily, with one value for each state of the MDP. A positive learning rate alpha is chosen. We then repeatedly evaluate the policy pi, obtain a reward r and update the value function for the old state using the rule: : V(s) leftarrow V(s) + alpha(overbrace{r + gamma V(s')}^{text{The TD target}} - V(s) ) where s and s'are the old and new states, respectively. The value r + gamma V(s') is known as the TD target.  TD-Lambda  TD-Lambda is a learning algorithm invented by Richard S. Sutton based on earlier work on temporal difference learning by Arthur Samuel. This algorithm was famously applied by Gerald Tesauro to create TD-Gammon, a program that learned to play the game of backgammon at the level of expert human players. The lambda (lambda) parameter refers to the trace decay parameter, with 0 leqslant lambda leqslant 1. Higher settings lead to longer lasting traces; that is, a larger proportion of credit from a reward can be given to more distant states and actions when lambda is higher, with lambda = 1 producing parallel learning to Monte Carlo RL algorithms.  TD algorithm in neuroscience  The TD algorithm has also received attention in the field of neuroscience. Researchers discovered that the firing rate of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) appear to mimic the error function in the algorithm. The error function reports back the difference between the estimated reward at any given state or time step and the actual reward received. The larger the error function, the larger the difference between the expected and actual reward. When this is paired with a stimulus that accurately reflects a future reward, the error can be used to associate the stimulus with the future reward. Dopamine cells appear to behave in a similar manner. In one experiment measurements of dopamine cells were made while training a monkey to associate a stimulus with the reward of juice. Initially the dopamine cells increased firing rates when the monkey received juice, indicating a difference in expected and actual rewards. Over time this increase in firing back propagated to the earliest reliable stimulus for the reward. Once the monkey was fully trained, there was no increase in firing rate upon presentation of the predicted reward. Continually, the firing rate for the dopamine cells decreased below normal activation when the expected reward was not produced. This mimics closely how the error function in TD is used for reinforcement learning. The relationship between the model and potential neurological function has produced research attempting to use TD to explain many aspects of behavioral research. It has also been used to study conditions such as schizophrenia or the consequences of pharmacological manipulations of dopamine on learning.

In the broadest sense, natural products include any substance produced by life. Natural products can also be prepared by chemical synthesis (both semisynthesis and total synthesis) and have played a central role in the development of the field of organic chemistry by providing challenging synthetic targets. The term natural product has also been extended for commercial purposes to refer to cosmetics, dietary supplements, and foods produced from natural sources without added artificial ingredients. Within the field of organic chemistry, the definition of natural products is usually restricted to organic compounds isolated from natural sources that are produced by the pathways of primary or secondary metabolism. Within the field of medicinal chemistry, the definition is often further restricted to secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are not essential for survival, but nevertheless provide organisms that produce them an evolutionary advantage. Many secondary metabolites are cytotoxic and have been selected and optimized through evolution for use as \\"chemical warfare\\" agents against prey, predators, and competing organisms. Natural sources may lead to basic research on potential bioactive components for commercial development as lead compounds in drug discovery. Although natural products have inspired numerous U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, drug development from natural sources has received declining attention in the 21st century by pharmaceutical companies, partly due to unreliable access and supply, intellectual property, cost, and profit concerns, seasonal or environmental variability of composition, and loss of sources due to rising extinction rates.  Classes  The broadest definition of natural product is anything that is produced by life, and includes the likes of biotic materials (e.g. wood, silk), bio-based materials (e.g. bioplastics, cornstarch), bodily fluids (e.g. milk, plant exudates), and other natural materials (e.g. soil, coal). A more restrictive definition of a natural product is an organic compound that is synthesized by a living organism. The remainder of this article restricts itself to this more narrow definition. Natural products may be classified according to their biological function, biosynthetic pathway, or source. One estimate of the number of natural product molecules is about 326,000.  Function  Following Albrecht Kossel's original proposal in 1891, natural products are often divided into two major classes, the primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites have an intrinsic function that is essential to the survival of the organism that produces them. Secondary metabolites in contrast have an extrinsic function that mainly affects other organisms. Secondary metabolites are not essential to survival but do increase the competitiveness of the organism within its environment. Because of their ability to modulate biochemical and signal transduction pathways, some secondary metabolites have useful medicinal properties. Natural products especially within the field of organic chemistry are often defined as primary and secondary metabolites. A more restrictive definition limiting natural products to secondary metabolites is commonly used within the fields of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy. = Primary metabolites = Molecular building blocks of life Primary metabolites as defined by Kossel are components of basic metabolic pathways that are required for life. They are associated with essential cellular functions such as nutrient assimilation, energy production, and growth/development. They have a wide species distribution that span many phyla and frequently more than one kingdom. Primary metabolites include carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids which are the basic building blocks of life. Primary metabolites that are involved with energy production include respiratory and photosynthetic enzymes. Enzymes in turn are composed of amino acids and often non-peptidic cofactors that are essential for enzyme function. The basic structure of cells and of organisms are also composed of primary metabolites. These include cell membranes (e.g. phospholipids), cell walls (e.g. peptidoglycan, chitin), and cytoskeletons (proteins). Primary metabolite enzymatic cofactors include members of the vitamin B family. Vitamin B1 as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is a component of the coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin ring similar in structure to porphyrin and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of methionine. DNA and RNA which store and transmit genetic information are composed of nucleic acid primary metabolites. First messengers are signaling molecules that control metabolism or cellular differentiation. These signaling molecules include hormones and growth factors in turn are composed of peptides, biogenic amines, steroid hormones, auxins, gibberellins etc. These first messengers interact with cellular receptors which are composed of proteins. Cellular receptors in turn activate second messengers are used to relay the extracellular message to intracellular targets. These signaling molecules include the primary metabolites cyclic nucleotides, diacyl glycerol etc. = Secondary metabolites = Representative examples of each of the major classes of secondary metabolites Secondary in contrast to primary metabolites are dispensable and not absolutely required for survival. Furthermore, secondary metabolites typically have a narrow species distribution. Secondary metabolites have a broad range of functions. These include pheromones that act as social signaling molecules with other individuals of the same species, communication molecules that attract and activate symbiotic organisms, agents that solubilize and transport nutrients (siderophores etc.), and competitive weapons (repellants, venoms, toxins etc.) that are used against competitors, prey, and predators. For many other secondary metabolites, the function is unknown. One hypothesis is that they confer a competitive advantage to the organism that produces them. An alternative view is that, in analogy to the immune system, these secondary metabolites have no specific function, but having the machinery in place to produce these diverse chemical structures is important and a few secondary metabolites are therefore produced and selected for. General structural classes of secondary metabolites include alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, polyketides, and terpenoids, which are described in more detail in the biosynthesis section below.  Biosynthesis  Biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites. The biosynthetic pathways leading to the major classes of natural products are described below. * Photosynthesis or gluconeogenesis → monosaccharides → polysaccharides (cellulose, chitin, glycogen etc.) * Acetate pathway → fatty acids and polyketides * Shikimate pathway → aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids * Mevalonate pathway and methyletrythritol phosphate pathway → terpenoids and steroids * Amino acids → alkaloids = Carbohydrates = Carbohydrates are an essential energy source for most life forms. In addition, polysaccharides formed from simpler carbohydrates are important structural components of many organisms such the cell walls of bacteria and plants. Carbohydrate are the products of plant photosynthesis and animal gluconeogenesis. Photosynthesis produces initially 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, a three carbon atom containing sugar (a triose). This triose in turn may be converted into glucose (a six carbon atom containing sugar) or a variety of pentoses (five carbon atom containing sugars) through the Calvin cycle. In animals, the three carbon precursors lactate or glycerol can be converted into pyruvate which in turn can be converted into carbohydrates in the liver. = Fatty acids and polyketides = Through the process of glycolysis sugars are broken down into acetyl-CoA. In an ATP dependent enzymatically catalyzed reaction, acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to form malonyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA undergo a Claisen condensation with lose of carbon dioxide to form acetoacetyl-CoA. Additional condensation reactions produce successively higher molecular weight poly-β-keto chains which are then converted into other polyketides. The polyketide class of natural products have diverse structures and functions and include prostaglandins and macrolide antibiotics. One molecule of acetyl-CoA (the \\"starter unit\\") and several molecules malonyl-CoA (the \\"extender units\\") are condensed by fatty acid synthase to produce fatty acids. Fatty acid are essential components of lipid bilayers that form cell membranes as well as fat energy stores in animals.  Sources  Natural products may be extracted from the cells, tissues, and secretions of microorganisms, plants and animals. A crude (unfractionated) extract from any one of these sources will contain a range of structurally diverse and often novel chemical compounds. Chemical diversity in nature is based on biological diversity, so researchers collect samples from around the world to analyze and evaluate in drug discovery screens or bioassays. This effort to search for biologically active natural products is known as bioprospecting. Pharmacognosy provides the tools to detect, isolate and identify bioactive natural products that could be developed for medicinal use. When an \\"active principle\\" is isolated from a traditional medicine or other biological material, this is known as a \\"hit\\". Subsequent scientific and legal work is then performed to validate the hit (eg. elucidation of mechanism of action, confirmation that there is no intellectual property conflict). This is followed by the hit to lead stage of drug discovery, where derivatives of the active compound are produced in an attempt to improve its potency and safety. In this and related ways, modern medicines can be developed directly from natural sources. Although traditional medicines and other biological material are considered an excellent source of novel compounds, the extraction and isolation of these compounds can be a slow, expensive and inefficient process. For large scale manufacture therefore, attempts may be made to produce the new compound by total synthesis or semisynthesis. Because natural products are generally secondary metabolites with complex chemical structures, their total/semisynthesis is not always commercially viable. In these cases, efforts can be made to design simpler analogues with comparable potency and safety that are amenable to total/semisynthesis. = Prokaryotic =  Bacteria  Botulinum toxin types A and B (Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, MyoBloc), used both medicinally and cosmetically, are natural products from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The serendipitous discovery and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products. Soil and water samples were collected from all over the world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. This, in turn, led to the development of an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including amphotericin B, chloramphenicol, daptomycin and tetracycline (from Streptomyces spp.), the polymyxins (from Paenibacillus polymyxa), and the rifamycins (from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica). Although most of the drugs derived from bacteria are employed as anti- infectives, some have found use in other fields of medicine. Botulinum toxin (from Clostridium botulinum) and bleomycin (from Streptomyces verticillus) are two examples. Botulinum, the neurotoxin responsible for botulism, can be injected into specific muscles (such as those controlling the eyelid) to prevent muscle spasm. Also, the glycopeptide bleomycin is used for the treatment of several cancers including Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and testicular cancer. Newer trends in the field include the metabolic profiling and isolation of natural products from novel bacterial species present in underexplored environments. Examples include symbionts or endophytes from tropical environments, subterranean bacteria found deep underground via mining/drilling, and marine bacteria.  Archaea  Because many Archaea have adapted to life in extreme environments such as polar regions, hot springs, acidic springs, alkaline springs, salt lakes, and the high pressure of deep ocean water, they possess enzymes that are functional under quite unusual conditions. These enzymes are of potential use in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, where biotechnological processes frequently involve high temperatures, extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, and / or high pressure. Examples of enzymes identified to date include amylases, pullulanases, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases, cellulases, xylanases, chitinases, proteases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and esterases. Archaea represent a source of novel chemical compounds also, for example isoprenyl glycerol ethers 1 and 2 from Thermococcus S557 and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, respectively. = Eukaryotic =  Fungi  The antibiotic penicillin is a natural product derived from the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. Several anti-infective medications have been derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), which became a lead for a series of drugs that lower cholesterol levels, cyclosporin (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.  Plants  The opioid analgesic drug morphine is a natural product derived from the plant Papaver somniferum. Plants are a major source of complex and highly structurally diverse chemical compounds (phytochemicals), this structural diversity attributed in part to the natural selection of organisms producing potent compounds to deter herbivory (feeding deterrents). Major classes of phytochemical include phenols, polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and alkaloids. Though the number of plants that have been extensively studied is relatively small, many pharmacologically active natural products have already been identified. Clinically useful examples include the anticancer agents paclitaxel and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (from Taxus brevifolia and Cephalotaxus harringtonii, respectively), the antimalarial agent artemisinin (from Artemisia annua), and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (from Galanthus spp.), used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Other plant-derived drugs, used medicinally and/or recreationally include morphine, cocaine, quinine, tubocurarine, muscarine, and nicotine.  Animals  The analgesic drug ω-conotoxin (ziconotide) is a natural product derived from the sea snail Conus magus. Animals also represent a source of bioactive natural products. In particular, venomous animals such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, caterpillars, bees, wasps, centipedes, ants, toads, and frogs have attracted much attention. This is because venom constituents (peptides, enzymes, nucleotides, lipids, biogenic amines etc.) often have very specific interactions with a macromolecular target in the body (e.g. α-bungarotoxin from cobras). As with plant feeding deterrents, this biological activity is attributed to natural selection, organisms capable of killing or paralyzing their prey and/or defending themselves against predators being more likely to survive and reproduce. Because of these specific chemical-target interactions, venom constituents have proved important tools for studying receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. In some cases, they have also served as leads in the development of novel drugs. For example, teprotide, a peptide isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper Bothrops jararaca, was a lead in the development of the antihypertensive agents cilazapril and captopril. Also, echistatin, a disintegrin from the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus was a lead in the development of the antiplatelet drug tirofiban. In addition to the terrestrial animals and amphibians described above, many marine animals have been examined for pharmacologically active natural products, with corals, sponges, tunicates, sea snails, and bryozoans yielding chemicals with interesting analgesic, antiviral, and anticancer activities. Two examples developed for clinical use include ω-conotoxin (from the marine snail Conus magus) and ecteinascidin 743 (from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata). The former, ω-conotoxin, is used to relieve severe and chronic pain, while the latter, ecteinascidin 743 is used to treat metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Other natural products derived from marine animals and under investigation as possible therapies include the antitumour agents discodermolide (from the sponge Discodermia dissoluta), eleutherobin (from the coral Erythropodium caribaeorum), and the bryostatins (from the bryozoan Bugula neritina).  Medical uses  Natural products sometimes have pharmacological activity that can be of therapeutic benefit in treating diseases. Moreover, synthetic analogs of natural products with improved potency and safety can be prepared and therefore natural products are often used as starting points for drug discovery. Natural product constituents have inspired numerous drug discovery efforts that eventually gained approval as new drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration = Traditional medicine = Representative examples of drugs based on natural products Indigenous peoples and ancient civilizations experimented with various plant and animal parts to determine what effect they might have. Through trial and error in isolated cases, traditional healers or shamans found some sources to provide therapeutic effect, representing knowledge of a crude drug that was passed down through generations in such practices as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Extracts of some natural products led to modern discovery of their active constituents and eventually to the development of new drugs. = Modern natural product-derived drugs = A large number of currently prescribed drugs have been either directly derived from or inspired by natural products. A few representative examples are listed below. Some of the oldest natural product based drugs are analgesics. The bark of the willow tree has been known from antiquity to have pain relieving properties. This is due to presence of the natural product salicin which in turn may be hydrolyzed into salicylic acid. A synthetic derivative acetylsalicylic acid better known as aspirin is a widely used pain reliever. Its mechanism of action is inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Another notable example is opium is extracted from the latex from Papaver somniferous (a flowering poppy plant). The most potent narcotic component of opium is the alkaloid morphine which acts as an opioid receptor agonist. A more recent example is the N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide analgesic which is based on a cyclic peptide cone snail toxin (ω-conotoxin MVIIA) from the species Conus magus. A significant number of anti-infectives are based on natural products. The first antibiotic to be discovered, penicillin, was isolated from the mold Penicillium. Penicillin and related beta lactams work by inhibiting DD-transpeptidase enzyme that is required by bacteria to cross link peptidoglycan to form the cell wall. Several natural product drugs target tubulin, which is a component of the cytoskeleton. These include the tubulin polymerization inhibitor colchicine isolated from the Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus flowering plant), which is used to treat gout. Colchicine is biosynthesized from the amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan. Paclitaxel, in contrast, is a tubulin polymerization stabilizer and is used as a chemotherapeutic drug. Paclitaxel is based on the terpenoid natural product taxol, which is isolated from Taxus brevifolia (the pacific yew tree). A class of drugs widely used to lower cholesterol are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, for example atorvastatin. These were developed from mevastatin, a polyketide produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum. Finally, a number natural product drugs are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. These include the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril is based on the peptidic bradykinin potentiating factor isolated from venom of the Brazilian arrowhead viper (Bothrops jararaca). =Limiting and enabling factors= Numerous challenges limit the use of natural products for drug discovery, resulting in 21st century preference by pharmaceutical companies to dedicate discovery efforts toward high-throughput screening of pure synthetic compounds with shorter timelines to refinement. Natural product sources are often unreliable to access and supply, have a high probability of duplication, inherently create intellectual property concerns about patent protection, vary in composition due to sourcing season or environment, and are susceptible to rising extinction rates. The biological resource for drug discovery from natural products remains abundant, with small percentages of microorganisms, plant species, and insects assessed for bioactivity. In enormous numbers, bacteria and marine microorganisms remain unexamined. As of 2008, the field of metagenomics was proposed to examine genes and their function in soil microbes, but most pharmaceutical firms have not exploited this resource fully, choosing instead to develop “diversity-oriented synthesis” from libraries of known drugs or natural sources for lead compounds with higher potential for bioactivity.  Isolation and purification  Penicillin G, the first of its class fungal antibiotic, first studied by Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming in the late 1920s, and made practical as a therapeutic via natural product isolation in the late 1930s by Ernst Boris Chain, Howard Florey, and others, these three named scientists sharing the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the work. Fleming recognized the antibacterial activity and clinical potential of \\"pen G\\", but was unable to purify or stabilize it. Developments in chromatographic separations and freeze drying helped move progress forward in the production of commercial quantities of penicillin and other natural products. All natural products begin as mixtures with other compounds from the natural source, often very complex mixtures, from which the product of interest must be isolated and purified. The isolation of a natural product refers, depending on context, either to the isolation of sufficient quantities of pure chemical matter for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation/degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but historically, often more), or to the isolation of \\"analytical quantities\\" of the substance of interest, where the focus is on identification and quantitation of the substance (e.g. in biological tissue or fluid), and where the quantity isolated depends on the analytical method applied (but is generally always sub-microgram in scale). The ease with which the active agent can be isolated and purified depends on the structure, stability, and quantity of the natural product. The methods of isolation applied toward achieving these two distinct scales of product are likewise distinct, but generally involve extraction, precipitation, adsorptions, chromatography, and sometimes crystallizations. In both cases, the isolated substance is purified to chemical homogeneity, i.e. specific combined separation and analytical methods such as LC-MS methods are chosen to be \\"orthogonal\\"—achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix—with the goal being repeated detection of only a single species present in the putative pure sample. Early isolation is almost inevitably followed by structure determination, especially if an important pharmacologic activity is associated with the purified natural product. Structure determination refers to methods applied to determine the chemical structure of an isolated, pure natural product, a process that involves an array of chemical and physical methods that have changed markedly over the history of natural products research; in earliest days, these focused on chemical transformation of unknown substances into known substances, and measurement of physical properties such as melting point and boiling point, and related methods for determining molecular weight. In the modern era, methods focus on mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance methods, often multidimensional, and, when feasible, small molecule crystallography. For instance, the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945, work for which she later received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1964).  Synthesis  Many natural products have very complex structures. The perceived complexity of a natural product is a qualitative matter, consisting of consideration of its molecular mass, the particular arrangements of substructures (functional groups, rings etc.) with respect to one another, the number and density of those functional groups, the stability of those groups and of the molecule as a whole, the number and type of stereochemical elements, the physical properties of the molecule and its intermediates (which bear on the ease of its handling and purification), all of these viewed in the context of the novelty of the structure and whether preceding related synthetic efforts have been successful (see below for details). Some natural products, especially those less complex, are easily and cost-effectively prepared via complete chemical synthesis from readily available, simpler chemical ingredients, a process referred to as total synthesis (especially when the process involves no steps mediated by biological agents). Not all natural products are amenable to total synthesis, cost-effective or otherwise. In particular, those most complex often are not. Many are accessible, but the required routes are simply too expensive to allow synthesis on any practical or industrial scale. However, in order to be available for further study, all natural products must yield to isolation and purification. This may suffice if isolation provides appropriate quantities of the natural product for the intended purpose (e.g. as a drug to alleviate disease). Drugs such as penicillin, morphine, and paclitaxel proved to be affordably acquired at needed commercial scales solely via isolation procedures (without any significant synthetic chemistry contributing). However, in other cases, needed agents are not available without synthetic chemistry manipulations. = Semisynthesis = The process of isolating a natural product from its source can be costly in terms of committed time and material expense, and it may challenge the availability of the relied upon natural resource (or have ecological consequences for the resource). For instance, it has been estimated that the bark of an entire yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) would have to be harvested to extract enough paclitaxel for just a single dose of therapy. Furthermore, the number of structural analogues obtainable for structure-activity analysis (SAR) simply via harvest (if more than one structural analogue is even present) is limited by the biology at work in the organism, and so outside of the experimentalist's control. In such cases where the ultimate target is harder to come by, or limits SAR, it is sometimes possible to source a middle-to-late stage biosynthetic precursor or analogue from which the ultimate target can be prepared. This is termed semisynthesis or partial synthesis. With this approach, the related biosynthetic intermediate is harvested and then converted to the final product by conventional procedures of chemical synthesis. This strategy can have two advantages. Firstly, the intermediate may be more easily extracted, and in higher yield, than the ultimate desired product. An example of this is paclitaxel, which can be manufactured by extracting 10-deacetylbaccatin III from T. brevifolia needles, then carrying out a four-step synthesis. Secondly, the route designed between semisynthetic starting material and ultimate product may permit analogues of the final product to be synthesized. The newer generation semisynthetic penicillins are an illustration of the benefit of this approach. =Total synthesis= cobalamin, an early natural product isolated and structurally characterized. The variable R group can be a methyl or 5'-adenosyl group, or a cyanide or hydroxide anion. The \\"proof\\" by synthesis of vitamin B12 was accomplished in 1972 by the groups of R.B. Woodward and A. Eschenmoser. In general, the total synthesis of natural products is a non-commercial research activity, aimed at deeper understanding of the synthesis of particular natural product frameworks, and the development of fundamental new synthetic methods. Even so, it is of tremendous commercial and societal importance. By providing challenging synthetic targets, for example, it has played a central role in the development of the field of organic chemistry. Prior to the development of analytical chemistry methods in the twentieth century, the structures of natural products were affirmed by total synthesis (so-called \\"structure proof by synthesis\\"). Early efforts in natural products synthesis targeted complex substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12), an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism. =Symmetry = Examination of dimerized and trimerized natural products has shown that an element of bilateral symmetry is often present. Bilateral symmetry refers to a molecule or system that contains a C2, Cs, or C2v point group identity. C2 symmetry tends to be much more abundant than other types of bilateral symmetry. This finding sheds light on how these compounds might be mechanistically created, as well as providing insight into the thermodynamic properties that make these compounds more favorable. Density functional theoretical (DFT), Hartree Fock, and semiempirical calculations also show some favorability for dimerization in natural products due to evolution of more energy per bond than the equivalent trimer or tetramer. This is proposed to be due to steric hindrance at the core of the molecule, as most natural products dimerize and trimerize in a head-to-head fashion rather than head-to-tail.  Research and teaching  Research and teaching activities related to natural products fall into a number of different academic areas, including organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy, ethnobotany, traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology. Other biological areas include chemical biology, chemical ecology, chemogenomics, systems biology, molecular modeling, chemometrics, and chemoinformatics. = Chemistry = Natural products chemistry is a distinct area of chemical research which was important in the history of chemistry, the sourcing of substances in early preclinical drug discovery research, the understanding of traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology, the evolution of technology associated with chemical separations, the development of modern methods in chemical structure determination by NMR and other techniques, and in identification of pharmacologically useful areas of chemical diversity space. In addition, natural products are prepared by organic synthesis, and have played a central role to the development of the field of organic chemistry by providing tremendously challenging targets and problems for synthetic strategy and tactics. In this regard, natural products play a central role in the training of new synthetic organic chemists, and are a principal motivation in the development of new variants of old chemical reactions (e.g., the Evans aldol reaction), as well as the discovery of completely new chemical reactions (e.g., the Woodward cis-hydroxylation, Sharpless epoxidation, and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions). = Biochemistry = Research is being carried out to understand and manipulate the biochemical pathways involved in natural product synthesis in plants. It is hoped this knowledge will enable medicinally useful phytochemicals such as alkaloids to be produced more efficiently and economically.  History  Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) Friedrich Wöhler (1800-1882) Hermann Emil Fischer (1852-1919) Richard Willstätter (1872-1942) Robert Robinson (1886-1975) = Foundations of organic and natural product chemistry = The concept of natural products dates back to the early 19th century, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid. Organic chemistry was regarded at that time as the chemistry of substances that plants and animals are composed of. It was a relatively complex form of chemistry and stood in stark contrast to inorganic chemistry, the principles of which had been established in 1789 by the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier in his work Traité Élémentaire de Chimie. = Isolation = Lavoisier showed at the end of the 18th century that organic substances consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He quickly focused on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, thebaine, and papaverine) from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. By 1805, morphine had already been isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated cholesterol, a crystalline substance, from animal tissue that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated. = Synthesis = A second important step was the synthesis of organic compounds. Whereas the synthesis of inorganic substances had been known for a long time, the synthesis of organic substances was a difficult hurdle. In 1827 the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius held that an indispensable force of nature for the synthesis of organic compounds, called vital force or life force, was needed. This philosophical idea, vitalism, well into the 19th century had many supporters, even after the introduction of the atomic theory. The idea of vitalism especially fitted in with beliefs in medicine; the most traditional healing practices believed that disease was the result of some imbalance in the vital energies that distinguishes life from nonlife. A first attempt to break the vitalism idea in science was made in 1828, when the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesizing urea, a natural product found in urine, by heating ammonium cyanate, an inorganic substance: :mathrm{NH_4OCN xrightarrow {  60^{circ}C   } H_2NCONH_2} This reaction showed that there was no need for a life force in order to prepare organic substances. This idea, however, was initially met with a high degree of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color). = Structural theories = A third step was the structure elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective of whether they were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver cyanate, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver fulminate, a salt with explosive properties. The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, but this was not the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon is tetravalent and can bind to itself to form carbon chains as they occur in natural products. = Expanding the concept = The concept of natural product, which initially based on organic compounds that could be isolated from plants, was extended to include animal material in the middle of the 19th century by the German Justus von Liebig. Hermann Emil Fischer in 1884, turned his attention to the study of carbohydrates and purines, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. He also succeeded to make synthetically in the laboratory in a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose and mannose. After the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, fungi and other micro-organisms were added to the arsenal of sources of natural products. = Milestones = By the 1930s, several large classes of natural products were known. Important milestones included: * Terpenes, first systematically studied by Otto Wallach (Nobel Prize 1910) and later by Leopold Ružička (Nobel Prize 1939) * Dyes based on porphins (including chlorophyll and heme), studied by Richard Willstätter (Nobel Prize 1915) and Hans Fischer (Nobel Prize 1930) * Steroids, studied by Heinrich Otto Wieland (Nobel Prize 1927) and Adolf Windaus (Nobel Prize 1928) * Carotenoids, studied by Paul Karrer (Nobel Prize 1937) * Vitamins, studied among others by Paul Karrer, Adolf Windaus, Robert R. Williams, Norman Haworth (Nobel Prize 1937), Richard Kuhn (Nobel Prize 1938) and Albert Szent-Györgyi * Hormones studied by Adolf Butenandt (Nobel Prize 1939) and Edward Calvin Kendall (Nobel Prize 1950) * Alkaloids and anthocyanins, studied by, among others, Robert Robinson (Nobel Prize 1947)  See also  * Appeal to nature * Ethnobotany * Pharmacognosy * Phytotherapy * Secondary metabolite = Journals = * Chemistry of Natural Compounds * Journal of Natural Products * Natural Product Reports * Natural Product Research  References   Further reading   External links  ","title":"Natural product"},{"id":"1209762","title":"Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)"},{"id":"1209769","text":"Bozouls () is a commune in the Aveyron department in southern France.

Early and family life John Buchanan Floyd was born on June 1, 1806, at Smithfield estate, Blacksburg, Virginia. He was the eldest son of the former Laetitia Preston and her husband, Governor John Floyd (1783–1837). His brother Benjamin Rush Floyd (1812-1860) served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, but failed to win election to the U.S. Congress. His sister Nicketti (1819-1908) married U.S. Senator John Warfield Johnston; his sisters Letitia Preston Floyd Lewis (1814-1886) and Eliza Lavalette Floyd Holmes (1816-1887) also survived their brothers.Lewis Preston Summers, History of Southwest Virginia (Richmond, 1903) (republished by Regional Publishing Company in Baltimore 1971) pp. 757, 767, 775 The elder Floyd served as a representative in Congress from 1817 to 1829 and as governor of Virginia from 1830 to 1834. Young Floyd, who was of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish heritage, graduated from South Carolina College in 1826 (by some accounts 1829), where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. He married his cousin, Sarah (Sally) Buchanan Preston (1802-1879), daughter of Francis Preston, on June 1, 1830. They had no children.Floyd, Nicholas Jackson. Biographical genealogies of the Virginia- Kentucky Floyd families: with notes of some collateral branches. Williams and Wilkins company (Virginia), 1912 page 77 Some claimed Floyd had a daughter, Josephine, who married Robert James Harlan in 1852. Harlan was a slave of Kentucky politician James Harlan and may have been James' son. In the 1850s, Robert Harlan was living as a free person in Cincinnati, Ohio.Gatewood, Willard B. Aristocrats of Color: The Black Elite, 1880-1920. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990, p 118 Career Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1828, Floyd practiced law in his native state and at Helena, Arkansas, where he lost a large fortune and his health in a cotton-planting venture. In 1839, Floyd returned to Virginia and settled in Washington County. Voters elected him to the Abingdon town council in 1843 and the Virginia House of Delegates in 1847, and he won re-election once, then resigned in 1849 upon being elected governor of Virginia.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978)pp. 427, 433, 437 As governor, Floyd commissioned the monument to President George Washington in Virginia Capitol Square, and laid the cornerstone in the presence of President Zachary Taylor on February 22, 1850.Summers p. 768 The second Governor Floyd also recommended the Virginia General Assembly pass a law taxing imports from states that refused to surrender fugitive slaves owned by Virginian masters, which would have violated the Interstate Commerce Clause. When he left statewide office in 1852, Washington County voters again elected him to the Virginia House of Delegates.Leonard p. 462 Floyd also bought the Abington Democrat from Leonidas Baugh when the paper's founder won appointment as postmaster, and he had J.M.H. Brunet of Petersburg publish it, but Brunet died and the paper was sold at auction to pay the debts incurred by its next printer, Stephen Pendleton, in 1857.Summers p. 590 Active in Democratic Party politics, the former governor was a presidential elector for James Buchanan after the presidential election of 1856. Secretary of War President Buchanan and his Cabinet From left to right: Jacob Thompson, Lewis Cass, John B. Floyd, James Buchanan, Howell Cobb, Isaac Toucey, Joseph Holt, and Jeremiah S. Black (circa 1859) In March 1857, Floyd became Secretary of War in Buchanan's cabinet, where his lack of administrative ability was soon apparent, including the poor execution of the Utah Expedition. Floyd is implicated in the scandal of the \\"Abstracted Indian Bonds\\", which broke at the end of 1860 as the Buchanan administration was reaching its end. His wife's nephew Godard Bailey, who worked in the Interior Department and who removed bonds from the Indian Agency safe during 1860, was also implicated. Among the recipients of the money was Russell, Majors, and Waddell, a government contractor that held, among its contracts, the Pony Express. In December 1860, on ascertaining that Floyd had honored heavy drafts made by government contractors in anticipation of their earnings, the president requested his resignation. Several days later, Floyd was indicted for malversation in office, although the indictment was overruled in 1861 on technical grounds. No proof was found that he profited by these irregular transactions; in fact, he left office financially embarrassed. Although he had openly opposed secession before the election of Abraham Lincoln, his conduct after the election, especially after his breach with Buchanan, fell under suspicion, and he was accused in the press of having sent large stores of government arms to federal arsenals in the South in the anticipation of the Civil War. Ulysses Grant, in his postwar Personal Memoirs, wrote: After his resignation, a congressional commission in the summer and fall of 1861 investigated Floyd's actions as Secretary of War. All of his records of orders and shipments of arms from 1859 to 1860 were examined. It is recorded that in response to John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, he bolstered the federal arsenals in some Southern states by over 115,000 muskets and rifles in late 1859. He also ordered heavy ordnance to be shipped to the federal forts in Galveston Harbor, Texas, and the new fort on Ship Island off the coast of Mississippi.Official Records, Series III, Vol. I. In the last days of his term, he apparently had an intention to send these heavy guns, but his orders were revoked by the President. His resignation as secretary of war, on December 29, 1860, was precipitated by the refusal of Buchanan to order Major Robert Anderson to abandon Fort Sumter, which eventually led to the start of the war. On January 27, 1861, he was indicted by the District of Columbia grand jury for conspiracy and fraud. Floyd appeared in criminal court in Washington, DC, on March 7, 1861, to answer the charges against him. According to Harper's Weekly, the indictments were thrown out. Civil War General John B. Floyd After the secession of Virginia, Floyd was commissioned a major general in the Provisional Army of Virginia, but on May 23, 1861, he was appointed a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army (CSA). He was first employed in some unsuccessful operations in the Kanawha Valley of western Virginia under Robert E. Lee, where he was both defeated and wounded in the arm at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on September 10. General Floyd blamed Brigadier General Henry A. Wise for the Confederate loss at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry, stating that Wise refused to come to his aid. Virginia Delegate Mason Mathews, whose son Alexander F. Mathews was Wise's aide-de- camp, spent several days in the camps of both Wise and Floyd to seek resolution to an escalating feud between the two generals. Afterward, he wrote to President Jefferson Davis urging that both men be removed, stating, \\"I am fully satisfied that each of them would be highly gratified to see the other annihilated.\\" Rice, Otis K. 1986. A History of Greenbrier County. Greenbrier Historical Society, p. 264 Davis subsequently removed Wise from his command of the western Virginia region, leaving Floyd as the region's unquestioned superior officer. In January 1862, he was dispatched to the Western Theater to report to General Albert Sidney Johnston and was given command of a division. Johnston sent Floyd to reinforce Fort Donelson and assume command of the post there. Floyd assumed command of Fort Donelson on February 13, just two days after the Union army had arrived at that spot, also becoming the third post commander within a week. Fort Donelson protected the crucial Cumberland River, and indirectly, the manufacturing city of Nashville and Confederate control of Middle Tennessee. It was the companion to Fort Henry on the nearby Tennessee River, which, on February 6, 1862, was captured by Union Army Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and river gunboats. Floyd was not an appropriate choice to defend such a vital point, having political influence, but virtually no military experience. General Johnston had other experienced, more senior, generals (P.G.T. Beauregard and William J. Hardee) available and made a serious error in selecting Floyd. Floyd had little military influence on the Battle of Fort Donelson itself, deferring to his more experienced subordinates, Brigadier Generals Gideon Johnson Pillow and Simon Bolivar Buckner. As the Union forces surrounded the fort and the town of Dover, the Confederates launched an assault on February 15 in an attempt to open an escape route. Although successful at first, indecision on General Pillow's part left the Confederates in their trenches, facing growing reinforcements for Grant. Early in the morning of February 16, at a council of war, the generals and field officers decided to surrender their army. Floyd, concerned that he would be arrested for treason if captured by the Union Army, turned his command over to Pillow, who immediately turned it over to Buckner. Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest and his entire Tennessee cavalry regiment escaped while Pillow escaped on a small boat across the Cumberland. The next morning, Floyd escaped by steamboat with the 36th Virginia and 51st Virginia Infantry regiments, two artillery batteries, and elements of the other units from his old command. He safely reached Nashville, having escaped just before Buckner surrendered to Grant in one of the greatest strategic defeats of the Civil War. He never satisfactorily explained upon what principles he appropriated all the transportation on to the use of his particular command\\". Floyd was relieved of his command by Confederate President Davis, without a court of inquiry, on March 11, 1862. He resumed his commission as a major general of Virginia Militia, but his health soon failed and he died a year later at Abingdon, Virginia, where he is buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery. In memoriam Floyd County in northwest Georgia, home to the cities of Rome and Cave Spring, is named for his relative, United States Congressman John Floyd. Camp Floyd, a U.S. Army post near Fairfield, Utah from July 1858 to July 1861, was originally named after Floyd.

As the 3rd oldest dentistry school in the United States, it offers both graduate programs and clinical training in oral healthcare. History The College of Dentistry was founded in 1865 as the \\"New York College of Dentistry.\\" It merged with NYU in 1925. NYU Dentistry is the third oldest continuously operating and the largest dental school in the United States. In 1957, the College moved into its present home on First Avenue, which in 1965 was named the K. B. Weissman Clinical Science Building. In 1978, the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Hall of Dental Sciences was completed. In 1987, New York University dedicated the David B. Kriser Dental Center. In 2002, the Leonard I. Bluestone Center for Clinical Research opened - the only dental school-based research center that provides beds for 24-hour patient monitoring. In fall of 2005, NYU's Division of Nursing moved from the Steinhardt School of Education to form the College of Nursing within the College of Dentistry. In 2015, a new joint 170,000 square foot building for Dentistry, Nursing, and the Bioengineering Institute was opened. In aggregate, the College of Dentistry occupies 27 floors distributed among five buildings. Facilities The College of Dentistry is located on First Avenue between East 24th and 26th Streets, about 6 blocks south of the NYU School of Medicine. The College's facilities include the Schwartz Hall of Dental Sciences, the K. B. Weissman Clinical Science Building, the new 13 floor interdisciplinary building at 433 First Avenue, four newly renovated floors at 137 25th Street, and one floor at 380 First Avenue. These house classrooms, patient clinics, research and teaching facilities, and administrative offices, as well as a state-of-the-art Learning Commons for dentistry, dental hygiene, nursing, and engineering students and an Executive Conference Suite. Clinical facilities include 506 dental operatories. The operatories are designed in modules, each containing a waiting room, offices, X-ray facilities, and a seminar room for instruction and consultation. These facilities enable the College to provide oral health care for thousands of New Yorkers. The address shown in the caption for the figure below is incorrect, the building shown is on East 24th street, not East 25th street. Library New York University College of Dentistry from E.25 Street The College of Dentistry maintains one of the largest rare book dental libraries, close to 1000 volumes, the legacy of Dr. Bernhard Wolf Weinberger, a dental historian, orthodontist and a faculty member in the 1930s. Its collection includes a first edition of the Pierre Fauchard Le Chirurgien Dentist (1728), one second edition (1746) and a third edition (1786). Other volumes include works by Bartolomeo Eustachio, 1563 edition of De Libellus de Dentibus, 1546 and 1547 editions of Artzneybuch (The Little Medicinal Book for All Kinds of Diseases and Infirmities of the Teeth), one of the first German dentally-related book. The original library, founded in 1909 and named the Waldmann Memorial Library in 1978 was digitized and modernized in 2015. The College of Dentistry has moved its \\"library\\" into the newly opened Dental-Nursing-Biomaterials joint interprofessional building at 433 First Avenue. The building has a large study area for all students but it no longer houses books. The students have 24 hour access to the study area. E-Curriculum Since 2001, NYU Dentistry has replaced traditional textbooks with a collection of digitalized textbooks. All required materials are available to students through a computer-enhanced curriculum. The new technology gives each student a license for all of the textbooks in the curriculum. In addition to traditional textbook content, students are able to view slide presentations and video streams of lab and clinical procedures and do full text searches on their materials.

The school was founded in 1966. Today, HKIS spans from reception one to the twelfth grade. Its Lower and Upper Primary Divisions are located in Repulse Bay and the Middle and High Schools are located in Tai Tam. The Western Association of Schools and Colleges has continuously accredited Hong Kong International School since 1971. History In 1964 a Hong Kong-based committee of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) first submitted a proposal to have the school built. - Online: 6 October 2016 - Print: \\"School with U.S. Curriculum Proposed\\" Hong Kong International School was founded in September 1966, its first location consisting of makeshift premises including residential flats in Chung Hom Kok, housing 120 students. The school was brought to life by the actions of three groups, all working together to the same ends; the Hong Kong Government (which granted land and interest-free loans), a group of American businessmen and representatives of the educational arm of the LCMS. On 14 September 1967, HKIS opened the doors to a new camp in Repulse Bay and housed 630 multi-national students. The first permanent school building, with seven stories, 32 classrooms, and a capacity for 750 pupils, cost $5,350,000 Hong Kong dollars. The campus included a cafeteria, library, and gymnasium. It became the first school in Hong Kong with a U.S. education program. - Online: 21 November 2016 - Print: \\"The American Way of Schooling: U.S. curriculum and programme at H.K. International School\\" HKIS continued to expand over time, which led to the creation of a second building in Repulse Bay, and finally an additional campus in Tai Tam. Its first primary school building in South Bay Close, Repulse Bay was dedicated in 1975. - Online: 5 October 2016 In the 1970s the school had both American students and students of other nationalities. - Online: 6 October 2016 Lower Primary and Upper Primary remain in Repulse Bay while Middle School and High School are in Tai Tam. In 2003, HKIS and BrainPop collaborated on an episode of the latter about SARS/MERS. The school has just finished undergoing its fourth major infrastructure development plan around mid-2010 in the Middle School Campus, called the Middle School Annex.

Lower Primary (LP) and Upper Primary (UP) are housed in the original building in Repulse Bay, while the Middle School (MS) and High School (HS) are in the newer building in Tai Tam. In 2010, HKIS became a 1:1 (one laptop, one student) school, offering education in both the traditional form and through technology. Every student from grade 5 upwards was equipped with an Apple MacBook Pro and younger students learn using a wide range of software using MacBook Pros, iPods, and iPads that remain at school. In 2013 the school switched to MacBook Airs for students participating in the 1:1 program. Each division of the school has its own administration and student government organization; the high school's is known as the Senate, the middle school's is called the Student Leadership Team, and the upper primaries are called the Student Consul. The entire school is overseen by the current Head of School, Ron Roukema. For the 2011/17 academic year, over 2,640 students (from over 40 different nationalities) and 500 faculty and staff occupy the two separate campuses of HKIS. Four libraries house a total of 200,000 books, periodicals and technological resources. =Academics= The school follows an American curriculum, offering various Advanced Placement courses and 3 foreign languages in Middle School and High School: French, Spanish and Chinese.

HKIS's high school has also hosted the annual Southeast Asia Honor Band Program, inviting several major schools from the region (i.e. Jakarta, Taipei) to participate. At these festivals, HKIS also provided three honor bands of its own: the Middle School band, the Junior Varsity band, and a Varsity honor band. In 2005, the High School Wind Ensemble earned first place at the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival. The High School band also travels to various countries for the APAC Festival, where students work with talented composers such as Robert W. Smith to put on a full-length concert in a few days. This festival has been held in places like Seoul and Shanghai. The Middle School band performs twice annually: once publicly, often in Stanley or City Hall, and once privately, usually in the Middle School Gymnasium. Other instrumental programs include the Strings program, which performs twice a year. They placed first in the Hong Kong Schools Interflow Music Festival in 2010 and again in 2014 and 2017.

Recent developments The Middle School completed a new annex during the summers of 2009 overlooking Tai Tam Bay. The annex includes administrative offices, a boardroom, several new Modern Languages classrooms, and a flexible seminar/meeting space. Some of these classrooms have been earmarked to house the R1 classes during the redevelopment of the Lower Primary building. In June 2011, HKIS announced that it would be redeveloping the Lower Primary school building in Repulse Bay. The project will require Lower Primary students to move to a new school building for a period of three years. During the redevelopment, the old building will be leveled and a new state-of-the-art building created using the latest in educational research on the environments necessary to foster the best in early learning. After turning down temporary campuses in Chai Wan and Hung Hom, HKIS announced in the Spring of 2013 that the lower primary students would move to the Tai Tam campus starting in the 2014-'15 school year. Offices and support staff rooms at Tai Tam will be retrofitted into classrooms, along with some space in the Middle School being turned over to the Lower Primary. Work will begin in 2014. When completed, the new campus will feature an indoor swimming pool, a large auditorium, and gymnasium as well as indoor and outdoor learning spaces and housing facilities for some teachers.

While the Gamsakhurdia rebellion was eventually defeated, the South Ossetia and Abkhazia conflicts resulted in the de facto secession of both regions from Georgia. As a result, both conflicts have lingered on, with occasional flare-ups.  Ethnic conflicts  Ethnic minority separatist movements – primarily on the part of the Ossetians and the Abkhaz, demanded fuller recognition in the new order of the early 1990s. Asserting its newly gained national prerogatives, Georgia responded with military attempts to restrain separatism forcibly. On January 5, 1991 Georgia's National Guard entered Tskhinvali, South Ossetian capital and fighting broke out in and around the city. The Georgian-Ossetian Conflict was the first major crisis faced by Gamsakhurdia's government. At the time of the dissolution of the USSR, the United States government recognized as legitimate the pre-Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact 1933 borders of the country (the Franklin D. Roosevelt government established diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the end of that year\\"Pretty Fat Turkey\\", TIME Magazine, November 27, 1933). Because of this, the George H. W. Bush administration openly supported the secession of the Baltic SSRs, but regarded the questions related to the independence and territorial conflicts of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the rest of the Transcaucasus — which were integral part of the USSR with international borders unaltered since the 1920s — as internal Soviet affairs.America Abroad, TIME Magazine, June 10, 1991  Civil unrest  Activity of the opposition against the authoritarian Government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia caused an acute political dispute, which soon turned violent in the fall of 1991. Following the police dispersion of a large opposition demonstration in Tbilisi on September 2, several oppositionists were arrested and their offices raided and pro-opposition newspapers were closed. The National Guard of Georgia, the major paramilitary force in the country split into two, pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia factions. Another powerful paramilitary organization, the Mkhedrioni led by Jaba Ioseliani also sided with the opposition. Demonstrations and barricade-building marked the next three months. On 22 September, there were the first fatalities in Tbilisi. On September 24, state of emergency was declared in Tbilisi. On October 4 anti- Gamsakhurdia groups attacked the supporters of Gamsakhurdia; one supporter of the President was killed. By late October 1991, most of the leadership of the oppositional National Democratic Party (NDP), headed by Giorgi Chanturia, had been arrested. A stand-off followed because former National Guard leader Tengiz Kitovani's armed supporters withdrew to the outskirts of Tbilisi where they remained until late December 1991 when the power struggle intensified with the opposition claiming that President Gamsakhurdia had left no chance to peaceful settlement of the crisis.  Coup d'état  On 20 December 1991, Kitovani's fighters returned in force to begin the final onslaught against Gamsakhurdia. The armed oppositionists released Jaba Ioseliani, the leader of \\"Mkhedrioni\\" and mounted barricades in central Tbilisi. On December 22, the rebels seized several official buildings, and attacked the Parliament building where Gamsakhurdia and his supporters were holding the position. Simultaneously, the rebels already controlling most of the city, brutally suppressed pro-Gamsakhurdia protests in and around Tbilisi. They fired on the crowds, killing and wounding several people. On 6 January 1992, President Gamsakhurdia with other members of his government was forced to flee first to Armenia and then to Chechnya, where he led a form of government-in-exile for the next 18 months. Within several days of the fighting the main boulevard in the city, Rustaveli Avenue, had been destroyed and at least 113 people were killed.  \\"Zviadist\\" resistance  After the successful coup, an interim government, the Military Council, was formed in Georgia. Initially it was led by a triumvirate of Jaba Ioseliani, Tengiz Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani, but it was soon chaired by Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Communist leader who returned to Tbilisi in March 1992. The 1992 elections established Shevardnadze as the Chairman of Parliament and the Head of State. Zviad Gamsakhurdia, despite his absence, continued to enjoy substantial support within Georgia, especially in rural areas and in his home region of Samegrelo in western Georgia. The supporters of the ousted president, the \\"Zviadists,\\" responded to the coup with spontaneous street demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the government forces and paramilitary groups. Clashes between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces continued throughout 1992 and 1993 with Zviad Gamsakhurdia's supporters taking captive government officials and government forces retaliating with reprisal raids. One of the most serious incidents occurred in Tbilisi on June 24, 1992, when armed Gamsakhurdia supporters seized the state television center. However, they were driven out within a few hours by the National Guard. The armed \\"Zviadists\\" actually prevented the new government forces from gaining control of Gamsakhurdia's native Samegrelo region, which became the stronghold of the overthrown president's supporters. Numerous acts of violence and atrocities committed by the Mkhedrioni and government forces in this region contributed to further confrontation between the local population and Shevardnadze's regime. Following the coup and armed clashes in western Georgia, Aslan Abashidze, the leader of southwestern autonomous province of Adjara, closed an administrative border and prevented both sides from entering Adjarian territory. This established Abashidze's authoritarian semi-separatist regime within the region, and created long-term problems in relations between the regional government and the central government of Georgia.  South Ossetian and Abkhazian wars  In February 1992, the fighting escalated in South Ossetia, with sporadic Russian involvement. Facing interior instability and political chaos, Shevardnadze agreed to negotiations to avoid a confrontation with Russia. A cease-fire was agreed upon and on 14 July 1992, a peacekeeping operation began, consisting of a Joint Control Commission and joint Russian – Georgian – Ossetian military patrols. By the summer of 1992, tensions in another secessionist region, Abkhazia, were close to developing into a full- scale Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. On August 14, Georgian forces entered Abkhazia to disarm separatist militias. By the end of September 1993, Russian-backed separatists fought back and took the region's capital, Sukhumi, after fierce fighting on September 27. Georgia's military defeat was followed by the ethnic cleansing of the Georgian majority in Abkhazia. The war produced approximately 20,000 deaths on both sides, and about 260,000 refugees and IDPs.  The 1993 civil war  During the Abkhazian war, the role of Vakhtang (Loti) Kobalia's militia, the major force of the former President's supporters, continued to be controversial. Kobalia's militia fought on the Georgian side near the village of Tamish in Abkhazia and played an important role in defeating the Abkhaz- North Caucasian commandos. This step was assessed by Shevardnadze as a 'beginning of national reconciliation'. At the same time, they stirred their activities in anticipation of the fall of Sukhumi and public discontent with Shevardnadze's policy which they expected to follow (as they openly stated). On July 9–10, 72 deputies of the former Supreme Council that had been ousted in January 1992, held a session in Zugdidi and declared the 'restoration of the legitimate government' there. Broadcasting on their TV channel became more frequent. From July to August Kobalia's militia effectively established its control in a significant part of the Samegrelo province. In September 1993, Zviad Gamsakhurdia took advantage of the struggle in Abkhazia to return to the city of Zugdidi, western Georgia, and rally enthusiastic but disorganized Georgians in Samegrelo region against the demoralized and unpopular government of Eduard Shevardnadze. Although Gamsakhurdia initially represented his return as a rescue of Georgian forces after the Abkhazian disaster, he actually disarmed part of the Georgian troops retreating from the breakaway region and established his control over the significant part of Samegrelo. Ex-president's advance made Shevardnadze to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and appeal for Russian military assistance. In mid-October, the addition of Russian weapons, supply-line security, and technical assistance turned the tide against Gamsakhurdia. On October 20, around 2,000 Russian troops moved to protect Georgian railroads. On October 22, 1993, the government forces launched an offensive against pro-Gamsakhurdia rebels led by Colonel Loti Kobalia and, with the help of Russian military, occupied most of Samegrelo province. The ex-president forces counter-attacked on October 27. Heavy fighting concentrated around the towns of Khobi and Senaki. From November 2, following an agreement between Eduard Shevardnadze and Russian leadership, a Russian marine battalion was deployed to Poti in order to secure critical transport infrastructure, including railroads and ports, from Zviadist rebels under the direction of Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In order to obtain this support, Shevardnadze had to agree to Georgian accession to CIS and the establishment of Russian military installations within Georgia. On November 4, 1993, the government forces broke through the defence lines of the Zviadist militias and entered Zugdidi without fighting on November 6. Zviad Gamsakhurdia and his bodyguards escaped to the forests chased by the government forces. He died in late December under controversial circumstances. It was later reported that Gamsakhurdia had shot himself on December 31, in a village Jikhashkari (Samegrelo region of Western Georgia). The revolt was crushed and the region was overrun by the pro-governmental paramilitaries. Several Zviadist leaders were arrested in the following years.  Aftermath  The three-year civil war produced a decade of political instability, permanent financial, economic and social crises. The situation began to stabilize in 1995. However, radical \\"Zviadists\\" organized several acts of terrorism and sabotage. They were charged for the assassination attempt of President Eduard Shevardnadze on 9 February 1998. A few days later, supporters of former president kidnapped four observers from the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia from their compound in Zugdidi in western Georgia. Some of the hostage takers surrendered, but Gocha Esebua, the leader of the Zviadist team, escaped and was killed in a shootout with police on 31 March. On October 18, 1998, there was an attempted revolt led by Colonel Akaki Eliava, former Zviadist officer near Kutaisi, Georgia's second largest city. After the collapse of the mutiny, Eliava and his followers hid in the forests of Samegrelo. He had produced permanent problems for the government until he was shot by security officers in 2000. On January 26, 2004, the newly elected President Mikheil Saakashvili officially rehabilitated Gamsakhurdia to resolve the lingering political effects of his overthrow in an effort to \\"put an end to disunity in our society\\", as Saakashvili put it. He also released 32 Gamsakhurdia supporters arrested by Shevardnadze's government in 1993–1994 and still remaining in prisons. The relationship between Georgia and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained tense and lead to renewed warfare during the 2008 South Ossetia war.

In order to increase the throughput of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and surface mount (SMT) lines, PCBs are often designed so that they consist of many smaller individual PCBs that will be used in the final product. This PCB cluster is called a panel or multiblock. The large panel is broken up or \\"depaneled\\" as a certain step in the process - depending on the product, it may happen right after SMT process, after in-circuit test (ICT), after soldering of through-hole elements, or even right before the final assembly of the PCBA into the enclosure. Risks When selecting a depaneling technique, it is important to be mindful of the risks, including: *Mechanical Strain: depaneling can be a violent operation and may bend the PCB causing some components to fracture, or in the worst case, break traces. Ways to mitigate this are avoiding placing components near the edge of the PCBA, and orienting components parallel to the break line. *Tolerance: some methods of depaneling may result in the PCBA being a different size than intended. Ways to mitigate are to communicate with the manufacturer about which dimensions are critical, and selecting a depaneling method that meets your needs. Hand depaneling will have the loosest tolerance, laser depaneling the tightest. Main depanel technologies There are six main depaneling cutting techniques currently in use: *hand break *pizza cutter / V-cut *punch *router *saw *laser =Hand break= This method is suitable for strain-resistant circuits (e.g. without SMD components). The operator simply breaks the PCB, usually along a prepared V-groove line, with the help of a proper fixture. =Pizza cutter / V-cut = A pizza cutter is a rotary blade, sometimes rotating using its own motor. The operator moves a pre-scored PCB along a V-groove line, usually with the help of a special fixture. This method is often used only for cutting huge panels into smaller ones. The equipment is cheap and requires only sharpening of the blade and greasing as maintenance. it uses an aluminum based jig to secure the PCB in place. =Punch= Punching is a process where single PCBs are punched out of the panel through the use of special fixture. It is a two- part fixture, with sharp blades on one part and supports on the other. The production capacity of such a system is high, but fixtures are quite expensive and require regular sharpening. =Router= A Depaneling router is a machine similar to wood router. It uses a router bit to mill the material of the PCB. The hardness of the PCB material wears down the bit, which must be replaced periodically. Routing requires that single boards are connected using tabs in a panel. The bit mills the whole material of the tab. It produces much dust that has to be vacuumed. It is important for the vacuum system to be ESD-safe. Also the fixturing of the PCB must be tight - usually an aluminium jig or a vacuum holding system is used. The two most important parameters of the routing process are: feed rate and rotational speed. They are chosen according to the bit type and diameter and should remain proportional (i.e. increasing feed rate should be done together with increasing the rotational speed). Routers generate vibrations of the same frequency as their rotational speed (and higher harmonics), which might be important if there are vibration- sensitive components on the surface of the board. The strain level is lower than for other depaneling methods. Their advantage is that they are able to cut arcs and turn at sharp angles. Their disadvantage is lower capacity. =Saw= A saw is able to cut through panels at high feed rates. It can cut both V-grooved and not-V-grooved PCBs. It does not cut much material and therefore generates low amounts of dust. The disadvantages are: ability to cut in straight lines only and higher stress than for routing. =Laser= Laser cutting is now being offered as an additional method by some manufacturers. UV laser depaneling makes use of a 355 nm wavelength (ultraviolet), diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser source. At this wavelength the laser is capable of cutting, drilling and structuring on rigid and flex circuit substrates. The laser beam, capable of cut widths under 25μm, is controlled by high-precision, galvo- scanning mirrors with repeat accuracy of +/- 4 μm. A variety of substrate materials can be cut with a UV laser source including FR4 and similar resin- based substrates, polyimide, ceramics, PTFE, PET, Aluminum, Brass and Copper. Advantages: accuracy, precision, low mechanical stress and flexible contour and cut capabilities. Disadvantages: initial capital investment is often higher than traditional depaneling technologies, also the optimal board thickness is recommended to be no more than 1mm. CO2 laser sources have also been used for depaneling, but are considered outdated as UV laser technology provides cleaner cuts, less-thermal stress and higher precision capabilities.

The design included innovative features and technologies that were uncommon or unused at the time such as liquid cooling, electric-only starting, low-maintenance shaft drive, modular wheels, and dual CV-type carburetors that were tuned for reduced emissions. The electronic ignition system was separate from the rest of the electrical system, but the motorcycle could only be started via the start button. Power train =Engine= The CX series feature a crankshaft configuration aligned longitudinally with the axis of bike, similar to the Moto Guzzi layout. Unlike a \\"boxer\\" flat-twin, the cylinders protrude at an angle above the horizontal. The included angle of the CX is 80°, and the heads are twisted 22° so that the inlet tracts do not interfere with the rider's legs. A camshaft nestles at the base of the V between the cylinders. Although Honda generally favors OHC engines, the cylinder head twist necessitated the use of stubby pushrods to operate the four overhead valves per cylinder, with a forked rocker arm acting off each pushrod. The 5-speed transmission is located below the crankshaft, with both in the same housing, an arrangement which keeps the engine short (length wise) but quite tall. The engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio and 9,650 rpm redline. Just as with the Honda Gold Wing, the transmission spins contrariwise to the engine's rotation to help counteract the engine torque's tendency to tip the bike slightly to one side when the throttle is opened or closed. The CX was the first V-twin motorcycle that Honda ever built. It was initially designed as a 90 ° V-twin. Honda built a prototype CX350 but it was never released to the public. In that version the cylinder heads did not have the cylinder-head twist. =Transmission= Final drive is with a shaft. Power is transferred by an enclosed splined driveshaft with one universal joint. The shaft drives a bevel gear to which the wheel is joined via a cush-drive, which absorbs and dampens driveline shocks and vibrations. The bevel drive spins in an oil bath, and a grease-nipple is provided for greasing the shaft bearing. =Wheels= The ComStar wheels combine the flexibility of spoked wheels with the strength and tubeless characteristics of one-piece wheels. Honda introduced the Com-Star wheels a year or so earlier on the CB250T/400T Dream as well as on the CB750F2 and GL1000 Gold Wing, although these featured standard rims that demanded inner tubes to be used. The CX500 was the first production motorcycle to use tubeless tires. Chassis Early versions had conventional suspension, consisting of hydraulically damped telescoping front forks and dual coil-over shocks at the rear. Later versions had air-assisted forks and featured Honda's Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension. US bikes (except GL500I, GL650I and Turbo) were equipped with a single front disc brake whereas all other bike possess dual front disc brakes. Besides the 'vanilla' CX500B, models after 1980 sport dual piston calipers replacing the single piston caliper of the earlier models. For the Turbo and Eurosport models the rear drum was replaced with a dual piston caliper and disc. All models feature steel tube frames with a large backbone, with the engine used as a stressed member. The dual shock models use a single tube backbone whereas the later Pro-Link models employed a triple tube backbone. Variants =CX500= 1979 Honda CX500 The 1978 CX500 Standard had a large fuel tank, stepped seat, a round brake fluid reservoir and a plastic mini-fairing that was thought to look unusual at the time. Turn signals extend out through the mini fairing from the headlight's centerline. The CX500 Standard had silver Comstar wheels, 19 inch in front and 18 inch in the rear. While V-twins were nothing new, as Moto Guzzi had been mounting them with the crankshaft inline with the frame with shaft drive for many years, this Honda was decidedly different. Not only was the 497 cc engine water- cooled, but it had four valves per cylinder that were operated by pushrods rather than the overhead cams favored by Honda on its previous four-stroke engine designs. The styling was radical and upright forks and a short engine contributed to a stubby wheelbase on a bike that was rather tall. The CX500 was one of the first recipients of Honda's new Comstar wheels (and later, on B models, reverse Comstar and a square brake fluid reservoir), which measured in front and at the back. The fuel tank tapered toward the front and a huge half- moon tail light jutted out from a short fairing behind the radically stepped seat. The end result was a mix of standard, sport, and cruiser features. =CX500 Custom= Honda CX500C Custom Honda CX 500 C The \\"Custom\\" variant, introduced in 1979, had a smaller, narrower tank and buckhorn handlebars. The headlight and gauges were similar to the CX500 Deluxe. Turn signals were now mounted along the fork tubes, below the level of the headlight. 1982 was the last model year for the CX500. In 1983 it was bumped up to 673 cc and became the CX650. The CX650's styling was different, and the engine was painted black instead of plain aluminium. =CX500 Deluxe= The \\"Deluxe\\" model appeared in 1979. This bike looked nearly identical to the original CX500 Standard, with the exception of regular (85 mph) gauges and headlight (the mini fairing was removed) and black reversed Com Star wheels - 19 inch front and 16 inch rear. 1981 was the final year for the CX500 Deluxe model. The CX500 met with a good degree of success. It proved to be reliable and economical, being the least- expensive shaft-drive bike. Many examples still exist today, and along with the GL Silverwings, are fast becoming cult bikes. There are owners clubs throughout Europe and the rest of the world. =CX500EC Sports= 1985 Honda CX500 Sports Introduced in 1982 the EC variant is a much improved motorcycle compared to the original 500. Sharing many parts with the CX500 Turbo introduced the same model year, the Sport (following the release of the CX650ED 'Eurosports', many people referred to the CX500EC also as the 'Eurosports' although technically not correct) features air pre-load assisted front forks with an anti-dive mechanism, known as TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti- dive Control), and an air pre-load assisted prolink mono-shock rear suspension. The wheels were also modified, with an restyled round hole comstar with a 100–90H18 front tyre, whilst on the rear is a 120–80H18. The brakes are vastly improved with much more effective twin pot calipers on the front and a new disc brake with twin pot caliper on the rear replacing the original drum. The Sports is also significantly restyled with a larger fuel tank, a nose fairing, side panels, seat, and tail unit that share much more modern lines. In the UK only two colour options were made: white pearl with blue and red strips, or black with orange and silver stripes. The instrumentation is improved with the introduction of a fuel gauge and like the rest of the bike, a much updated appearance. Plastic mudguards replace the chromed steel versions on the earlier machines curing the associated rust problems. The round headlight of the early bikes is also replaced with a rectangular lens which gives improved night lighting. The changes extended to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via the lack of a cam chain tensioner bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas. The changes made the 500 Sports significantly better to both look at and ride, and more reliable than the previous versions. The later CX650ED shared the majority of the cosmetic changes introduced by the 500EC, whilst in Japan a 400 cc version was introduced with the same styling to comply with licence rules. =GL500 Silver Wing and GL650 Silver Wing= In 1981 Honda released the GL500 Silver Wing, which was a mid-sized touring bike based on the CX500 engine. The GL500 engine was similar to the CX500 engine, but used the more reliable transistorized ignition system, which meant the stator would contain only charging windings and thus would put out more power for operating the lights and other devices commonly added to touring motorcycles. The GL500 also used Honda's Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension and was available as either a naked bike or as an Interstate model with fairing. The Interstate included a large factory fairing, hard saddlebags, and a trunk. This made the Silver Wing look like a miniature Gold Wing GL1100 Interstate. The 1981 model had a small tail trunk, which was replaced by a larger trunk in 1982. The trunk was interchangeable with the back seat—the bike is rider-only with the trunk installed, although there was an aftermarket extender available to allow the trunk to be mounted behind the passenger seat. In 1983 the GL500 was upgraded to the GL650. Apart from the larger engine, the GL650 had a slightly different fairing mounts and front engine hanger mount than the GL500, and portions of the GL650 engine are painted black. The fuel economy of the GL650 was improved over that of the GL500 due to significantly taller gearing and the replacement of the CX/GL500's mechanical radiator fan with an electric fan. The CX-based Silver Wings were discontinued after the 1983 model year. Overproduction of the 1982 GL500 caused some to be sold new as late as 1984. =CX500 Turbo= Honda CX500 Turbo in the Honda Collection Hall Barber Vintage Motorsport Museum The CX500 Turbo was released in 1982. The CX500 Turbo (also known as the CX500TC) was only produced for the 1982 model year. It was superseded by the CX650TD (CX650 Turbo; D=1983) for the 1983 model year, which was itself discontinued the same year. The 1982 CX500T was Honda's first production motorcycle to have programmed fuel injection system. With redundant fail-safe systems working in tandem with a separate ignition system. Electronic system failures were reported to the driver through two dashboard displays: an issue with the fuel injection system would light a \\"Fuel System\\" light on the dashboard and an issue with the ignition would flash the \\"TURBO\\" indicator. Due to the bikes technological uniqueness, many bikes were sold to motorcycle maintenance trade schools for hands on classes. The CX500TC powerplant was based on the water-cooled V-twin with four pushrod-operated overhead valves per cylinder configuration used in the CX500 introduced a few years earlier. The engine case look was retained nearly intact from the original CX500. The turbocharger, at peak boost providing approximately 19 psi boost nearly doubles the power output of the engine. The engine case is changed to accept the larger crankshaft bearings of the CX650 released in the same year, while the suspension, brakes, frame and fairing all differ significantly from the earlier CX500 and the Pro-Link rear suspension and TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti- dive Control) were used on the CX500EC (released 1982) and CX650ED (released 1983) models. =CX650C= 1983 Honda CX650C The CX650 Custom was a one-year model produced in 1983 for the US market. Like other CX customs, especially the CX400C designed for Asia-Pacific, this model was a cruiser. The frame is completely different, and the styling was marketed to accommodate the American desire for the low stretched look of American cruiser bikes. Its semi chopped fork, tear drop tank, low seat and truncated exhaust gave it a very rakish look. However, it was very similar in styling and price range to the 750 Shadow and Honda elected to have only one cruiser bike in that class, thus the reason for its short model life. =CX650ED= Honda CX650E The CX650ED or Eurosport was also introduced in 1983 and was cosmetically very similar to the CX500 Sports produced the previous year. It was aimed at the UK, European, Canadian, and Australian markets. The brakes, suspension and handling were advanced in comparison to CX500 variants. The model shares many common features with the CX500TC. Tubular frame design, TRAC anti-dive forks, Pro- Link rear suspension, twin-pot brakes and disc front and back. Though this model was not sold in the US, some have been imported by private owners. =CX650T= For the 1983 model year, the engine of the CX500 Turbo was increased to 673 cc, together with an increase in power. In addition to the increase in displacement, the compression ratio was increased and the maximum boost pressure was lowered thus making for a smoother transition from off- boost to on-boost. The fuel-injection control system was substantially revised for the CX650 Turbo, and the rear shock received an update as well by adding a manually operated damping control mechanism in addition to the \\"air\\" pre-load of the previous model. Cosmetically, the CX650 Turbo differs little from its predecessor other than in colors and badging. However, in a cost-cutting exercise, Honda manufactured the 650 Turbo fairing from ABS plastic as opposed to the 500 turbo's GRP. Honda built 1,777 models, with fewer than 1,200 imported to the U.S. and Canada. In the fall of 1982, it was Honda's intent to provide a singular new CX650T to each American Honda Dealership for sale. Sales were lackluster due to the bikes high retail cost and expensive insurance rates.

A spoof of the disaster movie genre (which was popular at the time), it follows the maiden cross- country trip of an enormous nuclear-powered bus named Cyclops. The Big Bus received mixed reviews at the time of its 1976 release, although the New York Times gave the film a favorable review. Box office sales were disappointing, but the film has since been recognized as a cult classic of its genre. Director Frawley won the audience award at the 1977 Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. Plot Coyote Bus Lines' scientists and designers work feverishly to complete Cyclops, a state-of-the-art articulated jumbo bus, enabling man to achieve a new milestone in bus history: a non-stop service between New York City and Denver. Almost immediately after the bus's engine is equipped with nuclear fuel, a bomb goes off, critically injuring Professor Baxter, the scientist in charge of the project. Cyclops itself is undamaged, but Coyote Lines has lost both its driver and co-driver. Kitty Baxter, the professor's daughter and the Cyclops designer, is forced to turn to Dan Torrance, an old flame. Once a promising driver, Torrance was disgraced after he crashed his bus atop Mount Diablo, and was accused of saving his own life by eating all of his passengers. (Torrance blamed his co-driver for cannibalism, insisting that he himself survived by eating the seats and the luggage, and only ate part of a passenger's foot by accident.) Narrowly surviving an assault by vindictive fellow drivers with the help of \\"Shoulders\\" O'Brien, Torrance is recruited to drive Cyclops. Meanwhile, a sinister tycoon plots, with oil sheikhs, to destroy the bus. Known as \\"Iron Man\\", he is encased in a huge iron lung while directing his brother Alex to sabotage Cyclops using timebombs. Alex would prefer to use a man-made earthquake, but Iron Man insists that the bus be destroyed and discredited. Before its maiden voyage, Alex sneaks aboard and hides a bomb within the bus. Amidst public fanfare, the bus finally leaves New York, bound for Denver. Among the passengers are the Cranes, a neurotic married couple waiting for their divorce to finalize; Father Kudos, a priest who has lost his way; Dr. Kurtz, a disgraced veterinarian; Emery Bush, a man with only a few months to live; and Camille Levy, whose father died in the aforementioned Mount Diablo bus crash. At first, Cyclops's journey is a success, and Torrance triumphantly breaks the 90 mph \\"wind barrier\\" (referenced as \\"breaking wind\\"). Soon, however, disaster strikes. Investigating a mechanical problem, Dan finds Alex's bomb. He disarms it only just before an explosion rips through another part of the bus. Now unable to stop, Cyclops speeds across America. Dan is determined to achieve Cyclops's historic goal of non-stop service to Denver, but he also needs to surpass a treacherously curvy road where his father died. Dan almost succeeds, but not before a truck collides into the upper deck windshield, and the bus runs partially off the road, finding itself teetering over a cliff. To save the bus, Dan and Shoulders shift all weight to the back of the bus by pumping all of the vehicle's storage of carbonated beverages into the opposite end of the bus into the galley, as well as jettisoning all of the passenger luggage. Knowing he has only one more chance to destroy Cyclops, Iron Man is finally persuaded by Alex to use the earthquake. Unfortunately for Iron Man, Alex has somehow set the co-ordinates for Iron Man's house instead. Back on the road, Cyclops is once again heading to its destination, when, just 25 miles outside of Denver, the front and rear halves of the bus split from each other. Cast * Joseph Bologna as Capt.

Although Landis doesn't mention The Big Bus by name, the film was Dunne's only previous performance as a lounge singer. =The Cyclops= The Cyclops The central set piece of the film is the bus itself—credited for the design is the film's art director Joel Schiller. The bus is a nuclear powered, double-decker, articulated bus with 32 wheels. It is named Cyclops due to the single large headlight prominent at the front. The front also features large wraparound windows on both upper and lower decks—with the lower deck containing the cockpit and the upper, front portion containing the lounge/bar. Cyclops requires the operation of a driver and co- driver. In the film, Cyclops has a passenger capacity of 110, is equipped with a bowling alley, Asian-style cocktail lounge with a piano bar, swimming pool, captain's dining room, private marble-and-gold bathroom with sunken tub, and chef's kitchen. Exterior features shown are an automatic washing mechanism for the Cyclops exterior; an automatic en route tire-changing system; and a display of \\"Flags of all Nations,\\" which emerges from the vehicle's roof. Cyclops can be compared to the German Neoplan Jumbocruiser, an actual double decker articulated super bus with a capacity of 170, originally built in 1975. According to articles in 1976 issues of both Motor Trend magazine and the now defunct Bus World magazine, the real bus used in the film was a large road- worthy vehicle created by production designer Joel Schiller. Though the most visible front portions of the bus (bar and cockpit) appeared to be functional, the remainder of the body of the vehicle was mostly empty—containing only the engine, suspension and essential mechanisms used for exterior trick shots. Few behind-the-scenes and construction photos or plans have surfaced, but according to Joel Schiller's web site, the actual bus built for the film was part of the Los Angeles Bicentennial Parade of 1976. Further, the Bus World article stated that the vehicle made a trip from Los Angeles to San Diego, California, as a film promotion in 1976. The Bus World article also contained extensive photos and details about the building of the bus. The article states that the rear half of the bus was a separate vehicle with a driver. The two halves of the bus would arrive separately at the filming location where they were joined together for shooting. The rear driver was unable to see and had to be directed by radio. In the scene in which the bus departs the terminal on its voyage, the front wheels on the rear portion of the bus are seen turning independently as the bus makes a very tight turn out of the terminal. According to car enthusiast web site Jalopnik.com, the bus was scrapped after filming. In the closing credits, Trailways Bus Lines is thanked for their help in creating the bus used in the film. It is not stated what role Trailways took in creating Cyclops, although the footage of passengers boarding the bus in New York used Trailways Los Angeles bus station. The fictional bus line in the film that operates Cyclops is Coyote Bus Lines, a parody of Greyhound Lines. Soundtrack score The score to the film was created by veteran film composer David Shire. Shire is also credited with composing scores for such films as The Hindenburg, The Conversation, and Short Circuit. Shire's score for The Big Bus was in line with the disaster parody theme of the film that also incorporated elements of disco. In the '90s, Film Score Monthly magazine ran a poll asking which film score its readers would most like to see released. The Big Bus was among the top 20 scores. In 2000, a bootleg CD of the film's soundtrack surfaced as a prized collectable. In January 2011, a limited edition official release of the score was produced by Film Score Monthly (Catalog No. FSM1401). The compact disc was limited to 2000 copies and contained the film's complete score, including alternate takes and excerpts of classical pieces used in various scenes. The CD also contained comedy music and vocals bits by Murphy Dunne, who portrayed Tommy Joyce, the piano player in the bus' Oriental Lounge. The soundtrack release was sourced from the master tapes. As a result, sound quality was excellent and in stereo. Reception The Big Bus received mixed reviews critically. The film currently holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on eleven reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_bus Television broadcast The film had its television premiere on CBS in March 1978, albeit with edits in some adult content and language to meet broadcast content standards. Repeated in May 1980, it has been broadcast only a few times over the past 30 years on various channels, though it had been aired uncut as recently as early 2009 on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and Showtime. As of 2009, Warner Bros. Television holds the USA TV broadcast rights while Paramount Pictures retains all other rights. Only the Warner Bros. logo appears on Showtime's airings and the original Paramount logo is preserved on TCM's print and the DVD issue. Home media The film was released to VHS and Betamax in the early 1980s. In 2002, Paramount Home Video released the film on DVD in a dual-format edition containing the film in the full-screen or theatrical 2.35:1 aspect ratios, (though there is some slight windowboxing with the widescreen version selected); Dolby 5.1 English Surround Sound stereo/mono mix, or Dolby 2.0 mono in English, French, and Spanish. No other extras are included, and the DVD is out of print. The film was also released on DVD in the United States on September 24, 2013, as a Warner Archive Collection DVD-R. The film has also been released on Region 4 full-screen DVD.

A member of the group known as the Fire-Eaters, Yancey was one of the most-effective agitators for secession and rhetorical defenders of slavery. An early critic of John C. Calhoun at the time of the Nullification Crisis of 1832-33, Yancey began to identify with Calhoun and the struggle against the forces of the anti-slavery movement by the late 1830s. In 1849, Yancey was a firm supporter of Calhoun's \\"Southern Address\\" and an adamant opponent of the Compromise of 1850. Throughout the 1850s, Yancey demonstrated an ability to hold large audiences under his spell for hours at a time and was sometimes referred to as the \\"Orator of Seccession\\"., . Potter refers to Yancey as \\"the most silver-tongued of a race of uninhibited orators, and the most fervent exponent of southern rights.\\" At the 1860 Democratic National Convention, he was instrumental in splitting the party into Northern and Southern factions as a leading opponent of Stephen A. Douglas and the concept of popular sovereignty. He used the phrase \\"squatter sovereignty\\" in a speech he gave at the convention to describe popular sovereignty.p. 250, Democratic Party. National Convention, Charleston and Baltimore, 1860. Proceedings of the Conventions at Charleston and Baltimore. Washington, 1860. During the American Civil War, Yancey was appointed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to head a diplomatic delegation to Europe in the attempt to secure formal recognition of Southern independence. In these efforts, Yancey was unsuccessful and frustrated. Upon his return to America in 1862, Yancey was elected to the Confederate States Senate, where he was a frequent critic of the Davis Administration. Suffering from ill health for much of his life, Yancey died during the Civil War, in July 1863 at the age of 48. Early life Yancey's mother, Caroline Bird, lived on her family's plantation (nicknamed \\"the Aviary\\") located near the falls of the Ogeechee River in Warren County, Georgia. On December 8, 1808, she married Benjamin Cudworth Yancey, a lawyer in South Carolina who had served on the USS Constellation during the Quasi-War with France. William Lowndes Yancey was born at the Aviary on August 10, 1814. Three years later, on October 26, 1817, his father died of yellow fever.. Yancey's widowed mother married the Reverend Nathan Sydney Smith Beman on April 23, 1821. Beman had temporarily relocated to South Carolina to operate Mt. Zion Academy, where William was a student. In the spring of 1823, the entire family moved when Reverend Beman took a position at the First Presbyterian Church in Troy, New York. Beman worked with Reverend Charles G. Finney in the free school movement and became involved with abolitionism in the 1830s through contacts with Theodore Dwight Ward and Lyman Beecher.. Beman's marriage was marred by domestic unrest and spousal abuse that led to serious considerations of divorce and finally a permanent separation in 1835. This atmosphere affected the children and caused William to reject many of his step-father's teachings. Yancey's biographer, historian Eric H. Walther, speculates the character of Yancey's later career was a result of low self-esteem and a search for public adulation and approval that went back to his childhood experiences with Reverend Beman.. In the fall of 1830, Yancey was enrolled at Williams College in northwestern Massachusetts. The 16-year-old Yancey was admitted as a sophomore based on the required entrance examinations. At Williams, he participated in the debating society and for a short time was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps as a politician by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay at Williams academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, six weeks before graduation.. Early career Yancey returned to the South, relocating to Greenville, South Carolina. He originally lived on his uncle's plantation, where he served as a bookkeeper. The uncle, Robert Cunningham, was a strong unionist, as were most of Yancey's family, including his birth father. On July 4, 1834, at a Fourth of July celebration, Yancey made a stirring nationalistic address in which he openly attacked the radicals of the state who were still talking secession from the repercussions of the Nullification Crisis: Portrait of John C. Calhoun. Yancey was critical of Calhoun in the 1830s, but he was fully supportive of Calhoun's defense of Southern institutions by the late 1840s. As a result of Yancey's political activities, he was appointed editor of the Greenville Mountaineer in November 1834. As editor, he attacked both nullification and the chief architect of nullification, John C. Calhoun. Yancey compared Calhoun to Aaron Burr and referred to them as \\"two fallen arch angels—who have made efforts to tear down the battlements and safeguards of our country, that they might rule, the Demons of the Storm.\\". Yancey resigned from the newspaper on May 14, 1835. On August 13, married Sarah Caroline Earl. As his dowry, Yancey received 35 slaves and a quick entry into the planter class. In the winter of 1836–1837, Yancey removed to her plantation in Alabama, near Cahaba (Dallas County). It was an inopportune time to relocate. As a result of the Panic of 1837, Yancey's financial position was seriously damaged by cotton prices that fell from fifteen cents a pound in 1835 to as low as five cents a pound in 1837.. In early 1838, Yancey took over the Cahaba Southern Democrat, and his first editorial was a strong defense of slavery. From his current economic perspective, Yancey began to identify the anti-slavery movement negatively with issues such as the establishment of a national bank, internal improvements, and the expansion of federal power. As the former nationalist moved to a states' rights position, Yancey also changed his attitude toward Calhoun, for example, by applauding Calhoun's role in the Gag rule Debates. Yancey also began to attack Henry Clay for his support of the American Colonization Society, which Yancey equated with attacks on Southern slavery.. Yancey, like most members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a personal code of honor.See \\"Southern Honor: Ethics & Behavior in the Old South\\" by Bertram . In this influential work Wyatt-Brown links the Southern code of honor to the South's reaction to the antislavery movement as part of the build-up to secession and civil war. In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. Yancey was confronted by another relative (and his wife's uncle), Dr. Robinson Earle. Conversation turned to violence, and the always-armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. Yancey was tried and sentenced to a year in jail for manslaughter. An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, \\"Reared with the spirit of a man in my bosom—and taught to preserve inviolate my honor—my character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated.\\". Yancey returned to his paper in March 1839, but sold it a couple of months later when he moved to Wetumpka in Elmore County, Alabama. While his intent was to resume his life as a planter, Yancey suffered a huge financial reversal when his slaves were poisoned as a result of a feud between Yancey's overseer and a neighboring overseer. Two of the enslaved were killed, and most of the others were incapacitated for months. Unable to afford replacements and burdened with other debts from his newspaper, Yancey was forced to sell most of the people as they recovered. Yancey did open in Wetumpka the Argus and Commercial Advertiser.. Public office After serving in the Alabama Legislature in the 1840s and the United States House of Representatives from 1844 to 1846, Yancey held no public office until the Civil War. Yancey was increasingly interested in politics as his personal politics moved towards the most radical wing of the Southern Democratic Party. Influenced most by Dixon Hall Lewis, Yancey fell into a social and political circle that included political leaders of the state such as Thomas Mays, J. L. M. Curry, John A. Campbell, and John Gill Shorter. In April 1840, Yancey started a weekly campaign newsletter that supported Democrat Martin Van Buren over Whig William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election while emphasizing that slavery should now be the most important political and economic concern of the South. While still not a secessionist, Yancey was also no longer an unconditional unionist.. He was elected in 1841 to the Alabama House of Representatives, in which he served for one year. In March 1842, Yancey sold his newspaper because of increasing debt. Throughout his career as an editor, he had faced the problem of many fellow editors in obtaining and collecting on subscriptions and decided to open a law practice instead. In 1843, he ran for the Alabama Senate and was elected by a vote of 1,115 to 1,025. His special concern in this election was the effort being made by Whigs to determine apportionment in the state legislature based on the \\"federal ratio\\" of each slave counting as three-fifths of a person. At the time, only whites were counted and the change would have benefited the Whigs, who generally were the largest slaveholders.. This type of conflict between large slaveholders and yeomen Alabamians would continue through the Alabama secession convention in 1861. In 1844, Yancey was elected to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy (winning with a 2,197 to 2,137 vote) and re- elected in 1845 (receiving over 4,000 votes as the Whigs did not even field a candidate). In Congress, his political ability and unusual oratorical gifts at once gained recognition. Yancey delivered his first speech on January 6, 1845, when he was selected by the Democrats to respond to a speech by Thomas Clingman, a Whig from North Carolina, who had opposed Texas annexation. Clingman was offended by the tone of Yancey's speech and afterwards Yancey refused to clarify that he had not intended to impugn Clingman's honor. Clingman challenged Yancey to a duel, and he accepted. The exchange of pistol fire occurred in nearby Beltsville, Maryland; neither combatant was injured.. In Congress, Yancey was an effective spokesman in opposing internal improvements and tariffs and supporting states' rights and the start of the Mexican–American War. More and more, he subscribed to conspiracy theories regarding Northern intentions while helping to provide ammunition for those Northerners who were starting to believe in a slaveholders' conspiracy. In 1846, however, he resigned his seat, partly for financial reasons, and partly because of his disgust with the Northern Democrats, whom he accused of sacrificing their principles for economic interests.. Alabama platform and address to the people of Alabama A portrait of Lewis Cass. The nomination of Cass for the 1848 Democratic Presidential nomination on a platform of popular sovereignty led Yancey to walk out of the convention. Within a few months of his resignation, Yancey moved to Montgomery, where he purchased a dairy farm while establishing a law partnership with John A. Elmore. No longer a planter, Yancey still remained a slaveholder, owning 11 slaves in 1850, 14 by 1852, and 24 between 1858 and 1860. While he had suggested with his resignation that his active role in politics might be over, \\"perhaps forever\\", Yancey found this to be impossible.. Yancey recognized the significance of the Wilmot Proviso to the South and in 1847, as the first talk of slaveholder Zachary Taylor as a presidential candidate surfaced, Yancey saw him as a possibility for bringing together a Southern political movement that would cross party lines. Yancey made it clear that his support for Taylor was conditional upon Taylor denouncing the Wilmot Proviso. However, Taylor announced that he would seek the Whig nomination, and in December 1847 Lewis Cass of Michigan, the leading Democratic candidate, endorsed the policy of popular sovereignty.. With no available candidate sufficiently opposed to the Proviso, Yancey in 1848 secured the adoption by the state Democratic convention of the \\"Alabama Platform,\\" which was endorsed by the legislatures of Alabama and Georgia and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia. The platform endorsed these proposals: # The Federal government could not restrict slavery in the territories. # Territories could not prohibit slavery until the point where they were meeting in convention to draft a state constitution in order to petition Congress for statehood. # Alabama delegates to the Democratic convention were to oppose any candidate supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty (which allowed territories to exclude slavery at any point). # The federal government would have to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws specifically in the Mexican Cession and actively protect slavery. When the national convention was held in Baltimore, Cass was nominated on the fourth ballot. Yancey's proposal that the convention adopt the main points of the Alabama Platform was rejected by a 216–36 vote. Yancey and one other Alabama delegate left the convention in protest, and Yancey's efforts to stir up a third party movement in the state failed.. The opening salvo in a new level of sectional conflict occurred on December 13, 1848, when Whig John G. Palfrey of Massachusetts introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. Throughout the South in 1849, \\"the rhetoric of resistance to the North escalated and spread\\". Calhoun delivered his famous \\"Southern Address\\", but only 48 out of 121 Congressmen signed off on it. Yancey persuaded a June 1849 state Democratic Party meeting to endorse Calhoun's address and was instrumental in calling for the Nashville Convention scheduled for June 1850.. Yancey was opposed to both the Compromise of 1850 and the disappointing results of the Nashville Convention. The latter, rather than making a strong stand for secession as Yancey had hoped, simply advocated extending the Missouri Compromise Line to the Pacific Coast. Yancey helped create Southern Rights Associations (a concept that originated in South Carolina) in Alabama to pursue a secessionist agenda. A convention held in February 1851 of these Alabama associations produced Yancey's radical \\"Address to the People of Alabama\\". The address began in this way: The address hit all of the main points that would ultimately resurface in the secession during the winter of 1860–1861, especially the treatment of Southerners: Despite the efforts of Yancey, the popularity of the Compromise of 1850, the failure of the Nashville Convention, and the acceptance of the more moderate Georgia Platform by much of the South, led to unionist victories in Alabama and most of the South. Yancey's third party support for George Troup of Georgia on a Southern rights platform drew only 2,000 votes.. Road to secession Yancey continued to support the most radical Southern positions and is generally included as one of a group of southerners referred to as \\"Fire-Eaters.\\" Historian Emory Thomas notes that Yancey, along with Edmund Ruffin and Robert Barnwell Rhett, \\"remained in the secessionist forefront longest and loudest.\\" Thomas characterized the whole Fire-Eater cause as reactionary in purpose (the preservation of the South as it then existed), but revolutionary in means (the rejection of the existing political order).. When the conflicts in Kansas Territory known as Bleeding Kansas erupted in 1855–1856, Yancey spoke publicly in support of Jefferson Buford's efforts to raise 300 men to go to Kansas and fight for Southern interests. In 1856, Yancey was head of the platform committee for the state Democratic and Anti–Know Nothing Convention, and he succeeded in having the convention readopt the Alabama Platform. In June 1856, he participated in a rally condemning Charles Sumner while praising his assailant Preston Brooks, who nearly bludgeoned Sumner to death in the United States Senate chamber. In June 1857, Yancey spoke at a rally opposing Robert J. Walker's actions as territorial governor of Kansas. In July 1856, he spoke at the University of Alabama's graduation on \\"the distinctive characteristics of the Northern and Southern people of the Union.\\"James Sellers, History of the University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1953): 194. In January 1858, he participated in a rally supporting William Walker, the famous Nicaragua filibuster, calling the \\"Central American enterprise as the cause of the South.\\". Throughout the mid-1850s, he also lectured on behalf of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, an organization that eventually purchased and restored Mount Vernon from John A. Washington in 1858. Yancey helped to raise $75,000 for this project.. Editor and fellow Fire-Eater James DeBow was a leader in establishing the Southern Commercial Conventions in the 1850s. At the 1857 meeting in Knoxville, DeBow had called for a reopening of the international slave trade. At the May 1858 convention in Montgomery, responding to a speech by Virginian Roger A. Pryor opposing the slave trade, Yancey, in an address that spanned several days, made the following points: Edmund Ruffin proposed the creation of a League of United Southerners as an alternative to the current political parties, a plan that Yancey supported. Yancey supported a plan originated by Edmund Ruffin for the creation of a League of United Southerners as an alternative to the national political parties. In letter of June 16, 1858, to his friend James S. Slaughter that was publicly circulated (Horace Greeley referred to it as \\"The Scarlet Letter\\"), Yancey wrote the following: Yancey was ill for much of the remainder of 1858 and early 1859. For the 1859 Southern Commercial Convention in Vicksburg, which passed the resolution to repeal all state and federal regulations banning the slave trade, Yancey could only contribute editorials, although by July 1859 he was able to speak publicly in Columbia, South Carolina, in favor of repealing the restrictions. When the Alabama Democratic Party organized in the winter of 1859–1860 for the upcoming national convention, they chose Yancey to lead them on the basis of the Alabama Platform. Both Stephen A. Douglas and popular sovereignty were the immediate targets, but by then, Yancey also recognized that secession would be necessary if a \\"Black Republican\\" were to gain the White House.. Spreading the pro-slavery message After twelve years' absence from the national conventions of the Democratic Party, Yancey attended the Charleston convention in April 1860. The Douglas faction refused to accept a platform modeled after Yancey's Alabama Platform of 1848 that was committed to protecting slavery in the territories. When the platform committee presented such a proposal to the convention, it was voted down on the floor 165–138. Yancey and the Alabama delegation left the hall and were followed by the delegates of Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, and two of the three delegates from Delaware. On the next day, the Georgia delegation and a majority of the Arkansas delegation withdrew. As Eric Walther states, \\"Through his years of preparation and despite some brief wavering, William L. Yancey had finally destroyed the Democratic Party.\\". Failing to nominate a candidate, the convention adjourned and reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, 1860. In a last gasp effort to obtain party unity, Douglas supporter George Nicholas Sanders made an unauthorized offer to Yancey to run as vice-president. Yancey turned this down, and the entire Yancey delegation from Alabama was refused credentials in favor of a pro–Douglas slate headed by John Forsyth Jr. With the South Carolina delegation also being denied credentials, the Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee delegations left the convention. The Southern representatives reconvened in Baltimore on June 23 and adopted the Yancey platform from the Charleston convention and nominated John C. Breckinridge for president. In a speech before the convention, Yancey characterized the Douglas supporters as \\"ostrich like—their head was in the sand of squatter sovereignty, and they did not know their great, ugly, ragged abolition body was exposed\\". Yancey, who had already made thirty public addresses in 1860, delivered twenty more during the campaign. If he had not been before, he was certainly now a national figure—a figure making it clear that secession would follow anything other than a Breckinridge election.. Yancey's speaking tour in favor of Breckinridge was not confined to the South. In Wilmington, Delaware, Yancey stated, \\"We stand upon the dark platform of southern slavery, and all we ask is to be allowed to keep it to ourselves. Let us do that, and we will not let the negro insult you by coming here and marrying your daughters.\\" On October 10, 1860, at Cooper Union Hall in New York, Yancey advised Northerners interested in preserving the Union to \\"enlarge your jails and penitentiaries, re-enforce and strengthen your police force, and keep the irrepressible conflict fellows from stealing our negroes...\\" Yancey cited southern fears that with abolitionists in power, \\"Emissaries will percolate between master [and] slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with strychnine to put in our wells.\\" He further warned the crowd that Republican agitation would make Southern whites \\"the enemies of that race until we drench our fields with the blood of the unfortunate people.\\". At Faneuil Hall in Boston, Yancey defended the practices of slavery: From Boston, Yancey's tour included stops in Albany, Syracuse, Louisville, Nashville, and New Orleans, finally returning to Montgomery on November 5. When news of Lincoln's election reached the city, Yancey rhetorically asked a public assemblage protesting the results, \\"Shall we remain [in the Union] and all be slaves? Shall we wait to bear our share of the common dishonor? God forbid!\\". Secession Jefferson Davis being sworn in as President of the Confederate States of America at the Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1861. Yancey had made the formal welcome address to Davis, stating that \\"The man and the hour have met.\\" Later, Yancey would criticize many of Davis' actions. On February 24, 1860, the Alabama legislature passed a joint resolution requiring the governor to call for the election of delegates to a state convention if a Republican was elected president. After first waiting for the official electoral votes to be counted, Governor Andrew Moore called for the election of delegates to take place on December 24 with the convention to meet on January 7, 1861. When the convention convened, Yancey was the guiding spirit. The delegates were split between those insisting on immediate secession versus those who would secede only in cooperation with other Southern states. A frustrated Yancey lashed out at those cooperationists: Eventually, the ordinance of secession was passed over cooperationists objections by a vote of 61–39. When the newly established Confederate States of America met later that month in Montgomery to establish their formal union, Yancey was not a delegate, but he delivered the address of welcome to Jefferson Davis, selected as provisional President, on his arrival at Montgomery. While many of the Fire-Eaters were opposed to the selection of a relative moderate like Davis, Yancey accepted him as a good choice. In his speech, Yancey indicated that in the selection of Davis, \\"The man and the hour have met. We now hope that prosperity, honor, and victory await his administration.\\". Many historians agree with Emory Thomas who wrote, \\"When Yancey and Davis met in Montgomery the helm of the revolution changed hands. Yancey and the radicals had stirred the waters; Davis and the moderates would sail the ship.\\". At war =Diplomat= Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Yancey met on February 18, 1861, as Davis was starting to put together the executive branch of the government. Yancey turned down a cabinet position, but indicated he would be interested in a diplomatic post. Don Doyle argues that Davis displayed \\"tone deafness\\" in appointing Yancey, who was \\"ignorant of the world\\" and himself realized that he was \\"wholly unsuited by experience and personality for diplomacy.\\" However, Davis feared that Yancey would be a political opponent, and wanted him out of the country.Don H. Doyle, The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War (2014) p 39 On March 16, Yancey was formally appointed as the head of the diplomatic mission to England and France. Ambrose Dudley Mann and Pierre Adolphe Rost were also part of the mission; only Mann had any diplomatic experience. The delegation assembled in London at the end of April. Confederate Secretary of State Toombs' official instructions to Yancey were to convince Europe of the righteousness and legality of southern secession, the viability of the militarily strong Confederacy, the value of cotton and virtually duty-free trade, and the South's willingness to observe all treaty agreements in effect between Britain and the United States except for the portion of the Webster- Ashburton Treaty requiring aid in combating the African slave trade. Above all, Yancey was to strive for diplomatic recognition., . Lord Russell rejected efforts by the Confederacy to secure diplomatic recognition by Great Britain. He would only agree to meet informally with Yancey and refused to meet with him at all during the critical Trent Affair. Hubbard argues that President Davis could not have selected \\"three less qualified Southern leaders\\". In contrast to Walther's favorable characterizations of Yancey's conduct, Hubbard stated that Yancey's conduct in England was \\"consistently impulsive, arrogant, [and] unreasonably demanding\\". Arriving in Britain just a few days ahead of the news about the attack on Fort Sumter, Yancey and his delegation met informally with British foreign secretary Lord John Russell on May 3 and May 9. Yancey emphasized the points from his instructions and denied, upon being questioned by Russell, that there was any intent to reopen the slave trade. Russell was non-committal, and on May 12, Queen Victoria announced British neutrality combined with recognition that a state of belligerency existed. After news arrived of the Confederate victory at Bull Run, Yancey attempted to arrange another meeting with Russell, but he was forced to present his arguments in writing. Doyle argues that Yancey blundered badly by extolling the benefits of slavery to the world in general and Britain in particular.Doyle, The Cause of All Nations (2014) p 45 In an August 24 response directed to the representatives \\"of the so-styled Confederate States of America\\", Russell merely reiterated the previous determination to remain neutral. Critics maintain that the Yancey mission failed to adequately exploit openings presented by Union Secretary of State William Seward's antagonist attitude towards Great Britain or to address British concerns concerning the effect of the war on Great Britain. In late August, with little else to do, Yancey submitted his resignation but, due to the events of the Trent Affair, Yancey did not leave until his replacements, James M. Mason and John Slidell (selected by President Davis in July before he was aware of Yancey's intent), arrived in January 1862. Yancey did make one further attempt to meet with Russell in the wake of the Trent affair, but Russell replied to the delegation that \\"we must decline to enter into any official communication with them.\\". While Yancey was originally optimistic about his mission, his observations in conversations and in the British papers forced him to conclude that the slavery issue was the primary obstacle to formal diplomatic recognition. He told his brother, \\"Anti-slavery sentiment is universal. Uncle Tom's Cabin has been read and believed....I ought never to have come here. This kind of thing does not suit me. I do not understand these people or their ways well enough.\\"Doyle, The Cause of All Nations (2014) p 46 =Confederate Senate= While still in England, Yancey was elected to the Confederate Senate. His return home, because of the Union blockade, found him landing at the Sabine Pass near the Texas and Louisiana border. On his way to Richmond, he stopped in New Orleans where he made a public speech lamenting the fact that Europe looked down on the Confederacy over the issue of slavery, stating, \\"We cannot look for any sympathy or help from abroad. We must rely on ourselves alone.\\". From March 28, 1862, until May 1, 1863, Yancey served in three sessions of the Confederate Congress. While there, he reluctantly supported the Confederate Conscription Act of April 16, 1862, but was instrumental in allowing many state exemptions to the draft as well as the unpopular exemption for one overseer for every twenty slaves, an exemption that applied to about 30,000 men. He unsuccessfully argued against the excessive use of secret, unrecorded sessions of Congress and generally pursued a states' rights position in regard to the exercise of national war powers in general and impressment of supplies and slaves by the federal Confederate government in particular. On military matters, Yancey wanted details provided to Congress on reports of execution without trials of Confederate soldiers by General Braxton Bragg, questioned the reasons Virginia had twenty-nine brigadier generals while Alabama only had four, authored a resolution condemning drunkenness within the army, and joined in demands that Davis account for complaints on the military administration of the Trans-Mississippi District.. Yancey gradually ran afoul of President Davis on matters of policy, although he was not one of Davis's most extreme critics. Their differences accelerated in a series of letters exchanged after May 1863, and no final resolution was reached. In Congress, Yancey and Benjamin Hill of Georgia, who had previously clashed in 1856, had their differences over a bill intended to create the Confederate Supreme Court erupt into physical violence. Hill hit Yancey in the head with a glass inkstand, knocking Yancey over a desk, and onto the floor of the Senate. The physical attack on Yancey by Hill within the Confederate Congress was kept secret for months, and in the ensuing investigation it was Yancey, not Hill, who was censured..\\"That D----d Brownlow\\", Steve Humphrey. Appalachian Consortium Press, 1978. p. 303. Yancey returned to Alabama in May 1863, before Congress had adjourned. By the end of June, Yancey was extremely ill from his injures received during the attack by Hill in the Confederate Congress, but he still continued his correspondence with President Davis and others. Finally on July 27, 1863, two weeks before his forty-ninth birthday, Yancey died of kidney disease. Yancey's funeral on July 29, 1863, brought the city of Montgomery to a standstill, and he was buried at Oakwood cemetery on Goat Hill near the original Confederate Capitol.. Memorials The William Lowndes Yancey Law Office in Montgomery, Alabama, was designated a National Historic Landmark of the United States in 1973. Due to unauthorized interior renovations, it was later de-designated, but it remains listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

An everyday example of a rotating reference frame is the surface of the Earth. (This article considers only frames rotating about a fixed axis. For more general rotations, see Euler angles.) In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black ball moves in a straight line. However, the observer (red dot) who is standing in the rotating/non-inertial frame of reference (lower part of the picture) sees the object as following a curved path due to the Coriolis and centrifugal forces present in this frame. Fictitious forces All non-inertial reference frames exhibit fictitious forces; rotating reference frames are characterized by three: * the centrifugal force, * the Coriolis force, and, for non-uniformly rotating reference frames, * the Euler force. Scientists in a rotating box can measure the speed and direction of their rotation by measuring these fictitious forces. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show the Coriolis force that results from Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If Earth were to rotate many times faster, these fictitious forces could be felt by humans, as they are when on a spinning carousel. Relating rotating frames to stationary frames The following is a derivation of the formulas for accelerations as well as fictitious forces in a rotating frame. It begins with the relation between a particle's coordinates in a rotating frame and its coordinates in an inertial (stationary) frame. Then, by taking time derivatives, formulas are derived that relate the velocity of the particle as seen in the two frames, and the acceleration relative to each frame. Using these accelerations, the fictitious forces are identified by comparing Newton's second law as formulated in the two different frames. = Relation between positions in the two frames = To derive these fictitious forces, it's helpful to be able to convert between the coordinates left( x',y',z' right) of the rotating reference frame and the coordinates left( x, y, z right) of an inertial reference frame with the same origin. If the rotation is about the z axis with a constant angular velocity Omega, or , and the two reference frames coincide at time t=0, the transformation from rotating coordinates to inertial coordinates can be written : x = x'cosleft(theta(t)right) - y'sinleft(theta(t)right) : y = x'sinleft(theta(t)right) + y'cosleft(theta(t)right) whereas the reverse transformation is : x' = xcosleft(-theta(t)right) - ysinleft( -theta(t) right) : y' = xsinleft( -theta(t)right) + ycosleft( -theta(t) right) This result can be obtained from a rotation matrix. Introduce the unit vectors hat{boldsymbol{imath}}, hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}, hat{boldsymbol{k}} representing standard unit basis vectors in the rotating frame. The time- derivatives of these unit vectors are found next. Suppose the frames are aligned at t = 0 and the z-axis is the axis of rotation. Then for a counterclockwise rotation through angle Ωt: : hat{boldsymbol{imath}}(t) = (costheta(t), sin theta(t) ) where the (x, y) components are expressed in the stationary frame. Likewise, : hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}(t) = (-sin theta(t), cos theta(t) )  . Thus the time derivative of these vectors, which rotate without changing magnitude, is : frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{imath}}(t) = Omega (-sin theta(t),  cos theta(t))= Omega hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}  ; : frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}(t) = Omega (-cos theta(t),  -sin theta(t))= - Omega hat{boldsymbol{imath}}  , where Omega equiv frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}theta(t). This result is the same as found using a vector cross product with the rotation vector boldsymbol{Omega} pointed along the z-axis of rotation boldsymbol{Omega}=(0, 0, Omega), namely, : frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{u}} = boldsymbol{Omega times}hat {boldsymbol{ u}}  , where hat {boldsymbol{ u}} is either hat{boldsymbol{imath}} or hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}. = Time derivatives in the two frames = Introduce the unit vectors hat{boldsymbol{imath}}, hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}, hat{boldsymbol{k}} representing standard unit basis vectors in the rotating frame. As they rotate they will remain normalized. If we let them rotate at the speed of Omega about an axis boldsymbol {Omega} then each unit vector hat{boldsymbol{u}} of the rotating coordinate system abides by the following equation: : frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{u}}=boldsymbol{Omega times hat{u}}  . Then if we have a vector function boldsymbol{f}, : boldsymbol{f}(t)=f_x(t) hat{boldsymbol{imath}}+f_y(t) hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}+f_z(t) hat{boldsymbol{k}} , and we want to examine its first derivative we have (using the product rule of differentiation): :begin{align} frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}boldsymbol{f} &= frac{mathrm{d}f_x}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{imath}} + frac{mathrm{d}hat{boldsymbol{imath}}}{mathrm{d}t}f_x + frac{mathrm{d}f_y}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{jmath}} + frac{mathrm{d}hat{boldsymbol{jmath}}}{mathrm{d}t}f_y + frac{mathrm{d}f_z}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{k}} + frac{mathrm{d}hat{boldsymbol{k}}}{mathrm{d}t}f_z  &= frac{mathrm{d}f_x}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{imath}} + frac{mathrm{d}f_y}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{jmath}} + frac{mathrm{d}f_z}{mathrm{d}t}hat{boldsymbol{k}} + left[boldsymbol{Omega} times left(f_x hat{boldsymbol{imath}} + f_y hat{boldsymbol{jmath}} + f_z hat{boldsymbol{k}}right)right]  &= left( frac{mathrm{d}boldsymbol{f}}{mathrm{d}t}right)_r+boldsymbol{Omega times f}(t) end{align} where left( frac{mathrm{d}boldsymbol{f}}{mathrm{d}t}right)_r is the rate of change of boldsymbol{f} as observed in the rotating coordinate system. As a shorthand the differentiation is expressed as: :frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}boldsymbol{f} = left[ left(frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t}right)_r + boldsymbol{Omega times} right] boldsymbol{f}  . This result is also known as the Transport Theorem in analytical dynamics and is also sometimes referred to as the Basic Kinematic Equation. = Relation between velocities in the two frames = A velocity of an object is the time-derivative of the object's position, or :mathbf{v}  stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} frac{mathrm{d}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t} The time derivative of a position boldsymbol{r}(t) in a rotating reference frame has two components, one from the explicit time dependence due to motion of the particle itself, and another from the frame's own rotation. Applying the result of the previous subsection to the displacement boldsymbol{r}(t), the velocities in the two reference frames are related by the equation : mathbf{v_i}  stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} frac{mathrm{d}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t} = left( frac{mathrm{d}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t} right)_{mathrm{r}} + boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r} = mathbf{v}_{mathrm{r}} + boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r}  , where subscript i means the inertial frame of reference, and r means the rotating frame of reference. = Relation between accelerations in the two frames = Acceleration is the second time derivative of position, or the first time derivative of velocity : mathbf{a}_{mathrm{i}}  stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} left( frac{mathrm{d}^{2}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t^{2}}right)_{mathrm{i}} = left( frac{mathrm{d}mathbf{v}}{mathrm{d}t} right)_{mathrm{i}} = left[ left( frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t} right)_{mathrm{r}} + boldsymbolOmega times right] left[ left( frac{mathrm{d}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t} right)_{mathrm{r}} + boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r} right]  , where subscript i means the inertial frame of reference. Carrying out the differentiations and re-arranging some terms yields the acceleration relative to the rotating reference frame, mathbf{a}_{mathrm{r}} : mathbf{a}_{mathrm{r}} = mathbf{a}_{mathrm{i}} - 2 boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{v}_{mathrm{r}} - boldsymbolOmega times (boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r}) - frac{mathrm{d}boldsymbolOmega}{mathrm{d}t} times mathbf{r} where mathbf{a}_{mathrm{r}}  stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} left( frac{mathrm{d}^{2}mathbf{r}}{mathrm{d}t^{2}} right)_{mathrm{r}} is the apparent acceleration in the rotating reference frame, the term -boldsymbolOmega times (boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r}) represents centrifugal acceleration, and the term -2 boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{v}_{mathrm{r}} is the Coriolis acceleration. The last term (-frac{mathrm{d}boldsymbolOmega}{mathrm{d}t} times mathbf{r}) is the Euler acceleration and is zero in uniformly rotating frames. = Newton's second law in the two frames = When the expression for acceleration is multiplied by the mass of the particle, the three extra terms on the right- hand side result in fictitious forces in the rotating reference frame, that is, apparent forces that result from being in a non-inertial reference frame, rather than from any physical interaction between bodies. Using Newton's second law of motion mathbf{F}=mmathbf{a}, we obtain: * the Coriolis force : mathbf{F}_{mathrm{Coriolis}} = -2m boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{v}_{mathrm{r}} * the centrifugal force : mathbf{F}_{mathrm{centrifugal}} = -mboldsymbolOmega times (boldsymbolOmega times mathbf{r}) * and the Euler force : mathbf{F}_{mathrm{Euler}} = -mfrac{mathrm{d}boldsymbolOmega}{mathrm{d}t} times mathbf{r} where m is the mass of the object being acted upon by these fictitious forces. Notice that all three forces vanish when the frame is not rotating, that is, when boldsymbol{Omega} = 0  . For completeness, the inertial acceleration mathbf{a}_{mathrm{i}} due to impressed external forces mathbf{F}_{mathrm{imp}} can be determined from the total physical force in the inertial (non-rotating) frame (for example, force from physical interactions such as electromagnetic forces) using Newton's second law in the inertial frame: : mathbf{F}_{mathrm{imp}} = m mathbf{a}_{mathrm{i}} Newton's law in the rotating frame then becomes ::mathbf{F_r} = mathbf{F}_{mathrm{imp}} +mathbf{F}_{mathrm{centrifugal}} +mathbf{F}_{mathrm{Coriolis}}+mathbf{F}_{mathrm{Euler}} = mmathbf{a_r}  . In other words, to handle the laws of motion in a rotating reference frame: Centrifugal force In classical mechanics, centrifugal force is an outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (also known as inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made. Coriolis effect Figure 1: In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black object moves in a straight line. However, the observer (red dot) who is standing in the rotating frame of reference (lower part of the picture) sees the object as following a curved path. The mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by a French scientist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis in connection with hydrodynamics, and also in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology. Perhaps the most commonly encountered rotating reference frame is the Earth. Moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern. Movements of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean are notable examples of this behavior: rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator, and to the left of this direction south of the equator. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology). Euler force In classical mechanics, the Euler acceleration (named for Leonhard Euler), also known as azimuthal acceleration or transverse acceleration is an acceleration that appears when a non-uniformly rotating reference frame is used for analysis of motion and there is variation in the angular velocity of the reference frame's axis. This article is restricted to a frame of reference that rotates about a fixed axis. The Euler force is a fictitious force on a body that is related to the Euler acceleration by F = ma, where a is the Euler acceleration and m is the mass of the body. Use in magnetic resonance It is convenient to consider magnetic resonance in a frame that rotates at the Larmor frequency of the spins. This is illustrated in the animation below. The rotating wave approximation may also be used. Animation showing the rotating frame. The red arrow is a spin in the Bloch sphere which precesses in the laboratory frame due to a static magnetic field. In the rotating frame the spin remains still until a resonantly oscillating magnetic field drives magnetic resonance.

The token is used in addition to or in place of a password. It acts like an electronic key to access something. Examples include a wireless keycard opening a locked door, or in the case of a customer trying to access their bank account online, the use of a bank- provided token can prove that the customer is who they claim to be. Some tokens may store cryptographic keys that may be used to generate a digital signature, or biometric data, such as fingerprint details. Some may also store passwords. Some designs incorporate tamper resistant packaging, while others may include small keypads to allow entry of a PIN or a simple button to start a generating routine with some display capability to show a generated key number. Connected tokens utilize a variety of interfaces including USB, near- field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), or Bluetooth. Some tokens have an audio capability designed for vision-impaired people.  Password types  All tokens contain some secret information that is used to prove identity. There are four different ways in which this information can be used: Asynchronous password token for online banking. ; Static password token:The device contains a password which is physically hidden (not visible to the possessor), but which is transmitted for each authentication. This type is vulnerable to replay attacks. ; Synchronous dynamic password token:A timer is used to rotate through various combinations produced by a cryptographic algorithm. The token and the authentication server must have synchronized clocks. ; Asynchronous password token: A one-time password is generated without the use of a clock, either from a one-time pad or cryptographic algorithm. ; Challenge response token: Using public key cryptography, it is possible to prove possession of a private key without revealing that key. The authentication server encrypts a challenge (typically a random number, or at least data with some random parts) with a public key; the device proves it possesses a copy of the matching private key by providing the decrypted challenge. = One-time passwords = Time-synchronized one-time passwords change constantly at a set time interval; e.g., once per minute. To do this some sort of synchronization must exist between the client's token and the authentication server. For disconnected tokens this time-synchronization is done before the token is distributed to the client. Other token types do the synchronization when the token is inserted into an input device. The main problem with time-synchronized tokens is that they can, over time, become unsynchronized. However, some such systems, such as RSA's SecurID, allow the user to resynchronize the server with the token, sometimes by entering several consecutive passcodes. Most also cannot have replaceable batteries and only last up to 5 years before having to be replaced – so there is additional cost. Another type of one-time password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate a series of one-time passwords from a secret shared key. Each password is unguessable, even when previous passwords are known. The open source OAuth algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are covered by US patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent of previous ones, whereby an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with knowledge of all previous passwords. Physical types Tokens can contain chips with functions varying from very simple to very complex, including multiple authentication methods. The simplest security tokens do not need any connection to a computer. The tokens have a physical display; the authenticating user simply enters the displayed number to log in. Other tokens connect to the computer using wireless techniques, such as Bluetooth. These tokens transfer a key sequence to the local client or to a nearby access point. Alternatively, another form of token that has been widely available for many years is a mobile device which communicates using an out-of-band channel (like voice, SMS, or USSD). Still other tokens plug into the computer, and may require a PIN. Depending on the type of the token, the computer OS will then either read the key from the token and perform a cryptographic operation on it, or ask the token's firmware to perform this operation. A related application is the hardware dongle required by some computer programs to prove ownership of the software. The dongle is placed in an input device and the software accesses the I/O device in question to authorize the use of the software in question. Commercial solutions are provided by a variety of vendors, each with their own proprietary (and often patented) implementation of variously used security features. Token designs meeting certain security standards are certified in the United States as compliant with FIPS 140, a federal security standard. Tokens without any kind of certification are sometimes viewed as suspect, as they often do not meet accepted government or industry security standards, have not been put through rigorous testing, and likely cannot provide the same level of cryptographic security as token solutions which have had their designs independently audited by third-party agencies. = Disconnected tokens = PASSCODE field by hand. Disconnected tokens have neither a physical nor logical connection to the client computer. They typically do not require a special input device, and instead use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which the user enters manually themselves via a keyboard or keypad. Disconnected tokens are the most common type of security token used (usually in combination with a password) in two-factor authentication for online identification. = Connected tokens = Connected tokens are tokens that must be physically connected to the computer with which the user is authenticating. Tokens in this category automatically transmit the authentication information to the client computer once a physical connection is made, eliminating the need for the user to manually enter the authentication information. However, in order to use a connected token, the appropriate input device must be installed. The most common types of physical tokens are smart cards and USB tokens, which require a smart card reader and a USB port respectively. Increasingly, Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) tokens, supported by the open specification group FIDO Alliance have become popular for consumers with mainstream browser support beginning in 2015 and supported by popular websites and social media sites. Older PC card tokens are made to work primarily with laptops. Type II PC Cards are preferred as a token as they are half as thick as Type III. The audio jack port is a relatively practical method to establish connection between mobile devices, such as iPhone, iPad and Android, and other accessories. The most well known device is called Square, a credit card reader for iPhone and Android. Some use a special purpose interface (e.g. the crypto ignition key deployed by the United States National Security Agency). Tokens can also be used as a photo ID card. Cell phones and PDAs can also serve as security tokens with proper programming.  Smart cards  Many connected tokens use smart card technology. Smart cards can be very cheap (around ten cents) and contain proven security mechanisms (as used by financial institutions, like cash cards). However, computational performance of smart cards is often rather limited because of extreme low power consumption and ultra-thin form-factor requirements. Smart- card-based USB tokens which contain a smart card chip inside provide the functionality of both USB tokens and smart cards. They enable a broad range of security solutions and provide the abilities and security of a traditional smart card without requiring a unique input device. From the computer operating system's point of view such a token is a USB-connected smart card reader with one non-removable smart card present.Specification for Integrated Circuit(s) Cards Interface Devices , usb.org = Contactless tokens = Unlike connected tokens, contactless tokens form a logical connection to the client computer but do not require a physical connection. The absence of the need for physical contact makes them more convenient than both connected and disconnected tokens. As a result, contactless tokens are a popular choice for keyless entry systems and electronic payment solutions such as Mobil Speedpass, which uses RFID to transmit authentication info from a keychain token. However, there have been various security concerns raised about RFID tokens after researchers at Johns Hopkins University and RSA Laboratories discovered that RFID tags could be easily cracked and cloned. Another downside is that contactless tokens have relatively short battery lives; usually only 5–6 years, which is low compared to USB tokens which may last more than 10 years. Some tokens however do allow the batteries to be changed, thus reducing costs.  Bluetooth tokens  The Bluetooth Low Energy protocols serve for long lasting battery lifecycle of wireless transmission. * The transmission of inherent Bluetooth identity data is the lowest quality for supporting authentication. * A bidirectional connection for transactional data interchange serves for the most sophisticated authentication procedures. However the automatic transmission power control antagonizes to attempts for radial distance estimates. The escape is available apart from the standardised Bluetooth power control algorithm to provide a calibration on minimally required transmission power. Bluetooth tokens are often combined with a USB token, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. Bluetooth authentication works when closer than 32 feet (10 meters). When the Bluetooth link is not properly operable, the token may be inserted into a USB input device to function. Another combination is with smart card to store locally larger amounts of identity data and process information as well. Another is a contactless BLE token that combines secure storage and tokenized release of fingerprint credentials. In the USB mode of operation sign-off requires care for the token while mechanically coupled to the USB plug. The advantage with the Bluetooth mode of operation is the option of combining sign-off with distance metrics. Respective products are in preparation, following the concepts of electronic leash.  NFC tokens  Near-field communication (NFC) tokens combined with a Bluetooth token may operate in several modes, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. NFC authentication works when closer than 1 foot (0.3 meters). The NFC protocol bridges short distances to the reader while the Bluetooth connection serves for data provision with the token to enable authentication. Also when the Bluetooth link is not connected, the token may serve the locally stored authentication information in coarse positioning to the NFC reader and relieves from exact positioning to a connector. = Single sign-on software tokens = Some types of single sign-on (SSO) solutions, like enterprise single sign-on, use the token to store software that allows for seamless authentication and password filling. As the passwords are stored on the token, users need not remember their passwords and therefore can select more secure passwords, or have more secure passwords assigned. Usually most tokens store a cryptographic hash of the password so that if the token is compromised, the password is still protected. = Programmable tokens = Programmable tokens are marketed as \\"drop-in\\" replacement of mobile applications such as Google Authenticator (miniOTPProgrammable hardware tokens Token2 miniOTP). They can be used as mobile app replacement, as well as in parallel as a backup.  Vulnerabilities  Any means and measures for securing data may be overcome. This applies as well for security tokens. The major threat is by incautious operation. Users shall be aware of permanent options of threat. = Loss and theft = The simplest vulnerability with any password container is theft or loss of the device. The chances of this happening, or happening unawares, can be reduced with physical security measures such as locks, electronic leash, or body sensor and alarm. Stolen tokens can be made useless by using two factor authentication. Commonly, in order to authenticate, a personal identification number (PIN) must be entered along with the information provided by the token the same time as the output of the token. = Attacking = Any system which allows users to authenticate via an untrusted network (such as the Internet) is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this type of attack, a fraudster acts as the \\"go-between\\" of the user and the legitimate system, soliciting the token output from the legitimate user and then supplying it to the authentication system themselves. Since the token value is mathematically correct, the authentication succeeds and the fraudster is granted access. Citibank made headline news in 2006 when its hardware-token-equipped business users became the victims of a large Ukrainian-based man-in-the-middle phishing attack. = Breach of codes = In 2012, the Prosecco research team at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt developed an efficient method of extracting the secret key from several PKCS #11 cryptographic devices, including the SecurID 800. These findings were documented in INRIA Technical Report RR-7944, ID hal-00691958, and published at CRYPTO 2012.  Digital signature  Trusted as a regular hand-written signature, the digital signature must be made with a private key known only to the person authorized to make the signature. Tokens that allow secure on-board generation and storage of private keys enable secure digital signatures, and can also be used for user authentication, as the private key also serves as a proof of the user’s identity. For tokens to identify the user, all tokens must have some kind of number that is unique. Not all approaches fully qualify as digital signatures according to some national laws. Tokens with no on-board keyboard or another user interface cannot be used in some signing scenarios, such as confirming a bank transaction based on the bank account number that the funds are to be transferred to.

Career He practised in Lichfield, and it was by his advice that Dr Johnson, when a child, was taken by his mother to be touched by Queen Anne for the king's evil on 30 March 1714. As a physician, Floyer was best known for introducing the practice of pulse rate measurement, and creating a special watch for this purpose. He was an advocate of cold bathing, and gave an early account of the pathological changes in the lungs associated with emphysema.

It is so named because of the location of four academic institutions within its boundaries — Rutgers University (Newark Campus), the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the New Jersey Medical School (Rutgers), and Essex County College. In total, the schools enroll approximately 35,000 degree-seeking students. The University Heights neighborhood is roughly bounded by University Avenue to the east, Orange Street to the north, Bergen Street to the west, and South Orange Avenue to the south. The schools are involved in the development of University Heights Science Park, a major research complex to be located between their campuses.

Biography After attending high school in his native city Flügel studied theology and philosophy in Leipzig. He soon discovered his passion for oriental languages, which he studied in Vienna and Paris. In 1832 he became a professor at the Fürstenschule (Ducal or Princely school) of St. Afra in Meissen. However, he resigned in 1850 on health grounds. From 1851 he worked at the Fürstenbibliothek in Vienna on the cataloguing of Arabic, Turkish and Persian manuscripts. In December 1857 he became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg and, in 1859, a full member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. In 1864 he was admitted as a foreign member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Flügel 's main work was the creation of a bibliographic and encyclopaedic lexicon of Haji Khalfa, with Latin translation (London and Leipzig, 1835-1858). Particular importance was attached to his edition of the Qur’ān, printed in Leipzig (1834 and 1893) by the printer and publisher Carl Christoph Traugott Tauchnitz. This made a reliable Quranic text available for the first time to European science. In the following years, almost all translations into European languages were based on Flügel's edition.

The term leg press machine refers to the apparatus used to perform this exercise. The leg press can be used to evaluate an athlete's overall lower body strength (from knee joint to hip). It can help to build squat strength. If performed correctly, the inclined leg press can help develop knees to manage heavier free weights, on the other hand, it has the potential to inflict grave injury: the knees could bend the wrong way if they are locked during the exercise. It can be performed in variations, for example with one leg, or attaching bands to the leg press.  Types  Incline leg press There are two main types of leg press: * The diagonal (incline) or vertical 'sled' type leg press. Weight plates are attached directly to the sled, which is mounted on rails. The user sits below the sled and pushes it upward with their feet. These machines normally include adjustable safety brackets that prevent the user from being trapped under the weight. * The 'cable' type leg press, or 'seated leg press', commonly found on multigyms. The user sits upright and pushes forward with their feet onto a plate that is attached to the weight stack by means of a long steel cable.  Muscle groups  The leg press works the following muscle groups: *Quadriceps *Hamstring *Gluteus maximus *Calves (partially) Varying the angle between the sled and the backrest and/or the position of the feet on the plate puts more emphasis on one or the other muscle group.  Magnitude of leg press lifts  A loaded leg press machine, used for strength exercises of the lower body. As the diagonal leg press involves pushing a weight along an inclined track, rather than lifting it vertically, it is possible for strength trainers to press very heavy weight in comparison to other exercises.

It is based on the book written by Pat Reid, a British army officer who was imprisoned in Oflag IV-C, Colditz Castle, in Germany during the Second World War and who was the Escape Officer for British POWs within the castle. Plot During World War II, the Germans transformed Colditz Castle into a high security prisoner-of-war camp called Oflag IV-C. Its purpose was to restrain those Allied prisoners who had attempted to escape from other Oflags and so Colditz housed various nationalities who were mainly British, Dutch, French and Polish. Among the British prisoners are Pat Reid (John Mills) and Senior British Officer Colonel Richmond (Eric Portman). Richmond is warned by the Kommandant (Frederick Valk) that \\"escaping is verboten\\" but Richmond has no intention of heeding this advice. All the prisoners are wary of Priem (Denis Shaw), the chief security officer, who is efficient and tenacious. Reid and other British officers attempt to open a manhole cover one night but are foiled by a simultaneous French attempt which alerts the German guards. Reid and La Tour (Eugene Deckers) argue about the lack of co-operation, both blaming the other. Later, a British tunnel is making progress until it meets another being dug by the Dutch officers and a collapse occurs. Richmond decides to act and proposes the creation by each nationality of escape officers who must liaise at all times to make sure attempts do not interfere with each other. Reid accepts the post for the British contingent. Soon afterwards, Winslow (Bryan Forbes) is hidden among palliasses being taken out of the castle and is not immediately caught. Richmond gains agreement for his own escape plan which hinges on his impersonation of a feldwebel called Franz Josef. This seems to be succeeding until, at the key moment, the German guards emerge and arrest all concerned. Tyler (Lionel Jeffries) is shot and wounded. Richmond, Reid and a dozen others are placed in solitary for a month and the likelihood of an informer is first discussed. This turns out to be the case when one of the Polish officers, whose family have been threatened by the Gestapo, is found to be collaborating with the guards and betraying escape plans. After two weeks on the run, Winslow is recaptured and returned to Colditz. While he is in the solitary compound, he talks to La Tour during a physical exercise session and watches as La Tour, helped by a compatriot, leaps over the barbed wire fence. Winslow runs into a guard to stop him shooting La Tour who runs to freedom. Soon afterwards, Richmond expresses annoyance that no British officer has yet made a complete escape. Reid's friend McGill (Christopher Rhodes) approaches Richmond with a new plan but says he will only disclose it if Richmond will relieve Reid from his escape officer duties so that McGill and Reid can make the attempt together. Richmond agrees and McGill convinces Reid that the plan is feasible. The escapees will be disguised as German officers but will approach the guards from the direction of the German mess. McGill argues that previous attempts have failed because the escapees came from the wrong direction. The attempt will coincide with a revue being staged in the castle theatre, to which all senior German officers are being invited. McGill is very tall and has antagonised the guards many times by reckless behaviour. Richmond realises that he will be too conspicuous and asks him to stand down so that other officers including Reid will have a good chance of making the plan work. McGill accepts Richmond's reasoning but is devastated. Next day, he attempts to scale the wire fence surrounding the exercise compound and is shot dead by the guards. Reid, on learning of Richmond's decision, says he will not let the escape attempt proceed but Richmond persuades him to do it for McGill's sake. The escape goes ahead as planned while the revue is being staged. Four men get out of the castle but two are soon recaptured. Several days later, Richmond receives a postcard with a cryptic message. He announces to the assembled and cheering prisoners that Reid and Winslow have successfully crossed into neutral Switzerland.

Speedway stations are located in 32 states, up significantly from its core seven-state region in the Midwest since 2012. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Marathon Petroleum Corporation and is the largest convenience store chain in central Ohio. History Speedway started as Speedway 79, the name of a gasoline chain based in Michigan for much of the first half of the 20th century. In 1959, Marathon, then known as the Ohio Oil Company, purchased the chain and in 1962 converted its outlets to the Marathon brand. As self-service gasoline became legalized in many states, Marathon decided to use \\"Speedway\\" (without the \\"79\\") at higher-volume self-service stations with convenience stores. The concept turned out to be one of the few bright spots for Marathon during this time, and the company quickly expanded this concept across Marathon's main territories across the Midwest and Southeastern United States. Part of this expansion was through the acquisition of various other smaller regional gasoline station chains, including GasAmerica, Starvin' Marvin, Gastown, Wake Up, Bonded, United, Cheker, Port, Ecol, and Value. These stations were converted to the Speedway branding. Stations acquired in the Cheker deal included former Enco stations that Cheker acquired after they were sold off by Exxon in 1977. In 1997, Marathon and Ashland Petroleum formed Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP), a joint venture which combined the companies' refining, marketing, and transportation businesses, with Marathon owning 62% of the operations while Ashland owned 38%. In the process, Ashland's SuperAmerica and Marathon's Speedway convenience store chains were merged to form Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MAP. At this time, Marathon acquired the rights to the Solo, Save Mart, Save More, and Rich brands from Ashland, along with others. Many of these brands would be converted to the Speedway brand over time. When the merger was completed in 1998, the Speedway and SuperAmerica brands began to market together. In 2005, Marathon purchased Ashland's share of Marathon Ashland Petroleum, which became Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, retaining the SuperAmerica and Rich brands that were originally owned by Ashland. At this time the locations outside the Upper Midwest were converted to \\"Speedway\\" and the \\"SuperAmerica\\" brand was restricted to the Upper Midwest market. Marathon sold SuperAmerica to Northern Tier Energy, a newly formed company backed by the private equity firms ACON Investments and TPG Capital, in February 2011. It is based in Woodbury, Minnesota. Speedway and SuperAmerica became unrelated chains until 7 years later, when Marathon bought Andeavor, who owns SuperAmerica's parent company Western Refining. Following the separation of Marathon's upstream and downstream operations in 2011, Speedway remained a part of Marathon's downstream operations. In 2001, Speedway's truck stop chain was merged into the Pilot Travel Centers brand after Marathon and Pilot Corporation entered into a partnership to form Pilot Travel Centers. Pilot has since bought out Marathon's interest in Pilot Travel Centers, now Pilot Flying J. Following its merger with Hess Corporation's retail chain in 2014, six WilcoHess locations in Virginia were rebranded as Pilot locations and jointly operated between Pilot Flying J and Speedway.Pilot Flying J Expands Diesel Network in Virginia Pilot Flying J (10/28/2014) On June 23, 2016, Pilot Flying J and Speedway announced a new joint venture between the two companies that will see 41 Speedway locations (all former Wilco Hess locations) and 79 Pilot Flying J locations primarily in the Southeastern United States form PFJ Southeast LLC. The locations will be operated by Pilot Flying J and the Speedway locations will be rebranded as either Pilot or Flying J. As of December 2, 2016, 12% of Speedway stores carry E85 Ethanol. Speedway currently has 326 stores with E85 available, and one store which carries CNG. Almost all of its stores in the Pittsburgh Metro as well as its stores in the state of Tennessee offer E85, greatly expanding the availability of the fuel in these respective markets. =Expansion since 2012= Hess stations, orange indicates both former Hess stations and states where Speedway was already expanding into organically prior to the Hess purchase, and blue from the former Andeavor properties, including the SuperAmerica chain that Speedway owned & operated from 1997 to 2011. Map of Speedway locations as of August 2020 (the date of the announced purchase by 7-Eleven). 2012–14 expansion On February 13, 2012, it was announced that a deal had been reached with Indiana and Ohio convenience store chain GasAmerica to acquire all 88 of its locations. Speedway also acquired all trademarks, trade dress and intellectual property from GasAmerica and included several parcels of undeveloped real estate for future development. The transaction was finalized on May 29, 2012, for an unspecified price. On June 5, 2012, it was reported that Speedway, LLC signed a deal with the convenience store chain Road Ranger. The deal gave Speedway nine Road Ranger stores in Kentucky, and one in Ohio, in exchange for cash and a truck stop in the Chicago metropolitan area. Rockford, IL-based Road Ranger operates approximately 80 truck stop and gasoline convenience store locations in seven Midwestern states. Like Speedway before it, Road Ranger has a partnership with Pilot Flying J.

Hess has 1,342 locations along the Eastern United States. Some Hess stations in the Northeastern United States originated as Merit Oil stations until Hess bought the company in 2000. Post Hess Expansion On April 30, 2018, Marathon agreed to buy Andeavor, an independent refinery and oil company based in the Western United States, for $23 billion. On October 1, 2018, the merger was completed. The merger brought all SuperAmerica locations once again under the ownership of Speedway. On April 16, 2018, it was announced that all 78 Express Mart locations were being re-branded as Speedway locations, which follows Marathon's acquisition of Express Mart, a chain based in Syracuse, NY that co- branded with competitors such as Sunoco and Mobil. Speedway and MPC closed on the acquisition of Express Mart in November 2018 after being required by the FTC to divest of 5 stores. In 2019 they purchased 33 NOCO Express locations in Western New York. On October 31, Marathon Petroleum has announced the plans of spinning off Speedway into an independent company.http://ir.marathonpetroleum.com/file/Index?KeyFile=400741555 On June 6, 2020, Dunkin' announced to close all Dunkin' Express locations at Speedway locations (which Speedway acquired as part of the acquisition of Hess retail business in 2014), by the end of the year. =Separation from Marathon and pending sale to Seven & i Holdings= In late 2018, Marathon announced their intentions to spin-off Speedway into an independent company by the end of 2020.https://ir.marathonpetroleum.com/investor/news-releases/news- details/2019/Marathon-Petroleum-Provides-Update-On-Strategic-Review-To- Enhance-Shareholder-Value/default.aspx In February 2020, it was reported that Seven & i Holdings, the parent company of convenience store chain 7-Eleven, planned to buy Speedway for $22 billion. However, due to investor concerns that the offer was too high, as well as the potential impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the economy, the company abandoned the idea the following month. Despite initially abandoning the acquisition, on August 2, 2020, Marathon announced that Seven & i Holdings would be acquiring Speedway for $21 billion. The deal is anticipated to close in early 2021 pending regulatory approval.  Public Relations  A corporate partner of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals since 1991, Speedway has raised more than $100 million over the past 26 years for the charity through a variety of fundraising activities. Speedway LLC raised $10.3 million for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals in 2017. Speedway was ranked the 4th worst company to work for in the United States in 2018, with work-life balance and senior management as major detractors to the work environment. These issues are highlighted in the memoir, \\"Corporate Lunacy; Behind the Scenes of America's Worst Gas Station\\" (written by Rob Clooney). In 2019, Speedway became the official fuel supplier of the IndyCar Series, and announced their endorsement of LPGA golfer Ally McDonald through 2020.

It was owned by Marathon Petroleum. The first convenience store opened in the 1960s. SuperAmerica had 278 stores with 271 in Minnesota, 11 in Wisconsin and 2 in South Dakota. History SuperAmerica convenience stores first opened in 1960 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. They were first operated by Northwestern Refining of St. Paul Park, Minnesota. SuperAmerica operated stations primarily in Minnesota, but also a number of locations in western Wisconsin and eastern South Dakota. The chain formerly operated stores in Florida, but these were sold to Shell Oil in 1993. Ashland Petroleum purchased Northwestern Refining and the SuperAmerica chain in the 1970s. Ashland had marketed full-service stations under its own \\"Ashland\\" brand. As self-service was legalized, it used the brands \\"Solo\\", \\"Save Mart\\", \\"Save More\\", and \\"Rich\\", along with others. Ashland converted most of its outlets in its core territory to \\"SuperAmerica\\", while withdrawing from Florida. It maintained a few outlets under its other brand names to keep the trademarks valid. In 1997, Marathon and Ashland Petroleum merged, forming Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP), a joint venture combining the companies' refining, marketing and transportation businesses, with Marathon owning 62% of the operations while Ashland owned 38%. In the process, Ashland's SuperAmerica and Marathon's Speedway LLC convenience store chains were merged to form Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MAP.

In February 2011, Marathon sold its SuperAmerica stores along with the Marathon refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota to Northern Tier Energy, a newly formed company backed by the private equity firms ACON Investments and TPG Capital. Northern Tier Energy went public in 2012. In 2013, Western Refining bought a controlling stake in Northern Tier Energy. In 2015, employees protested at the corporate headquarters in Woodbury, Minnesota, to lobby against low hourly wages and erratic employee scheduling. During the early 2010s, following the chain's purchase by Northern Tier Energy, the chain began to fall behind competitors. Shoppers reported rusting canopies, water damaged ceilings, broken tile floors, and malfunctioning soda machines . As SuperAmerica's primary competitor Holiday Stationstores continually invested in locations, SA stagnated. Upon Kwik Trip and Casey's entrance to the local market SA fell further behind . Holiday was generating twice as much revenue per store as SA. Furthermore, SA failed to further develop its food service offerings like their competitors did in the 2010s . On October 11, 2018, it was announced on the chain's webpage that SuperAmerica locations were being rebranded as Speedway locations. This decision follows Marathon's acquisition of SuperAmerica beginning in May 2018.  Rewards programs  SuperAmerica maintained a rewards program for customers called \\"My SA Rewards.\\" Points in the program were redeemable for discounts in gasoline purchase or on other purchases in stores. The rewards program offered 3 cents off per gallon of gasoline. From 2011 to 2016, the company accepted the coupons of competitors gas coupons. The company also offered its own credit card to reduce cost of gasoline by 5 cents per gallon. The credit card was offered to customers in partnership with the bank First Bankcard.

Biography He was born at Barby, near Magdeburg. He started his career as a merchant's clerk. In 1810, he emigrated to the United States, where he engaged in business, diplomatic and official occupations. He made a special study of the English language, and returning to Germany in 1819, was in 1824 appointed lector of the English language in the University of Leipzig. In 1838 he became American consul, and subsequently representative and correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D.C., and several other leading American literary and scientific institutions. He died at Leipzig on 24 June 1855. Works The fame of Flügel rests chiefly on the Vollständige englisch-deutsche und deutsch-englische Wörterbuch, first published in two volumes (Leipzig) in 1830, which has had an extensive circulation not only in Germany but in England and America. In this work he was assisted by J. Sporschil, and a new and enlarged edition, edited by his son Felix Flügel (1820–1904), was published at Brunswick (1890–1892). Another edition, in two volumes, edited by Prof. Immanuel Schmidt and S. Tanger, appeared (Brunswick, London & New York) in 1906. Among his other works are: *Vollständige engl. Sprachlehre (1824–1826) *Triglotte, oder kaufmännisches Wörterbuch in drei Sprachen, Deutsch, Englisch und Französisch (1836–1840) *Kleines Kaufmännisches Handwörterbuch in drei Sprachen (1840) *Praktisches Handbuch der engl. Handelscorrespondenz (1827, 9th ed. 1873) All these have passed through several editions. In addition, Flügel also published in the English language: A series of Commercial Letters (Leipzig, 1822), a 9th edition of which appeared in 1874 under the title Practical Mercantile Correspondence and a Practical Dictionary of the English and German Languages (2 vols, Hamburg and Leipzig, 1847–1852; 15th ed., Leipzig, 1891).

Referendums may be held on special occasions. Ukraine has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which often not a single party has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Legislation Elections in Ukraine are held to choose the President (head of state) and Verkhovna Rada (legislature). The president is elected for a five-year term.

Half of the representatives were elected from national closed party lists distributed between the parties using the Hare quota with a 5% threshold. The remaining half were elected from constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. This system was adopted for the 2012 elections and was also used for the 2014 election, as a new draft law moving to electing all members using open party lists failed to gather necessary support in the Rada. According to current law, the next election to the Verkhovna Rada (to be held) in 2023 will again be without single-member constituencies and instead deputies can only be elected on a party list in one nationwide constituency with a 5% election threshold with open regional lists of candidates for deputies.

By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since Leonid Kuchma left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the Party of Regions being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the People's Movement of Ukraine, political leadership in the non- communist camp was taken over by Our Ukraine bloc and Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko. In the elections since 2002 voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts voted mostly for parties (Our Ukraine, Batkivshchyna, UDAR, Self Reliance, Radical Party, Petro Poroshenko Bloc and the People's Front) and presidential candidates (Viktor Yuschenko, Yulia Tymoshenko) with a pro- Western and state reform platform, while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts of Ukraine voted for parties (CPU, Party of Regions and Opposition Bloc) and presidential candidates (Viktor Yanukovych) with a pro-Russian and status quo platform.Центральна виборча комісія України - WWW відображення ІАС \\"Вибори народних депутатів України 2012\\" Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe by Uwe Backes and Patrick Moreau, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2008, (page 396)Ukraine right-wing politics: is the genie out of the bottle?, openDemocracy.net (January 3, 2011)Eight Reasons Why Ukraine’s Party of Regions Will Win the 2012 Elections by Taras Kuzio, The Jamestown Foundation (17 October 2012) UKRAINE: Yushchenko needs Tymoshenko as ally again by Taras Kuzio, Oxford Analytica (5 October 2007)After the parliamentary elections in Ukraine: a tough victory for the Party of Regions, Centre for Eastern Studies (7 November 2012) Although this geographical division is decreasing.Election winner lacks strong voter mandate, Kyiv Post (February 11, 2010) Ukraine's Party of Regions: A pyrrhic victory, EurActiv.com (16 November 2012) Ukraine vote ushers in new constellation of power, Deutsche Welle (30 October 2012) Till the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the electorate of CPU and Party of Regions was very loyal to them.

Because of the ongoing War in Donbass and the unilateral annexation of Crimea by Russia, the 2014 parliamentary elections were not held in Crimea and also not held in parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast.

Voter turnout in the presidential elections is always higher than for Verkhovna Rada elections with an average voter turnout of 72% from 2004 till 2010 (67.95% in the 2010 Presidential election). In the 2014 Presidential election the Central Election Commission of Ukraine set the turnout at over 60%; just as in the 2014 parliamentary elections, these elections were not held in Crimea and also not held in parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast.Poroshenko Declares Victory in Ukraine Presidential Election, The Wall Street Journal (25 May 2014) The most popular presidential elections were the first one in 1991 where nearly 30.6 million people voted and in the 2004 election which gathered some 28 million. There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 million votes: Leonid Kravchuk (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), Viktor Yushchenko (2004 - 11.1), and Viktor Yanukovych (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by Leonid Kuchma in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and Petro Poroshenko are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is Oleksandr Moroz who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each. Since the 1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election voter turnouts have been declining. 1994 75.81%, 1998 70.78%, 2002 69.27%, 2006 67.55%, 2007 62.03%, 2012 57.43%, 2014 51.91% and the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election at 49.84%. Perceived flaws in legislation Despite a clear system for declaring donations to campaign funds, officials and experts say that Ukraine's election law is consistently flouted, with spending from candidates’ official funds representing only a fraction of the amount truly spent while it is rarely clear where the funding comes from.More than $1 billion will be spent on campaign, but no one knows for sure, Kyiv Post (January 14, 2010) Early May 2009, the \\"Committee of Voters of Ukraine\\" stated they believe that the use of the state's administrative resources by political forces for their own national and local election campaigns is no longer a decisive factor in the outcome of Ukrainian elections.Committee Of Voters: Use Of State’s Administrative Resources No Longer Decisive Factor In Outcome Of Elections , Ukrainian News Agency (May 8, 2009) According to a survey of 2,000 people conducted in October 2010 by two Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations, the Democratic Initiatives Fund and OPORA, one in five Ukrainians were willing to sell his or her vote in the then upcoming 2010 Ukrainian local elections.Survey Shows Every Fifth Ukrainian Ready To Sell Vote, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (October 22, 2010) But according to (then) Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov these elections \\"were absolutely without the use of administrative resources, naturally.

He wrote a number of highly influential textbooks, and was particularly important in the development of the theory of instinct and of social psychology in the English-speaking world. He was an opponent of behaviourism and stands somewhat outside the mainstream of the development of Anglo-American psychological thought in the first half of the 20th century; but his work was very well-known and respected among lay people. Biography McDougall was educated at Owens College, Manchester and St John's College, Cambridge. He also studied medicine and physiology in London and Göttingen. After teaching at University College London and Oxford, he was recruited to occupy the William James chair of psychology at Harvard University in 1920, where he served as a professor of psychology from 1920 to 1927. He then moved to Duke University, where he established the Parapsychology Laboratory under J. B. Rhine, and where he remained until his death. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Among his students were Cyril Burt, May Smith, William Brown and John Flügel. McDougall's interests and sympathies were broad. He was interested in eugenics, but departed from neo- Darwinian orthodoxy in maintaining the possibility of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as suggested by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; he carried out many experiments designed to demonstrate this process.Berger, Arthur S. (1988). Portrait of William McDougall. In Lives and Letters in American Parapsychology: A Biographical History, 1850–1987. McFarland. pp. 118–124. Opposing behaviourism, he argued that behaviour was generally goal-oriented and purposive, an approach he called hormic psychology (from Greek ὁρμή hormḗ \\"impulse\\"). However, in the theory of motivation, he defended the idea that individuals are motivated by a significant number of inherited instincts, whose action they may not consciously understand, so they might not always understand their own goals. His ideas on instinct strongly influenced Konrad Lorenz , though Lorenz did not always acknowledge this . McDougall underwent psychoanalysis with C. G. Jung, and was also prepared to study parapsychology. Because of his interest in eugenics and his unorthodox stance on evolution, McDougall has been adopted as an iconic figure by proponents of a strong influence of inherited traits on behavior, some of whom are regarded by most mainstream psychologists as scientific racists. He wrote: > \\"...; the few distinguished Negroes, so called, of America – such as > Douglass, Booker Washington, Du Bois – have been, I believe, in all cases > mulattoes or had some proportion of white blood. We may fairly ascribe the > incapacity of the Negro race to form a nation to the lack of men endowed > with the qualities of great leaders, even more than to the lower level of > average capacity\\" (McDougall, William., The Group Mind, p.187, Arno Press, > 1973; Copyright, 1920 by G.P. Putnam's Sons). McDougall married at the age of 29 (\\"against my considered principles\\", he reports in his autobiographical essay, \\"for I held that a man whose chosen business in life was to develop to the utmost his intellectual powers should not marry before forty, if at all\\"). He had five children. McDougall's book The Group Mind received \\"very hostile reviews\\" from psychologists but sold well to the public. The American Press was critical of McDougall as his lectures on national eugenics were seen as racist. Psychical research McDougall was a strong advocate of the scientific method and academic professionalisation in psychical research. He was instrumental in establishing parapsychology as a university discipline in the US in the early 1930s.Asprem, E. (2010), \\"A Nice Arrangement of Heterodoxies: William McDougall and the Professionalization of Psychical Research\\", Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 46 (2):123–143. In 1920, McDougall served as president of the Society for Psychical Research, and in the subsequent year of its US counterpart, the American Society for Psychical Research. McDougall was a member of the Scientific American committee that investigated the medium Mina Crandon. He attended séances with the medium and was sceptical about her \\"ectoplasmic hand\\". He suspected that it was part of an animal, artificially manipulated to resemble a hand. McDougall's suspicion was confirmed by independent experts who had examined photographs of the hand. McDougall was critical of spiritualism, he believed that some of its proponents such as Arthur Conan Doyle misunderstood psychical research and \\"devote themselves to propaganda\\". In 1926, McDougall concluded \\"I have taken part in a considerable number of investigations of alleged supernormal phenomena; but hitherto have failed to find convincing evidence in any case, but have found rather much evidence of fraud and trickery.\\"Valentine, Elizabeth R. (2011). Spooks and Spoofs: Relations Between Psychical Research and Academic Psychology in Britain in the Inter-War Period. History of the Human Sciences 25: 67–90. McDougall, however, continued to encourage scientific research on psychic phenomena and in 1937 was a founding co-editor (with Joseph Banks Rhine) of the peer-reviewed Journal of Parapsychology, which continues to be published.  Animism  In 1911, McDougall authored Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism. In the work he rejected both materialism and Darwinism and supported a form of Lamarckism where mind guides evolution. McDougall defended a form of animism where all matter has a mental aspect; his views were very similar to panpsychism as he believed that there was an animating principle in matter and had claimed in his work that there were both psychological and biological evidence for this position.The New international encyclopaedia, Volume 7, Dodd, Mead and company, 1923, p. 282 McDougall had defended the theory that mind and the brain are distinct but interact with each other though he was not a dualist or a monist as he believed his theory of animism would replace both the philosophical views of dualism and monism.David Ray Griffin Parapsychology, philosophy, and spirituality: a postmodern exploration 1997, p. 139William McDougall Body and mind: a history and a defense of animism Methuen, 1911 As a parapsychologist he also claimed telepathy had been scientifically proven, he used evidence from psychic research as well as from biology and psychology to defend his theory of animism.Janet Oppenheim The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914 1988, pp. 263–264 McDougall produced another work attacking materialism titled Materialism and Emergent Evolution (1929). In the book he had also criticised the theory of emergent evolution as he claimed it had ignored the evidence of Lamarckism and had ignored the evidence of mind guiding evolution. McDougall's last work on the subject titled The Riddle of Life (1938) criticised organicism as according to McDougall even though the theory of organicism had rejected materialism it had not gone far enough in advocating an active role for a nonphysical principle.Peter J.

Thus, a car left out of gear will appear to be rolling uphill against gravity.University of California Riverside article on phenomenon There are hundreds of recognised gravity hills around the world. The slope of gravity hills is an optical illusion, Free full text although sites are often accompanied by claims that magnetic or supernatural forces are at work. The most important factor contributing to the illusion is a completely or mostly obstructed horizon. Without a horizon, it becomes difficult to judge the slope of a surface as a reliable reference is missing. Objects which one would normally assume to be more or less perpendicular to the ground, such as trees, may actually be leaning, offsetting the visual reference. The illusion is similar to the Ames room, in which objects can also appear to roll against gravity.

The reverse side includes the quotation, \\"...we have nothing to fear but fear itself\\" as well as an inscription of his signature. Wheaton Industries was a long-standing famous manufacturer of glassware and ceramics products in Millville, New Jersey, USA. A spin-off of the original firm (which returned to its pharmaceutical glass roots) adopted the name in 2006. Founded in 1888 by Dr. Theodore Corson Wheaton, it became a mainstay of the economy of southern New Jersey, which gained a reputation as the center of commercial glass manufacturing in the United States. The company was run by the Wheaton family for nearly its entire existence, and at its height it had 41 factories throughout the United States and subsidiaries in 20 other countries. Many of its vintage products continue to be collectors items. Formerly a subsidiary of Alcan Packaging as Wheaton Science Products, it was taken private in November 2006, and is once again known as Wheaton Industries. History The company was founded by Theodore C. Wheaton, a pharmacist and businessman, who in 1883 settled in Millville, in Cumberland County, New Jersey, southeast of Philadelphia. Southern New Jersey had by that time emerged as the center of U.S. glass manufacturing because of the prevalence of natural resources such as wood and silica sand. Wheaton became particularly interested in the manufacture of pharmaceutical glassware, and in 1888 he established a small factory on the outskirts of Millville to manufacture his own bottles. The company became known as the T.C. Wheaton Co. Anticipating future growth of the company, Wheaton purchased 25 square blocks in Millville in an area bounded by Third Street, Wheaton Avenue and north to railroad siding which allowed the company to expand over the following decades. Wheaton's son, Frank H. Wheaton, Sr., entered the company in 1889. Two years later, the company suffered a financial setback when T.C. Wheaton entered into a bad business venture that left the company with debts that took ten years to pay off. Frank Sr. assumed the presidency of the company in 1931 after the death of his father. He became known as the \\"dean of American glassware\\" during his tenure as company president. Despite the Great Depression, the company expanded greatly during the 1930s through the use of automation. The expansion continued through the 1940s and 1950s with acquisitions and new factory construction. The Millville facility became the basis of the local economy, employing family members over several generations throughout the 20th century. Frank Wheaton Jr. took over the management of the company from his father in 1966. Frank Sr. remained board chairman until his death at age 102 in 1983. While he was company president, Frank Jr. founded Wheaton Village, a non-profit living museum and artisan colony in Millville which preserves the heritage of traditional glassmaking in southern New Jersey. He was ousted by the board of directors in 1991 after a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. George J. Straubmuller III, who was married to T.C. Wheaton's granddaughter Elizabeth Anderson Straubmuller, was elected by the Board of Directors to replace Frank Wheaton Jr. as Chairman & CEO of Wheaton Industries. George Straubmuller had been the President of the Wheaton Tubing Products division and was the leader behind the creation, development and the decades of success from this division within Wheaton Industries. In 1996 the company was acquired by Algroup, a firm based in Switzerland, that was itself acquired by Alcan of Canada in 2000. Frank Jr. died in 1998. In 2002 the molded glass operation was spun off as The Glass Group Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in the summer of 2005. Its assets were purchased by India-based Gujarat Glass and Kimble Glass, a subsidiary of Gerresheimer, a German concern. Today Amcor Packaging of Australia now owns the glass tubing and plastic operations in Millville. Wheaton Science Products was spun off in late 2006 and was re-christened Wheaton Industries. In September 2015, a German company, DURAN Group GmbH, bought Wheaton Industries. Collectibles The original Wheaton Industries' large variety of products spawned a community of collectors with sales on sites such as eBay. Many of the company's products are on display at the Museum of American Glassware at Wheaton Village, which remains a popular tourist destination.  See also  * Schultz v. Wheaton Glass Co.

The series consists of fourteen games across different video game platforms. The series has been adapted into an anime. A remaster of the first installment is planned to be released in Japan in 2020. Story Before the world's continents broke up into pieces, a huge disaster hit the world. People prayed to God for help, and God created new life forms. However, new life forms brought new troubles, so God became exasperated and sealed them in \\"disc stones\\". Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of \\"disc stones\\". Today people still continue searching for these missing \\"disc stones\\" to unlock the lifeforms within. It is said that the \\"disc stones\\" are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began! As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world. Now ranchers across the globe come together and enter battle. Games Monster Rancher is often compared to Pokémon, though the two series play differently. While the Pokémon games are traditionally collection-based role-playing video games, Monster Rancher games tend to be simulated animal breeding games. The genre Monster Rancher occupies is shared by other simulation virtual pet games, such as Digimon, and games based on raising horses for racing, like in the Gallop Racer series, also by Tecmo. In the games, the player takes the role of a monster breeder whose goal is to raise monsters to fight in tournaments. The breeder must take it in hand to raise the monster throughout its life, training it, keeping it healthy, making an exercise schedule, and trying to maximize its abilities before it dies of old age or is retired. Monsters have good or bad morale depending on how they are raised; loyal monsters are more likely to perform critical hits, while disloyal monsters might refuse to obey commands or not fight at all. Retired monsters can be combined to create more powerful monsters. =Monster generation= Although not widely popular, the games do have a loyal cult following, mostly because of the games' innovative \\"unlocking\\" aspect. In Monster Rancher, Monster Rancher 2, Monster Rancher 3, Monster Rancher 4, and Monster Rancher EVO, monsters can be generated by inserting any CD into the game system. Monster Rancher 3, Monster Rancher 4, and Monster Rancher EVO can also use DVDs. The characteristics of the monster (such as stats, breed and traits) are determined by various numbers stored in the game. To generate a monster, a random number generator is needed to define what characteristics the monster will have. Tecmo created a CD-reading system that would use the discs to generate random number seeds and, consequently, a large variety of random monsters. The values found in the discs' data are mapped to monster characteristics. Some discs are designed to produce specific monsters, often thematically related to the disc in question. For instance, in Monster Rancher 4, the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets DVD (as well as the tie-in PlayStation 2 game) generates a unique owl monster, and in Monster Rancher 2 and Monster Rancher 4, Tecmo's Dead or Alive game creates a Pixie named Kasumi. Special CDs, called pandora discs, can produce multiple monsters. Often, the Monster Rancher game CD itself is a pandora disc. In Monster Rancher Advance and Monster Rancher Advance 2, the system generates random monsters by using character sequences rather than CDs, due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance game cartridges. Certain combinations of characters will determine the monster's breed, sub-breed, stats, and traits. Codes found in-game can be used to generate rare monsters. In Monster Rancher DS and Monster Rancher DS 2, the system is revised to take advantage of the Nintendo DS's input devices. Monsters can be generated by speaking into the microphone, drawing figures on the bottom screen, or inserting a Game Boy Advance game cartridge into the second slot. For Monster Farm Online, the unlocking system is changed entirely. Players select a monster species they have some knowledge of, with the basic purebreeds automatically available, and insert a CD or DVD to create their traits. This is so that players do not need to find a disc that is unique to one particular territory to get the rarest monsters.

Until 2018, he was the president of En+ Group, a Russian energy company, and until 2018 headed United Company Rusal, the second-largest aluminium company in the world. After graduating from Moscow State University with a degree in physics, Deripaska became a metals broker specialized in trading aluminium before expanding into energy, machinery, financial services and agribusiness. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and Roman Abramovich's Millhouse Capital. In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman. He was once Russia's richest man, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the 2007–08 financial crisis. As of February 2020, his wealth was estimated by Forbes at $4.5 billion. As the founder of the Volnoe Delo foundation, he is reported to have donated more than $250 million to mostly educational causes. He was married to Polina Yumasheva, step-granddaughter of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and daughter of Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's son-in- law and close advisor. They were divorced in 2017. Deripaska is known for his connection to American political consultant Paul Manafort, convicted of tax fraud, bank fraud and failure to report foreign bank accounts. The convictions stemmed from Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Deripaska employed Manafort from at least 2005 to 2009. Deripaska was also granted Cypriot citizenship in 2017. Education and early career =Early life= Deripaska was born in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Soviet Russia and grew up in Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar Krai. His parents were from Kuban. Deripaska grew up on the family's small farm, where from the age of 5 or 6, he learned how to live off the land from his grandparents, who primarily raised him after his widowed mother, an engineer, had to leave to find work. Deripaska credits his grandparents for teaching him the discipline of hard work along with farming. Both his grandfathers fought in the Second World War; one was killed in battle and buried in a mass grave in Austria; the other returned to Russia after the war ended. Deripaska's first job was at the Ust-Labinsk plant where his mother worked. At age 11, he became an electrician's apprentice doing maintenance on electrical motors. Deripaska acquired a passion for reading; his favorite authors were Mayne Reid and Jack London. Today, Basic Element's headquarters contain walls of books, reflecting Deripaska's lifelong love of reading. His talent for math allowed him to enroll at the physics faculty of Moscow State University in 1985. One year into his studies, he was conscripted into the armed forces and served in the Soviet army's Strategic Missile Forces in the Trans-Baikal area, Siberia, from 1986–1989. =Education = In 1993, Deripaska graduated with honors in physics from Moscow State University; however, the collapse of the Soviet Union greatly eliminated academic funding and made it impossible for him to continue his studies as a theoretical physicist. There were no stipends or grants for students either. \\"We had no money. It was an urgent and practical question every day. How do I earn money to buy food and keep studying?\\" he recalls. In 1996, he earned a master's degree from the Plekhanov University of Economics. =Early career= At the age of 25, teaming up with fellow physicists, engineers and rocket scientists, Deripaska set up his first metal trading company, VTK. He adopted a systematic, scientific approach to commodity trading. \\"I represented companies that were buying and selling raw materials\\", Deripaska said. Deripaska undertook export arbitrage, buying metal at low Russian prices and selling it abroad at significantly higher international market prices. Deripaska traded primarily through the Baltic state of Estonia, as the Russian system of export licenses was in disarray. \\"I started my business at an unusual moment in history. The country in which I was born and raised had disappeared, although the new country was not fully formed. The first one gave me an excellent education; the second one gave me the chance of success\\", Deripaska recalled in an interview with Metal Bulletin. He used nearly all his arbitrage and trading profits to acquire his initial package of shares in the Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter in Southern Siberia. Between 1993 and 1994, Deripaska bought vouchers and shares in Sayanogorsk, and accumulated a 20% stake in the factory, becoming the biggest individual shareholder after the Russian State—to the annoyance of the plant's Communist-era bosses. In 1994, Deripaska became director general of the plant at the age of 26. In 1997, he founded Sibirsky (Siberian) Aluminium Group, which in 2000 merged with Roman Abramovich's Millhouse Capital to create RUSAL. In 2003, businesses led by Deripaska increased their stake in those companies under common management to 75% by acquiring half of the interest managed by Millhouse Capital. In 2004, the consolidation of RUSAL's ownership by companies related to Deripaska was completed with the acquisition of the remaining 25% equity interest in RUSAL managed by Millhouse Capital. =Business growth= RUSAL went on to become the largest aluminium producer in the world, until the China Hongqiao Group surpassed it in 2015. In 2010, under Deripaska's leadership, Rusal became the first Russian company to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Beyond metals, which remain at the core of his diversified industrial holding, Deripaska has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies in various sectors, including energy, manufacturing, commercial vehicles, auto components, financial and insurance services, leasing businesses, construction, aviation, and agriculture. Among his assets are a Siberian power company ,EuroSibEnergo company website that is Russia's biggest private energy company; he ownes 10% of Ingosstrakh, one of Russia's largest insurance companies; GAZ Group, a producer of cars, trucks and buses, founder of agricultural business (Kuban Agro Holding). He established a transport company to run airports in the Krasnodar region, including Sochi and Krasnodar. All these assets form part of the diversified investment and industrial group Basic Element. Basic Element built several Olympic facilities for 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, including the Coastal Olympic Village, Imeretisnkiy sea port, Doubler of Kurortny Avenue in Sochi, renovation of the Sochi International Airport. The total investments account for over $1.4 billion. Later business career =Basic Element= Deripaska is the founder Basic Element, a diversified investment group established in 1997 which has been managing investments in the following sectors: energy, metals and mining, machinery, financial services, agriculture, construction, and aviation. The major investments under Basic Element management included stakes in United Company RUSAL (the world's largest aluminium and alumina producer), GAZ Group (an automotive company), Aviakor aircraft manufacturer, EuroSibEnergo (ЕвроСибЭнерго (an energy supply company) Glavmosstroy (Главмосстрой) (a construction company) Kuban Agroholding (an agricultural company) and Basel Aero (an aviation business comprising the three largest airports in the Krasnodar territory, and a joint venture with Changi Airports International). Basic Element has been managing Oleg Deripaska's investments into companies in Russia, the CIS countries, Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe and Latin America, which employ as many as 250,000 people. =En+ Group= The group was formed in 2006, with Oleg Deripaska as president and controlling shareholder. The En+ Group is a diversified mining, metals and energy group. It owns a majority stake in UC Rusal (48.13%) and in EuroSibEnergo. En+ also holds interests in SMR, one of the world's largest ferromolybdenum producers. In 2017, it reported adjusted core earnings of $2.3 billion on revenues totaling $9.8 billion. In November 2017 En+ was listed on the London Stock Exchange. = Metals and mining = RUSAL United Company RUSAL is the world's second largest aluminium company. It was the largest until it was overtaken by China Hongqiao Group in 2015. In 2019, Rusal was overtaken by China's Chalco as the second biggest listed producer of aluminium. As of 2018, UC RUSAL accounts for 5.8% of the world's primary aluminium output and 6.2% of the world's alumina production. The company employs over 62,000 in twenty countries on five continents. In order to ensure a stable supply of alumina to its smelters, several mergers and acquisitions were accomplished by RUSAL under Deripaska. At the beginning of the 2000s, RUSAL acquired bauxite mines in Guinea, a country with the world's largest bauxite reserves. Subsequently, RUSAL acquired a stake in an alumina refinery in Australia. At Deripaska's behest, in 2007, RUSAL, SUAL Group, one of the world's top 10 aluminum producers; and Glencore International AG, the Swiss natural resources group, merged their assets to form United Company RUSAL, the world's largest aluminum and alumina producer. After the merger with Glencore, bauxite and alumina assets in Jamaica, Italy and Ireland were added to RUSAL's portfolio. These transactions converted RUSAL from a company with few supplies of the raw material bauxite into a vertically integrated corporation. In parallel, Deripaska invested significantly in the operational improvement of smelters inside Russia. He said, \\"We consolidated the industry, and located bauxites that do not exist in Russia. We established the company that became the leader of industry in less than twelve years. But to become the number one alumimium producer in the world, we had to improve our operations practice. To apply the best practices in the world, we looked at Toyota, which had utilized a precise, deep and well thought-through process for almost thirty years of operations.\\" Deripaska himself has been an active supporter Japanese production efficiencies made popular by the \\"Toyota Way.\\" RUSAL smelters have adopted the concept of kaizen, which means continuous improvement and involves training workers in standardized production techniques. \\"It's important to change both the company’s mind set and reporting lines,\\" Deripaska said. \\"Instead of top-down management, you should understand everything is in the hands of your operator and empower that operator to drive efficiencies and improvements directly on the factory floor.\\" Under Deripaska's leadership, RUSAL constructed and commissioned Khakas aluminium smelter outside of Sayanogorsk in Russian Siberia. The Khakas facility was the first aluminium smelter built in post-Soviet Russia (since 1985). The smelter, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, is currently one of the most technologically advanced in the world. The company also undertook large-scale modernization projects at a number of its facilities, including the Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk aluminium smelters. In the middle of the financial crisis, Deripaska returned in 2009 to RUSAL as CEO to lead the company through the debt restructuring process. \\"I worked 16-hour days. We were in default, although none of the parties involved wanted to call it default.\\" As part of contingency measures, Deripaska cut costs at RUSAL by 25% in 2009. By December 2009, Deripaska reached a final agreement with over 70 Russian and international lenders to refinance US$17 billion of debt. In 2017, Rusal issued two Eurobonds to finance its debts. The first one, worth $600 million, was issued in February, followed by the second one in April, worth $500 million. Also in February, plans were announced to sell 10 billion yuan worth of seven-year onshore bonds to finance purchases in China. This made Rusal the first foreign company to offer panda bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company also agreed on a pre-export finance mechanism with international lenders worth $1.7 billion for debt refinancing. In 2013, Deripaska was awarded the \\"Aluminium Industry Ambassador Award\\" in the Metal Bulletin Awards for Excellence for his \\"great influence within the global aluminium industry and the wider market\\". Deripaska stepped down from RUSAL in May 2018 the day after seven board members and the chief executive resigned. The move was part of a deal with the US Treasury to get U.S. sanctions removed from the company. As part of that deal, in February 2019 it was announced that Deripaska had reduced his ownership stake in EN+ to below 50% in order to obtain sanctions relief. =Energy=  EuroSibEnergo  EuroSibEnergo controls and manages 18 power plants with a combined installed energy capacity of 19.5 GW, including 15 GW provided by hydrogeneration. The company produces approximately 9% of all electricity in Russia and is also the leader in the Siberian energy market, with a market share totaling 41%. Some of EuroSibEnergo's key clients include the largest aluminum plants in Russia. The company owns large fuel resources, which satisfy over 85% of the coal needs of its thermal power and boiler plants. Its coal reserves amount to 1.26 billion tons, with annual coal production exceeding 12 million tons. En+ Group, of which EuroSibEnergo is a subsidiary, is investing in a joint venture with China's largest hydroelectric power generation company China Yangtze Power Co to build new power plants in Siberia, primarily hydroelectric ones, with a total capacity of up to 10 GWt. =Machinery= Russian Machines Russian Machines corporation was established in 2005 and unites Oleg Deripaska's machine building assets. It comprises industrial and engineering assets in the following industries: automotive OEM (GAZ Group), automotive components (RM-Systems), rail industry (RM Rail), aircraft OEM (Aviacor), road construction (RM-Terex) and agricultural machinery (AGCO-RM). Russian Machines Corporation manages 24 facilities located across 12 regions in Russia. GAZ Group In 2000, Deripaska started acquiring machine building assets. His first acquisition was Nizhny Novgorod-based Gorkovsky Automobile Plant (GAZ), which was previously a government-run company. In 2005, GAZ Group was established by combining the businessman's machine building assets. The Russian automotive conglomerate, GAZ Group, comprises 18 manufacturing facilities in eight regions of Russia, as well as sales and service organizations. GAZ Group produces light and medium commercial vehicles, heavy trucks, buses, cars, road construction equipment, power units, and automotive components. In March 2019, GAZ Group asked the Russian government for $468 million in support claiming that US sanctions placed on Deripaska could cut production by almost 40% in the second half of that year. Airports Basel Aero, a joint venture between Changi Airports International, Basic Element and Sberbank of Russia, is a company-operator the Sochi, Krasnodar and Anapa airports. These airports handle more than 7% of the total passenger flow in Russia. Sochi International Airport was the main gateway to Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and successfully serviced the guests and participants of the Games. In October 2014, Sochi was granted open skies status, meaning that any foreign carrier may pick up and drop off passengers and cargo with no restrictions on aircraft type, frequency, and regardless of interstate agreements. =Financial services= Deripaska personally holds 10% of Ingosstrakh's ordinary shares. The company is a leading insurer of complex risks such as insurance for ship owners, ship hull insurance, insurance against aviation and space-related risks, and insurance of transportation companies. Ingosstrakh has 83 branches in Russia and the company's offices operate in 220 Russian towns and cities. =Agribusiness= Oleg Deripaska established Kuban Agroholding, a massive agribusiness in southern Russia. The company integrates two dairy farms, а 16,000 pig capacity breeding complex, three elevators with non-recurrent grain storage capacity of more than 270,000 tonnes, three-seed plants, a sugar factory and the Sunrise horse breeding farm, specializing in the breeding of English thoroughbred horses. It is one of the top-20 largest agribusinesses and top-5 most efficient land users in Russia. Kuban Agroholding is one of the few agrocompanies in Russia involved in embryo transfer technology that allows for the reproduction of high- yielding milk cows out of less productive recipients. The company has gained significant media attention about its corn-seeding program, deploying several dozen corn brands selected by its genetic specialists. = Other roles = In 2004, Deripaska was appointed by the President of Russia to represent the country in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council (ABAC). He has been Chairman of ABAC Russia since 2007. Deripaska is the vice president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, chairman of the executive board of the Russian national committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Council, an agency of the Russian government.Oleg Deripaska biodata . Retrieved 12 May 2012. He has been a permanent participant at World Economic Forum sessions since 2007, when RUSAL became a WEF strategic partner. In May 2007, Magna International chairman Frank Stronach announced that Deripaska was becoming a strategic partner in Magna. Deripaska is also a member of the International Council at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. During the West African Ebola virus epidemic Deripaska personally initiated construction of the Centre for Epidemic and Microbiological Research and Treatment in the Guinean Kindia province. The centre was designed and constructed by RUSAL specialists with the assistance of Rospotrebnadzor scientists (RUSAL has invested $10 million). He sits on the board of trustees of the School of Business Administration, the School of Public Administration, and the School of Economics at Moscow State University as well as the School of Business Administration at St. Petersburg State University. Deripaska is a co-founder of the National Science Support Foundation and the National Medicine Fund. In 1999, he was awarded the Order of Friendship, a state award of the Russian Federation. He was named businessman of the year in 1999, 2006, and 2007 by Vedomosti, a Russian business daily. Deripaska also sits on the board of trustees of the Bolshoi Theatre, and has financed ballet performances like Flames of Paris, La Sylphide, and Paquita as well as operas like The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya, Carmen, and Wozzeck. Philanthropy =Volnoe Delo= In 1998, Deripaska established Volnoe Delo, Russia's largest private charitable foundation.(20 April 2009): The Volnoe Delo Fund acknowledged as the largest contributor The fund supports over 400 initiatives across Russia aimed at developing education and science, preserving spiritual and cultural heritage, and improving standards in public health.Volnoe Delo Fund website It helps children, old people, talented youths, teachers, eminent scientists and other participants of the programs. Since 1998, Oleg Deripaska has invested more than RUB10.6 billion in more than 500 charity programs in 50 regions of Russia. Volnoe Delo has supported research activities in the 2,550-year-old city of Phanagoria since 2004. More than $10 million has been allocated to Phanagoria fieldwork over the past 14 years. Today, Phanagoria is one of the best-equipped archeological expeditions in Russia and has its own scientific and cultural center, cutting-edge equipment and technology for above-ground and underwater excavation as well as a large team of specialists involved in the excavation process. In 2014, Volnoe Delo foundation launched a programme on students' early career guidance and professional training—JuniorSkills. The first, pilot, championship on professional skills, JuniorSkills Hi-Tech, was held in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg in 2014, part of the nationwide championship on cross-industry blue-collar professions in high-tech WorldSkills. =Climate change = Deripaska is one of the 16 global business leaders who drafted CEO Climate Policy Recommendations to G8 Leaders, a document outlining the international business community's proposals to tackle global warming. The proposals were signed by more than 100 of the world's leading corporations and handed to the Prime Minister of Japan Yasuo Fukuda on 20 June 2008. The G8 leaders discussed the recommendations during the summit in Japan on 7–9 July 2008. The process was coordinated by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Expert magazine; \\"Zero Waste\\"; interview Deripaska actively advocates cutting the global carbon footprint and calls for the creation of an enforcement mechanism with consequences for countries that do not reduce carbon-intensive emissions, such as those produced by coal-fired powerplants. He also remains a strong advocate of a legally binding climate change deal, but has publicly voiced concern about the potential competitive impact of a Paris climate agreement and also about the absence of binding measures to curb each country's emissions in the near future. \\"Everyone is in favour; we just need to have more or less fair regulation. There shouldn't be any pockets where people can cheat the system. People shouldn't agree on something that creates another Kyoto protocol that creates nice polished statements\\", he told the Financial Times in January 2016. =Other activities= In February 2014, Deripaska financed the construction of makeshift kennels to house stray dogs that had been abandoned by construction workers after completing work on the Sochi Olympic Village. Officials said the number of strays exceeded 2,000 and the animals presented a risk of rabies, so they contracted out their extermination. Many of these dogs were saved and more were re-homed in a global adoption program that Deripaska created. Controversies =Cherney lawsuit= Michael Cherney brought legal action against Deripaska in the Commercial Court of the High Court in London. Cherney sought a declaration that he was the beneficial owner of 20% of RUSAL stock which, he claimed, Deripaska held in trust for him. The claim was denied. On 3 May 2007, Justice Langley ruled that Deripaska had not been properly served, and that the court had no jurisdiction to try the claim as Deripaska did not live in England or Wales. On 3 July 2008, Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that the case should be tried in England, although \\"the natural forum for this litigation is Russia\\", because, he held, \\"risks inherent in a trial in Russia...are sufficient to make England the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interest of both parties and the ends of justice\\". On 22 July 2008, he granted Deripaska the right to appeal. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the appeal on 31 July 2009. At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person. An outstanding arrest warrant issued by Interpol meant that the British would detain him if he travelled to the UK.Paul, Jonny. (23 June 2011) \\"British High Court to decide: Can Cherney testify by video?\\" The Jerusalem Post. 23 June 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2012.\\"Wanted: Cherney, Michael\\". Interpol, (14 October 2010) In late July 2011, the High Court ruled to allow Cherney to give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel, and also set trial for April 2012. Deripaska denied that Cherney was owed any stake in RUSAL, and asserted payments made to Cherney had been for unavoidable \\"protection\\" at a time when violence was sweeping the region and posed an existential threat to any profitable business in the country. In an interview with The Telegraph, Deripaska said he was one of the few who worked to clean up Russian industry and provided support to law enforcement agencies. However, in this early chaotic period paying protection money to criminal gangs was inescapable, as revealed in court testimony. In September 2012, Cherney terminated his UK lawsuit against Deripaska. = U.S. investigation= In 2015, Deripaska filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, accusing the bank of using insider information to short sell the businessman's $1.5 billion investment in shares of Canadian-based Magna International in 2008. In 2007, Deripaska's Veleron investment vehicle acquired stock in Magna through a $1.2 billion loan from BNP Paribas, with Magna shares serving as collateral. Morgan Stanley was involved in the deal through a swap agreement with BNP Paribas where the US bank assumed the risks of the loan in return for a fixed payment from Paribas. In September 2008, Magna's stocks plummeted, hit by the global economic downturn. BNP issued a $93 million margin call to Veleron. Morgan Stanley, in turn, learned that Veleron was unlikely to meet the call and sold the stock short. Deripaska claimed that Morgan Stanley abused its duties and engaged in unlawful insider trading that resulted in significant financial damage to Veleron, estimated at $15 million to $25 million. A New York jury determined in November 2015 that Morgan Stanley had \\"acquired inside information and traded on it despite a duty to keep it confidential and not trade on it,\\" finding as well that Morgan Stanley did not have the intent to defraud Veleron. Veleron strongly disagreed with and said it would file an appeal. In July 2006, whilst Deripaska was involved in a bid to buy the Daimler Chrysler Group, it was reported that the United States canceled his entry visa; the unnamed official declined to give a reason for the revoking of the visa. The Wall Street Journal reported that it could have been because Deripaska has been accused of having links to organized crime in Russia and cited as their sources two unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials. The New York Times reported on 27 August 2018 that the visa had been revoked on concerns Deripaska might attempt to launder money through real estate transactions. Deripaska had received a multiple-entry visa in 2005; a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman refused to comment. Lobbying on his behalf had been done by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential candidate Bob Dole and his law firm, Alston & Bird, Senate records show. Alston & Bird was paid about US$260,000 in 2005 for work on \\"Department of State visa policies and procedures\\" tied to Deripaska. In 2009, Deripaska was again allowed entry and visited the United States twice. The Wall Street Journal reported that according to two unnamed FBI administration officials, Deripaska met with agents regarding a continuing criminal probe, the details of which were not known or reported. During Deripaska's visits, he met with leading management figures from investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The aluminum company that Deripaska headed, United Company RUSAL, was in preparations for an initial public offering. The easing of Deripaska's visa issues, which were an issue for possible investors, helped to reassure bankers. The State Department has never said why it revoked his visa and refused to comment on his 2009 visits. The visits were arranged outside of the usual process as the U.S. continues to have concerns about Deripaska's business associations. Deripaska has repeatedly denied a connection to any organized crime and said business rivals have caused the visa to be revoked by smearing him. When interviewed by the BBC in July 2009, Deripaska said that the authorities in the United States had been attempting to blackmail him by revoking his visa and thus affecting possible investors in a negative way and thereby hoping to push Deripaska into cooperating with them. =Spanish investigation= Deripaska and Iskander Makhmudov (head of UGMK) were asked by Spanish police to answer questions in relation to a money-laundering enquiry. While Deripaska had been interrogated previously as a witness in Spain and England and by the FBI about money laundering, he was never been charged with any crimes. On 25 January 2010, the Financial Times published a story titled \\"Rusal: A lingering heat\\" exploring Deripaska's business relations with Sergei Popov and Anton Malevsky, alleged heads of Russian organized crime groups. Deripaska has accused Michael Chernoy of using Malevsky and the Izmailovskaya syndicate to extort US$250 million from him as part of a protection racket. However, Deripaska has himself been accused of having similar links to Malevsky, who, with his brother Andrei, owned a 10% stake in Deripaska's company. Deripaska denies the claims.Swinford, Steven, \\"Peter Mandelson oligarch Oleg Deripaska linked to mafia boss\\", The Sunday Times (London), 26 October 2008. In November 2011, Spain's High Court sent the criminal cases against Deripaska to the Russian General Prosecutor's office because the root of the cases is Russian. =Political relationships= Vladimir Putin and Deripaska, 19 March 2002 Vladimir Putin Deripaska is known for his close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Their relationship became visibly strained amidst Deripaska's financial struggles in 2009. In an incident broadcast on Russian television, Putin visited a stalled cement factory owned by Deripaska and berated its management. He forced Deripaska to sign a contract promising to pay nearly $1 million in unpaid wages. Their relationship recovered, however, and Deripaska has been described as \\"Putin's favorite industrialist\\". Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described Deripaska as \\"among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis\\" and \\"a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad\\". In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Kinross Gold CEO Tye Burt, who knows Deripaska, said \\"I believe Russia recognizes Oleg's major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure.\\" Nathaniel Rothschild and Peter Mandelson Deripaska is a friend of Nathaniel Rothschild, a major investor in both Glencore and United Company RUSAL. Together Deripaska and Rothschild hosted George Osborne and Peter Mandelson on Deripaska's yacht in Corfu in the summer of 2008. Osborne was then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom and a friend of Rothschild from school and university. Peter Mandelson has reportedly maintained private contacts over several years with Oleg Deripaska News of the contacts sparked criticism because, as European Union Trade Commissioner, Mandelson had been responsible for decision to cut aluminium tariffs from 6 to 3%, a decision that had benefited Deripaska's Company RusAl. Mandelson insisted that he had never discussed aluminium tariffs with Deripaska. On 26 October 2008 the Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague claimed the \\"whole country\\" wanted \\"transparency\\" about Mandelson's previous meetings with Deripaska. In response, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Mandelson's dealings with Deripaska had been \\"found to be above board\\". Mandelson said that meeting business figures from \\"across the range\\" in emerging economies was part of his brief as EU Trade Commissioner. On 29 October 2008, while Mandelson was on a ministerial visit to Moscow, it was alleged in the British press that Valery Pechenkin, the head of security at Deripaska's company Basic Element, organised a swift entry visa for Mandelson when he came to Moscow to visit Deripaska in 2005. Paul Manafort On 22 March 2017, the Associated Press published a report alleging that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former presidential campaign manager, negotiated a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005. Both Deripaska and Manafort confirmed working together in the past, but rejected the contents of the AP story. Manafort argued that his work had been inaccurately presented, and that there was nothing “inappropriate or nefarious\\" about it. Responding to the allegations, on 28 March 2017 Deripaska published open letters in the print editions of The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal in which he denied having signed a $10 million contract with Manafort in order to benefit the Putin government. He also stated willingness to testify before the United States Congress about these allegations, and argued that the accusations were part of \\"the negative context of current US-Russian relations.\\" Congressional sources cited by The New York Times said lawmakers declined Deripaska's request after he had asked for immunity. Unnamed officials argued that \\"immunity agreements create complications for federal criminal investigators\\". On 15 May 2017, Deripaska filed a defamation and libel lawsuit against the Associated Press in U.S. District Court in D.C., arguing that the report falsely claimed that Deripaska had signed a contract with Manafort to advance the goals of the Russian government. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017 on the grounds that Deripaska had not disputed \\"any material facts\\" in the story by the Associated Press. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, it is alleged that Manafort, via Kiev-based operative Konstantin Kilimnik, offered to provide briefings on political developments to Deripaska Behaviors such as these were seen as an attempt by Manafort to please an oligarch tied to Putin's government.  Navalny video  In February 2018, Alexei Navalny published a video about a meeting between Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko on a yacht traveling near Norway. According to Navalny, Deripaska probably served as a middle man between the Russian government represented by Prikhodko and Paul Manafort during Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prikhodko denied the allegations, accusing Navalny of \\"mixing the facts\\" about his \\"friend\\" Deripaska, Donald Trump and Paul Manafort, while also voicing his wish to have talk with Navalny as a \\"man with a man\\". A day after the video was published the Roskomnadzor added the video to the Federal List of Extremist Materials, thus making accessing the video illegal for all Russian citizens. It also ordered YouTube to remove seven videos and Instagram to take down 14 points that were cited in the investigation; neither YouTube nor Instagram had responded as of 12 February 2018. According to a Roskomnadzor representative who spoke to Vedomosti, a \\"court injunction of this sort against content hosted on Instagram and YouTube is unprecedented for Russia\\". The New York Times noted that this may presage a \\"more aggressive approach by the Russian government\\" to control online activities. Fearing her own death while incarcerated in Bangkok, Anastasia Vashukevich, a Belarusian citizen who claimed to have an intimate history with Deripaska, claimed to have over 16 hours of audio recordings she said could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She offered the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, but was deported and arrested in a Russian airport. Vashukevich said the recordings from August 2016 include Deripaska discussing the United States presidential election with three English-speakers who Vashukevich believed were American. \\"Deripaska had a plan about elections,\\" Vashukevich said. In court, Vashukevich apologized to Deripaska, and said Russian agents visited her in jail to urge her to cease public statements about him. The New York Times argued that her claims might be easily dismissed were it not for the Navalny video. Deripaska denies an intimate history with Vashukevich. =Terra Services Ltd= Deripaska-linked U.K. company Terra Services Ltd was raided in December 2018.  U.S. sanctions  In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Oleg Deripska and 23 other Russian tycoons and officials. The statement of the United States Department of the Treasury said that Deripaska \\"ha[d] been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering\\". In October 2018, the U.S. Treasury announced it had extended until 12 December a deadline for the full imposition of sanctions against Rusal and its parent company En+ Group, pending the review of the proposals presented by En+ Group to the U.S. government that would see Deripaska reduce his stake in En+ to below 45 per cent from around 70 per cent. In January 2019, the U.S. Treasury lifted the sanctions on companies formerly controlled by Deripaska. Sanctions on Deripaska himself remained in effect. In April 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department nonetheless allowed Deripaska to transfer 10.5 million shares of his holding company En+ Group to a trust fund for his children as part of a divorce settlement with his ex-wife Polina Yumasheva, which had been finalized before the sanctions were put in place. The deal to have U.S. sanctions removed from En+ Group was brokered by Greg Barker, a UK legislator, who in February 2019 went on to be appointed chairman of En+ Group. In March 2019, Deripaska sued the United States, alleging that it had overstepped its legal bounds in imposing sanctions on him and made him the “latest victim” in the U.S. probe into Moscow's alleged election interference.  Personal life  Deripaska was married to Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin's top adviser Valentin Yumashev and stepdaughter of Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana. While Yeltsin was president, Deripaska's close ties put him in Yeltsin's inner circle, dubbed \\"The Family\\". In 2017 Deripaska and Yumasheva had divorced. The Deripaskas have two children: a son, Pyotr (born 2001), and daughter, Maria (born 2003). Deripaska practices yoga, swimming, horseback riding, and hiking. At his home near Moscow, he has seven horses and six dogs. In March 2018, it was reported that Deripaska had successfully purchased Cypriot citizenship in 2017 under Cyprus' \\"golden visa\\" that generates billions of revenue for the island nation. According to documents seen by The Guardian, Deripaska's first attempt to become a citizen of a country in the EU was unsuccessful because of a preliminary inquiry into his activities in Belgium. The inquiry was dismissed in 2016. = Net worth = In 2008, Forbes estimated his wealth at US$28 billion, making him the then ninth richest man in the world. In 2009, Deripaska's ranking fell to a ranking of No. 164, with Forbes stating: \\"[H]e may not withstand collapsing markets and heavy debts\\". In 2010, however, his estimated $10.7 billion fortune allowed him to rise to No. 57 of the World's Billionaires list. According to Forbes magazine, he removed the heads of his two largest companies and personally negotiated with the Russian government, banks, and other creditors to restructure his loan obligations. Deripaska himself in 2007 was reported to have consistently said that the estimate of his wealth was exaggerated, that it did not completely account for the amount of debt he incurred, and that he should be ranked far below the top ten on the list of the Russian billionaires. Deripaska's Cypriot registered company Edenfield Investments acquired the Grade II listed Hamstone House in the St George's Hill district of Weybridge, Surrey, in 2001. Deripaska has owned the Haft mansion near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C., through a company incorporated in Delaware since 2006. Forbes estimated his fortune at $3.3 billion in 2015, $5.2 billion in 2017, and $3.3 billion in 2019.

The crew, along with Prophets of Da City (POC), is credited with being a pioneer of Cape Town's 'conscious' hip-hop scene in the late 80s and early 90s. The crew's line-up has changed significantly since the early 90s, but Emile YX? (aka Emile Jansen) has been the crew's mainstay. Black Noise is South Africa's oldest active hip-hop crew and Jansen, born on 20 July 1968 in Cape Town, has been instrumental in employing Black Noise for youth development initiatives, such as workshops for township youth. He went on to establish a non-profit organisation called Heal the Hood and launched landmark hip-hop events; these include the annual Hip-Hop Indaba, African Battle Cry and Shut Up and Dance. The crew has conducted workshops and performed extensively in South Africa as well as in a number of European countries. Jansen and Black Noise have also launched a number of albums, DVDs, poetry anthologies (including the work of school pupils and established hip-hop artists) and books. His work on eTVs \\"Step Up or Step Out\\" gave him the chance to judge dance competitions and work with the youth. Furthermore, he has helped to raise money and sent 177 young people to travel to international events globally. He has recorded and released 12 albums with Black Noise, 6 solo Emile YX? Albums, 1 Afrikaaps soundtrack, 9 compilation albums, 7 Heal the Hood compilation albums and helped 6 local artists release their solo albums.https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/967489-Emile-YX Emile started South Africa's first Hip Hop magazine “Da Juice” and wrote 3 books.

Emile started break-dancing in 1982 with Pop Glide Crew. So he became one of the first South African bboys, which made him a pioneer of South African Hip Hop. Six years after that, in 1986, he made it to the regional finals of the Shell Road to Fame with “the Chill Convention\\", who later that year became the legendary South African Hip Hop Group Black Noise. In addition Emile Jansen qualified as a school teacher and started teaching at Battswood Primary. In 1989 the group won the Mayors Award for Greening the City. Two years later Emile and Black Noise self- funded a tour to JHB to explore their own record deal and performed with Brenda Fassie & Marc Alex. In 1992 Black Noise signed a record deal with Tusk Records and released Black Noise 1st Album \\"Pumpin' Loose Da Juice\\". The album was created around the same time that the world of hip hop goes from Public Enemy to the gangster era. Black Noise helped with Voters Education before South Africa's first democratic election campaign in 1994. At the Inauguration of Nelson Mandela, Black Noise performed in Cape Town to support the democratisation process of South Africa. In the same year Emile attends Universal Zulu (Hip Hop) Nation Anniversary in New York to spread the ideas of South African Hip Hop. Two members, Warro and Ernie, left the group before the 3rd Album \\"Black Facts\\" was released in St Louis Missouri. 1995 Emile & Black Noise were part of a movie about youth globally called \\"Juvenis\\" and performed in Sweden for the UN 50th Anniversary.

It is an ode to Capoeira, the martial art of Brazilian slaves; the 'circle of fire' is the sacred space in which this martial art is performed. Black Noise tried to mix the rhythms of Capoeira with urban South African hip hop styles. 'Don't speak, just listen', is an a cappella track talking about gangsterism in Cape Town. The standout track on the album is a remake of Bob Marley's 'Could you be loved'. Like POC, Black Noise's live act includes MCs, DJs and b-boy performances. They have also included live music components at certain events. Recognition Black Noise's Emile Jansen features in the 2010 South African feature, The Creators. In the film, Emile teaches bboy workshops to Cape Flat youth, leads a group of South Africans on a trek up Table Mountain, and spearheads the first African Hip Hop Indaba.http://thecreatorsdocumentary.com/ Members of Black Noise are also supporting the Heal the Hood Organisation, which tries to teach young adolescents self-confidence and encourage them developing own ideas.http://healthehood.org.za/  References  South African hip hop groups ","title":"Black Noise (group)"},{"id":"1209980","text":"Bison Dele ( ; born Brian Carson Williams; April 6, 1969 - July 7, 2002) was an American professional basketball player who played center for the NBA's Orlando Magic, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons.

He averaged 17.3 points, 12.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.5 steals and 9.1 blocks per game in his senior season, shooting 57.7% from the field. Before transferring to Bishop Gorman, he attended Saint Monica Catholic High School in Santa Monica, California, where his jersey is retired. He was a track and field runner, until a high school growth spurt pushed him towards basketball. His collegiate basketball career began at the University of Maryland, where he played for one year before sitting out the next season while transferring to the University of Arizona. Professional career After playing for two seasons at Arizona, Williams was drafted with the 10th pick in the first round of the 1991 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic. He saw limited action during two seasons in Orlando. After playing for Orlando, Williams joined the Denver Nuggets, for whom he played two seasons. In 1993–94, he played a career-high 80 games and averaged 8.0 points per game. Williams then played one year for the Los Angeles Clippers, earning increased playing time and averaging 15.8 points per game. Due to a contract dispute and reports that Williams' asking price was too high, he could not find a team at the beginning of the 1996–97 season, sitting out most of the season. He was then signed by the Chicago Bulls nine games before the end of the season and became an important backup player in the Bulls' run to their fifth championship. Williams finished his career playing two seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he set career highs of 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds per game in 1997–98. In 1998, he changed his name to Bison Dele to honor his Native American (Cherokee) and African ancestry, and played his final season under that name. =Retirement= Dele suddenly retired from the NBA before the start of the 1999–2000 season at age 30, when he was still in the prime of his career. He had been the Pistons' highest-paid player, but had strained relationships with the organization and decided to walk away from the remaining five years and US$36.45 million on his contract rather than be traded. It has also been theorized he had never been especially passionate about playing basketball and felt he had earned enough money to allow him to walk away from the pro game and lifestyle. Personal life Dele reportedly dated Madonna at one point in his career. He played the saxophone, violin and trumpet, enjoyed adventure travel, and earned a pilot's license. After his retirement he spent long periods traveling to Lebanon, the Mediterranean, and the Australian outback before learning to sail and purchasing a catamaran to sail the Seven Seas. =Disappearance in the South Pacific= On July 6, 2002, Dele and his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, along with skipper Bertrand Saldo, sailed from Tahiti on Dele's catamaran, the Hukuna Matata. Dele's brother, Miles Dabord (born Kevin Williams), was the only person involved in the voyage who was seen or heard from after July 8, 2002, when the last of three satellite phone calls from the voyage was made. Dele and Karlan had previously kept regular contact with their banks and family members. On July 20, Dabord brought the boat into Tahiti; he was alone aboard the vessel. On September 5, 2002, police used a sting operation organized by Dele's family and friends to detain Dabord in Phoenix, Arizona. Dabord had forged Dele's signature in order to buy US$152,000 worth of gold under his brother's name, using Dele's passport as identification. Mexican police later found that Dabord had been staying at a hotel in Tijuana, Mexico. Two days before, the Hukuna Matata, which had been registered in Tahiti under another name, was found off the coast of Tahiti with its name plate removed and some possible bullet holes patched. About the same time, Dabord phoned his mother, Patricia Phillips, telling her that he would never hurt Dele and that he could not survive in prison. The FBI and French authorities became involved in the investigation, and concluded that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were probably murdered and then thrown overboard, by Dabord. Given that the bodies were likely dumped in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it would be highly unlikely that the three would ever be found. Dabord, the only first-person source of information regarding the case, intentionally overdosed on insulin and slipped into a coma. On September 27, 2002, Dabord died in a California hospital. In his account of events, Dabord said he and his brother had fought, and that Karlan had been accidentally hit and died when her head struck part of the boat. When Saldo wanted to report her death, a panicked Dele killed him; Dabord then shot his brother in self-defence, threw the bodies overboard and subsequently fled back to the U.S. After Dabord's insulin overdose, officials did not expect to find much more regarding the case. A memorial service was then held for both Dabord and Dele. The brothers were frequently at odds with each other. After Dabord's death, his lawyer and lifelong best friend, Paul White, was questioned regarding his client but gave little information about what happened. Dabord had said that he knew for sure that Dele and Karlan were in French Polynesia, but not much more other than that he was trying to help Dele.

Before Kid Dynamite, he was the vocalist for screamo band \\"Bound.\\" Shevchuk became the vocalist of Kid Dynamite after winning an audition with his melodic yet abrasive voice and catchy \\"whoa-whoa-whoas\\". He left Kid Dynamite in 2000 to pursue film editing work. His first film, Ghetto Venue, was about the recently closed Philadelphia club Stalag 13. He still edits film and has worked on music videos with None More Black and other bands, such as The Loved Ones. However, his musical urges led to the birth of his next band, None More Black. Shevchuck started to write and record his own solo material under the name OnGuard. As of early June 2007, the OnGuard MySpace page all but vanished, with all songs and pictures/information removed. However, later he put up a website which has the project's entire discography. Shevchuk emerged on MySpace with the band LaGrecia saying OnGuard is \\"officially dead\\" and changed its name while becoming a full band including Dana Berkowitz on drums and Sal Dell'Aquila on bass. The band released their first and only album, \\"On Parallels,\\" on June 24, 2008, on Suburban Home Records. The cover artwork for the album was done by Dell'Aquila. The band broke up just before the release of \\"On Parallels.\\" Consequently, LaGrecia's remaining duo of Sal and Dana announced via the band's MySpace account that Shevchuk had left the band and the LaGrecia project was finished.

It is also used as a slang for those thought to have \\"yellow undertones\\". The term was in common use in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century, and is reflected in such popular songs of the era as \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\". It is now considered offensive and outdated.  Etymology  \\"High\\" is usually considered a reference to a social class system in which skin color (and associated ancestries) is a major factor, placing those of lighter skin (with more European ancestry) at the top and those of darker skin at the bottom. High yellows, while still considered part of the African-American ethnic group, were thought to gain privileges because of their skin and ancestry. \\"Yellow\\" is in reference to the usually very pale undertone to the skin color of members of this group, due to mixture with Europeans. Another reading of the etymology of the word \\"high\\" is that it is a slang word for \\"very\\", often used in Southern English, therefore \\"very yellow\\" (as opposed to brown).  Use as social class distinction  In an aspect of colorism, \\"high yellow\\" was also related to social class distinctions among people of color. In post-Civil War South Carolina, and according to one account by historian Edward Ball, \\"Members of the colored elite were called 'high yellow' for their shade of skin\\", as well as slang terms meaning snobbish. In his biography of Duke Ellington, a native of Washington, D.C., David Bradbury wrote that Washington's In some cases the confusion of color with class came about because some of the lighter-skinned blacks came from families of mixed heritage free before the Civil War, who had begun to accumulate education and property. In addition, some wealthier white planters made an effort to have their \\"natural sons\\" (the term for children outside of marriage who were produced with enslaved women) educated or trained as apprentices; some passed on property to them. For instance, in 1860, most of the 200 subscription students at Wilberforce College were the mixed-race sons of white planters, who paid for their education. These social distinctions made the cosmopolitan Harlem more appealing to many blacks. The Cotton Club of the Prohibition era \\"had a segregated, white-only audience policy and a color-conscious, 'high yellow' hiring policy for chorus girls\\". It was common for lighter-skinned African Americans to hold \\"paper bag parties,\\" which admitted only those whose complexion was lighter than that of a brown paper bag. In her 1942 Glossary of Harlem Slang, Zora Neale Hurston placed \\"high yaller\\" at the beginning of the entry for colorscale, which ran: Quadroon novelist Alexandre Dumas, père was called \\"High Yellow\\" in a 1929 issue of Time magazine.  Applied to individuals  The French author Alexandre Dumas père was the son of a French mulatto general (born in Saint- Domingue but educated by his father in France) and his French wife. He was described as having skin \\"with a yellow so high it was almost white\\". In a 1929 review, Time referred to him as a \\"High Yellow Fictioneer\\". Singer Eartha Kitt was taunted by darker-skinned relatives and called that \\"yella gal\\" during her childhood.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/19/eartha- kitt-suffered-over-identityhttps://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/arts/26kitt.html  Art and popular culture  The terminology and its cultural aspects were explored in Dael Orlandersmith's play Yellowman, a 2002 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in drama. The play depicts a dark-skinned girl whose own mother \\"inadvertently teaches her the pain of rejection and the importance of being accepted by the 'high yellow' boys\\". One reviewer described the term as having \\"the inherent, unwieldy power to incite black Americans with such intense divisiveness and fervor\\" as few others. The phrase survives in folk songs such as \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\", which originally referred to Emily West Morgan, a \\"mulatto\\" indentured servant apocryphally associated with the Battle of San Jacinto. Blind Willie McTell's song \\"Lord, Send Me an Angel\\" has its protagonist forced to choose among three women, described as \\"Atlanta yellow\\", \\"Macon brown\\", and a \\"Statesboro blackskin\\". Bessie Smith's song \\"I've Got What It Takes\\", by Clarence Williams, refers to \\"a slick high yeller\\" boyfriend who \\"turned real pale\\" when she would not wait for him to get out of jail. Curtis Mayfield's song \\"We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\\" makes reference to a \\"high yellow girl\\". In \\"Big Leg Blues\\", Mississippi John Hurt sings: \\"Some crave high yellow. I like black and brown.\\" Digital Underground's 1991 album Sons of the P featured \\"No Nose Jobs\\", a song in which Shock G as Humpty Hump opines: \\"They say the lighter the righter - Oh yeah?! Well'at's tough - Sometimes I feel that I'm not black enough - I'm high yellow, my nose is brown to perfection - And if I was to change it'd be further in that direction - So catch me on the beach, I'll be gettin' a tan - But yo there's no mistake that - Humpty-Hump is from the motherland\\". On the 1988 album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm by Joni Mitchell, the song \\"Dancin' Clown\\" contains the lyrics \\"Down the street comes last word Susie, she's high yellow, looking top nice.\\" On Ice Cube's album War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc) released in 2000, the song \\"Hello\\" contains the lyrics \\"I'm looking for a big yellow in 6-inch stilettos\\". In 2004, white R&B; singer-songwriter Teena Marie released a song titled \\"High Yellow Girl\\", said to be about her daughter Alia Rose, who is biracial. The related phrase \\"high brown\\" was used in Irving Berlin's original lyrics for \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\".

It is also part of the Darling Harbour region. As of 2011, it is Australia's most densely populated suburb.Packed-in Pyrmont is Australia's most densely populated suburb . News.domain.com.au. Retrieved on 2 August 2013. Pyrmont was once a vital component of Sydney's industrial waterfront, with wharves, shipbuilding yards, factories and woolstores. As industry moved out, the population and the area declined. In recent years it has experienced redevelopment with an influx of residents and office workers. History Pyrmont contained a mineral spring of cold water bubbling out of a rock and was thus named for a similar natural spring in Bad Pyrmont, close to Hanover, Germany.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, (Angus and Robertson) 1990, page 213 Thomas Jones was granted of land on the peninsula in 1795. Land was sold to Obadiah Ikin in 1796 for 10 pounds, which he then sold to Captain John Macarthur in 1799 for a gallon of rum.Early Pyrmont Powerhouse Museum Pyrmont was the site of quarries from a fairly early stage because of the quality of the sandstone. Charles Saunders, licensee of the Quarryman's Arms hotel, became the biggest quarrymaster, with three quarries established in the area from 1853. The work was continued by his son and grandson till circa 1931. The quarries were nicknamed Paradise, Purgatory and Hell Hole by the Scottish workers employed by Saunders. Steam-powered equipment was used there for the first time in Australia. The sandstone was used in many of the most significant buildings in Sydney. Saunders Street, near the site of the Paradise quarry, was named after Saunders. There is also a small brewery, the original was built in 1880 near where the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel stands today.Brewing in Pyrmont and Eora country Maybanke Kindergarten, named after Maybanke Anderson, in Harris Street The area was also the site of the first Presbyterian Church in the colony, built in 1864 and situated in Mount Street. The congregation eventually outgrew the premises and had to move to a new church at Quarry Street, Ultimo, in 1883. In the 1870s, a small Methodist chapel was built in Harris Street on land owned by Charles Saunders. In the 1920s, it was converted to the Maybanke Free Kindergarten, named after Maybanke Anderson, a feminist and educationist. It was still used for that purpose as of 2018. Pyrmont became a working class industrial and port community. A major sugar refinery was operated by CSR Limited. In 1900 the area had a population of around 30,000. The first Pyrmont Bridge opened in 1858. A larger bridge with a swinging span opened in 1902, but was closed to traffic in the 1980s. It was subsequently turned into a pedestrian precinct. In 1973, a public meeting held between residents of Pyrmont and Ultimo asked the Builders Labourers Federation imposed a green ban on the North Western Expressway to save much of the suburb. =Decay= Pyrmont was regarded as a slum area in the 19th century. It started to decay seriously after World War II, when industries closed down, and the residents moved to the suburbs. In 1963 the Ultimo Powerhouse closed down as well. Its population declined to only 1,800 by 1978.Bounds, Michael and Morris, Alan: High-rise gentrification: the redevelopment of Pyrmont Ultimo, in Urban Design International, nr.10, 2005 By 1990 the population had dropped to around 900. =Redevelopment in the 1990s= View of Pyrmont from Sydney Tower In order to rejuvenate the area the government initiated the Better Cities Program. In 1992 the City West Development Corporation had been created with the mission to renew the precinct. In 1999 this responsibility has been transferred to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. This led to a larger community of 13,000 by 2004 and also an increase of trade with businesses moving back into the area, totalling 22,000 employees. Almost all industrial function is gone from the area now, replaced by low and high-rise residential developments. The sugar refinery closed down and some of the buildings, including The Cooperage and Tablet House, were restored as residential and office space. Both are listed on the local government heritage register. Following the redevelopment the suburb became more multicultural, with only 35% of residents born in Australia, followed by 8% born in China. Landmarks Pyrmont Fire Station in Pyrmont Street was designed by the Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, in 1907. It is an example of the Federation Free Style, predominantly made of brick with sandstone trimmings, and with Art Nouveau elements. It is now on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/88 The public school in John Street was designed by W.E.Kemp and built in 1891; a brick building, it features a bell tower, belfry and slate roof, and is on the defunct Register of the National Estate.

Transport Pyrmont is linked to the city by the Pyrmont Bridge, a swing bridge for pedestrians and cyclists. The Western Distributor passes through the suburb and provides a connection to the city and then to the North Shore via the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Distributor includes the Anzac Bridge, a large cable-stayed bridge spanning Johnstons Bay between Pyrmont and Rozelle, which replaced the Glebe Island Bridge. The Dulwich Hill Line of Sydney's light rail network includes four light rail stops in the suburb - Pyrmont Bay, The Star, John Street Square and Fish Market. The Pyrmont Bay ferry wharf is served by Cross Harbour ferry services. Pyrmont is also served by buses. Pyrmont was served by the former Sydney tramway network. Services commenced at Railway Square, travelling southwest on Broadway, turning right onto Harris Street, passing the former Darling Harbour Goods Yard. At Pyrmont a separate line branched off from the main line on Harris Street, turning left into Miller Street, turning right into Bank Street, crossing the former Glebe Island Bridge. It then travelled along Commercial Road turning right onto Victoria Road, then right onto Darling Street, terminating at the Darling Street Wharf.Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 6, 2, 1 The tram lines closed in 1958. The Sydney Monorail ran between the city and nearby Darling Harbour across the Pyrmont Bridge between 1988 and 2013. One of the stations of the cancelled Sydney Metro would have been located in Pyrmont, under Union Square. The new Sydney Metro West line, still in planning, may include a station in Pyrmont. Parks Pyrmont Park (left) and Anzac Bridge (background), 2009 St Bartholomew's Park is a small park on the corner of Bowman Street and Cross Street, created in 1954 after the demolition of numbers 113-115 Bowman Street. The park is named after St Bartholomew's Church which once stood nearby on Point Street (now a block of apartments at 22 Point Street). Pyrmont Park is located in the northern tip of the peninsula, overlooking Balmain East, and extends south along the coast up to the beginning of Harris street.

It has a population around 4500 and was named after Baden-Baden, Germany. The approximate population as of 2015, as per township statistics, is 4,940. The area is the site of the Baden Tower, a huge television, radio, and communications tower located on top of one of the Baden Hills, which is the transmitter for CKCO-DT, the CTV affiliate for Kitchener, as well as CFCA-FM and CHYM-FM, which have studios in Kitchener. Much of the area consists of farmlands and pine forests are in the area. The local high school, Waterloo- Oxford District Secondary School, is located just outside the town and the statue park Prime Ministers Path is located on the grounds adjacent to Castle Kilbride. History The first settler in this area was Jacob Beck in 1854; he opened a large flour mill on the Spring Creek. A second flour mill, two saw mills, a flax mill, and an iron foundry also opened in the next 20 years. The settlement was originally called Weissenburg. The village of Baden founded and established in 1855, was originally named after an old bachelor living in the area. Jacob Beck, born in the Grand Duchy of Baden-Baden, Germany, settled in the village and later renamed Baden in 1854. Baden was also the birthplace of Sir Adam Beck, founder of Ontario's public hydroelectric system. By 1864, the town had school and its population was 400. A historical plaque near Baden honours Christian Nafziger, an Amish Mennonite from Munich, Germany, who arrived in 1822 with about 70 families. With assistance from local Mennonites, he was able to obtain the \\"German Block\\" (now Wilmot Township) from the government; many other Amish from Europe settled here. Baden is home to the historic Castle Kilbride, built in 1877 by James Livingston, co-founder of a successful linseed oil company, who went on to represent the area in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the House of Commons of Canada. The home was designed by architect David W. Gingerich, who also designed major projects such as the Mutual Life office block, the Waterloo Town Hall, and the governor's (jailer's) house at the Waterloo County Gaol. In 1993, Castle Kilbride was purchased and restored by Wilmot Township, which spent $6.2 million on the project. The castle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1994 and Wilmot Township's administrative offices and council chamber are housed in an addition to the original building. Baden was also the home town of Sir Adam Beck, who went on to pioneer hydroelectric power, the visible results being the generation plants located in Niagara Falls. Beck has a park named after him in his hometown, as well as an elementary school within the Waterloo Region District School Board. =Prime Ministers Path= Baden is home to Prime Ministers Path, a series of bronze sculptures of Canadian Prime Ministers, designed to have visitors explore the history of the country since Canadian Confederation. The privately funded project was conceived of as a Canada 150 project and has been met with repeated controversy. It was unanimously approved by Wilmot Township councillors in 2016 after attempts to install it in Kitchener's Victoria Park and on the campus of Wilfrid Laurier University failed after public push back about the appropriateness of the project. As of June 2020, statues of Robert Borden, Kim Campbell, William Lyon Mackenzie King, John A. Macdonald, and Lester B. Pearson have been installed. Several of the designs include Easter eggs as nods to notable events or aspects of a prime minster's life. The statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first to be installed, was put in place June 2016. Titled 'A Canadian Conversation', the piece was sculpted by Wilmot artist Ruth Abernethy. It had previously been installed on the Laurier campus, but was removed and relocated after concerns were raised about Macdonald's role in creating the Canadian Indian residential school system. Controversy regarding the statue project was raised again in June 2020, following the dousing of Macdonald's statue in red paint, an act that coincided with the celebration of National Indigenous Peoples Day. A statue of Macdonald had been vandalized with red paint the week prior in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The incidents followed a number of similar occurrences across North America tied to calls for the removal of monuments and memorials following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Wilmot mayor, Les Armstrong, defended the Prime Ministers Path expressing frustration with people who failed to do their research about Macdonald, noting the prime minister had a number of Indigenous friends. Statue creator Ruth Abernathy acknowledged the incident raised important questions about who is deemed worthy of a statue, but cautioned against \\"sanitizing public spaces\\". Cree-Métis educator Lori Campbell challenged the ability of public statues to raise awareness about history due to lack of contextual information. Campbell positioned museums as better and safer spaces for these types of installations, calling their presence in open spaces \\"painful\\".

This line still exists as the CN Guelph Subdivision, which runs from the Park Street bridge in Kitchener (continuing east as the Metrolinx Guelph Subdivision) to London Junction in London, Ontario, where it connects to the CN Dundas Subdivision immediately after crossing over the CP Galt Subdivision. Baden is the location of a rail siding on the Guelph Subdivision, as well as an industrial spur constructed by Pestell Group.https://www.wilmot.ca/en/doing-business/resources/Documents/Township-of- Wilmot-industrial-lands-package.pdf Baden is not currently served by passenger rail, though Wilmot Township has set aside land for a possible future GO Transit layover facility and station in Baden.

She was the Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006, representing Koonung Province. She is the daughter of former state Labor leader Frank Wilkes, and a former teacher and local councillor. Early life Buckingham was born in Melbourne, and went to secondary school in the suburb of Preston, but switched to the selective University High School for her final year. She studied teaching at La Trobe University, and took up her first position teaching history and politics at the somewhat underprivileged Pascoe Vale Girls High School. She taught there from 1975 to 1982, and then worked for a time at the private Mount Scopus College. From 1987, she taught at Presbyterian Ladies' College, and worked there until retiring from teaching in 1991. She took up a position as a careers counsellor the following year. Politics Buckingham was actively involved in a number of community organisations, and was on the board of Box Hill Hospital for several years, as well as being a member of the Monash University Department of Physiology's Animal Ethics Committee. In 1997, Buckingham made a bid to be elected as a councillor for the City of Whitehorse, and was ultimately successful. She became mayor the following year, and served for two years in this capacity. Buckingham was not re-elected as mayor in 2000, but continued to serve as a councillor. She stood as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Deakin at the 2001 election, and was thought to have a chance of winning it. However, the 2001 election was not successful for Labor, and Buckingham was defeated. Her second bid for political office was to be more successful. She switched from federal to state politics, and won pre-selection for the Legislative Council seat of Koonung Province at the 2002 election. It was held by a strong margin by sitting Liberal member Gerald Ashman, but the election resulted in a significant landslide victory for Labor, and Buckingham soundly defeated Ashman, even before the distribution of preferences. She was instrumental in reforms to the regulation of Victorian Bodies Corporate. She also played a strong role on the Parliament's All-Party Education Committee. She also focused on local issues such as preventing the closure of the Angliss Hospital. She served on the Legislative Council Privileges Committees . Her term was marred by a serious illness which forced her to take leave for the second half of 2004. She returned to her duties in 2005 . While on holiday in England during the year, she found herself caught up in the 7 July 2005 London bombings; she was on a train in front of one of those bombed.

Dark Future is a 1988 alternate history and post-apocalyptic science-fantasy miniature wargame by Games Workshop. It is set in the then-future year of 1995 (later updating the setting to 2021), in a post-apocalyptic fantasy-inspired alternate reality where the United States--as well as the rest of the world--has fallen apart. Society has collapsed (almost back to the times of both the Dark Ages and the Wild West-- where there's no law and no order), and the natural laws of physics have broken down. Megacorps are now in total control, technology runs rampant, and Sanctioned Ops patrol the roads and highways tracking down and destroying the renegade scum who live there, outside of the law and doing what they please. Another game like it, bearing the name Dark Future, was originally developed for Games Workshop as a cyberpunk role-playing game, but was canceled. The game's co-author and GW board game developer Marc Gascoigne ported it onto Richard Halliwell's car-racing game system, using a mechanic originally developed for Judge Dredd role-playing game adventure Slaughter Margin. The game was seen as a replacement for GW's early board game Battlecars, which merged James Bond-like combative car gadgets in a Death Race 2000 and Mad Max- styled background. The novels that were written by Jack Yeovil--a pen name of Kim Newman--created an elaborate alternate history in which Elvis Presley is a hard-as-nails bounty hunter and Oliver North is President of the United States. In 2005 the Dark Future setting was brought back as a series of novels published by Games Workshop's fiction imprint Black Flame. They updated the setting to 2021, and released several new titles. However, while several pop- culture references were updated in the books, some lines retain their original wording, and now seem out of place (such as when character Jazzbeaux thinks of the millennium coming around in five years' time in 'Route 666'). In the board game, the player plays the part of a Sanctioned Op--a bounty hunter of the future--or a Renegade, dueling for survival in high-tech vehicles of the present. Dark Future was rebooted as a video game entitled Dark Future: Blood Red States and released in May 2019. Original game components The original game published in 1988 had the following game components: * standard-sized Games Workshop box * illustrated rulebook * 14 sections of interlocking laminated track * 4 plastic cars with interchangeable weapons * 4 plastic motorcycles * markers White Line Fever expansion This is a volume of advanced rules for Dark Future. Inside this book players will find new rules for manoeuvers, shooting, hazards, and new equipment. Also, new vehicles are presented (trikes), new scenarios, and new characters as well. Blood Red States Digital Version Auroch Digital, the UK indie developer responsible for the digital versions of a previous Games Workshop cult classic, Chainsaw Warrior, announced that they would be developing a reboot of the board game as a digital title for Windows. The game is set 30 years after the original setting of the board game in 2025 and was released on Steam on May 16th, 2019. Designer Tomas Rawlings described the inspiration for adapting the original being due to the themes still prevalent today, stating \\"The original rule book talks about the impact of climate change. This was from 1988 where most people would have been oblivious to it. When I read news articles that suggest conflicts like that in Darfur and Syria has climate as a partial catalyst, it shows how prescient Dark Future was.

World The post-apocalyptic and science-fantasy world of the Dark Future series--as detailed by Yeovil/Newman--plays with multiple sci-fi, horror, and dystopia clichés while blending in alternate history and homages & cameos to other fiction (i.e. instead of becoming the President of the United States, actor Ronald Reagan portrayed Maxwell Smart in the TV series Get Smart, famous film murderers like Jason Voorhees are inmates in an asylum in Krokodil Tears, and actor Leonard Nimoy is viewed as a '60s astronaut in Comeback Tour). The world has undergone an intense social, environmental, and moral collapse, combined with a dramatic rise in technology; by the year 1995, violence became the main killer as well as mutating viruses ASD, CSE and PHD. Cover of Comeback Tour, second 90s printing. In the Demon Download Cycle books, the main antagonist is Elder Nguyen Seth, the ageless Summoner of the Great Old Ones, who is trying to bring about the end of the world. As of the late 1990s, he's doing this as leader of the Brethren of Joseph (which he himself brought about in 1843) and clashes with the various protagonists. As well as causing blood sacrifices to his masters, he sacrifices the potential of artists and thinkers - including Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, the Marquis de Sade, and Elvis (via Colonel Tom Parker) - after showing them a brief glimpse of the Old Ones, corrupting them. Route 666 has Seth responsible for the bizarre circumstances of Poe's death, and revealed he tried and failed to sacrifice Elvis as well (meaning the real-life shape of Elvis' career after 1960). The main point of divergence in this timeline was the 1960 Presidential election - here, John F. Kennedy was caught in an affair with Marilyn Monroe, crippling his support and giving Richard Nixon the Presidency. The Solid Sixties were seen as a golden age of peace, stability and decent, if hypocritical, moral values in America, under a popular but authoritarian President. Legal restrictions were removed from businesses, allowing for both technological advancement and ending regulations against pollution. Racial strife was considered to be ended by the Separate But Equal laws; the influence this had on culture included a Lieutenant O'Hara in Star Trek and James M. Hendrix and his Merry Minstrels performing big-band music, while operating an underground movement to Make America Groove Again. Other key resistance operatives included Dr. Jim Morrison, whose experimental LSD and Black Hole bio-tech engineering opened 'the doors of perception'; Lt. J. Joplin of the California Liberation Front, and the jet fighter squadron called the Black Panthers. Successive Presidents would be Barry Goldwater, Spiro Agnew, \\"Big Chuck\\" Heston (a parody of Reagan becoming President), and Oliver North with a truncated term by ex-CIA director Jack Ryan. Thanks to the increased pollution, drastic climate change and damage to mid-western water supplies would cause most of America to become desert (\\"the Des\\") from the 70s onwards. Violent dystopian gangcults - the Maniax, the Psychopomps, and the Confederate Air Force being central to the books - would rise to prominence. In 1985, to control the increasing violence, the Enderby Amendment opened up law enforcement to private groups and individuals: the Sanctioned Ops, the most famous being Turner-Harvest-Ramirez Agency and their star agent Rachel \\"Redd\\" Harvest. President Heston would also bring in the Moral Re-Armament Drive and recreate the United States Road Cavalry, a heavily armed Mad Max- style group garbed like the original Cavalry, to patrol the roadways and interstates. By the (then) near future of 1995, the major cities have for been split between Policed Zones and the lawless NoGos for over a decade; several of the southern states have re-legalised slavery under the term \\"indentured labour\\"; New York has a wall to keep out rising flood waters, while New Orleans is succumbing to floods. The North government is bankrupt, thanks to the (deliberately) disastrous policies of free-market economist Ottakar Proktor, secretly a serial killer. Utah, a completely abandoned and dead area, has been sold to the sinister Brethren of Joseph, a religious group formed in the 19th Century, who have reclaimed the dead land and renamed it Deseret. The Catholic Church was drastically changed when Nelson Mandela became Pope in the 1970s. Increased liberalisations were introduced out of necessity - same-sex marriage, use of contraception, end to celibacy, and nuns given the same status as priests - and the Vatican became politically involved (both diplomatically and militarily) in conflicts where a Good and Evil side could be identified. Thanks to Vatican negotiations, US involvement in Central America was ended in the 70s. The Church maintains major computer systems and intelligence networks, and is involved in many covert actions, including against the Josephites. Large amounts of power belong in the hands of corporations, mainly the \\"JapCorps\\" like GenTech, who can manipulate major governments. GenTech even has a neutrality treaty with the United States in case of \\"corporate war\\" with the now fractured Soviet bloc following the Chernobyl Revolution and the Eurasian Uprisings. The USSR is no more. Instead, there is the UPP, the ESU and the CSA. The UPP is led by bloated alcoholic Zhabnkv. The ESU is headed by Kropotkin and the CSA by Volodin. A stronger Argentina won a decisive victory over Britain in the Malvinas War, using GenTech and G-Mek weaponry. Britain, already a more insular and conservative nation at the time, became a depressed and failing state, to the point of selling off the modern London Bridge for cash; Ian Paisley was Prime Minister until he suffered a heart attack after the loss of Port Stanley; Jeffrey Archer has been the leader since, carrying out heavy rationing and implied dictatorial actions, with John Lennon the head of the Labour Party. In place of the Bay of Pigs, there was a major American invasion of Cuba that saw Castro outed. Continental Europe has been unified into the United European Community under President LePen, with numerous insurrectionist clashes; Sicily is now a prison camp. Japan is home to the ultranationalist Blood Banner Society. Since the seventies, the states of Central American have been unified into the socialist Central American Confederation, which has stopped exporting coffee. Mexico has collapsed into permanent civil war. The Middle East is dominated by the Pan-Islamic Congress, a union of states, and \\"liberated\\" Albania, Greece, Macedonia, and Kosovo. Global warming has melted much of Antarctica, leaving it open to mining interests; Argentina controls most of it. The Vietnam War took place with the Soviet Union in America's place and China pouring in to Indochina, while many young Russians fled to Finland to avoid the draft; the USSR lost to North Vietnam, but not after devastating its ally China in the Nine-Minute War nuclear exchange. The war led to China descending into feudal states, while the Soviet Union suffered major social unrest from its youths and the loss of territory to Japan & the Pan-Islamics. The end result was Yuri Andropov's coup in 1973, which led to the USSR becoming a more democratic and peaceful state with greater freedoms until the rebellions of the late 80s and throughout the 90s shattered the bloc. Nixon's Presidency saw NASA given more funding and support while being heavily chased for results; the Moon was landed on in 1965 at the cost of many dead astronauts. Nixon's legacy was the Needlepoint System of laser satellites, which proved so costly and difficult to produce that they led to the Spiro administration shutting down NASA in 1978. Cape Canaveral was abandoned to the swamp. NASA was restarted as a public-private enterprise by billionaire investors Donald Trump, Bill Gates and Ross Perot in 1980. The Soviet space program ended when Yuri Gagarin was killed in his first space flight and the cost of the Vietnam War prevented them from recovering. Rock and roll music collapsed after New Year's Day 1961, when Reverend Jimmy Swaggart led a march against a Madison Square Garden rock festival; the three-day Rock and Roll Riots left many major stars dead or crippled, and Nixon branded the music as a severe moral threat, leading to moral standards being placed on the American industry. More 'moral' music like Pat Boone and the \\"English Invasion\\" - Ken Dodd, Matt Monro, and Valerie Singleton - took over. Britain is still dominated by this type of music, with groups like the John Lydon Band and their patriotic hit God Save the Queen. Russian \\"Sovrock\\", inspired by bootleg tapes of rock music, would take prominence and lead the USSR to cultural dominance, with singers like Andrei Tarkovsky becoming international stars. As a result, Elvis Presley rejoined the army in 1961 and remained there until 1989, then leaving to become a Sanctioned Op defending the Deep South; very few people outside of the USSR and Japan remember his music career, while Elvis has a recurring nightmare of himself an obese self-parody of his former self, unable to remember the music. The Beatles never formed; years later, when Elvis was bodyguarding John Lennon MP, Lennon would remark that he might've stayed with music if Elvis had not retired (a twist on their real- life meeting). The main news service, used in the novels to deliver exposition and world-building, is ZeeBeeCee (a pun on BBC), a GenTech group. It will occasionally divert from reporting stories to 'reporting' how pollution has been found not to have killed off the whales or how indentured labourers are not slaves.

The film is an adaptation of Hal Roach's Our Gang, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as The Little Rascals) which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children. The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur, and Penelope Spheeriswho also directedpresents several of the Our Gang characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It was the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were Liar Liar and Heartbreakers. Another film based on Our Gang, The Little Rascals Save the Day, was released as a direct-to-video feature in 2014. Plot Spanky McFarland is the president of the \\"He-Man Woman Haters Club\\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer, Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, \\"The Blur\\", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. The boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla, with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans. At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date . When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down. Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo, the new kid in town whose father is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, he is assigned by Stymie to guard the go-kart until the day of the race. Alfalfa makes several attempts to win back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially denied entrance to her ballet recital, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a frog to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies, Butch and Woim , who chase them inside the building. To escape, Spanky and Alfalfa duck into a costume room and disguise themselves as ballerinas in pink tights, tutus, and wigs. They manage to evade the bullies, but they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises. They are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla. The boys nervously pretend to be in the recital that is about to take place, but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Darla admits that she doesn't miss him, but does miss his voice. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress enters and ushers them all on stage. The recital begins, as the children are performing scenes from \\"The Nutcracker.\\" Alfalfa hands the frog to Spanky, but Spanky drops the frog into the waistband of Alfalfa's tights. Alfalfa squirms in discomfort as the slimy frog wriggles around in his tights, turning the show to chaos as he tries to catch it while still dancing along. The girls break out into laughter, along with the audience. The recital ends, and the boys run off stage and Alfalfa quickly ducks behind a curtain and strips out of his disguise in order to get the frog out. The ballet mistress, furious that the boys ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. Butch and Woim chase Alfalfa into a mansion, but are turned away by the maid. Escaping through the back door, Alfalfa is chased by Waldo's Doberman, and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side. As he climbs out, he notices his underwear floating on the surface of the pool. As Alfalfa retrieves his underwear, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. At the carnival talent show the day before the race, the boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat and Porky, have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree, finds out about the scheme and confronts Spanky, but he convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby. Alfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his singing voice. Waldo and Darla have also entered the show in a duet. Alfalfa then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song. As a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, \\"The Blur\\" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys need a new go-kart. They band together to build \\"Blur 2: The Sequel,\\" and on the day before the race, Spanky and Alfalfa (who previously had a falling out when the latter discovers the gang's \\"prank list\\", which was the proof that the gang sabotaged Alfalfa's picnic with Darla) reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson. Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also in the race, but they are eventually annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, \\"The Blur 2\\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo- finish between \\"The Blur\\" and \\"The Blur 2\\" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim, scared, jumps into the slop willingly. Along with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone because she found out that Waldo was responsible for the bubbles at the talent show. Meanwhile, Spanky is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be female. Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys were responsible for ruining their picnic lunch. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla and her friends as well as other girls into the club.

Production Bill Thomas, Jr., son of the late Bill Thomas, who played the original Buckwheat, contacted the studio and was invited down to visit the set, but got the impression that the filmmakers did not want him or any of the surviving original cast members involved in any production capacity. The surviving cast members saw this as especially hurtful, in light of the fact that director Penelope Spheeris had previously made a point of including Buddy Ebsen, from the original Beverly Hillbillies, in her 1993 feature film adaptation of that series. Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent Our Gang comedies, tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, \\"It's real cold.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 23% based on reviews from 13 critics, although it has an audience rating of 70% as of April 2020. On Metacritic it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"A-\\" on scale of A to F. Brian Lowry of Variety magazine wrote: \\"Those who grew up watching The Little Rascals may well be intrigued by the idea of introducing their kids to this full-color, bigscreen version. Still, the challenge of stretching those mildly diverting shorts to feature length remains formidable, and one has to wonder whether an audience exists beyond nostalgic parents and their young children.\\" =Box office= The Little Rascals earned $10 million at the North American box office during its opening weekend. The film grossed a worldwide total of $67,308,282.  Year-end lists  *Dishonorable mention – Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Dishonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph Repurposed scenes and situations Many of the gags and subplots in the film were borrowed from the original Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts. These include: * The scene in which Buckwheat and Porky are fishing and get their fishing lines tangled originates from a scene in the 1943 Our Gang short Three Smart Guys with Buckwheat, Froggy, and Mickey. * The He-Man Woman Haters Club originally appeared in the 1937 Our Gang short Hearts are Thumps; the club would return in the short Mail and Female the same year. The plots for both shorts were reused for the film. In addition, the scene where the gang ruins Alfalfa and Darla's lunch date, as well as the scene where bubbles come out of Alfalfa's mouth while he sings, were borrowed gags from Hearts are Thumps. Alfalfa sending Buckwheat and Porky to deliver a love note to Darla was borrowed from Mail and Female. * The \\"hi- sign\\" originally appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short Anniversary Trouble, and the animated 1979 special, The Little Rascals Christmas Special. * The children dressing up as fire fighters and attempting to put out a fire appeared in the Our Gang shorts Fire Fighters (1922), The Fourth Alarm (1926), and Hook and Ladder (1932). The gag in which Spanky (Travis Tedford) winds up on a flying water hose was originally used with Farina in The Fourth Alarm. * The gag involving Spanky and Stymie disguising as adults appeared in a handful of Our Gang shorts. Mickey Daniels and Johnny Downs attempted to dress up as Santa Claus with this gag in the 1926 short Good Cheer. Farina and Pleurisy tried this routine in the 1929 short Election Day. Stymie and Dickie Moore tried it in the 1933 short Fish Hooky, while Spanky and Alfalfa tried pulling it off in both the 1935 short Teacher's Beau and the 1936 short Two Too Young. * The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa accidentally find themselves performing in a ballet recital was inspired by the plot of the 1937 short Rushin' Ballet. The costumes that the duo wear are exact replicas of the costumes that the original Spanky and Alfalfa wore in Rushin' Ballet. The gag in which Alfalfa gets a frog loose in his clothes was originally used in the 1937 short Framing Youth, where Spanky was trying to convince him he had a frog in his throat. * Alfalfa singing \\"The Barber of Seville\\" originated in Our Gang Follies of 1938. * The idea of the children building their own vehicle out of junk and scrap metal had been used in several Our Gang shorts, most notably the 1934 short Hi'-Neighbor!. The gag in which the kids' car causes several adults to leap into the air was also borrowed from Hi'-Neighbor!, and also appears in One Wild Ride (1925), Free Wheeling (1932), and Divot Diggers (1936). * Much of the Go-Cart race climax (including the gag in which the car belonging to Butch and Woim accidentally goes into reverse) was borrowed from the 1939 short Auto Antics. Material from Hi'-Neighbor and Three Men in a Tub (1938) is also present. Home media The Little Rascals was released on VHS and DVD in 1995 and 2004 respectively. It made its Blu-Ray debut in 2014.

He came to prominence in the 1960s as one of the Liverpool poets, and writes primarily lyrical poetry about human relationships. His famous works include: \\"Little Johnny's Confessions\\", \\"The irrelevant Song\\", \\"Vanishing Trick\\", \\"Emma's Doll\\", \\"Impossible Parents\\", amongst others. Career Patten was born in Bootle, England, near the Liverpool docks. He attended Sefton Park School in the Smithdown Road area of Liverpool, where his early poetic writing was encouraged. He left school at fifteen and began work for The Bootle Times writing a column on popular music. Together with the other two Liverpool poets, Roger McGough and Adrian Henri, Patten published The Mersey Sound in 1967. One of the best-selling poetry anthologies of modern times, The Mersey Sound aimed to make poetry accessible to a broader audience. It has been described as the most significant anthology of the twentieth century. Together with Henri and McGough, Patten was awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool in 2001. Patten's first published volumes of poems were Little Johnny's Confession (1967) and Notes to the Hurrying Man (1969). The later collections Storm Damage (1988) and Armada (1996) are more varied, the latter featuring a sequence of poems concerning the death of his mother and memories of his childhood. Armada is perhaps Patten's most mature and formal book, dispensing with much of the playfulness of former work. He has also written comic verse for children, notably Gargling With Jelly and Thawing Frozen Frogs. Patten's style is generally lyrical and his subjects are primarily love and relationships. His 1981 collection Love Poems draws together his best work in this area from the previous sixteen years. Charles Causley commented that he \\"reveals a sensibility profoundly aware of the ever-present possibility of the magical and the miraculous, as well as of the granite-hard realities. These are undiluted poems, beautifully calculated, informed - even in their darkest moments - with courage and hope.\\" Patten's poem So Many Different Lengths of Time has in recent times, become a popular poem recited at Funerals. Opening his poem with verse by Pablo Neruda, Patten's poem argues that it is the act of remembrance which offers family members the best antidote to the anguish of loss. In tackling the subject of grief, Patten views poetry as performing an important social function: ‘Poetry helps us understand what we’ve forgotten to remember. It reminds us of things that are important to us when the world overtakes us emotionally.’ https://beyond.life/blog/the-poetry-of-remembrance-pablo-neruda-brian-patten/ Selected bibliography =Publications with others= * The Mersey Sound (1967) =Poetry collections for adults= * Little Johnny's Confession * Notes to the Hurrying Man * The Irrelevant Song * Vanishing Trick * Grave Gossip * Love Poems * Storm Damage * Grinning Jack * Armada * Selected Poems * Collected Love Poems * The Projectionist's Nightmare * Geography Lesson =Books for children= * The Elephant and the Flower * Jumping Mouse * Emma's Doll * Gargling With Jelly * Mr Moon's Last Case * Jimmy Tag-Along * Thawing Frozen Frogs * Juggling With Gerbils * The Story Giant * Impossible Parents, illustrated by Arthur Robins (Walker Books, 1994), * The Impossible Parents Go Green, illus.

He was the son of Richard of the Principate and the 2nd cousin of Tancred, Prince of Galilee, both participants on the First Crusade. He became regent of Antioch when Tancred died in 1112; the actual prince, Bohemund II, was still a child. Like Tancred, Roger was almost constantly at war with the nearby Muslim states such as Aleppo. In 1114 there was an earthquake that destroyed many of the fortifications of the principality, and Roger took great care to rebuild them, especially those near the frontier. Roger defeated Bursuq ibn Bursuq in 1115 at the Battle of Tell Danith. With Joscelin I of Edessa, Roger put enough military pressure on Aleppo that the city allied with Ortoqid emir Ilghazi in 1118. Ilghazi invaded the Principality in 1119, and despite the urging of the Patriarch, Roger did not wait for reinforcements from Jerusalem or Tripoli. At the ensuing Battle of Ager Sanguinis he had 700 knights and 3000 foot soldiers, including 500 Armenian cavalry, but nearly all were killed, including Roger himself. Ilghazi's forces scattered to plunder the surrounding land and did not attack Antioch itself. Baldwin II of Jerusalem came north to take over the regency of the principality. He married Cecilia of Le Bourcq, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Rethel and sister of Baldwin II. No children of this union are recorded. Roger's reign was chronicled by his chancellor Walter. Roger is also known in numismatic history for the unique series of coins, minted during his reign. Despite ruling for less than seven years, he had two different types of coin, minted in his name at Antioch. Copper coin of Roger of Salerno issued during his reign (1112-1119). The use of copper implies that Byzantine influence persisted over the Principality of Antioch's coinage at this time. The coin is also notable for bearing one of the earliest images of St. George and the dragon on a coin.The first type bore the image of the Mother of God Orans, standing full-height. The second type bore the image of the Miracle of Saint George and the Dragon. It is quite possible that it was minted after Roger's great victory at the Battle of Tell Danith. Prince Roger was in fact the first ruler in the Christian world to depict the Miracle of Saint George and the Dragon on his coinage.

A three-time Olympian, McPeak garnered 72 career beach volleyball titles with career earnings of $1.4 million USD. She is third in titles won (behind Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh) and second in career earnings (behind May-Treanor) for female professional beach volleyball players. She won a bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics with partner Elaine Youngs. Though McPeak was considered short for a beach volleyball player at 5 feet 7 inches in height, she was one of the toughest players to beat on the tour. Early life and college career McPeak was born and raised in Manhattan Beach, California. She attended Mira Costa High School. While there she was a member of two CIF 5-A champion volleyball teams. During her junior year, in 1985, the Mustangs went undefeated (29–0) en route to winning the state championship. In 1986 Mira Costa again went undefeated through the regular season and reached the championship match before losing in the finals. The team finished with a 23–1 mark. Mira Costa head coach Dae Lea Aldrich, who had led the Mustangs to three state championships, two No. 1 national rankings, eight CIF titles and two state finals over a ten year period, offered the following on McPeak: \\"She's a workaholic. She's a great athlete who will do anything you ask, and she'll do it twice as hard. She's the girl that does the extra mile and the extra lifting in the off season.\\" McPeak was a three-time All-Ocean League and All-Southern Section setter at Mira Costa. Though short in stature at 5'7\\", she was heavily recruited. Volleyball Monthly magazine called her \\"the most coveted setter in the country.\\" Among McPeak's top choices were scholarship offers from the UCLA Bruins and the Golden Bears of the University of California, Berkeley. McPeak chose to attend college at UC Berkeley for its academic excellence. At Cal, McPeak was named Pacific 10 Conference freshman of the year in 1987. At the conclusion of McPeak's freshman year Cal head coach Marlene Piper moved to teach and coach at UC Davis, and was replaced by Dave DeGroot. The coaching change was problematic for the intense McPeak, who found DeGroot unwilling or unable to push the team. For his part DeGroot was not happy with how McPeak was setting the team. Commenting at the time, fellow Bear teammate Lisa Arce, who had played with McPeak at both Mira Costa High and Berkeley, said \\"Holly is definitely a competitor. She's not one to lose. She always plays to win, whether its a drill, a scrimmage or a game.\\" McPeak continued under DeGroot through her junior year, and led the Golden Bears to three playoff berths in three years. Over time McPeak's conflict with the Cal head coach escalated to the point of an impasse. After her junior season in 1989 DeGroot banned McPeak from the team. She could continue her studies at Berkeley under scholarship, but she was not allowed to practice or play for the volleyball team. Believing her college career was over, McPeak resigned herself to focusing on her academics. However, a teammate encouraged her to consider transferring. The one school she desired to play for was UCLA. Pacific-10 conference policy required a transferring athlete to sit out two years before they can compete at another conference school. She spoke with UCLA head coach Andy Banachowski, who noted McPeak was in a special circumstance, as her scholarship school had banned her from further participation. McPeak challenged the policy so that she might transfer and play her final season with the Bruins. To win the appeal, McPeak's case had to be approved by faculty athletic representatives from each of the league's 10 institutions. With Banachowski's help, she succeeded in gaining the support of the athletic representatives from all 10 conference schools, including those from the University of California at Berkeley. The vote was unanimous to waive the transfer rule. Joining UCLA for her senior season, McPeak was joining one of the top programs in the nation. However, the Bruins were hungry to regain the national championship, having fallen in the semi-finals the previous two seasons. They were returning several key players, including the team's setter. With the 1990 season UCLA won their first three matches, suffered a loss in the fourth to perennial power Nebraska, and then went on a tear. Splitting time at the setter position, McPeak had an immediate impact upon the team. By early in the year she had taken over the starting spot, beating out junior setter Jennifer Gratteau. Against Stanford she broke a UCLA record with 97 assists. Said Banachowski \\"We were very good last year with Jennifer, but we finally made the decision to go with Holly because she added a lot more quickness. Everybody seemed to play at a quicker pace when Holly was in there.\\" DeGroot witnessed this for himself during Cals two losses to the Bruins during the 1990 regular season. The 1990 UCLA Bruins won the NCAA collegiate championship. It was the school's fifth of seven national titles. McPeak was selected first team All-Pac-10 and first team All-Tournament. She had amassed the single season assist record of 2,192 assists, to go along with her single match assist mark of 97 assists. The team's season record of 36 - 1 was the best mark in women's volleyball in school history. Said coach Banachowski \\"We wanted McPeak out of high school because she was a tremendous athlete. I only wish I had had her for the three years instead of the one. Besides being a great athlete, she's quick and very competitive.\\" The following year McPeak served as an assistant coach for Banachowski, whose Bruins repeated as national champions. Soon thereafter McPeak became intensely involved in professional beach volleyball. She continued her studies at UCLA, graduating in 1995 with a degree in English.Holly McPeak ’95 Career in beach volleyball McPeak grew up at Marine street, and followed local teams such as Jim Menges and Matt Gage, Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland, and later Karch Kiraly and Sinjin Smith. After graduating high school in 1987, McPeak made her pro beach volleyball debut at the age of 18, partnering with Jill Horning at the WPVA \\"Miller Lite Open\\" in Santa Monica. Horning had been a year ahead of McPeak at Mira Costa High. The team scored a ninth place finish, an accomplishment the young rookies repeated later that summer in the pair's second professional tournament. Following McPeak's freshman year at Cal she and Horning partnered again for two more pro beach volleyball tournaments, again finishing ninth each time. McPeak was named the WPVA's Rookie of the Year in 1991, but it was not until 1993 at the Phoenix Open that she would win her first tournament. She would win 11 tournaments that year, eight of them with Cammy Ciarelli. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, McPeak teamed up with Nancy Reno, but they finished in fifth place with a 2 – 2 record. This was right behind the American team of Barbra Fontana and Linda Hanley, which lost the bronze-medal game and finished fourth. Fontana and Hanley had defeated McPeak and Reno in face-to-face competition in this double-elimination tournament, thus eliminating McPeak and Reno and sending them to fifth place. McPeak returned for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, teaming with Misty May in May's first Olympic competition. The pair won through the first two rounds, but then lost 16-14 in a hard fought quarter-final match against Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel of Brazil. The team finished tied for fifth place. In 2002 the AVP shortened the court dimensions from 30 feet by 60 feet to 8 meters by 16 meters (26 feet 3 inches by 52 feet 6 inches). The rule change decreased the area a player had to defend, making player height a more essential element of a player's success. Shorter players like McPeak were placed at a disadvantage. The change followed the FIVB change from the year before. Said McPeak, \\"I liked the big courts better - with ball control we could make the big girls run.\\" At the 2004 Summer Olympics McPeak teamed with Elaine Youngs. The pair reached the semifinals where they met McPeak's former partner Misty May, and her new partner Kerri Walsh. May and Walsh won the match, sending McPeak and Youngs to the bronze medal match, where they faced Australians Natalie Cook and Nicole Sanderson. McPeak and Youngs won to earn their first Olympic medal.Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs Win Bronze on the Beach During the 2005 season, McPeak teamed up with Jennifer Kessy and with Nicole Branagh for the 2006 season. After Branagh left to partner with Elaine Youngs, McPeak partnered with indoor volleyball player Logan Tom for the 2007 AVP season. She then partnered with Angie Akers. McPeak was planning to retire after the 2008 AVP season, but decided to continue for the 2009 season. After three-straight ninth-place finishes in her first three AVP events of the season, she retired for good on May 6, 2009, a week shy of her 40th birthday. McPeak's career in professional beach volleyball spanned over twenty years. She ranked in the top 10 six times on the AVP Tour and seven times on the FIVB Tour. She was the first woman to break one million dollars in earnings. She won titles with seven different partners. McPeak is one of just five women worldwide to have competed in the first three Olympics in beach volleyball. Player profile McPeak was a quick and highly competitive athlete. A 5-foot-7 defensive specialist, she was a hard worker and was known for her intense off-court training regimen. She could consistently side out, scoring with placement more frequently than power. She preferred playing on the larger courts of the earlier years, where player height was at less of a premium. She had a long career, and had at least one career victory every year from 1993 to 2004, with the exception of 1998, when there was no women's domestic tour. She states she came to realize she could win with any partner, and once she made that realization her confidence increased. McPeak states her toughest opponents were Kerri Walsh and Misty May. Said McPeak at her induction in 2013: \\"They just drove me crazy, and to this day they still do.\\" Broadcast career Since retiring from beach volleyball, McPeak works as a color commentator for Pac-12 volleyball shown on Fox Sports West, including most televised games of UCLA. She also does color for SEC coverage on the SEC Network. In 2014, McPeak served as a sand volleyball game analyst for Pac-12 Network. Personal life McPeak is married to former AVP commissioner Leonard Armato. She has a twin brother (Gary), and a sister (Katie). Awards and honors At UCLA in 1990 she was selected first-team All-Pacific-10, first-team All-Pacific Region and first-team All-NCAA Tournament. On October 30, 2009, McPeak was inducted into Volleyball Hall of Fame.

The legend of Iram The Quran mentions Iram in connection with ‘imad (pillars): There are several explanations for the reference to \\"Iram – who had lofty pillars\\". Some see this as a geographic location, either a city or an area, others as the name of a tribe. Those identifying it as a city have made various suggestions as to where or what city it was, ranging from Alexandria or Damascus to a city which actually moved or a city called Ubar. As an area, it has been identified with the biblical region known as Aram. It has also been identified as a tribe, possibly the tribe of ʿĀd, with the pillars referring to tent pillars. \\"The identification of Wadi Rum with Iram and the tribe of ʿĀd, mentioned in the Quran, has been proposed by scholars who have translated Thamudic and Nabataean inscriptions referring to both the place Iram and the tribes of ʿĀd and Thamud by name.\\" According to some Islamic beliefs, King Shaddad was the king of the Iram of the Pillars who defied the warnings of the prophet Hud, whereupon Allah smote the city, driving it into the sands, never to be seen again. The ruins of the city are thought to lie buried somewhere in the sands of Rub' al Khali (The Empty Quarter). Iram became known to Western literature with the translation of the story \\"The City of Many-Columned Iram and Abdullah Son of Abi Kilabah\\" in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. Archeological research In November 1991, the remains of a settlement were discovered in southern Oman and hypothesized to be the legendary lost city claimed to have been destroyed by God. In 1992 Ranulph Fiennes wrote a book called Atlantis of the Sands about the expedition. The term Atlantis of the Sands had originally been coined by T. E. Lawrence.https://www.psu.com/news/the-atlantis-of-the-sands-the-real-myth- behind-uncharted-3/ Archaeologist Juris Zarins discussed Ubar in a 1996 NOVA interview: By 2007, following further research and excavation, a study authored in part by Zarins could be summarised as follows: * As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by ground water being taken to irrigate the surrounding oasis. * Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that \\"Ubar\\" was more likely to have been a region—the “Land of the Iobaritae” identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin. Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods. In Ahadith There are many Hadiths about Iram, with one being the story of 'Abdullah bin Qalabah, who found Iram of the Pillars while searching for his lost camel. The story has been rejected by some Islamic scholars who consider the story an Isra'iliyyat Hadith. Ka’b al-Ahbar, who told the story, was Jewish before he converted to Islam, and thus he was accused by some scholars of narrating Isra'iliyyat stories.

It was previously considered conspecific with the yellow-footed gull (Larus livens) of the Gulf of California. The western gull ranges from British Columbia, Canada to Baja California, Mexico. Description Western Gull in flight over the cliffs of Bodega Head The western gull is a large gull that can measure in total length, spans across the wings, and weighs . The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The western gull has a white head and body, and gray wings. It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). It closely resembles the slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus). In the north of its range it forms a hybrid zone with its close relative the glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens). Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage, their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. The western gull typically lives about 15 years, but can live up to 25 years. The largest western gull colony is on the Farallon Islands, located about west of San Francisco, California; an estimated 30,000 gulls live in the San Francisco Bay area. Western gulls also live in the Oregon Coast.  Distribution and habitat  The western gull is a year-round resident in California, Oregon, Baja California, and southern Washington. It is migratory, moving to northern Washington, British Columbia, and Baja California Sur to spend the nonbreeding season. Behavior Pair-bonding behaviour The western gull rarely ventures more than approximately 100 miles inland, almost never very far from the ocean; it is almost an exclusively marine gull. It nests on offshore islands and rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries. A colony also exists on Ano Nuevo Island, then Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park, and Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In the colonies, long term pairs aggressively defend territories whose borders may shift slightly from year to year, but are maintained for the life of the male. =Feeding= Western gulls feed in pelagic environments and in intertidal environments. At sea, they take fish and invertebrates like krill, squid and jellyfish. They are unable to dive and feed exclusively on the surface of the water. On land they feed on seal and sea lion carcasses and roadkill, as well as cockles, starfish, limpets and snails in the intertidal zone. They also feed on human food refuse, in human-altered habitats including landfills, and take food given to them, or stolen from people at marinas, beaches and parks. Western gulls are known to be predatory, killing and eating the young of other birds, especially ducklings, and even the adults of some smaller bird species. Western gulls, including one who lived at Oakland's Lake Merritt are known for killing and eating pigeons (rock doves). They will also snatch fish from a cormorant's or pelican's mouth before it is swallowed. Reproduction A nest of vegetation is constructed inside the parent's territory and 3 eggs are laid. These eggs are incubated for a month. The chicks, once hatched, remain inside the territory until they have fledged. Chicks straying into the territory of another gull are liable to be killed by that territory's pair. Chick mortality is high, with on average one chick surviving to fledging. On occasion, abandoned chicks will be adopted by other gulls. =Hybridization= In Washington state, the western gull hybridizes frequently with the glaucous- winged gull, and may closely resemble a Thayer's gull. The hybrids have a flatter and larger head and a thicker bill with a pronounced angle on the lower part of the bill, which distinguishes it from the smaller Thayer's gull. Western gulls and humans Over San Francisco Bay The western gull is currently not considered threatened. However, they have, for a gull, a restricted range. Numbers were greatly reduced in the 19th century by the taking of seabird eggs for the growing city of San Francisco. Western gull colonies also suffered from disturbance where they were turned into lighthouse stations, or, in the case of Alcatraz, a prison. Western gulls are very aggressive when defending their territories and consequently were persecuted by some as a menace. The automation of lighthouses and the closing of Alcatraz Prison allowed the species to reclaim parts of its range. They are currently vulnerable to climatic events like El Niño events and oil spills. Thousands of western gulls and chicks reside at the Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park. Western gulls have become a serious nuisance to the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Thousands of gulls fly over AT&T; Park in San Francisco during late innings of games. They swarm the field, defecate on fans, and after games eat leftovers of stadium food in the seats; how the birds know when games are about to end is unknown. The gulls left while a red- tailed hawk visited the park in late 2011, but returned after the hawk disappeared. Federal law prohibits shooting the birds, and hiring a falconer would cost the Giants $8000 a game. In media The western gull was one of the antagonists in Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie The Birds which was filmed in Bodega Bay, California.

Born in Wallasey, Cheshire, he became best known for directing many comedies produced at Ealing Studios and had a 40-year career editing and directing many films and television programmes. For the acclaimed comedy A Fish Called Wanda (1988), Crichton was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (along with the film's star John Cleese).  Early life and education  Crichton, one of six siblings, was born on 6 August 1910 in Wallasey, Cheshire, England. He was educated at the University of Oxford.  Career  =Editing= In 1931, Crichton began his career in the film industry as a film editor. His first credit as editor was Men of Tomorrow (1932). He edited over fifty films, such as Things to Come (1936). Other films he edited included those that were produced by Alexander Korda, such as Cash (1933), The Girl from Maxim's (1933), The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), Sanders of the River (1935), Elephant Boy (1937) and The Thief of Bagdad (1940). Crichton was paid £8 per week for his editing. In 1940, Crichton began his employment at Ealing Studios. There he edited the film, The Big Blockade (1942). Crichton also served as an associate producer of the film, Nine Men (1943), which he also edited. =Directing= Crichton made his directorial debut with For Those in Peril (1944). In 1945, he directed Painted Boats and co-directed a segment in Dead of Night. Crichton then directed Hue and Cry (1947), a film considered to be the first comedy released by Ealing Studios. Crichton later directed Against the Wind (1948) and Dance Hall (1950). Crichton then directed Alec Guinness in The Lavender Hill Mob (1951). This was followed by Hunted (1952), starring Dirk Bogarde. Afterwards, Crichton directed The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Later films he directed during the 1950s included The Divided Heart (1954), Law and Disorder (1958), and Floods of Fear (1959). He also directed Peter Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes (1959). Crichton was the original director of Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), but he quit after clashing with Burt Lancaster. Crichton was then replaced by John Frankenheimer. Crichton said of the experience: \\"Had I known that Burt Lancaster was to be de facto producer, I do not think I would have accepted the assignment, as he had a reputation for quarreling with better directors than I. But Harold Hecht, the credited producer, had assured me that there would be no interference from Lancaster. This did not prove to be the case.\\" Crichton was also planning another film project with Sammy Davis, Jr., but it never came to fruition due to the death of a producer involved with it. The Third Secret (1964) and He Who Rides a Tiger (1965), the last two films Crichton directed during the 1960s, were not successful. The latter film was the last film he directed in 23 years. Crichton moved to directing television shows, then corporate videos. The latter were through John Cleese's company Video Arts. This led Cleese to propose Crichton returning to the crime comedy film genre.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/449392/ Beginning in 1983, Cleese and Crichton worked together on the story for A Fish Called Wanda. Cleese wrote the screenplay. When the film went into production in 1987, Cleese had to act as stand-by director for insurance reasons since Crichton was 77 years old. Cleese said of working with Crichton as a stand-by director: \\"That was a subterfuge. I knew the studio would be worried about Charlie's age. I don't know anything about how to direct, but that doesn't stop one-half of the directors. I simply prayed that Charlie would be on the set every morning. He shoots in such a way to convey the essence of every scene. He's economical. He's a dear man who's terrified of showing off. If he says anything shrewd or insightful, he'll apologize for a minute so he won't be considered pompous.\\"  Personal life and death  In 1936, Crichton married Vera Harman-Mills, and together they had two sons, David and Nicholas. Nicholas became an eminent judge and reformer in UK family law. Crichton married his second wife, Nadine Haze, in 1962, and their marriage lasted until his death. Following completion of production on A Fish Called Wanda, Crichton retired from the entertainment industry and spent the rest of his life living comfortably, fishing in both Scotland and Wales.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/447612.stm He died on 14 September 1999 in South Kensington, London, at the age of 89.

He was a utility forward who played in the second or back row of the scrum – lock, flanker, or number eight. White played at club level for Glasgow Caledonians (now known as Glasgow Warriors); the French Top 14 side ASM Clermont Auvergne; and English Premiership side Sale Sharks. He won 77 caps playing for Scotland, captaining the side on 19 occasions. Early life White grew up in The Paddock, Peterculter, Aberdeen and was educated at Cults Academy and then at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, leaving in 1996. He first started playing rugby union when a friend invited him to join a local team in Aberdeen – Aberdeen Wanderers. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Scotland Under-18 and Under-21 Squads. Captain of Scotland He was named the new captain of the Scotland national team by Scotland coach Frank Hadden after an injury to Jon Petrie. White led them for the first time in the test against Argentina at Murrayfield on 12 November 2005. He also led them in the famous win against France on 4 February 2006 at Murrayfield when he earned his 50th Scottish cap. Shortly after he led Scotland to another famous victory, 18–12 over the 'Auld Enemy' at Murrayfield, therefore recovering the Calcutta Cup. He received the Man of the Match award for his outstanding contribution to the victory. In the final fixture, White hit (in a legal tackle) Andrea Lo Cicero so hard that it forced a penalty for holding on. This penalty was kicked by Chris Paterson to secure a 13–10 victory for Scotland. The tackle was similar to the one on Joe Worsley in the Calcutta Cup match which snuffed out the final England attack. Awards On 21 April 2006, White was named The Famous Grouse Scotland Player of the Season 2005–06. In the tenth year of the awards it was the first time that a serving Scotland captain has been declared winner. On 10 May 2006 he received the Guinness Premiership Player's Player of the Year Award after receiving the same accolade in his native Scotland. In the 2005–06 season, White started the final as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. White was named in a \\"World XV of the year\\" chosen in The New Zealand Herald newspaper in 2006. In recognition of both his skills and sportsmanship his founding influence Aberdeen Wanderers RFC renamed their pavilion in his honour in April 2006. In January 2007, White was awarded the Pat Marshall Memorial Award for season 2005–06 by the Rugby Union Writers' Club. Injury and recovery White was out of action from November 2006 until August 2007 after having sustained an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament in the 2006 Autumn test match against Romania; he underwent reconstructive surgery shortly after the injury. He returned to the Scotland squad in their 2007 Rugby World Cup warm-up against Ireland at Murrayfield on 11 August, captaining the side to a 31–21 win. He was again the captain of Scotland at the World Cup finals. White joined Clermont Auvergne in 2009 after signing from Sale Sharks. He was released by them in 2012. Personal life He is married to Beverly. Together they have a daughter called Annabelle. In 2017 White took his first steps into teaching with a role at Loretto School.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1990, representing the rural riding of Springfield. The son of Marcel Roch, he worked as a hotel manager before entering political life. He was a board member of the Tourist Industry Association of Manitoba, and was also a member of the Franco-Manitoban School Trustees Association. Unlike most Franco-Manitoba politicians, Roch was an evangelical Christian rather than a Roman Catholic. Roch's political career followed an unusual course. He initially supported the Liberals, but defected to the Progressive Conservative Party in 1986 when the Liberals denied him permission to run as a candidate for the party. In the provincial election of 1986, Roch was elected in Springfield as a Progressive Conservative, defeating incumbent New Democrat Andy Anstett by 55 votes. He was re-elected by a much greater margin in the 1988 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under Gary Filmon. Roch, against his expectations, was not appointed to Filmon's cabinet following the election. On September 8, 1988, he crossed the floor to rejoin the Liberal Party, which was the official opposition in the legislature at the time. These changing allegiances won Roch few supporters, and he did not seek re-election in the 1990 election.

It has a population of about 27,500. The Klosterneuburg Monastery, which was established in 1114 and soon after given to the Augustinians, is of particular historical importance. Geography Klosterneuburg and Korneuburg (background), view from Leopoldsberg It is located on the Danube, immediately north of the Austrian capital Vienna, from which it is separated by the Kahlenberg and Leopoldsberg hills of the Vienna Woods range. It has been separated from its twin city of Korneuburg on the left bank of the Danube since the river changed its course during the Late Middle Ages. Both towns are connected by a reaction ferry link. The municipal area comprises the northern tip of the Donauinsel as well as the high Mt. Exelberg and its telecommunication tower. At the site of a former pioneer school of the Austrian Bundesheer, Klosterneuburg has various military buildings and former stores which will be developed into a 12 hectare large new quarter of the town by 2030. It is also the centre of a wine growing area, with several esteemed vintners, numerous Heuriger taverns, and the Federal Institute for Viticulture and Pomology, where Fritz Zweigelt bred the Zweigelt and Blauburger red wine grapes. Due to its hilly location, Klosterneuburg has several geographical areas within the cadastral communities of Klosterneuburg-Stadt, , , , , , and . Its town centre has two main shopping areas, the Niedermarkt and the Rathausplatz, separated by a steep hill. The town is tightly linked to the Austrian capital and houses some of the most affluent citizens of Lower Austria. It has direct access to the Vienna city centre via the Klosterneuburger Straße highway (B14), by the Vienna S-Bahn network on the Emperor Franz Joseph Railway line (S40) from Franz-Josefs- Bahnhof to Tulln, and along the EV6 The Rivers cycling route. The town is the site of light industry and, whilst not belonging to Vienna, has almost the feel of a suburb. The of contemporary art and the Institute of Science and Technology Austria established in 2006 are located in the town. History Archaeological findings denote a settlement of the area already during the Neolithic period. In the Roman era (1st to 5th centuries), a fort of the Danubian limes stood at the site of Klosterneuburg on the northwestern border of the Pannonia. After Charlemagne had defeated the Avars, a Carolingian settlement in the newly established Avar March recorded as Omundesdorf may correspond to the site of the town. Klosterneuburg itself was first mentioned as Nivvenburc (Neuburg, \\"New Castle\\") in an 1108 deed. Monastery and town walls In 1113 it became the residence of the Babenberg margrave Leopold III, the later patron saint of Austria. In 1114 Leopold, son-in-law of the Salian emperor Henry IV by his marriage with Agnes of Wailingen, had a princely castle erected together with a collegiate church on a hill rising directly from the banks of the Danube, which he transferred to Augustinian canons in 1133. This order is one of the oldest and richest of its kind in Austria; it owned much of the land upon which today the north-western suburbs of Vienna stand. Later, Duke Leopold VI of Austria (d. 1230) also had his residence there during parts of his reign. It was also here where Leopold VI's eldest son climbed a tree, fell and died. The monastery complex include the old chapel of 1318, with Leopold's tomb and the Verdun Altar, dating from the 12th century, the treasury and relic-chamber, the library with 30,000 volumes and numerous manuscripts, the picture gallery, the collection of coins, the theological hall, and the winecellar, containing an immense tun like that at Heidelberg. The market on the left river bank quickly developed in conjunction with the famous monastery on the right bank. While the Danube was an important waterway trade route, it also repeatedly affected the citizens by floods. In the late 13th century, the two parts of the town, Klosterneuburg (the monastery) and Korneuburg (the market), had grown apart, whereafter the Habsburg king Albert I of Germany granted separate town privileges to Klosterneuburg in 1298. The unfortified \\"Untere Stadt\\" was devastated by Ottoman forces in the 1529 Siege of ViennaAs seen in the Stadtmuseum and the 1683 Battle of Vienna whereas the fortified \\"Obere Stadt\\" was successfully defended in both cases. In the 18th century Emperor Charles VI, who could not prevail in the War of the Spanish Succession, set up plans to rebuild the Klosterneuburg monastery complex modelled on the Escorial. The construction of the Baroque buildings began in 1730; however, it did not survive an initial phase. After the Austrian defeat in the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, the town was occupied by Napoleonic troops until 1809. A winemaker's town during the 19th century, Klosterneuburg developed to a recreational and residential area of Austrian officials working in the nearby capital. During the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany from 1938, Klosterneuburg was incorporated as the 26th district of \\"Greater Vienna\\", which was reversed with the establishment of Wien-Umgebung District in 1954. At the end of 2016 Wien-Umgebung District was dissolved and Klosterneuburg became a part of Tulln.http://www.noen.at/nachrichten/noe/politik-bildung/Bezirk-Wien-Umgebung- wird-aufgeloest;art79519,667302 Politics Town hall Seats in the town's assembly (Gemeinderat) local elections: *Austrian People's Party (ÖVP): 24 *Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 6 *The Greens – The Green Alternative: 5 *Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 2 *Plattform Unser Klsierneuburg (Independent): 2 *Hofbauer (Independent): 1 *Sozial Aktiv Unabhängig (Independent): 1 Twin town Klosterneuburg is twinned with: * Göppingen, Germany, since 1971 Notable people Kierling sanatorium where Kafka died in 1924 * Otto of Freising (c.1114–1158), churchman and chronicler * Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (1736–1809), musician * Nikolaus Lenau (1802–1850), poet, buried in the Weidling cemetery * Walter Breisky (1871–1944), politician and Austrian chancellor, died in Klosterneuburg * Hans Ledwinka (1878–1967), automobile designer * Franz Kafka (1883–1924), author, died at the Hoffmann sanatorium in Kierling * Pius Parsch (1884–1954), priest, died at Klosterneuburg * Ernst Plischke (1903–1992), architect * Karl Rahm (1907–1947), SS officer, commandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp executed for war crimes * O.

It published comics from 1929 to 1974. At its peak, it was the most prominent and successful American company in the medium.Evanier, Mark. \\"What was the relationship between Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics?\\" In 1953 Dell claimed to be the world's largest comics publisher, selling 26 million copies each month.\\"Good Friends for Him... and Mother Too.. in Dell Comics!\\" Saturday Evening Post (January 10, 1953).  History  = Origins = Its first title was The Funnies (1929), described by the Library of Congress as \\"a short-lived newspaper tabloid insert\\" rather than a comic book.U.S. Library of Congress, The Funnies, \\"American Treasures of the Library of Congress\\" exhibition. WebCitation archive. Comics historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, four-color, newsprint periodical as \\"more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on newsstands\\". It ran 36 weekly issues, published Saturdays from January 16, 1929, to October 16, 1930.Funnies, The (Dell, Film Humor, Inc. [#1-2; Dell Publishing Co. [#3-36] imprint, 1929 Series)] at the Grand Comics Database The cover price rose from 10¢ to 30¢ with issue #3. This was reduced to a nickel from issue #22 to the end. In 1933, Dell collaborated with Eastern Color Printing to publish the 36-page Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics, considered by historians the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \\"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\\".Goulart, \\"Famous Funnies\\", p. 144Famous Famous - Carnival of Comics at the Grand Comics Database. It was distributed through the Woolworth's department store chain, though it is unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to the publisher \\"sticking a ten-cent pricetag [sic] on the comic books\\".Goulart, \\"Famous Funnies\\", p. 145 In early 1934, Dell published the single-issue Famous Funnies: Series 1, also printed by Eastern Color. Unlike its predecessor, it was intended from the start to be sold rather than given away.Famous Funnies: Series 1 at the Grand Comics Database. = Western Publishing = The company formed a partnership in 1938 with Western Publishing, in which Dell would finance and distribute publications that Western would produce. While this diverged from the regular practice in the medium of one company handling finance and production and outsourcing distribution, it was a highly successful enterprise with titles selling in the millions. Most of the Dell-produced comics done for Western Publishing during this period were under the Whitman Comics banner (later also used by Gold Key Comics); notable titles included Crackajack Funnies (1938–1942) and Super Comics (1938–1949). Comic book historian Mark Carlson has stated at its peak in the mid-50s \\"while Dell’s total number of comic book titles [was] only 15% of those published, it control[ed] nearly a third of the total market. Dell [had] more million-plus sellers than any other company before or since\\".Carlson, Mark. \\"Funny Business: A History of the Comics Industry\\" Nostalgia Zine v.1 #1 (2005). = Licensed material = Dell Comics was best known for its licensed material, most notably the animated characters from Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Walter Lantz Studio, along with many movie and television properties such as the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Felix the Cat, Howdy Doody, Yogi Bear and other Hanna-Barbera characters. = Four Color = From 1938 to 1962, Dell's most notable and prolific title was the anthology Four Color. Published several times a month, the title (which primarily consisted of standalone issues featuring various licensed properties) saw more than 1,300 issues published in its 23-year history. It often served as a try-out title (much like DC's Showcase) and thus the launching pad for many long-running series. = Lil' Eightball = Responding to pressure from the African-American community, the character Lil' Eightball (who appeared in a handful of Walter Lantz cartoons in the late 1930s and in those initial appearances constituted what animation and comics historian Michael Barrier described as being a \\"grotesquely stereotypical black boy\\") was discontinued as one of the featured characters in the Lantz anthology comic book New Funnies; the last appearance of the character was in the August 1947 issue.Barrier, Michael. \\"Behind the Li'l Eight Ball\\" (September 2009). = Fredric Wertham = In 1948, Dell refused an invitation of membership in the nascent Association of Comics Magazine Publishers. The association had been formed to pre-empt government intervention in the face of mounting public criticism of comic books. Dell vice-president Helen Meyer told Congress that Dell had opted out of the association because they didn't want their less controversial offerings to serve as \\"an umbrella for the crime comic publishers\\".Comic Books and Juvenile Delinquency: Interim Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary When the Comics Code was formed in 1954 in reaction to Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent, Dell again refused to join and instead began publishing in its comics a \\"Pledge to Parents\\" that promised their editorial process \\"eliminates, rather than regulates, objectional [sic] material\\" and concluded with the now classic credo \\"Dell Comics Are Good Comics.\\" Bart Beaty in his book Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture describes a concerted campaign by Dell against publication of Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent to the extent of recruiting several of the companies that it licensed characters from (including Warner Brother Cartoons, the Lone Ranger Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc.) to send letters of protest to Wertham's publisher Stanley Rinehart.Beaty, Bart. Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture. Jackson, MS : University Press of Mississippi, 2005. pp. 147-148 Dell in this period even burnished its image by taking out full- page ads in the Saturday Evening Post in late 1952 and early 1953 that emphasized the wholesomeness of its comics. = Dell Comics Club and subscription promotions = From mid-1950 to Spring 1959 Dell promoted subscriptions to its non-Disney titles with what it called the Dell Comics Club. Membership was automatic with any one year subscription to such titles and came with a certificate of membership plus a group portrait of the most prominent non-Disney characters published by Dell. Dell also offered various subscription premiums during the 1940s and 1950s (in some cases these were prints of covers or other character artwork and in one instance a cel from a Warner Brothers cartoon) in what Mark Evanier has dubbed a coordinated concerted \\"aggressive subscription push\\"Christmas Comics and offered the option of an illustrated note or card be sent to the recipients of a gift subscription for birthdays or Christmas.http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/image- browser.asp?ai=52885&whichpage;=4&pageSize;=1 Multi-year subscriptions were also available (in the case of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, at one point in the 1940s subscriptions for up to five years were offered).http://cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=42&view;=topic&forumid;=25&postid;=42090 = Alternate format = In 1961, Dell issued two atypical, comic-book like paperbacks without coloring, with cardboard covers and heavier-weight paper than standard comics, and selling for one dollar when most comic books were 12 cents: the 116-page The Flintstones on the Rocks and the 117-page Huck & Yogi JamboreeHuck and Yogi Jamboree at the Grand Comics Database. One historian describes the latter as \\"a collection of drawings with text (there’s not a word balloon to be found). But there are drawings that are sequential which tell stories.... [T]his was intended for Huck and Yogi’s adult fans. Of which there apparently were more than a few, given the format and high price — $1!\\" = Western partnership ends, Dell declines = In 1962 the partnership with Western ended, with Western taking most of its licensed properties and its original material and created its own imprint, Gold Key Comics. While most of the talent who had worked on the Dell line continued at Gold Key, a few creators like John Stanley stuck with Dell and its new line. Dell also drew new talent to its fold, such as Frank Springer, Don Arneson, and Lionel Ziprin. Dell Comics continued for another 11 years with licensed television and motion picture adaptations (including Mission: Impossible, Ben Casey, Burke's Law, Doctor Kildare, Beach Blanket Bingo) and a few generally poorly received original titles.

It was O'Donnell's first such collection of stories (he would publish a second, Cobra Trap, decades later). The stories featured in this collection are: #\\"A Better Day to Die\\" #\\"The Giggle-Wrecker\\" #\\"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\\" #\\"A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck\\" #\\"Salamander Four\\" #\\"The Soo Girl Charity\\" Elements from some of these stories would appear in the Modesty Blaise comic strip which O'Donnell wrote concurrent with his book series. \\"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\\" is distinguished as the only Modesty Blaise tale to be told in the first person by Modesty's right-hand man, Willie Garvin. The stories in this collection predate the publication of the book by several years. In the 1960s they were planned for publication in a book that would have been illustrated by O'Donnell's comic strip artist, Jim Holdaway who died in 1970. That edition was never produced. Holdaway's illustrations for the stories exist and have been reprinted in various magazines. The stories were originally published as newspaper inserts in Australia in 1970, in a weekly called Pix, under the series title \\"Pay for Your Holidays Book (1–6)\\". The original order was: #Modesty Blaise and the Men of Salamander Four (3 January 1970) #A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck (10 January 1970) #A Better Day to Die (17 January 1970) #The Giggle Wrecker (24 January 1970) #The Soo Girl Charity (31 January 1970) #I Had a Date with Lady Janet (7 February 1970) All were illustrated and eight pages long. The artists were uncredited, though the front page illustrations are signed by Holdaway for the first five (and the last looks like Holdaway's work). The interior illustrations appear to be by a different artist. Pieces of Modesty is unusual in the Modesty Blaise canon as it was the only book in the series not published in its first edition by Souvenir Press, instead being published exclusively in paperback by Pan Books. In 1986, the American company Mysterious Press issued the book's first and (to date) only hardcover edition. In the 2000s, Souvenir Press began a series of reprints of the Modesty Blaise books, and after acquiring the rights, re-issued Pieces of Modesty in March 2010 with new cover artwork based on the original hardback edition of the first Modesty Blaise novel (as no first-edition hardback was published of Pieces of Modesty).

In legal terms, this is known as a fraudulent transfer. For example, a group of major shareholders or the management of a publicly traded company orders that company to sell off its assets to a second company at unreasonably low prices. The shareholders or management typically own the second company outright, and thus profit from the otherwise disastrous sale. Tunneling differs from outright theft because people who engage in tunneling generally comply with all of the relevant legal procedures; it is thus a subtler scheme than simply writing checks from a company to a private bank account. While people widely agree that tunneling is unethical, penalties for it vary widely; some states impose criminal sanctions, whereas other states provide either for civil suits only, or for no sanctions at all.  Origin  The word 'tunneling' was probably first used in this way in the Czech Republic (tunelování in Czech, tunelář for the person committing fraud) during the first half of the 1990s, when several large, previously privatised banks and factories unexpectedly went bankrupt. It was discovered later that the managements of these companies were deliberately transferring company property and real estate into their own private businesses, sometimes in offshore locations. The term became a common label for this kind of criminal activity among Czechs and Slovaks. The term subsequently appeared in specialized literature in English, and then in a broader literature during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.  Examples  The most common scheme in Central Europe in the post-privatization era was transferring funds and property from high cash flow corporations to companies privately owned by the very same management. Transfers were accomplished via huge loans that were issued without any expectation of repayment, via massive overpayment for outsourced services, or simply by selling a corporation's real estate for a fraction of its market price. The main conditions enabling such a fraud is weak law against conflict of interests, non-existent legal liability of managers for leading their employer towards bankruptcy, and incompetence of financial authorities. A typical example was the huge industrial complex Škoda Works in Plzeň, Czech Republic, which was tunneled by its top manager. The fraud, together with failures in management strategy, resulted in bankruptcy (2001) and then restructuring of the company. The manager was later acquitted by a court, which claimed that \\"such practices were common at the time\\". The typical 7-Step 'Tunneling' Process: Step 1: Identify and incentivise a trusted company 'insider', usually in the finance dept, that will be willing to trample over company compliance and authorisations—and enter secretly into a loan/loans—with a person 'outside' of the company. 'Granting' a partial or a full 'security' over some of, or over the assets, or over the entire business and all of its assets. Step 2: Rapidly run down the cash in the company, usually by buying and holding in inventory equipment and stock—that is unnecessary at that time. Step 3: At short (sometimes only 24–48 hours) notice, announce that the company is 'insolvent'—and have the company immediately forced into a bankruptcy process. Step 4: The 'only'/'main creditor' is of course the local 'outsider'—and so it is THEY that dominates a rapidly assembled 'creditors committee'—which similarly rapidly agrees to sell some or all of the company assets.... to a holding company that THEY already control. Step 5: Knowing that the original owners are eventually likely to seek justice and also the re-establishment of ownership of their assets, the 'tunnelers' next typically pay a local Police Dept officer, to file (knowingly false) 'charges'—against the original owner of the company—usually by claiming that a 'loan' or 'loans' (which the original owners were entirely unaware of!) were 'taken, with no intention of repaying them'. Step 6: The 'tunnelers' typically pay a local Local/Regional Court official, to: (a) accept the knowingly false 'charges' (b) hold 'Court Hearings', without serving any formal Notice on the victim—the original owners (c) gain 'convictions' against the original owners. Step 7: The 'tunneler' next offers a 'Settlement Agreement'—under which: (i) they get to keep all of the misappropriated assets, that they have 'legitimately' purchased from the 'creditor's committee'. (ii) they have a clause included, whereby the original owner agrees to waive all rights—to ever sue the 'tunnelers' in the future. (iii) the 'tunnelers' agree to retract all of the knowing false claims and allegations—that they made against the original owner—thereby quashing all any 'convictions' or ongoing legal proceedings.

The claimant is the one who seeks to establish, or prove, liability. Theories of Liability Claimants can prove liability through a myriad of different theories, known as theories of liability. Which theories of liability are available in a given case depends on nature of the law in question. For example, in case involving a contractual dispute, one available theory of liability is breach of contract; or in the tort context, negligence, negligence per se, respondeat superior, vicarious liability, strict liability, or intentional conduct are all valid theories of liability. Each theory of liability has certain conditions, or elements, that must be proven by the claimant before liability will be established. For example, the theory of negligence requires the claimant to prove that (1) the defendant had a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant's breach caused the injury; and (4) that injury resulted in recoverable damages. Theories of liability can also be created by legislation. For example, under English law, with the passing of the Theft Act 1978, it is an offense to evade a liability dishonestly. Payment of damages usually resolves the liability. A given liability may be covered by insurance. In general, however, insurance providers only cover liabilities arising from negligent torts rather than intentional wrongs or breach of contract. Liability in Business In commercial law, limited liability is a business form that shields its owners from certain types of liability and that amount a given owner will be liable for. A limited liability form separates the owner(s) from the business. This means that when a business is found liable in case, the owners are not themselves liable; rather, the business is. Thus, only the funds or property the owner(s) have invested into the business are subject to that liability. If, for example, a limited liability business goes bankrupt, then the owner(s) will not lose unrelated assets, such as a personal residence (assuming they do not give personal guarantees). This is the standard model for larger businesses, in which a shareholders will only lose the amount invested (in the form of stock value decreasing). (For an explanation, see business entity.) There is an exception to this rule, however, which allows a claimant to litigate against the owner(s) of a limited liability business, if the owner(s) have engaged in conduct that justifies the claimant's recovery from the owner(s): This is known as \\"piercing the veil\\". =Additional Concepts= Manufacturer's liability, a legal concept in most countries, reflects the fact that producers have a responsibility not to sell a defective product (see product liability). Economists use the term \\"legal liability\\" to describe the legal-bound obligation to pay debts.

Design  The eZ80 (like the Z380) is binary compatible with the Z80 and Z180, but almost three times as fast as the original Z80 chip at the same clock frequency. The eZ80 has a three-stage pipeline. Available at up to 50 MHz (2004), the performance is comparable to a Z80 clocked at 150 MHz if fast memory is used (i.e. no wait states for opcode fetches, for data, or for I/O) or even higher in some applications (a 16-bit addition is 11 times as fast as in the original). The eZ80 also supports direct continuous addressing of 16 MB of memory without a memory management unit, by extending most registers (HL, BC, DE, IX, IY, SP, and PC) from 16 to 24 bits. In order to do so, the CPU works in a Z80-compatible mode or a full 24-bit address mode. The processor has a 24-bit arithmetic logic unit and overlapped processing of several instructions (a so- called pipeline) which are the two primary reasons for its speed. Unlike the older Z280 and Z380 it does not have (or need) a cache memory. Instead, it is intended to work with fast SRAM directly as main memory (as this had become much cheaper). Nor does it have the multiplexed bus of the Z280, making it as easy to work with (interface to) as the original Z80 and Z180, and equally predictable when it comes to exact execution times. The chip has a memory interface that is similar to the original Z80, including the bus request/acknowledge pins, and adds four integrated chip selects. Versions are available with on-chip flash memory and on-chip zero wait-state SRAM (up to 256 KB flash memory and 16 KB SRAM) but there are also external buses on all models.  Variants  eZ80Acclaim! is a family of eZ80 single chip computers labeled as \\"application-specific standard products\\" (ASSP) that feature up to 128 KB of flash memory, up to 8 KB of SRAM, and can operate at speeds of up to 20 MHz. Like other eZ80 variants, it has an external address and data bus and can thus be used as a general purpose microprocessor as well. eZ80AcclaimPlus! is a family of connectivity ASSPs that feature up to 256 KB of flash memory, 16 KB of SRAM, can operate at speeds of up to 50 MHz. It adds an integrated 10/100BaseT Ethernet MAC, TCP/IP stack over the eZ80Acclaim! line. Like other eZ80 variants, it has an external address and data bus and can thus be used as a general purpose microprocessor as well.  Use in commercial products  The latest (mid-2015) graphing calculator in the TI-84 line by Texas Instruments, the TI-84 Plus CE, uses the eZ80 in the 24-bit address mode at a clock rate of 48 MHz. In Europe, the TI-84 Plus CE-T and TI-83 Premium CE are also powered by the eZ80. The EZ80L92 is the primary processor in the ST Robotics robot controller, clocked at 50MHz. It has 128Kb of external RAM and 128Kb of external flash memory.

Profile  The school focuses early on a more advanced education in mathematics and sciences. An entrance examination is required for admission to the school. With more classes than normal in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry and informatics, the students from grade 7 on learn more than students in a regular high school. The school also has a contract with the Dresden University of Technology under which students in grades 7 and 8 spend a week there doing a project. In addition, 11th-grade students in the intensive program are required to carry out a scientific study. Students also take three subjects, rather than the normal two, at a higher level. Students regularly take part in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, and the International Chemistry Olympiad. As a result of the school's special profile, many students such as Lisa Sauermann have receive international acclaim for their excellence in natural sciences research.

The track begins near a small settlement on the upper reaches of the Lakekamu River on the south side of the ranges. After penetrating dense equatorial rain forests it winds up around jungle clad ridges for some sixty kilometres to over 9,800 feet (3,000 metres) on the Central Ranges before dropping down to the township of Wau in the Bulolo Valley. The track is some one hundred kilometres due west of the famous Kokoda Track and crosses some of the most rugged and isolated terrain in the world, combining hot humid days with intensely cold nights, torrential rainfall and endemic tropical diseases such as malaria. Bulldog Track was longer, higher, steeper, wetter, colder and rougher than Kokoda Track. For the moment it is one of the few great treks in the Tropical montane regions of the world. Constructed sixty years ago, it was the only vehicular road ever to cross the Central Ranges of New Guinea. In order to reach the Bulldog Track it is a short drive south east from Wau to the village of Winima. A six-hour walk will take you along a divergent track that was used as an alternate line of communication, during construction of the Track, commonly referred to as the Kudjeru Track. The villagers at Winima will be able to provide guides and directions for the Kudjeru Track. The Hidden Valley Gold Mine has cut off the highest sections of the track, which are now only accessible from the Papuan side. History In 1943 Australian Army engineers; the 2/1 and 2/16 Field Company RAE, 9th Australian Field Company (AIF), veterans of Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Greece and Crete, the 1st and 3rd Australian Pack Transport Companies and local Papuan labour cut the road with pickaxes and dynamite over a period of eight months. The Chief Engineer, W. J. Reinhold, was later to write \\"Every foot of progress made on this road exacted the ultimate in courage, endurance, skill and toil. Its construction took a toll from surveyor, engineer, labourer and native carrier alike.\\" During five months of operations over seventy per cent of the 2/1 Australian Field Company contracted malaria. The purpose of the road was to provide a supply line for future military operations in the Markham Valley and on the northern coasts of Papua New Guinea. On the late afternoon of August 22, 1943, the road was finally completed and two jeeps crossed from Edie Creek to Bulldog. On September 23, the first three-ton trucks crossed the road successfully and the long supply line was finally open with 114 kilometres of road were now completed. Commencing at Bulldog at an altitude of 59 metres it rose by a series of long loops up through the steep river gorges of the southern watershed to an altitude of three thousand metres, then dropped down a series of ridges into the Wau valley. Seventeen bridges were constructed; mostly single, but at least one with multiple spans. More than two thousand Australian army personnel and over two thousand Papuans and New Guineans were involved during nine months of construction. Thus the road, acclaimed as the greatest military engineering feat ever, was completed and for the only time in history motor vehicles crossed the high rugged mountains of Papua New Guinea.

Good's Manson Family nickname is \\"Blue\\", which was given to her by Charles Manson to represent clean air and water.Bravin, Jess (1997). Squeaky: The Life and Times Of Lynette Alice Fromme. St. Martin's Press. . Early life She was born in San Diego, California, the daughter of an aeronautical engineer. Her parents divorced when she was four years old. Good attended Point Loma High School and was a member of the Student Opinion Club. Good attended California State University Sacramento, the University of Oregon and San Francisco State College off and on for seven years, but never received a degree. Manson Family Good joined the Manson Family in April 1968 and a few months later went off with them when they moved to a new home at Spahn Ranch in the mountains west of Chatsworth. She was in jail with Mary Brunner for attempting to use stolen credit cards when the Tate/La Bianca murders took place, but was back at the ranch in time to get arrested during the August 16th raid. (Good wrote extensively about meeting Charles Manson, her life in “the Family,” and the Tate/LaBianca murders in Lynette Fromme’s 2018 memoir Reflexion.Fromme, Lynette (2018). Reflexion. The Peasenhall Press. ) She has a son named Ivan S. Pugh (born September 16, 1969). Various men have been named as the father, most notably Joel Pugh (June 7, 1940 – December 1, 1969), who was found dead in a London hotel room under suspicious circumstances.Bugliosi, Vincent. Helter Skelter, 1974, pg 241. In a telephone interview with WWL (AM) in New Orleans soon after Lynette Fromme's attempted assassination of Gerald Ford, Good threatened that \\"a wave of assassins\\" from a group that she identified as the International Peoples Court of Retribution (see ATWA) would kill or disfigure certain business executives, whom she named, as well as members of their families. Good accused the executives of polluting the environment. On September 10, 1975, in a subsequent interview with Barbara Frum of the CBC radio program As It Happens, Good made similar threats against persons to avenge the killing of trees. She also did a telephone interview with Hamilton Ontario broadcaster Bob Bratina on CHML Radio. As a result, Bratina was subpoenaed to appear at the trial of Sandra Good in Sacramento, where the air- check of the interview was introduced as prosecution evidence. Prison On December 22, 1975, Good and another Manson devotee, Susan Murphy, were indicted for \\"conspiracy to send threatening letters through the mail\\" by a Federal Grand Jury in Sacramento in connection with death threats against more than 170 corporate executives who Good believed (see ATWA) were polluting the earth.Los Angeles Times, Dec. 23, 1975, \\"Sandra Good Indicted in Death Threat Conspiracy – 2 Manson Devotees Indicted\\", p.

Parole Good was paroled in early December 1985, and released from the Federal Correctional Center for Women in Alderson, West Virginia, after having served nearly 10 years of her 15 year sentence; unlike many Manson Family members, at that time Good still professed total allegiance to Manson.Los Angeles Times, Dec. 3, 1985, \\"Manson Follower Sandra Good Paroled\\", p. SD 2. A condition of her parole was that she could not reside in California. She lived instead in Vermont, where she lived quietly under the name Sandra Collins (or at times, \\"Blue Collins\\") until 1989, when her environmental activism made the news and her identity was made public. Following her parole, Good moved to Hanford, California, near Corcoran State Prison, to be closer to Manson, although as a convicted felon she was not permitted to visit him. On January 26, 1996, she and George Stimson began a now-defunct, pro-Manson website named Access Manson, about which prosecutor Stephen Kay said, \\"[it] gives her [Good] an outlet where she can do things for [Manson].\\" Good also used the website to support Manson's environmental movement, ATWA (Air Trees Water Animals). In a 2019 interview, Good said, \\"They [Manson and his \\"family\\"] really saved my health, my brain, my emotional health, my mental health, my physical health. I’m thankful to them all,” and credited Manson with teaching her about the “deep connection to the natural world.\\" References External links * Official website (ATWA) * *CBC Archives: A 1975 interview with Sandra Good 1944 births Living people American criminals Manson Family Eco-terrorism Radical environmentalism People from San Diego Point Loma High School alumni University of Oregon alumni San Francisco State University alumni Prisoners and detainees of California ","title":"Sandra Good"},{"id":"1210281","text":"Ormes may refer to: *communes in France: **Ormes, Aube **Ormes, Eure **Ormes, Loiret **Ormes, Marne **Ormes, Saône-et-Loire **Ormes-et-Ville, Meurthe-et- Moselle **Les Ormes, Vienne **Les Ormes, Yonne * collectively, the Great Orme and Little Orme, two limestone headlands in Llandudno, Wales, UK See also * Orme (disambiguation) * Orm (disambiguation) * Orme (name) * Orme's Law ","title":"Ormes"},{"id":"1210285","text":"I'm Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen is a tribute album to Leonard Cohen, released in 1991, produced by the French music magazine Les Inrockuptibles.I'm Your Fan at The leonard Cohen Files The album features Cohen's songs interpreted by some of the most respected rock acts of the time.Rock and Roll hall of Fame - Inductee - Leonard Cohen Its name is a play on the title of Cohen's album I'm Your Man.

He has also coached for the University of Michigan and Seton Hall University. He played point guard and later served as an assistant coach at Duke University under Mike Krzyzewski. An All-American player, Amaker set numerous records and earned many honors and awards. He took Seton Hall to the post season in each of his four seasons as their coach, helped Michigan win the National Invitation Tournament the year after a probationary ban from postseason play, and had the three highest single-season win totals in the history of Harvard basketball, the school's first six Ivy League championships and first NCAA tournament victory. Amaker was a high school basketball McDonald's All-American and a Parade All-American. As a college basketball player, he set most of the assists records and many steals records for Duke basketball. He also set the Atlantic Coast Conference single-season games played and games started records. Among his numerous accolades, he was the first winner of the NABC Defensive Player of the Year, and he was a third team All-American. Amaker was an assistant coach for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball under Krzyzewski for nine seasons. His first four seasons were part of a five-year streak of Final Four appearances by Duke (including back-to- back national championships). As a head coach, Amaker took the Seton Hall Pirates to postseason tournaments (NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament – 2000 and National Invitation Tournament – 1998, 1999, and 2001) in each of his four seasons as their coach. He dealt with the turmoil and self-imposed sanctions of the University of Michigan basketball scandal in his first years with Michigan, where he eventually won the 2004 National Invitation Tournament with the 2003–04 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team and finished as the runner-up with Michigan in the 2006 National Invitation Tournament. In his tenure as Harvard men's basketball coach, he was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent with the . He also coached the 2009–10 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team into the postseason (2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament) in his third year there, which included the highest single-season victory total (21) in school history. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university's first NCAA penalty of the men's basketball program. The 2010–11 team became the first Harvard men's basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23). The 2011–12 team became the first in school history to appear in the Associated Press (AP) and Coaches Polls and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26) https://www.thecrimson.com/blog/the-back- page/article/2012/3/29/harvard-coach-tommy-amaker-awards-basketball/ . Amaker's 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14 and 2014–15 teams repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012–13 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013–14 team posted a record 27 wins. Amaker became the winningest coach in school history in 2016. Early years Amaker was born in Falls Church, Virginia, in 1965. Amaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Virginia, because his mother, Alma Amaker, was a high school English teacher in Fairfax County. Her job allowed her to choose among the county schools, her choice made because the school's basketball coach, Red Jenkins, who called Amaker \\"T-bird,\\" had been impressed with his performances at his youth summer league since Amaker was 10 years old. He began playing varsity for Woodson by December, making him the first freshman to play varsity in the school's history. His mother, whom Jenkins called \\"his first coach and his best coach,\\" attended his practices and graded papers in the coach's office. Duke University basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski, who had just completed his first season as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate Johnny Dawkins in a 1981 Washington D.C. summer league game, but was convinced to stay for a second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, \\"Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to look great in Duke blue.\\" At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the Maryland Terrapins because his sister Tami went to the University of Maryland, College Park and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard John Lucas. He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006. Amaker played on the 1983 McDonald's All-American Team and was also named to the Parade All-American team. According to the Fairfax Connection, the county changed the rules regarding where teachers could send their children due to Amaker's success at Woodson. College career Amaker was a star point guard at Duke after becoming a freshman starter for head coach Krzyzewski. He led the team in assists three years and in steals four seasons. While at Duke his roommate for away games was Mike Brey. =Freshman and sophomore years= Dawkins played point guard for the 1982–83 Blue Devils, but moved to shooting guard the following year to make way for Amaker. When Amaker joined the 1983–84 Blue Devils, unranked Duke, led by Dawkins and Amaker, won its first seven games, the longest winning streak of fourth-year head coach Krzyzewski's career. Amaker had a field goal accuracy of over 65 percent in those games. He led Duke to the NCAA Tournament during his 1984 freshman and 1985 sophomore seasons, but neither team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen (regional semifinals). In the quarterfinal round of the 1984 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament against the Mark Price-led Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Amaker hit the game-winning shot with the score tied and less than 10 seconds left in overtime. In some instances, Amaker's defense changed the game by limiting dribble penetration and forcing low shooting percentages regardless of whether he had notable offensive contributions. =Junior year= During Amaker's junior year (1985–86), Duke won the inaugural NIT Season Tip-Off (then known as the preseason National Invitation Tournament) and Amaker had nine assists in the championship game against a Danny Manning-led Kansas team. In the March Carolina–Duke rivalry game against North Carolina Amaker stole the ball from Jeff Lebo and made a layup that gave Duke a late first half three-point lead it never surrendered. The win clinched Duke's first regular season ACC Championship since 1966. According to ESPN college basketball color commentator Dick Vitale, Amaker had a reputation for putting pressure on the ball. That year, he helped the team win the 1986 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, including a championship game victory over the Price-led Georgia Tech. Duke entered the 1986 NCAA Tournament ranked number one with a team that was built around the defensive efforts of its guards, Dawkins and Amaker. In the final four with Duke clinging to a 69–67 lead in a rematch against Kansas, Amaker pulled down the final rebound and sank two clinching free throws in the final five seconds. The win sent Duke to the championship game, giving the team its 21st consecutive victory and an NCAA record 37 single-season victories. Chicago Tribune journalist Robert Markus described Amaker and Dawkins as the best guard combination in the country, although Vitale described Amaker as unknown. Amaker with Duke in the 1986 NCAA tournament The 1985–86 Blue Devils finished as national runner-up in the 1986 NCAA Tournament to Louisville. That year, Amaker recorded 81 steals, second to Jim Spanarkel at that point in Duke history. He set the career steals record, which stood until Shane Battier broke it in 2001. Amaker also holds the Duke single-year NCAA Tournament record with 18 steals in 1986, which had been a tournament record. That year, he had seven steals in two tournament games—against Old Dominion in the second round on March 15 and Louisville in the final on March 31. This seven-steal total stood as the single-game NCAA tournament record for seven years until the 1993 NCAA Tournament when Darrell Hawkins had eight for Arkansas against and Grant Hill had eight for Duke against California. The seven steals was a championship game record that was tied by Mookie Blaylock in the 1988 NCAA Tournament for Oklahoma against Kansas and was surpassed by Ty Lawson in the 2009 NCAA Tournament for North Carolina against Michigan State. Amaker was selected to the 1986 Division I Basketball Tournament All- NCAA Final Four Team. The 1986 Duke team graduated four of its five starters (Dawkins, Mark Alarie, Jay Bilas and David Henderson), leaving Amaker with an inexperienced supporting cast for his senior season. That year, Amaker was a spokesman against drug and alcohol abuse as part of an NCAA-Fiesta Bowl drug education television program. =Senior year= Muggsy Bogues, Amaker's ACC rival, was his roommate during the July 1986 FIBA World Championship. He played in at least two games in the tournament, the first for a mere two minutes against Puerto Rico, but he played a prominent role in the USA's win over Italy. Amaker won a gold medal while serving on the US national team in the FIBA World Championship, which served as the basketball tournament for the 1986 Goodwill Games. Senior Amaker served as team captain for the 1986–87 Blue Devils, and he led Duke back to the 1987 NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual champion Indiana. The key players on the team that year were Amaker and sophomore Danny Ferry. During his senior season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted the three-point field goal. Amaker led Duke in three point shooting that year. He hit a three-point shot with 1:39 remaining in overtime against 17–0 (4–0 ACC) Horace Grant-led Clemson to give Duke the lead for good. A few weeks later, with the score tied in regulation at 60 against and on a two-on-one fast break with 16 seconds left, Amaker took a jump shot. Krzyzewski said Duke lost the game because it did not play as smart as its opponent and Markus described this example in his column. In Amaker's final home game, he made a jump shot with 1:15 remaining that put number seventeen Duke, which made all six of its free throws in the final 45 seconds, ahead for good in its rematch against number thirteen Clemson. In the 1987 tournament he led Duke in scoring in its final two games, including 23 against the Rick Calloway/Keith Smart/Steve Alford-led Indiana, who was coached by Bobby Knight, Krzyzewski's college coach. That year, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) awarded Amaker with the first Henry Iba Corinthian Award (also known as the NABC Defensive Player of the Year). Amaker was selected to the 1987 NCAA Men's Basketball All-American third team by the NABC. He was named to the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament All-Midwest Regional Team. He was a 1987 All-ACC 2nd-team honoree and earned the team co-MVP award with Ferry that year. Amaker earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1987 from Duke. =Accomplishments= Amaker set many Duke career and single-season assists records. He held the record for single-season assists in the years between 1986 and 1990, which was broken by Bobby Hurley. Hurley also broke Amaker's records in career assists per game (5.1, 1987–93) and career assists (708, 1987–92). Steve Wojciechowski broke Amaker's records in single-season assists to turnover ratio (2.88, 1985–97) and career assists to turnover ratio (2.11, 1987–98). Although his single-season assists records were surpassed by Hurley's freshman, sophomore and senior season totals, it still remains a record for a Duke junior. He also held Duke's career NCAA tournament assist average record with 57 in 12 games for a 4.7 average until Hurley surpassed it with 145 in 20 games for a 7.3 average. His school single-game assists record of 14 that he tied (Kevin Billerman, March 2, 1974, vs. North Carolina) vs. on February 19, 1986, was not broken until Hurley's senior 1993 season and is still a record for a junior. Amaker holds several Duke and ACC records for games played. Amaker, Alarie and Dawkins have all started 40 games for the 1985–86 Duke team and both Ferry and Billy King have played 40 games in a season. Amaker's 138 consecutive games started surpassed Alarie and Dawkins' totals of 133. His 138 consecutive games played was a Duke record until Chris Duhon played 144 in a row ending in 2004. Consecutive games started is not shown in the 2009–10 Atlantic Coast Conference Media Guide records section. However, no ACC player has ever played more than 40 games in a season. Pro career Following his college basketball career, Amaker was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 3rd round of the 1987 NBA Draft with the 55th pick overall. He was also drafted in the first round of the April 1987 United States Basketball League's draft by the Staten Island Stallions. He was regarded to be too small to play in the NBA at and . He was cut from the SuperSonics team on October 21, 1987. Subsequently, he spent three days with the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association in Casper, Wyoming. He quickly decided he wanted to return to Duke to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA). Coaching career =Duke= After playing four years for Duke basketball, Amaker returned to serve on his former coach, Mike Krzyzewski's (pictured), Duke staff. Amaker accepted a graduate assistant position on Krzyzewski's staff at Duke in 1988 while pursuing his MBA degree from the Fuqua School of Business; the team reached the Final Four of the 1989 NCAA Tournament. He was an assistant coach from 1989 through 1997, during which Duke won two NCAA Championships (1991 and 1992) and made two other Final Four appearances (1990 and 1994). By 1992, Duke had been to five consecutive final fours. While an assistant coach, he declined numerous Division I head coaching opportunities. Duke also won four regular season Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball championships (1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997) and the 1992 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament. The 1994–95 season was turbulent. In October 1994, Krzyzewski underwent back surgery. He attempted to return to coaching two weeks later but eventually was re-admitted to Duke University Hospital for four days in January due to related complications. He eventually relinquished control of the team for the season to interim coach Pete Gaudet. After Wimp Sanderson was forced out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under consideration to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying \\"It boiled down to us looking at a situation where we were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now.\\" That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O'Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience. =Seton Hall= In 1997, Amaker took the head coaching position at Seton Hall, who had missed the post season in the two prior years. At 31, Amaker became the youngest head basketball coach in Big East Conference history. Then, he took Seton Hall to the NCAA tournament once (2000) – when his team reached the \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" – and to the National Invitation Tournament three times (1998, 1999 and 2001). The earned the sixth seed in the 1998 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament, but were ousted in the first round by eleventh-seeded in overtime in the first round. They ended up in the 1998 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to to fall to a final record of 15–15. After returning Seton Hall to the post season, Amaker was considered for the Michigan job, but they decided to make interim coach Brian Ellerbe a full-time head coach. Seton Hall's earned the ninth seed in the 1999 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament. They defeated eighth-seeded in the first round, but lost by one point to top-seeded Connecticut, who went on to win the national championship. They were invited to the 1999 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to and again finished 15–15. According to ESPN, Amaker recruited the #2 recruiting class in the nation for the class of 2000 while at Seton Hall. The class consisted of Eddie Griffin (ranked by some as the top high school player in the nation), Andre Barrett, and Marcus Toney-El. The Pirates were ranked high on many experts' pre-season rankings. The 1999–2000 Seton Hall team earned the fifth seed in the 2000 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament and earned a victory against twelfth-seeded in the first round, but lost to fourth-seeded Connecticut. The first round win gave the team 20 victories and no Big East team had achieved that number of victories without getting invited to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in the 21-year history of the conference. They were invited to the 2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament where they were seeded tenth in the East Region. They knocked off seventh-seeded Oregon and second-seeded Temple. In the Sweet Sixteen round they were ousted by third-seeded and finished with a 22–10 record. The earned the Big East West Division's sixth seed in the 2001 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament and beat the East Division three seed St. John's and west two seed Georgetown. They were defeated in the semifinals by east top seed and ended the year at 16–15. They were invited to the 2001 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to Alabama. The following season, Amaker resigned as the Seton Hall head coach and became head coach at Michigan, replacing Ellerbe, who had been fired. Amaker met with Michigan athletic director Bill Martin in a hotel lobby instead of renting a room because Martin wanted to save money. Word of the meeting got back to ESPN and the New Jersey press was not kind to Amaker, hinting that he was devious and selfish. =Michigan= Amaker inherited a Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that was five years into the investigation of the University of Michigan basketball scandal. The Wolverines opposed Amaker's former mentor Krzyzewski and the 2001–02 Duke Blue Devils in his seventh game as head coach, but his team lost. Although the 2001–02 Wolverines finished at 11–18, Amaker was able to lead the tenth-seeded team to a victory over seventh-seeded in the 2002 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament before losing to two seed, . Michigan finished the 2002–03 season with a 17–13 record, but sat out both that year's NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self-imposed postseason ban. The team had banned itself from post season play before the season started. Nonetheless, over the course of the season the team had earned a three seed and a first round bye in the 2003 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, but was upset in the second round by Indiana. At the conclusion of the season, the NCAA added a second year of post season ineligibility to bring the severity of the punishment to a level it deemed more appropriate. Amaker's 2003–04 team earned a fifth seed and first round bye in the 2004 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament where it defeated fourth-seeded Iowa before losing to top-seeded Illinois. The team experienced successive wins in the 2004 National Invitation Tournament against , , and . The team won the championship game against , giving Amaker his highest single-season victory total up to that point in time with a 23–11 record. Amaker, who has tended to avoid the spotlight, was not on the court as his team celebrated the college basketball tradition of cutting of the nets in celebration of a championship at the 2004 NIT. The 2004–05 team only achieved a nine seed in the 2005 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament when it lost in the first round to eighth-seeded . It posted a 13–18 record (4–12 in conference) and finished ninth in the conference. The Wolverines' 2005–06 team was a high percentage shooting, disciplined and balanced team. It was seeded seventh in the 2006 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament but lost to the tenth seeded Minnesota Golden Gophers. The team had been ranked 37th in the Ratings Percentage Index prior to the game, making them a solid contender for an 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament invitation. The loss sent them to the 2006 National Invitation Tournament where they were a number one seed, and they finished as the runner-up to . Along the way to its runner- up finish, the team defeated ninth-seeded , fifth-seeded (2OT), third-seeded and fifth-seeded . The team ended with a 22–11 (8–8) record. Michigan's 2006–07 team earned an eight seed in the 2007 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, when it defeated the ninth-seeded Minnesota Golden Gophers before succumbing to top-seeded Ohio State. After receiving a three seed, Michigan advanced to the second round of the 2007 National Invitation Tournament by beating before falling to . The team finished with a 22–13 record yet only 8–8 in conference play. Amaker was credited for helping to restore the ethical reputation of a Michigan program which had been tarnished by scandal. However, he was criticized in the press for being unable to take the Wolverines to the NCAA tournament in six seasons at the helm. Some fans and sportswriters argued that Amaker's Michigan teams tended to underachieve and fall apart in pressure situations, particularly in conference, on the road and at the end of the regular season. On March 17, 2007, Amaker was fired by the University of Michigan. Amaker was paid $900,000 to buy out the remaining years on his contract. =Harvard= On April 11, 2007, Amaker was named head men's basketball coach at Harvard University. Harvard's recruiting process had included interviewing the underclassmen on the team who preferred Amaker to alternatives that included Mike Jarvis and Mike Gillian. Upon his arrival, Harvard had endured five consecutive non-winning seasons, a streak that Amaker would not halt until his third year. Amaker became the only African American among the head coaches of Harvard's 32 athletic teams. Amaker's Harvard team beat his former team, Michigan, in his eighth game as coach at Harvard during the 2007–08 season. It was the school's first win ever against a BCS conference school. The New York Times published an accusatory article in March 2008, raising allegations of diminished academic standards among Amaker's first class of recruits and potentially improper recruiting practices. Prodded by this negative publicity, the Ivy League office conducted a four-month investigation and \\"determined that no violations of NCAA or Ivy League rules occurred\\", clearing Amaker and his staff completely. Typically, the NCAA would accept the results of a formal investigation performed by a conference office but, in this case, the NCAA initially tabled and then eventually rejected the Ivy League's findings completely. The NCAA commenced its own investigation which ultimately took two years to complete. Amaker's Harvard squad defeated then-ranked Boston College (#17 AP Poll – #24 Coaches' Poll) on January 7, 2009 for the first win over a ranked team in the program's history. His 2008–09 recruiting class was the first time an Ivy League institution was ranked in the top 25 by ESPN. Jeremy Lin led Amaker's 2009–10 Harvard team. The following season, the 2009–10 Harvard team played competitively against #14 ranked Connecticut getting 30 points and 9 rebounds from senior Jeremy Lin on December 6. Although they held the lead only once, they were within 4 points in the final seconds of the game. They also won their December 9 rematch with by a 74–67 margin. After coaching Harvard to its highest single- season win total ever behind the play of Lin, Harvard was invited to participate in the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The team was defeated in the first round by . During the season, Amaker was a nominee for the first Ben Jobe Award as the top minority Division I college basketball coach, and was recognized by Fox Sports as the 2010 Ivy League Coach of the Year. Amaker was mentioned for the 2010 head coach opening at St. John's. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA informed Harvard that Amaker's behavior constituted impermissible recruiting behavior. Harvard and the NCAA negotiated a settlement in which the university would \\"declare\\" what the NCAA consented to classify as secondary violations. Under the terms of the agreement, Harvard accepted punitive recruiting restrictions for the 2010–11 season. These were the first NCAA penalties ever assessed against the Harvard men's basketball program and the first instance of the Ivy League being overruled on a formal rules interpretation. Under Amaker's leadership, the 2010–11 team tied with Princeton for the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season championship, which was the school's first men's basketball Ivy League championship since the league was formed in the 1956–57 season. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season's school record of 11 home wins. Harvard's 12 conference game wins established a school record. The team's victory over Colorado was the Crimson's first against a Big 12 Conference opponent since that conference commenced play in 1996. His fourth season also marked the fourth straight season that Harvard defeated at least one power conference opponent. Although Harvard never appeared in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, for a few weeks during the season they received a vote in the AP Poll. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Harvard faced Ivy League co-champion Princeton in a one-game playoff and lost by a 63–62 margin. Princeton earned the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament automatic bid, while Harvard earned an at-large bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, marking the school's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 established a school record for number of wins, surpassing the prior season's total of 21. Amaker was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award, was a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award and was selected by the NABC as the District 13 Coach of the Year. He was named Ivy League coach of the year by Collegeinsider.com. The 2011–12 Harvard team defeated then- ranked Florida State (#22 AP Poll – #20 Coaches' Poll) on November 25, 2011 for the school's second win over a ranked team in the program's history, and the highest ranked opponent in the Coaches' Poll that Harvard had defeated up to that point. On December 5, 2011, Harvard made its first appearance in either the AP Poll (25) or Coaches' Poll (24). It left Brown as the only remaining Ivy League school to have never been ranked in the AP Poll and leaves only seven schools that have played Division I basketball since the AP Poll began that have never been ranked in it. Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches' Poll since the 2009–10 Cornell Big Red and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the 1997–98 Princeton Tigers, who finished 8th in the poll. By January 2, the team achieved rankings of 22 in the AP Poll and 21 in the Coaches' Poll. The team was also ranked 21st in the Coaches' Poll on February 6. The team established a new record for single-season wins as well as single-season non-league wins and tied the record for conference game wins. Amaker was selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association as the 2011–12 Men's District I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT) Coach of the Year. He won the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for both the Ben Jobe Award and the Hugh Durham Award. On March 6, 2012, Harvard earned its first bid to the NCAA Tournament since 1946. On October 6, 2012, Amaker was inducted into his high school's inaugural hall of fame class. Amaker's 2012–13 Harvard team entered the season affected by the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal. Instead of being the favorite as originally expected, the team was predicted to finish second to Princeton by various media sources because Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew due to the scandal. Casey and Curry had been first-team and second-team All-Ivy selections for the 2011–12 Ivy League men's basketball season, respectively. Both players withdrew in hopes of preserving their final year of athletic eligibility following the investigation. During the season, the team defeated Boston College its fifth consecutive victory against Boston College Eagles men's basketball, making Amaker a perfect 6-0 against the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 2012–13 Harvard team overcame the withdrawal of its senior co- captains to repeat as 2013 Ivy League champions, which earned Harvard a trip to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. On March 21, 14th- seeded Harvard earned the school's first NCAA Tournament victory by a 68–62 margin and its first victory over a top 10 opponent when it defeated 3rd- seeded New Mexico (#10 AP Poll – #10 Coaches' Poll). Two nights later, Harvard lost to Arizona 74–51. Following the season, Amaker was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2013. Amaker won the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) Clarence \\"Big House\\" Gaines College Basketball Coach of the Year in Division I as the top minority coach, the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award. In August, Amaker was inducted into his fourth Hall of Fame (Washington Metro Basketball Hall of Fame). The 2013–14 team won the 2013 Great Alaska Shootout and 2013–14 Ivy League conference regular season championship with a 13–1 record and posting a school record 27 wins against 5 defeats. The team entered the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a number twelve seed where it defeated a (#15 AP Poll – #14 Coaches' Poll) Cincinnati team that was seeded fifth. Harvard eventually lost to number (#11/13) four seed Michigan State. The team was the first Ivy League school to win games in consecutive NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournaments since the 1983–84 Princeton Tigers. The 2014–15 team was the first Ivy League team to make a fifth consecutive postseason appearance since the 2001–02 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team completed a seven-year run for Princeton. They were the third Ivy team to make four consecutive NCAA Basketball Tournament appearances, a feat last accomplished by the 1991–92 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team. On December 7, 2016, in a rivalry contest against Boston College, Amaker earned his 179th win with the 2016–17 team, surpassing Frank Sullivan as Harvard's all-time winningest coach. Amaker led the 2017–18 Harvard Crimson to a share of the 2017–18 Ivy League men's basketball season regular season title. The team reached the championship game of the 2018 Ivy League Men's Basketball Tournament, but lost to Penn earning an automatic bid to the 2018 National Invitation Tournament.

It was replaced by the modernised M-2141-02 Svyatogor and its sedan body version, the M-2142, in 1997–2003. The Aleko was a huge improvement over previous Moskvitch models, which were durable but old-fashioned saloons and station wagons (estates) with rear-wheel drive and a solid rear axle, and had no common parts with them apart from the engine and some other minor details. The new car had such innovative features as front-wheel drive, a hatchback body style, MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion-crank rear suspension. It had rack-and-pinion steering and a collapsible steering column. The spare tyre was located underneath the boot and was accessible from outside, in the tradition of French cars. The wheelbase went up almost , the body got wider, the wheel size went up one inch (14 inches). The car became more spacious, comfortable and safe. For the first time in the history of Soviet and Russian car making, the car's profile was optimized for aerodynamics, with the help of Russian and, partially, French engineers, who shortly cooperated with them at the final stage of the development process. The officially reported drag coefficient was 0.35. Before the development of the M-2141 started, Moskvitch engineers had been working on a new series of rear-wheel drive cars and had developed it to the stage of pre-production prototypes. However, surprisingly for them, the Minister of Automobile Industry required them to cease all work on the unfinished project and instead create a front-wheel drive car with its upper part identical to that of the French Simca 1307, which was favoured by him. While this decision helped to cut the development costs, it came as an insult to the engineers and designers, who had their own mock-ups of the future car ready. Designer Igor Zaytsev recalled that it took more than a month to motivate his disappointed colleagues to get involved in the new project. However, besides the fact that the AZLK designers considered it \\"insulting and humiliating\\" to copy an existing car, it came out that the new powertrain and chassis required a different bodyshell, and despite the two cars having similar shapes, the only parts of the French car that were borrowed to the Moskvitch-2141 were some constructive elements of the roof and the form of the window seals. As the company's chief designer Yuri Tkachenko stated in 1992, the differences between the Simca and the M-2141 were so numerous and significant that it was more correct to say what details were borrowed from the Simca rather than what was added to its design. \\"Auto\\", № 26, 1992 It is only the top of the body that these models have in common. The existing engine was too long for transverse placement, so it was placed longitudinally, like on the Renault 20/30 or Audi 80/100 series. Aleko interior The Aleko turned out to be quite a breakthrough for the Soviet automotive industry of its time. It almost became the first front-wheel drive hatchback of the Soviet Union, but due to the fact that its development took a further two years for Moskvitch to set up the manufacturing, the Lada Samara arrived first. Although the M-2141 had a more comfortable design than the Samara, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 followed by an economic crisis, financial mismanagement and disruptions in the work of the company caused a decline in assembling quality in the 1990s and damaged the reputation of this car in the markets. Nonetheless, even then, it was still praised for a high level of passive safety, robustness of construction, good off-road capabilities, and ease of repair. In 2001 the aging M-2141, designed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and lacking modern airbags and seatbelts with pretensioners, was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the new Russian ARCAP safety assessment program, but the reviewers pointed out that for a 20-year-old car it showed an \\"excellent\\" crash-test result. The steering column and the A-pillar were displaced less than in the Citroen Xantia and early Audi A4. Before 1991, AZLK designers also created the four-wheel-drive Moskvich-21416SE and a sedan version of the M-2141 equipped with a different steering wheel and an electronic instrument cluster that was publicly demonstrated in 1990,АО \\"Москвич\\" \\"Москвич-2142\\" but none of these cars were put into series production due to the hardships brought by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although AZLK had designed and fully tested a new and more powerful generation of four-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines for the M-2141, the construction of the company's engine production plant was stopped and never resumed. Comparison between the body design of the Simca 1307 (black) and the Aleko (red) The Aleko was sold mostly on the domestic market, but in the late 1980s it was exported too. In some export markets, including France and Germany, the cars were advertised as the Lada Aleko, and diesel engines from Ford and Indenor could be delivered in addition to the standard petrol engines. The Aleko was also assembled in Bulgaria under licence for a brief period in the late 1980s. Some of the last Moskvitch models to be built were the upgraded Alekos that were renamed to Svyatogor (models M-214122, M-214100, M-214145) and the M-2142, Dolgorukiy (1997–2002). They were also based on the design of the M-2141.
