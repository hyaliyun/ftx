The theorem is named after physicists and mathematicians Nicolas Gisin, Lane P. Hughston, Richard Jozsa and William Wootters, though much of it was established decades earlier by Erwin Schr√∂dinger. The result was also found independently by Nicolas Hadjisavvas building upon work by Ed Jaynes, while a significant part of it was likewise independently discovered by N. David Mermin. Thanks to its complicated history, it is also known as the HJW theorem and the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìHJW theorem.  Purification of a mixed quantum state  Consider a mixed state \\\\rho=\\\\sum_ip_i\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi_i of the system S, where the states \\\\phi_i\\\\rangle are not assumed to be mutually orthogonal. We can add an auxiliary space \\\\mathcal{H}_A with an orthonormal basis \\\\\\\\{a_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, then the mixed state can be obtained as reduced density operator from the pure bipartite state : \\\\Psi_{SA}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_i\\\\sqrt{p_i}\\\\phi_i\\\\ranglea_i\\\\rangle. More precisely, \\\\rho=\\\\mathrm{Tr}_A\\\\Psi_{SA}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\Psi_{SA}. The state \\\\Psi_{SA}\\\\rangle is thus called the purification of \\\\rho. Since the auxiliary space and the basis can be chosen arbitrarily, the purification of a mixed state is not unique; in fact, there are infinitely many purifications of a given mixed state.  GHJW theorem  Consider a mixed quantum state \\\\rho with two different realizations as ensemble of pure states as \\\\rho=\\\\sum_ip_i\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi_i and \\\\rho=\\\\sum_jq_j\\\\varphi_j\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi_j. Here both \\\\phi_i\\\\rangleand \\\\varphi_j\\\\rangle are not assumed to be mutually orthogonal. There will be two corresponding purifications of the mixed state \\\\rho reading as follows: :Purification 1: \\\\Psi_{SA}^1\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_i\\\\sqrt{p_i}\\\\phi_i\\\\ranglea_i\\\\rangle; :Purification 2: \\\\Psi_{SA}^2\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_j\\\\sqrt{q_j}\\\\varphi_j\\\\rangleb_j\\\\rangle. The sets \\\\\\\\{a_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}and \\\\\\\\{b_j\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\} are two collections of orthonormal bases of the respective auxiliary spaces. These two purifications only differ by a unitary transformation acting on the auxiliary space, viz., there exists a unitary matrix U_Asuch that \\\\Psi^1_{SA}\\\\rangle=I\\\\otimes U_A\\\\Psi^2_{SA}\\\\rangle. Therefore, \\\\Psi_{SA}^1\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_j\\\\sqrt{q_j}\\\\varphi_i\\\\rangle\\\\otimes U_Ab_j\\\\rangle, which means that we can realize the different ensembles of a mixed state just by choosing to measure different observables of one given purification.

Born to immigrant parents in the United States, she was the first in her family to enroll at University, earning Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Falk worked at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, University of Washington and UCL Medical School. She and neuroscientist Paul Fatt researched celluar biophysics to find how the retina converts light into electrical signals, and later worked alongside Jonathan Ashmore in demonstrating that light responses can be increased significantly at the synthase between the rod bipolar cell and photoreceptor cell. Biography Gertrude Falk was born in Brooklyn, New York City on August 24, 1925. Her mother was a Lithuanian who entered the United States at the age of 16, only able to speak Yiddish, and her immigrant father operated a furrier shop during the Great Depression. Falk had one sister. She worked as a guard at her father's shop, and helped him to conceal non-unionized workers in the cupboard when inspectors visited the shop. Falk expressed a desire to enroll at university though her traditionalist parents objected to this. Nevertheless, she became the first member of her family to attend university by enrolling at Antioch College, Ohio, one of the few universities not to bar black students and impose quotas on Jews. Falk graduated from the college with a Bachelor of Science in 1947. She went on to study at University of Chicago, undertaking postgraduate research on diuresis (the increase in production of urine by a rat's kidneys), earning her a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Falk began her academic career at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, where she worked from 1952 to 1953, before moving to the University of Chicago as an instructor in natural science between 1953 and 1954. She moved to the University of Washington, Seattle in 1954, working as an instructor, and later as assistant to the professor of paracetamol. Falk left the University of Washington in 1961. That year, she flew to England as a Guggenheim Fellow to join the biophysics department of UCL Medical School, becoming the first woman to hold a professional chair at the department. There, Falk worked on the high capacitance of human muscle with a colleague, neuroscientist Paul Fatt. The two utilized two electrode recording techniques, requiring an comprehensive of real biophysics that explained how the retina converts light into electrical signals. A conclusion was reached the internal membranes accounted for the same high capacitance. She also worked with Andrew Field Huxley in 1963 and Bernard Katz in 1970. Falk and Fatt later researched celluar biophysics to increase awareness of phototransduction of the retina. In 1974, Falk and physicist Jonathan Ashmore worked on a post-doctorate to demonstrate that light responses can be increased significantly at the synthase between the rod bipolar cell and photoreceptor cell. Throughout the 1990s, she and Richard Shiells pioneered the use of micro-electrodes to analyse a solitary bipolar cell. Outside her academic work, Falk was a decades-long member of the Hampstead Labour Party, working in campaigning and fundraising from her home in Hampstead Hill Gardens. However, she was opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and New Labour, which fellow party members described as \\"the party moved away from her.\\" Falk heavily campaigned in support of the National Health Service (NHS), and she protested against a perceived threat to privatize it, which she feared would create a situation in which there would be an \\"Americanised service, where people will have to pay for healthcare through insurance, as has happened with dentists in this country\\". She was a signatory to British Friends of Peace Now and Jews for Justice for Palestinians, and was a treasurer for Mapam UK (now Meretz UK). Falk was a strong supporter of Israel and the withdrawal of its military forces from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 2007, Falk wrote to Camden New Journal about the cuts to the mental health service budget to hospitals in Camden Town. She and two personal friends spent much of the year protesting outside the Royal Free Hospital. Falk died after a short illness on March 9, 2008, and she was given a funeral in Golders Green on March 17. Personality and personal life Falk was described by Lawrence Joffe of The Guardian as \\"small of stature\\" and \\"a legendary conversationalist\\". She was outspoken, had a sense of humor, sympathy for those individuals considered the underdog, and friends and colleagues called her \\"a generous, warm and intellectually challenging person.\\" Falk was briefly married to Paul Fatt, with whom she had a daughter; the two remained on amicable terms after they were divorced. Legacy The STS Gertrude Falk Prize was established by the University College London in her honor to award the \\"top overall performance through any STS iBSc year\\".

He was awarded a Military Cross for valor in combat. and, after the war, wrote a book, 18 Platoon, about his experiences that became a recommended text on several military academy reading lists including that of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.  Early life  Jary was born in Ilford, Essex, on 24 May 1924 and was educated at Chigwell School.  Military career  In 1942, Jary joined the Royal East Kent Regiment and, following selection for officer training, was commissioned into the Royal Artillery. Wishing to serve in the infantry, he successfully requested a transfer to the Hampshire Regiment and joined them in France shortly after the invasion of Normandy. He was, however, then posted to the 2nd Battalion Somerset Light Infantry, 129th Infantry Brigade, 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, where he took over command of 18 Platoon, D Company. The battalion had suffered heavy losses, and Jary was informed that his life expectancy was just three weeks. On 2 November 1944, Jary led a fighting patrol that penetrated enemy territory and identified the location of enemy machine gun positions before destroying an enemy post and two enemy-occupied buildings. As a result of his \\"skill and good leadership\\" in the operation, Jary was recommended for and received the Military Cross. Jary participated in Operation Market Garden and the crossing of the Rhine. Following the war, he remained in the army and was posted to Libya and Palestine before eventually resigning.  Later life  After leaving the army, Jary started a publishing company and, in 1987, wrote 18 Platoon, a book about his experiences during World War II. The book was widely praised as an insight into the experiences of platoon command during the war, and became a popular textbook on leadership.

Chi's father was a lighthouse keeper stationed at the Kaohsiung Lighthouse. Chi earned his bachelor's degree from National Chiao Tung University's Department of Traffic and Transportation Engineering in 1981, followed by a master's degree within the school's Institute of Traffic and Transportation three years later. Chi worked as the chief engineer of the Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office between 1997 and 1999, then served as director of the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau, a division of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications until 2005, when he was named deputy chief engineer within the same department. From 2006 to 2008, Chi worked for the Taichung City Government, within its Transportation Bureau. Chi returned to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications in 2008 as the director of the Department of Railways and Highways. By 2010, he was named the director of the Department of Aviation and Navigation. He remained head of Aviation and Navigation through 2012. By 2013, Chi was appointed Maritime and Port Bureau director-general. From this position, Chi commented on the practice of ship inspection as the Ministry of Transportation and Communications considered increasing the frequency of such inspections in 2014. The Ocean Researcher V sunk in October of that year, and Chi was called upon to discuss details of the shipwreck and subsequent investigation. In October 2014, Chi commented on the perceived national security threat of the Hua Yun No. 12, a Chinese-owned, Hong Kong-operated ship registered in Cambodia, as the vessel traveled near Taiwan. In May 2016, Chi helped make travel arrangements for Nien Chi-cheng to visit Beiding Island Lighthouse on Kinmen, where Nien's father, a lighthouse keeper, was once stationed. As leader of the Maritime and Port Bureau, Chi also supported the designation of Dongyong Lighthouse as a national historical landmark, a status it had first gained in 1988. Following the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president, Chi was appointed administrative deputy minister of transportation and communications. In this role, Chi announced in December 2016 an intention for the government to focus on instances of drunk driving by young adults. That same month, Chi was questioned about construction delays on the Taichung Metropolitan Area Elevated Railway Project, as well as fines levied on Hua Sheng Engineering Construction Company, which was responsible for a portion of the project. Throughout 2017, Chi commented on several issues, including a protest action organized by the National Motorcycles Management Industry Advancement Association, toll discounts in place for National Day, the results of an investigation into a road incident involving a bus, and a misleading report issued by the Central Weather Bureau. In January 2018, Chi was appointed to a task force to promote the New Southbound Policy. Additionally, he replaced Tseng Dar-jen, who had resigned as Taoyuan International Airport Corporation chairman, on a temporary basis in October, serving to the end of 2018. That same year, Chi commented on the regulations mandating car inspections, legal campsites, and participated in discussions about the Tourism Bureau‚Äôs winter domestic travel subsidy program. Following an outbreak of African swine fever in 2018, Chi explained how Taiwan's airlines dispose of leftovers from in- flight meals. Later that year, Chi discussed amendments to the Regulations Governing Business Income Tax Exemption for Foreign Countries, Mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau Profit-Seeking Enterprises Conducting Goods Storage and/or Simple Processing Operations in Free Trade Zones. In 2019, Chi discussed proposed amendments to the Act for the Development of Tourism. He later disclosed further penalties against Far Eastern Air Transport, an airline that cancelled several flights without prior notice in May 2019 to manage flight hours control in effect against the airline since March 2017. As deputy transportation and communications minister, Chi has signed reciprocal drivers license agreements with Wyoming and New Mexico, participated in inspections at Taiwan Railways Administration offices, and Taoyuan International Airport, and attended a number of public functions, such as the opening of a traffic safety park for children at Youth Park in Taipei in 2018, and the 60th anniversary celebration of Japan Airlines service to Taipei Songshan Airport in 2019.

The suffix replaces the ending of Chicano and Chicana that are typical of grammatical gender in Spanish. The term is commonly used to reference a connection to Indigeneity, inclusion of genders outside the Western gender binary imposed through colonialism, and transnationality. Xicanx started to gain popularity in the 2010s and media outlets started using the term in 2016. Its emergence has been described as reflecting a shift within the Chicano Movement. The term is sometimes used by scholars to encompass all related identifiers of Latino/a, Latin@, Latinx, Chicano/a, Chican@, Latin American, or Hispanic. The term has also been used by scholars to replace what have been identified as colonizing and assimilationist terms like Latino/a, Mexican American, Mestizo, and Hispanic.  Usage and pronunciation  The first X in Xicanx is believed to be rooted in usage of the x in M√©xico. Whereas older spellings of the country appeared as M√©jico, the Mexican state symbolically reclaimed the X in M√©Xico and MeXica. However, scholars Jennie Luna and Gabriel S. Estrada describe that \\"this state reclamation of Indigenismo was a racialized logic that favored modern mestizo identity rather than supporting the living Nahua and Indigenous pueblos.\\" Luna and Estrada cite Indigenous peoples of Mexico who see the Mexican state as an agent of violence and destructive assimilationist practices in their communities. Recognizing this state violence, Luna and Estrada argue that it is important to deconstruct the notion that the X is only related to the Mexica people or \\"Aztec empire\\" (who the Mexican state has centered in its project of Indigenismo and who Chicano nationalists centered in the Chicano Movement), stating that \\"the Nahuatl language existed before the Mexica migrated south into what is now Mexico City.\\" Contemporary usage of the term Xicanx has been described as taking on new meanings. Luna and Estrada state that it has transformed to \\"reject Mexica-centrism, and instead can be viewed from a broader perspective, one that more widely embraces the Uto-Nahuatl, Mayan, and other Indigenous language families spoken throughout the Americas.\\" Maribel M. Acosta Matos states that some speakers have suggested pronouncing -x with its phonetic value in the Mayan language (/ É/ or ‚Äòsh‚Äô), where Xicanx is then pronounced as . The X may be perceived then as \\"symbolic return to Nahuatl and Maya usage and pronunciation and thus retains potential for Indigenous reclamation.\\" Luna and Estrada argue that Xicanas, Xicanos, and Xicanxs adopted the X \\"not only as a respelling, but also as a conscious resistance to further Hispanicization/colonization.\\" The rejection of coloniality in Xicanx extends to gender neutrality, which is represented in the second x in Xicanx. As noted by Acosta Matos, \\"the fact that Nahuatl and the Mayan languages do not have grammatical gender classes has also influenced the deployment of gender neutral forms\\" of terminology. As a result, Acosta Matos argues that \\"the use of -x reveals the intersection of race/ethnicity and (grammatical) gender politics: it ‚Äòsymbolizes‚Äô efforts to decolonize language. Adopting and using gender neutral nouns and pronouns reclaims Mesoamerican activists‚Äô Indigenous languages, as their linguistic systems do not conform with grammatical gender as codified in Spanish.\\" Luna and Estrada refer to the second x as an \\"Indigenized genderqueer\\" representation that interrupts \\"colonization and male/female hierarchies\\" while still acknowledging that it operates within a \\"partially European construction of language.\\" Scholars R. Tolteka Cuauhtin, Miguel Zavala, Christine Sleeter, and Wayne Au refer to Xicanx as a term that \\"moves closer to more Indigenous words, spellings, and identities.\\"  In literature and scholarship  In his 2019 book, author Luis J. Rodriguez identifies himself as a Native Xicanx writer. In a study on education and administration, David Gutierrez uses the term \\"to accentuate indigenous connections amongst these historically minoritized groups that are often categorized through a Eurocentric lens\\" as well as \\"to acknowledge and oust the gender biases that often exist in categorical labels to recognize the non- traditional gender diversity within our Xicanx community.\\" Scholar Pedro J. DiPietro states that Xicanx is inclusive of all genders and gender non- conforming people and destabilizes the centrality of cisgender masculinity. Artist Roy Martinez describes Xicanx as \\"not being bound to the feminine or masculine aspects,\\" stating that \\"it's not a set thing\\" that people should feel enclosed in, but that it is a fluid identity that extends beyond fitting within the gender binary and beyond borders. Rose Borunda and Lorena Magalena Martinez describe the decolonial and transnational aspects of Xicanx identity: > The term ‚ÄúXicanx\\" promotes a more inclusive and expansive view of Indigenous > identity and stands separate from colonizing terms such as ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù or > ‚ÄúLatino/a,‚Äù terms that do not reflect indigeneity and that project the > patriarchy of Spanish language with noun endings of ‚Äúa‚Äù for female and ‚Äúo‚Äù > for male. The term, Xicanx, is inclusive of the Indigenous and colonized > people of Mexican descent as well as the people who may originate from > Central and South American nations. Luis J. Rodriguez argues that both Xicanx and Chicano \\"mean the same thing\\" and describes Xicanx as \\"the most recent incarnation of a word that describes people that are neither totally Mexican nor totally what is conceived as American.\\" Luna and Estrada state that while \\"the 1960s Chicano Movement focused on mestizo politics, later evolutions of the movement began to recognize the need for spiritual guidance and Indigenous perspectives\\" which has resulted in the emergence of Xicanx. Scholar Susy Zepeda argues that the Chicano Movement offered \\"surface-level representations of the Mexica\\" and that the roots of de-Indigenization \\"were not excavated fully\\" nor were Indigenous peoples \\"understood as living entities.\\" Zepeda states that while the Chicano Movement's acknowledgement was a problematic yet important step, that the lack of deeper exploration may have partially stemmed out fear or susto: \\"there is almost a palpable fear of knowing more about ancestral traditions, culture, discipline, and the decolonial pathway of spirit.\\" As such, Zepeda calls upon Xicanx scholars to perform \\"a conscious examination within the field of colonial trauma or legacy of susto... [which] can lead to a ‚Äúpath of conocimiento‚Äù and to sanaci√≥n or healing of intergenerational traumas for Xicana/x detribalized peoples, without recreating forms of violence or the fear of appropriation \\"  Organizations  Some grassroots activist organizations use the term Xicanx. The Xicanx Institute for Teaching & Organizing (XITO) emerged as a strategy to continue the legacy of the Mexican American Studies Department Programs (MAS) in Tucson Unified School District. After the forced and later overturned closure of the MAS programs, XITO developed what is described by scholar Anita E. Fern√°ndez as \\"a decolonizing and re-humanizing model of Ethnic Studies professional development to counter the deficit model of current teacher education by infusing critical identity work‚Äîa critical analysis of race, power, and systems of oppression‚Äîtogether with an Indigenous epistemological framework formerly implemented in the highly successful MAS program.\\" XITO states that their commitment is to \\"assisting urban school districts, higher education institutions, school administrators and classroom teachers create inclusive, vibrant and dynamic learning environments.\\"  References  Category:American political neologisms Category:Chicano Category:Nonstandard spelling Category:Words coined in the 2010s Category:Gender-neutral language Category:Spanish grammar ","title":"Xicanx"},{"id":"61422776","text":"Charlotte Bernard (born 1 June 1972) is a French snowboarder.

[online] Available at: <http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit06.pdf> [Accessed 20 October 2020] Their analysis puts into question Minford‚Äôs figure for economic welfare in the UK to increase by 4% after Brexit and instead predict a 2.3% loss of welfare from Minford‚Äôs ‚ÄòBritain Alone‚Äô policy. According to the CEP, Minford overlooks the loss in services trade that would result from leaving the Single Market, such as ‚Äòpassporting‚Äô privileges in financial services. Furthermore, Minford‚Äôs assumption that goods prices would fall by 10% comes from attributing all producer price differences between the EU and low-cost countries to EU trade barriers, ignoring differences in quality. Minford‚Äôs approach of ignoring empirical analysis of trade data seems predicated on the view that because statistical analysis is imperfect, it should all be completely ignored. But such statistical biases may reinforce rather than weaken the case for remaining in the EU.

However, the port eventually became clogged with silt, and was unable to accommodate large ships. The first person to comprehend the tremendous possibilities of a port in Haifa was Theodor Herzl, the father of Political Zionism, who in 1902 wrote a prophetic description of the town in his book AltNeuland. Construction of the port began in 1922, and it was officially opened on October 31, 1933 by Lieut. Gen. Sir Arthur Wauchope, the British High Commissioner for Palestine. The port allowed Haifa to blossom, and in 1936, the city had over 100,000 inhabitants. The port was a gateway for thousands of immigrants after the Second World War. The port has been the scene of the Patria disaster in 1940, which killed 267 people.

Derived from the European Standard Wireless M-bus it has been mainly used by utilities for smart metering infrastructures (AMI) for gas, water or electricity but is equally open to other applications in industry and the Smart City spaces.Evjen, P.M, The Wize Protocol, LPWAN for Smart Cities (2018) [White Paper]  History  = 169 MHz radio frequency spectrum = The 169 MHz radio frequency band (169.4 - 169.8125 MHz more precisely), formerly known as ERMES band, was historically used by \\"pagers\\" type services. With the end of the use of this type of service, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) and its Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) decided in 2005 to allocate this frequency for a number of new use cases, including remote meter reading. The low value of the frequency, as well as the allowance to transmit at up to 500mW, makes this band a high- performance technical solution for remote meter reading taking into account the difficult radio access conditions (deep indoor) and the necessity to be battery-powered over a long period (up to 20 years). The ISM 169 MHz radio frequency spectrum is open and royalty-free in Europe, working as a license- free band for Short-range devices, with the common spectrum occupancy restrictions this shared spectrum have. From 2005, Suez, a private water utility, has developed an AMI infrastructure based on the 169 MHz frequency to run smart water metering deployments across Europe, mainly in France, Spain and Portugal. In 2011, Malta's Water Services Corporation (WSC) adopted the 169 MHz frequency band for its smart water metering project, becoming the first country in the world to build a nationwide smart grid with a fully integrated water system. = The EN13757 standard communication system = The EN13757-4 European standard is part of a metering standard suite managed by the CEN TC294 technical committee. The CEN TC294 standardizes communication for gas, water and heat meters as well as for heat cost allocators. The EN13757-4 defines the wireless low level interface of this standard, including physical and MAC layers. This standard includes a long list of variants. In 2012, the emergence of EN13757-4/N2 variant within the CEN TC294 technical committee constituted a turning point. The EN13757-4 mode N is the physical layer of the Wize Technology. The application layer of the Wize protocol is referenced in the EN13757 standard family and a liaison between the Wize Alliance, created in 2018, and the CEN technical committee \\"TC294\\" has been granted in 2018. The Wize protocol is now open to free access and other uses for the Internet of Things.LACOSTE, R. (2017) LoRaWAN vs 15757-4/N2 : An technical comparative analysis. [White Paper]  Technical features  = Channels = The radio spectrum of EN13757-4 mode N standard defines 6 channels within the VHF band (5 up and 1 down). The combination of a low channel bandwidth (12.5 kHz), high speed option using 4GFSK modulation, bidirectionality and a high transmission power (500 mW, +27 dBm) enables the technology to achieve high radio performances. = Range = Per unit, the in situ coverage of the Wize technology varies from 50 km range outdoors, to 10 km range indoor and 2.5 km range deep indoor. = Battery lifetime = The small amount of communication per day (5 to 10) enables the power consumption to be very low as small lithium batteries cells (AA, A or C) are enough to feed the devices for 15-20 years for remote meter reading. = End-to-end security = The communication between devices and gateways (link layer) and the communication end-to-end is encrypted using hash keys in AES-128 to secure the data. = Over-the-air (OTA) updates = A protocol mechanism allows to schedule and perform, via broadcasting, an update of the devices' firmware over the air, this is wirelessly.  Roll outs  So far, more than 7 million smart meters are operated with the Wize protocol. In France GRDF has taken the decision in 2012 to develop gas meter solutions called Gazpar using the Wize technology. The deployment of the 11 million smart meters and ten thousand gateways started in 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2022. It is mainly an energy efficiency project dedicated to clients and collectivities, designed to : * Increase customer satisfaction through daily and automatic remote reading of gas consumption measures * Develop energy savings by making consumption data available to clients. * Optimize grid management and enhance performance of Distribution System Operators (DSOs), through more accurate knowledge of consumed volumes of gas. By the end of October 2019, 4,5 million gas meters and 6500 data-concentrators are installed on the field. GRDF intends to use its infrastructure bases on WIZE Technology for automatic and daily reading of industrials meters. In 2018, the French local utility R√©gaz Bordeaux started a smart metering project for 250 thousand gas meters. The development of Wize 169 MHz infrastructures has also been undertaken in the water sector by the private utility Suez Eau France and other public water utilities such as Eau de Paris . Smart water meters have also been deployed with the Wize technology in different European utilities such as Aig√ºes de Barcelona in Spain or Ovak in the Czech Republic.  Wize Alliance  Founded by Suez, GRDF and Sagemcom in March 2017, the Wize Alliance aims to promote and develop the use of the 169 MHz Wize protocol. The Wize Alliance is presided by Edouard Sauvage, CEO of GRDF. The board is constituted of the three founding members GRDF, Suez and Sagemcom. Using the frequency 169 MHz is free by rights within the European Union, it is not mandatory to be part of the Wize Alliance to use the technology. However, only members of the Alliance have access to the technical specifications of the Wize technology using the frequency 169 MHz.

The neighboring buildings are Palazzo Savorgnan and Palazzo Testa. History The palace was built in the 16th century to be a residence of the Bonfadinis, a family of Tyrolean merchants who joined the Venetian patriciate. In the mid-17th century, the present fa√ßade was completed. In the 19th century, the Jewish family of the Vivantes settled in the palazzo, initially as a tenant, giving the building its second name. In the first half of the 20th century, the building suffered a prolonged degradation until the new owners carried out an important restoration in the 1990s. Architecture The fa√ßade of the palazzo is rather simple, of three levels and an attic on top. The structure has two rectangular portals on the ground floor flanked by square windows. The second noble floor is decorated with the most important element, a serliana with a metal parapet. The first noble floor below has a similar layout with smaller quadrangular openings, also with parapet. Finally, the fa√ßade terminates with a thin dentilled cornice and stringcourse. The palazzo interiors are of notable artistic value, decorated with artworks made between the 18th and 19th centuries by Giuseppe Castelli, Giuseppe Borsato, and Giambattista Canal.

The garden was one of the early developments of the city soon after its foundation. Previously it had been part of the estates and hunting grounds of a Swedish noble, but after its capture during the region's conquest by the Russians in the early 1700s, it became part of the imperial estates, and was granted by Peter the Great to his wife Catherine for her palace. Catherine's palace, on the banks of the Moyka River, was known as the Golden Mansion, and the surrounding land was developed by Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond as a garden both for pleasure, and to provide supplies for the imperial household. During this time it went by several names, including the \\"Swedish Garden\\", the \\"Tsaritsyn Garden\\", and the \\"Third Summer Garden\\". The garden was further developed during the reigns of Empress Anna Ioannovna and Empress Elizabeth, who built new palaces and arranged the land to suit their own preferences. Empress Catherine's palace was demolished in 1768 and during the reign of Emperor Paul I the Mikhailovsky Castle was built to the east of the gardens. The garden was included in these redevelopments, but Paul was assassinated in the castle in 1801, and for some years after that the area was neglected. The next large scale redevelopment took place in the 1810s when Emperor Alexander I commissioned a new palace complex for his younger brother, Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich from architect Carlo Rossi. The Mikhailovsky Palace, named for its occupant, was completed in 1825 to the south of the garden, which was also substantially redeveloped as part of an ensemble that included the land to the north across the Field of Mars and as far as the Neva River. Assisted by Adam Menelaws, Rossi introduced the style and techniques of English landscape gardens, creating a large irregular oval meadow with alleyways, while the ponds were reshaped into more natural meandering outlines. Rossi also designed a pavilion and pier and a bridge as features for the garden. The garden served as the private grounds of the palace until its purchase for the state in 1898 and the establishment of the Russian Museum, at which point it became a city park. The garden survived the Soviet period, but suffered significant changes to its original composition. Children's play areas, tennis courts and public toilets were built on its grounds, while tree planting was carried out haphazardly, eventually blocking important sightlines around the ensemble. Transferred to the Russian Museum in 1999, the garden underwent substantial restoration in the early 2000s, which recreated Rossi's original designs. The garden was designated an \\"object of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance\\" in 2001, and since 2008 has hosted the annual International \\"Imperial Gardens of Russia\\" Festival. Location and layout Aerial view of the Mikhailovsky Garden, looking towards the south. The course of the Moyka River and the Rossi Pavilion in the foreground, and the Mikhailovsky Palace in the background. The Church of the Saviour on Blood is visible to the right of the picture. The Mikhailovsky Garden is in Dvortsovy Municipal Okrug, part of the Tsentralny District of the city. It covers 9.4 hectares and lies to the north of the Mikhailovsky Palace, now the main building of the Russian Museum, and its extension, the Benois Wing. The building of the Russian Museum of Ethnography completes the southern boundary of the garden. To the east the garden is bordered by Sadovaya Street, and to the west by the Griboyedov Canal and embankment, and the Church of the Saviour on Blood. The Moyka River flows across the northern end of the garden, and separates it from the Field of Mars. History =Catherine's garden= Empress Catherine, for whom the first garden and palace complex was built. A 1717 portrait by Jean-Marc Nattier The area now partly occupied by the Mikhailovsky Garden, prior to the region's conquest by the Russians and the founding of Saint Petersburg, was the site of various rural settlements. In a map of 1698 it is marked as belonging to the estate of a Swedish rotmister named Konau, and contained his hunting grounds. With the establishment of the city of Saint Petersburg and the imperial residences in the area, the region became the property of the crown. Peter the Great gifted the land to his wife Catherine in 1712 for the purpose of building a residence. In 1716 Peter commissioned architect Jean- Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond to create a series of summer gardens for the imperial palaces. Le Blond's first and second gardens were located on the grounds of what is now the Summer Garden. The third occupied the site of the present-day Mikhailovsky Garden, and was the location of Empress Catherine's palace. Catherine's palace occupied a site on the banks of the Moyka River, now the location of the Rossi Pavilion. It was a relatively small wooden construction, known as the \\"Golden Mansion\\" because its tiled roof was decorated with a golden spire, with some rooms decorated with gilded leather. The palace garden stretched southwards between the Krivusha and Fontanka Rivers almost as far as Bolshaya Perspekpekty, the modern-day Nevsky Prospect. It was known at different times as the \\"Swedish Garden\\", the \\"Tsaritsyn Garden\\", and the \\"Third Summer Garden\\". Le Blond's plan, personally approved by Peter the Great, envisaged a single large palace and park ensemble that was to include the imperial residences and gardens. The garden as it appears on a 1753 map of the city. The grid pattern of ponds and garden plots are visible. To the left is Empress Elizabeth's Summer Palace, while at the bottom are the Summer Garden and the Tsaritsyn Meadow, the future Field of Mars. The garden design combined aesthetic qualities with practical considerations. Fir trees, trimmed into pyramidal shapes, were grown near the palace, while an alley of chestnut trees linked it with gazebos, a fountain, and sculptures. The garden was also intended to supply the palaces with provisions, and the southwestern half of the garden was laid out with fruit trees, vegetable gardens and berry bushes, with five rectangular ponds to supply fresh fish. \\"French-Italian cellars\\" were also located in the grounds, providing storage space for imported wines and other foodstuffs, while 50 nightingales were brought to the garden from Moscow, Pskov and Novgorod Governorates. In his diary entry of 11 July 1721, kamer-junker Friedrich Wilhelm von Bergholz recorded that bananas and pineapples had been successfully grown in the garden. A number of farm buildings, stables, barns and servants' quarters were laid out in the grounds of the palace, while Catherine ordered the laying out of pathways along the Moyka and Fontanka. Access between the Third and Second Summer Gardens was via a floating bridge across the Moyka. By 1718 the garden was under the care of the Hanoverian gardener Gaspar Focht, as were the First and Second Summer Gardens, and the Pharmacy Garden, now the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden. =The reigns of the Empresses= Empress Elizabeth's Summer Palace in a 1756 view by The garden was partially redeveloped during the reign of Empress Anna Ioannovna, with the vegetable garden and orchards relocated to the east bank of the Fontanka, and replaced with a small hunting area where hares and deer were kept in specially fenced areas. A nursery of maple trees was also established. A more comprehensive redesign occurred during the reign of Empress Elizabeth, who commissioned Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli to build a new Summer Palace for her. Construction began on the wooden palace on 24 June 1741, with the Empress taking up residence in it in 1745. The garden was redesigned with a more regular layout with longitudinal and transverse avenues, and with trees trimmed into geometric shapes, with added sculptures, ponds, flower beds and pavilions. A bathhouse was built on the banks of the Moyka, with amusements such as swings, merry-go-rounds, and slides placed in the centre of the garden. The Golden Mansion survived until 1768, when it was demolished on the orders of Catherine the Great. Shortly after Emperor Paul's accession to the throne in 1796, he ordered the demolition of Empress Elizabeth's Summer Palace and its replacement with the Mikhailovsky Castle, which was finally completed in 1801. The garden was once more included in the new developments, which retained most of the existing ponds, while planting lines of trees around their perimeters. Four of the five original fishponds were preserved, and were connected together by underground pipes which linked them with an ornamental pond in the western part of the garden. Water became an important feature in the new designs, which envisaged the Mikhailovsky Castle as a moated construction, entirely surrounded by water and crossed by drawbridges which could be raised. The castle stood between four waterways: the Moyka and Fontanka Rivers, and the specially-dug Church and . After Paul's assassination in the castle in 1801, the imperial family abandoned the residence, and it and its surroundings fell into disrepair, with the castle eventually transferred to the Main Engineering School in 1822. =Rossi's ensemble= The curving banks of the garden's pond, typical of English landscape gardens. The Mikhailovsky Castle in the background. In 1817, Emperor Alexander I commissioned a major redevelopment of the area of the city between Nevsky Prospect and Palace Embankment, centred around a new palace complex for his younger brother, Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich. The ensemble, the last palace ensemble built in the city, was the work of architect Carlo Rossi, and envisaged an entirely new arrangement for the gardens surrounding what became the Mikhailovsky Palace. The greenhouses which covered the southern part of the garden became the site of the new palace, while the area stretching north from the palace to the Moyka became the palace garden and grounds. Thus by 1825 it had become known as the Mikhailovsky Garden. The plans for the garden were drawn up by Rossi and Adam Menelaws, and approved by the emperor in April 1822. The land around the Mikhailovsky Castle was also redeveloped under the scheme, approved by Alexander in 1823, and involving the filling in of the Church Canal and part of the garden's eastern ornamental pond. The earlier water system, linking the garden's ponds with the castle's watercourses, was otherwise retained, and further expanded with an underground channel linking the garden's large pond with the Moyka. Rossi also retained Leblon and Rastrelli's practice of dividing the garden into sections, and planted new trees around the castle. The Rossi Pavilion, viewed from the Moyka River For the overall layout of the garden, Rossi followed the style and techniques of English landscape gardens, which had become internationally popular in the eighteenth century. The garden facade of the Mikhailovsky Palace looked out over a large irregular oval meadow, bordered by alleyways and laid out in a grid pattern. The small rectangular ponds in the centre of the garden were filled in, while other ponds were reshaped from angular geometric designs into more natural meandering outlines. The garden was decorated with flower beds and flowering shrubs, with picturesque groups of trees supplementing the plantings along the pathways. In the north of the garden, on the banks of the Moyka and on the site of Catherine's Golden Mansion, Rossi designed a pavilion and pier intended \\"for romantic meetings on summer evenings over a cup of tea or playing cards\\". Rossi himself designed a cast iron bridge across the ponds, and the railings for the pier, which were cast by the . By the 1830s Sadovaya Street was extended along the east side of the garden, from which it was separated by an ornamental fence. During the imperial period the garden was a private space and closed to citizens. Grand Duke Michael's wife, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, took chief responsibility for the palace and garden, and the spaces were used to host events, horseback riding and balls. During this period the nickname \\"Elena Pavlovna's Garden\\" became popular among the city's residents. A 1839 description of one of the Grand Duchess's balls recorded that \\"During the ball, the garden and the palace were turned into a kind of exhibition of Saint Petersburg gardening. All the flowers from the Pavlovsk and Oranienbaum greenhouses were brought to the ball via the pier of the Mikhailovsky Garden on two hundred carts. Everything in the palace was blossoming and fragrant ... From the garden shone a fantastic illumination, with a wonderful view of the Field of Mars and the Neva\\". The Church of the Saviour on Blood, built on the garden's western side, and the Art Nouveau- style fence which separates it from the garden On 1 March 1881, Emperor Alexander II was assassinated by members of Narodnaya Volya while travelling along the Catherine Canal embankment beside the Mikhailovsky Garden. In memory of his father the new emperor, Alexander III, ordered the building of the Church of the Saviour on Blood on the site of the assassination. The church took up part the western edge of the garden, and was separated from it by an Art Nouveau-style fence designed by Alfred Parland and created by between 1903 and 1907. By 1898 the palace had ceased to be a grand ducal residence, and was bought back by the state for use as the home of the Museum of Emperor Alexander III, now the Russian Museum. Both the palace and garden were opened to the public, though a sign on the entrance forbade entry to dogs and soldiers. The redevelopment of the palace complex in the early 1900s, with the construction of the museum's ethnographic department, reduced the size of the garden slightly, while in 1902 the eastern pond was filled in. =Soviet park= In 1918 the garden was designated a monument of landscape art by the early Soviet state, and in 1922, during the early Soviet period, the garden was named after the International Organization of Assistance to Revolutionary Fighters (), but was otherwise in decline. By now designated a city park, some repair work was carried out in 1924 with the planting of new trees, the cleaning of the pond, and maintenance work on the fence along Sadovaya Street. Also that year paths were built across the meadow, and new pavilions and stages erected for exhibitions. However the garden sustained damage in heavy flooding in November 1924. In 1939 a children's playground and public toilets were built. During the siege of Leningrad efforts were made to protect some of the city's monuments by burying them in open spaces. Several, including the , were buried in the Mikhailovsky Garden. The garden suffered from the heavy bombing and shelling the city received during the Second World War, which destroyed trees and left craters in the grounds. Restoration work took place in 1949, in 1957 the railings of the pier were restored, and in 1959 a bust of sculptor Fedot Shubin was installed on the meadow. During the later Soviet period tree and bush planting was carried out in a haphazard fashion, and the view across the Field of Mars to the Neva became obstructed. =Post-Soviet period= View across the meadow to the garden facade of the Mikhailovsky Palace In 1999 the garden was transferred to the Russian Museum, which commissioned an inspection of the state of the grounds. The report in 2000 revealed the extensive damage done to the original design of the ensemble, and a plan was drawn up the following year by the for the restoration of the garden. Work was then carried out between 2002 and 2004, restoring the gardens to the original Rossi designs. Some of the artworks that had been placed in the garden, such as A. P. Solovyov's \\"Tree of Freedom\\", and the bust of Shubin, were removed. A bust of Rossi was placed in the Rossi Pavilion, while busts of Karl Bryullov, and Alexander Ivanov were installed in the grounds of the garden. As restored, the garden preserves the English landscape style in its centre, and the French formal style around its edges. On 10 July 2001 the garden and its ensemble were designated as objects \\"of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance.\\" Since 2008 the garden has hosted the International \\"Imperial Gardens of Russia\\" Festival annually in late May and early June. The festival is an exhibition and competition of landscape and garden-park art.

It was designed by architect Carlo Rossi during his redevelopment of the garden in the early 1820s, and built in 1825. Built to span the neck between two large ponds in the east of the garden, the bridge was constructed of cast-iron spans supported by brick abutments lined with limestone. The fencing and pedestals making up the parapet are also of cast iron. Little survives of the original construction details, with the exception of an architectural plan from 1826. The bridge and ponds suffered during the twentieth century, with one of the ponds being filled in, leaving the bridge half buried in earth. Restoration works in the early 2000s restored the ponds and bridge back to their original appearance. Today the bridge is the only one in Saint Petersburg to retain most of its original cast-iron parts. Design and history The area now occupied by the Mikhailovsky Garden had previously been the site of the Golden Mansion of Empress Catherine, the wife of Peter the Great, and its surrounding land. The garden had been granted by Peter to Catherine in 1712 for her residence, which was a relatively small wooden construction, receiving its name from its golden spire, with some rooms decorated with gilded leather. It was demolished on the orders of Catherine the Great in 1768. The construction of the bridge formed part of the general redevelopment of the garden and its surrounding areas, begun in 1817 under the orders of Emperor Alexander I. The centrepiece was to be a new palace complex for his younger brother, Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich. The palace was designed by Rossi, while the plans for the garden were drawn up by Rossi and Adam Menelaws, and approved by the emperor in April 1822.

The existing ponds were reshaped into more natural meandering outlines and picturesque groups of trees supplemented the plantings along the pathways. The bridge's cast-iron railings and decorative pedestals The bridge, also designed by Rossi, is about long, and crosses a neck connecting two ponds in the east of the garden. It has brick abutments lined with limestone blocks, and is supported by five cast-iron lattice trusses, its ribs being cast in halves. The parapet consists of cast-iron fencing fixed to pedestals with decorative elements. Little information about the construction survives, with the exception of an architectural drawing dated 1826 and signed by Rossi. Between 1900 and 1911 the easternmost of the two ponds was filled in as part of the construction of the building of the Russian Museum of Ethnography, and the bridge was half buried in earth. The bridge and ponds underwent restoration between 2002 and 2003 as part of the general programme of works that recreated Rossi's original plans for the garden. The Rossi Bridge is the only bridge structure in Saint Petersburg to retain most of its original cast- iron elements and arched structures, only a few having been replaced by new castings based on the surviving originals.

It was designed by architect Carlo Rossi in the early 1820s and built in 1825 during his redevelopment of the garden. The site now occupied by the pavilion was previously the location of one of the city's early imperial palaces, the Golden Mansion of Peter the Great's wife, Empress Catherine. The palace was demolished on the orders of Catherine the Great in 1768, and was only redeveloped in the early 1820s as part of the construction of the Mikhailovsky Palace complex. As part of the new ensemble, the gardens between the palace and the Moyka River were laid out in the style of an English landscape garden. The pavilion, designed by Rossi in the Neoclassical style, was built to provide an area for pleasure and refreshment overlooking the river, with a pier where boats could moor. The pavilion survived the Soviet period and was part of the large-scale restoration of the garden in the early 2000s. As part of this work, a bust of Carlo Rossi was placed in the pavilion. Location and design  The pavilion viewed from the garden The pavilion sits in the northern end of the Mikhailovsky Garden, on the southern bank of the Moyka River. Designed in the Neoclassical style, it has an open Doric colonnade connecting two square rooms, cast-iron fences, and a pier on the river accessed by two flights of granite steps. The pavilion is in the east of the garden, off the centre line of the Mikhailovsky Palace to the south, but aligned with the centre line of the Field of Mars to the north. Explanations for this are either that Rossi had planned a second pavilion to be built to the west, creating a symmetrical view to and from the Mikhailovsky Palace, but the second pavilion was never built; or that it was a deliberate choice by Rossi to connect the Mikhailovsky ensemble with the Field of Mars ensemble on the other side of the river. The site of the pavilion had previously been occupied by the Golden Mansion of Empress Catherine, the wife of Peter the Great.

It was first published in the United States as a paperback original in November 2015 by Roc Books, and in the United Kingdom by Gollancz in paperback in February 2018. An audio edition of the book, narrated by Newman, was published in the United States by Blackstone Audio in November 2015, and in the United Kingdom by Orion Publishing in December 2017. Planetfall was Newman's first science fiction novel and is about a 3D printer engineer in a colony on a remote planet and a large bio-mechanical alien structure called \\"God's City\\". The novel is the first book in her four-book Planetfall series, which Newman said can be read in any order. The book was generally well received by critics, and was shortlisted for the 2016 Gaylactic Spectrum Award for best novel. The Planetfall series was nominated for the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Series. Plot summary Planetfall is set in the future in a colony on an unnamed planet. It is narrated by Renata Ghali (Ren), the colony's 3D printer engineer. The expedition to the planet on the ship Atlas was led by Lee Suh-Mi (Suh). Ren had met Suh at university in France and they became lovers. When they were hiking in a nature reserve near the Alps, Suh found an uncatalogued plant and ate its seed. She fell into a coma, but awoke soon after and immediately wrote down the coordinates of a planet she said she had to go to. Suh later told Ren that the plant releases a pheromone, compelling its finder to eat its seed. For what became known as the expedition \\"to find God,\\" Suh recruited a thousand people, including Cillian Mackenzie (Mack), who financed the mission; her son, Lee Hak-Kun; and Ren. Suh was called the Pathfinder and guided them to the planet. Suh, Ren, Mack, and Hak-Kun made planetfall in a pod, finding a large bio-mechanical alien structure they called \\"God's City\\". At the top of the city, Suh disappeared into a room. Several minutes later, she returned in tears, claiming that God had died. She removed her helmet and died. The advance party returned to Atlas without Suh. In order to keep the colony together, Mack explained to the colony that Suh had remained behind because she was communing with God. Hak-Kun disagreed with Mack, believing that they should tell the truth. Everyone then left Atlas in pods for the second planetfall. Mack manipulated Hak-Kun's pod so that it went off course and crashed, but the remainder of the colonists established a colony at the foot of God's City. Two decades later the colonists are still waiting for Suh to return, and every year a ceremony is held at God's City where they receive a seed believed to have been placed by Suh. Ren, who built the colony with her printers, is a loner and keeps to herself. She is also a hoarder of discarded objects that should be recycled. Since the first planetfall, Mack and her have been hiding the truth about what happened to Suh. Ren wants to tell the colony that she died, but Mack insists they perpetuate the lie that she is still in God's City to keep the colony's hopes alive. Every year Mack and Ren sneak into the City and place a seed in the plant for the next ceremony. One day Suh's grandson Sung-Soo arrives at the colony. He tells Mack and Ren that his parents survived their pod's crash and that he was born in the wilderness. When his family died, he came looking for other survivors. He befriends Ren and discovers that her house is full of \\"junk\\". He offers to help her clear it out, but she becomes distressed, saying that she needs it all. Concerned for her welfare, he reports her to the colony, who break into her house and start removing things. Buried deep in the junk they find a box with Suh's body in it. Everyone assumes that Ren killed her. Distraught at having her space invaded and her treasures thrown out, and in an effort to defend herself, Ren uses her implants to broadcast her video of the first planetfall to the entire colony, revealing the truth about Suh's death and Mack's manipulation. Unable to bear parting with Suh, Ren had retrieved her body from God's City and buried her in her house. Mack and Ren are arrested, but Ren escapes when explosions rip through sections of the colony. The explosions were planted by Sung-Soo and other survivors he did not tell the colony about. Hak-Kun had told them that Suh had died, and they were seeking revenge on the colony for hiding the truth and abandoning them. Ren flees into God's City and works her way to the top where Suh had led them twenty years ago. Ren has no protective gear and touches the slimy walls with her bare hands. A connection is made between her and the alien structure, which never happened with Suh because of her environmental suit. The City leads Ren to a room with evidence that other Pathfinders from other worlds have been here. On a slab rests a body that turns to dust as she approaches. She knows what she has to do and lies on it. She is ready to meet the City's makers. = Narrative chronology = The novel is narrated two decades after the colonists arrive on the planet. Much of the background is initially unknown to the reader; the events of and prior to planetfall are gradually revealed through Ren's thoughts and memories. =Technology= The colony uses 3D printing to produce almost all of its needs, including building materials, equipment, clothing, food and medicines. The minerals used by the printers are mined in the mountains surrounding the colony, and extracted from the colony's discarded material using the Masher, a recycling machine. The colonists adapt themselves to live on the planet without environmental suits using biotechnology and genetic engineering. This enables them to breathe the planet's atmosphere and defend themselves against harmful microbes and allergens. They enhance themselves with chips that monitor their health, and neural implants that connect them to the colony's network. With the implants they can record and playback what they see, hear and feel, and communicate with others colonists. Background Newman said ideas for Planetfall had been with her for several years. She had wanted to write a story about a person with a mental illness, but the character and setting eluded her. Then she started reading about advances in 3D printing, and in particular an article about using 3D printers to create a moon base from moon dust. That gave her what she was looking for, and her character became Renata, a disturbed 3D printer engineer who constructs a colony on a remote planet. Planetfall was to be Newman's first science fiction novel. Previously she had written three urban fantasy books in her Split Worlds series. She said that despite science fiction being her \\"first love\\", she had never attempted to write it. She explained that she felt \\"intimidated\\" by science fiction, and was worried she would \\"get the science wrong\\" and \\"screw it up\\". But once she realized that so long as she does not break any of the fundamental rules of science, she is free to create whatever future she pleases. Planetfall was originally intended to be a stand-alone novel, but when Newman's publishers bought it, they asked her for a second book, and over the next four years she wrote three more in the Planetfall universe. Newman said the books in the series are largely self-contained, and can be read in any order. Reception In a review of Planetfall in The New York Times, American science fiction and fantasy author N. K. Jemisin described Ren as \\"a rare science fiction protagonist\\", and complimented Newman on her handling of this \\"mentally ill\\" and \\"unlikable yet poignantly human\\" character. She noted that while the author's antagonists \\"doesn't do nearly as well\\" and \\"teeter on the line of caricature\\", Ren's \\"inner demons are the stars of the show\\". Jemisin was fascinated how Newman made revealing the lies about Suh more interesting than the lies themselves, and concluded that the book's climax is \\"cathartic and transcendent enough to smooth over any flaws along the way.\\" Writing at Tor.com, Robert H. Bedford described Planetfall as \\"a fascinating character study\\" that shows just how destructive secrets can be. He said Ren's first-person narrative gives the reader \\"a very limited perspective\\" of her world, which makes her voice \\"haunting\\" and suggestive of \\"dread lurking beneath the surface\\". He added that because Ren is a troubled person, she is an unreliable narrator, and although such narrators are not uncommon in literature, Bedford said Newman \\"gives new depth to the meaning 'unreliable. He compared Planetfall to Mary Doria Russell‚Äôs novel The Sparrow which also deals with an uneasy truce between science and religion. He was, however, critical of Planetfall ending, saying that while it is thought-provoking, he felt it a little too \\"abrupt\\". But overall Bedford described Newman's book as \\"[b]eautifully and heartbreakingly wrought\\" and called it \\"a distressing, harrowing novel that left a deep mark on me\\". American writer Charlie Jane Anders said Planetfall is not your average novel about space colonization. Writing at Gizmodo she described the book as \\"much weirder\\", \\"a fair bit darker\\", and with as much psychological drama as science fiction. She complimented Newman on her \\"well-realized world-building\\" with its realistic portrayal of the inner working of the colony and its advanced technology. But she added that this setting is not what it seems, and it is not too long before the book starts to \\"mess with your head\\". The settlement turns out to be \\"some weird fusion of utopian community and religious pilgrimage\\", and Ren becomes someone totally unexpected. Anders remarked that Newman's use of a first-person narrator who does not reveal all she knows is \\"risky\\", but felt that here, with all its \\"repressed truths and terrible secrets, it absolutely works and feels natural and honest\\".

It is a major bird watching site in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The wetland is home to 1.4 lakhs migratory birds in the winter. It is the last surviving wetland at Uran. The core wetland area at Panje covers 213 hectares and consists of foraging and roosting areas of several bird species. The buffer area of 157 hectares is mangroves. Panje consists of a mix of habitats including freshwater and saline marshes, reeds, mangroves, grasslands and scrub ‚Äî make it a fine birding place. The Panje wetlands are notified and protected under the Maharashtra National Wetland Atlas 2011. In 2015, The State Wildlife Board approved the creation of a bird sanctuary at Panje-Funde near Uran. A film documenting the flora and fauna of this wetland was made by Aishwarya Sridhar-a young wildlife film maker. The film is called Panje-The Last Wetland.  Flora and fauna  The area is home to large numbers of coconut trees and mangroves. It is also the foraging and roosting area for several bird species like Lesser sand plover, Curlew sandpiper, Little stint, Gull billed tern, Brown headed Gull, Black headed Gull, Heuglin‚Äôs Gull, Blue-tailed bee-eater, Lesser Flamingoes, Greater Flamingoes, Purple moorhens, Eurasian Curlew, Ruddy Shelduck, Common Shelduck, Eurasian Coots, Spot-billed bucks, Pheasant tailed Jacana, Bar tailed Godwits, Black tailed Godwit, Ruff, Marsh sandpipers, Scaly breasted Munia, Tri-colored Munia, Red Avadavat, Indian Skimmer, the Asian Desert Warbler, the Bristled Grassbird, Caspian Plover and many more. Also, one can see as many as 800-900 flamingoes at Panje coastal village during the months of October‚ÄìMarch. Last year, two rare wetland birds of the species Red-necked Phalarope were seen at Panje after a gap of 15 years. Mammals found here include Indian Grey Mongoose, Gerbil, Jungle Cat, Indian Fox and Indian Jackal. Reptiles found are Common Rat Snake, Indian Cobra, Checkered Keelback, Buff striped Keelback, Rock python, Common Krait, Russel‚Äôs Viper and Saw scaled Viper.  Fishing  Panje wetland is rich in terms of fish catch. The Uran wetlands serve as a fish breeding ground and the main livelihood of the local people is fishing. Panje Wetlands  Controversy  Around 85% of Uran‚Äôs wetlands have been destroyed. Recurring cases of mangrove destruction (9500 trees) and reclamation of wetlands have happened at Uran. Recently illegal landfills are on the rise and the wetlands are being slowly assimilated in the coastal city. This unprecedented land development and urbanization are creating concerns about the impact on the environment. This is because the wetlands serve as a natural sponge absorbing excess rainfall and doing its bit to reduce pollution. Wetlands are under threat due to exponential expansion of real-estate projects in Mumbai Now a day, land encroachment and land alteration are the important aspect of threats for Panje wetlands and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) had also published a report stating the protection of Panje wetlands due to its proximity to the Navi Mumbai International Airport. The wetland is a part of the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) and in the entire wetland a boundary has been created by NMSEZ. In September 2018, City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) of Maharashtra shut the high tide water ingress to the Panje Wetlands. The barrier was built in the year 1991 with help from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay as a flood control mechanism. It shuts automatically during high tide and opens up during low tide, remaining closed throughout the months of monsoon. However, in the last week of September, some gates were damaged and the barrier was shut down, starving water supply into the mangroves. Around 60% of the Panje wetlands dried up. Navi Mumbai residents and environmentalists filed a complaint with the state highlighting CIDCO‚Äôs actions. This led to the HC appointed state mangrove committee to issue directions to stop reclamation activities at Uran to protect bird habitats. On October 6, 2018, CIDCO opened 10 out of the 76 sluice gates. But environmentalists complained it wasn‚Äôt enough to sustain the wetland. Vanashakti (an NGO) filed a contempt petition against Cidco under its original petition to safeguard wetlands in Maharashtra. On October 10, 2018, a day before the Bombay High Court appointed wetland grievance redressal committee was to hear the matter, Cidco vice chairman and managing director instructed his engineering team to open majority of the gates at Panje. Of 76 gates, 70 opened by Cidco, and the wetland, mangroves and holding pond area were partially restored. Today, Panje is the last surviving wetland of Uran.

Religious tourism  The SCOAN is especially known for the huge number of foreign pilgrims it attracts with The Guardian reporting the church receives more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. This Day newspapers reported that ‚Äúabout two million local and inbound tourists‚Äù visit The SCOAN annually. It has been described as ‚ÄúNigeria‚Äôs biggest tourist attraction‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most visited destination by religious tourists in West Africa‚Äù. Figures released by the Nigerian Immigration Service indicated that six out of every ten foreign travellers coming into Nigeria are bound for The SCOAN. The SCOAN‚Äôs contribution to Nigeria's religious tourism was highlighted when the cleric hinted at the possibility of relocating his ministry to Israel during a Sunday service. The announcement proved controversial with several prominent Nigerians urging him to remain in the country, citing the economic setbacks Nigeria would likely experience through his potential relocation. The church's popular services have also resulted in an enormous boost for local businesses and hoteliers.  Faith healing  SCOAN claims regular occurrences of divine miracles. It has published numerous videos claiming to document the healing of incurable disabilities and illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, blindness and open wounds. Spiritual healing at The SCOAN has been the subject of several media reports, including a mention in Time Magazine, an Associated Press interview and an article by Foreign Policy.

Murang‚Äôa town is in Kiharu constituency. Ndindi belongs to Jubilee Party, the ruling party in Kenya under President Uhuru Kenyatta. He previously served as the Chairman of Kiharu Constituency Development Fund (CDF) from 2013 to 2016. He is a graduate of Kenyatta University with a Bachelor of Arts (Economics) and was a student leader at the same university. Ndindi occupies a markedly controversial position in Kenya political life, having risen to prominence with his disdain for the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party leader Raila Odinga, and later and unequivocal supporter of Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential ambitions. Ndindi has been rated as among the best performing Members of Parliament in Kenya. Besides being a Member of Parliament (MP), Ndindi is an entrepreneur with interests in stock brokerage, communication, construction, civil works, water engineering and drilling. His firms include Afrisec Telecoms, Investax Capital and Telesec with total capital of $3 million and annual turnover of $500,000. Ndindi is a self-made multi-millionaire, having commenced his entrepreneurship as a cobbler and a hawker in his peasantry teenage life in Murang'a countryside, before elevating to the pinnacle of business success, with Investax Capital being the largest stock broking agency in Kenya. Before the 2017 Kenya general election, Ndindi was profiled as among social media users infamous for hate-mongering after he ceaselessly hurled Raila Odinga with expletives, though, neither National Cohesion and Integration Commission nor police pressed charges against him. Ndindi threw his hat into the ring for the Kiharu Constituency Parliamentary Seat in 2017 and won with a landslide as a Member of Parliament (MP) after scooping 60,881 votes against his closest competitor who garnered 35,181 votes. Ndindi made history as a son of peasant farmer being elected as an MP in a constituency that was famous for the prominent politicians it produced, including Kenneth Matiba. In March 2019, Ndindi proposed a bill in parliament, Anti-corruption and Economics Crime Amendment Bill 2019, which stipulated stringent penalties including execution for those convicted of corruption in Kenya. Though the bill drew a flurry of excitement, ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga slammed it as a ploy to clip powers of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and Directorate of Public Prosecutions in handling corruption cases. However, Ndindi and the Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi denied this and blamed the media for misinformation. Ndindi is a confidante and a key member of Deputy President William Ruto's inner circle. He belongs to Team Tangatanga, a large faction of Jubilee Party politicians allied to William Ruto and which is determined to have Ruto succeed Uhuru Kenyatta as the fifth president of Kenya. The antagonists of Ndindi's team is Team Kieleweke which is opposed to William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. On Sunday, 8 September 2019, Ndindi clashed with Nominated MP Maina Kamanda over protocol in a fundraiser ceremony in Gitui Catholic Church in Kiharu and thereafter sought and arrested by police to answer charges of assault, incitement and causing disturbance in the church. His supporters in Murang'a immediately staged a protest and held a vigil to demand his release, maintaining that Ndindi was innocent. Members of Parliament allied to Team Tangatanga termed Ndindi's arrest as mere political persecution and blamed Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho for applying bullying tactics to silence those who do not subscribe to his political beliefs. Through intervention of Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata, Ndindi was freed and attended Murang'a Law Court the following morning where charges against him were dropped unconditionally. Ndindi is married to Sophia Wambui. He is the author of a motivational book, 'How to Succeed in High School.  Early life and education  Ndindi was born in December 1985 in Gathukeini location, Murang'a county. His mother was a peasant farmer while his father a carpenter in Kiandutu slums in Thika. Ndindi is the last born son in a family of four, the other siblings being his sisters. His father died when Ndindi was young. Ndindi attended and completed his preparatory education at Gathukeini Primary School and won a placement at Kiaguthu Boys Secondary School, but he could not join the school due to prohibitively high fees. The family enrolled him at Kiambugi Boys Secondary because the school principal was a family friend and would allow for a flexible fee payment plan. Ndindi repaired shoes for his schoolmates at Kiambugi to scrape a living and to add to fee payment. During school holidays, Ndindi burned charcoal and sold second hand clothes to supplement his family's meagre farming income. Ndindi completed his secondary education in 2003 and performed exemplary well in Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations and was the only student in Kiambugi in his year who won a university placement. But Ndindi had to remain in school and work as a librarian in order to offset fee arrears of $300. In 2005, Ndindi joined Kenyatta University for a Bachelor of Arts (Economics). To muddle through harsh financial life, Ndindi set a restaurant near the university, but the business performed dismally and he closed it down. He then secured a part-time job as a stockbroker in Nairobi. While a sophomore, Ndindi was elected as a student leader in Kenyatta University Student Association where he was the Academic Secretary. Thereafter, he served as the Chairman of Murang'a Student Association and Mount Kenya Student Association. Ndindi graduated from Kenyatta University in December 2009.  Business career  Ndindi started Stockbridge Securities while a sophomore at Kenyatta University as he was working part-time for Ngenye Kariuki & Company Stockbrokers. Through apprenticeship by his mentor and the director of the company, Ngenye Kariuki who happened to be Kiharu former member of parliament, Ndindi was introduced to the world of stock brokerage. But his start-up lost many business opportunities due to poor internet connection and after carrying research in Thika where one of his offices was located, Ndindi discovered the internet problem was widespread. In 2010, he then started Afrisec Telecoms as an internet service provider. Today, the firm has 26 employees and its worth is $1.2 million. In 2016, Ndindi co-founded a stock brokerage firm, Investax Capital, and due to conflict of interests, he resigned from Stockbridge Securities and receded his shareholding. Investax Capital is the largest stockbroker agency in Kenya with several branches. Later in 2016, Ndindi started yet another firm, Telesec Africa, to deal with construction, civil works, water engineering and drilling.  Political career  = Early political career = Ndindi's political career began in Kenyatta University when he was elected as a student leader in 2006 to represent over 40,000 students in the University Senate. He served the same student union with his friend John Kaguchia, the Speaker of Nyeri County Assembly, and Maryann Njambi Mugo who unsuccessfully vied for Molo Parliamentary seat on KANU ticket in 2017. Through student politics in Kenyatta University, Ndindi met his friend Senator Mwaura Isaac Maigua (Nominated Senator) and other comrades such as Muchangi Karemba and Kuria Kimani who are Members of Parliament for Runjenjes and Molo respectively. After exiting as a student leader, Ndindi served his district association of university students as the chair and later in Mount Kenya association of university students in the same capacity. In 2013, Ndindi was appointed the Chairperson of Kiharu Constituency Development Fund (CDF), a position he served inconclusively up to 2016 in order to offer a chance to someone else. = Election as Kiharu Constituency MP = In 2017, Ndindi threw his hat into ring for Kiharu Parliamentary Seat when the incumbent Member of Parliament and a buddy Irungu Kang'ata opted not to defend his seat and instead contest for Murang'a County Senate seat. Ndindi trounced 11 competitors and clinched Jubilee Party ticket in the party primaries. In August 2017 general election, Ndindi won as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kiharu constituency after scooping 60,881 votes against his closest competitor who garnered 35,181 votes. Ndindi's win at only 32 years and as a son of peasant farmer was hailed as a remarkable triumph over the big giants such as Kenneth Matiba, Gikonyo Kiano, Kembi Gitura and Ngenye Kariuki that represented the constituency in the past. = Controversial post before Supreme Court ruling over October 2017 repeat poll = On October 24, 2017, Ndindi wrote a tendentious statement on his Facebook page, urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare a state of emergency for six months and suspend the constitution should the Supreme Court of Kenya rule over the scheduled 24 October 2017 repeat presidential poll. He asked the president to rule by the fist and restructure the arms of government by having judiciary as a department within the executive. The Supreme Court had a month earlier nullified August 8, 2017 presidential election results and invalidated re- election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, the repeat election was not halted as the hearing could not proceed due to quorum hitch at the Supreme Court. = Controversial Anti-corruption and Economics Crime Amendment Bill, 2019 = In March 2019, Ndindi proposed a bill in parliament to have those convicted of corruption in Kenya face stringent punishment, including execution. The bill, Anti-corruption and Economics Crime Amendment Bill 2019, which was mooted against the backdrop of unsuccessful sentence of serious economic crime offenders in Kenya, also sought to have corruption cases handled exclusively by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Though Ndindi's proposals had received general support in and out of National Assembly, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga came guns blazing and attributed Ndindi's amendments as a ploy to disempower Directorate of Criminal Investigations and Directorate of Public Prosecutions from handling corruption cases. = Team Tangatanga = Ndindi has distinguished himself as a stalwart supporter and an adherent of Kenya's Deputy President Dr William Ruto, and a figurehead behind Team Tangatanga - a large contingent of Members of Parliament (MPs) that supports William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. Team Tangatanga is seen as a group of dissenters opposed to Uhuru-Raila Handshake (2018 Peace Agreement between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga) due to its politically perceived ramifications of changing Kenya 2010 constitution to substitute the presidential system with parliamentary system and have Raila Odinga as the Prime Minister. Tangataga has its match in a loose political conglomeration called Team Kieleweke that comprises some Members of Parliament drawn from Jubilee Party and a few 2017 general election losers who are opposed to William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. Ndindi and other Tangatanga allied MPs from Mount Kenya region have come to bear brunt of their association with William Ruto who has been accused of engaging in premature presidential campaigns. In July 2019, Ndindi wrote on his Facebook page that there were plans to harass and silence MPs affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto and that he himself had been informed reliably of his imminent arrest. Ndindi said he would not be intimidated since he has 'lived in houses and situations worse than police cells'. Ndindi is a confidante and a key member of Deputy President William Ruto's inner circle and whose admiration for the deputy president, he says, is due to Ruto's humble beginnings. \\"Like Dr Ruto, my father was nobody. He was a poor carpenter and a hustler who only left us with a hammer, a handsaw and nails as inheritance,\\" Ndindi said this to a news reporter in April 2019. In February, 2019, Ruto described Ndindi as 'among the most progressive and development- oriented legislators' in Kenya. = 8 September 2019 fundraiser clash and subsequent arrest = On Sunday, 8 September 2019, Ndindi clashed with Nominated Member of Parliament (MP) Maina Kamanda over protocol in a fundraising ceremony in Gitui Catholic Church in Kiharu when Ndindi insisted on his prerogative to officiate the event as the area MP. An altercation ensued in and outside the church, and the police attempted to arrest Ndindi, but angry supporters shielded him away. Later in the evening, Ndindi found himself marooned inside the studios of Royal Media Services where he had attended a show on Inooro TV as contingent of police officers lay in waiting outside. But he left the media house incognito and surfaced the following morning in Kiangage Primary School in Kiharu on a developmental tour where he castigated Interior Principal Secretary (PS) Karanja Kibicho for misusing police to fight him politically. After playing cat and mouse game with the police, 60 paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) officers were deployed and finally arrested Ndindi at ACK St James Cathedral in Murang'a where he was attending an evening show on Kameme TV alongside two other legislators from Murang'a county. Ndindi was apprehended and detained in Murang'a Police Station on allegations of assaulting police officers, causing disturbance at the church service and resisting arrest during the fundraiser. News of his arrest provoked a storm of protest in Murang'a, and residents poured on the streets at night and lit bonfires, demanding immediate release of the MP. Through intervention of Ndindi's friend and Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata who doubles as a lawyer, Ndindi was freed at midnight. The following morning he appeared in Murang'a Law Court where charges against him were dropped unconditionally. His supporters went wild with jubilation as Ndindi vacated the court accompanied by Senator Irungu Kang'ata, Kandara MP Alice Muthoni Wahome, Gichugu MP Githinji Gichomo, and a swarm of other political leaders. When addressing a multitude of his supporters in Murang'a, Ndindi echoed words of the former Kiharu MP and multi-party democracy activist Kenneth Matiba of 'let the people decide', in reference to the political stance he has taken of supporting Deputy President William Ruto for 2022 presidency, a stand he says, has caused his political persecution. He said this to the media, \\"I'm elected by the people and it is to them I owe allegiance. We must be given space to exercise our free will, and people should not be bulldozed to follow certain political direction. These persecutors must never lie to themselves that they can buy off souls and hearts of poor people with their money. This money in the first place belong to the poor peasants and their families. I am ready to pay the price for what my people and I believe in.\\"  Motivational book: How to Succeed in High School  Ndindi is a publisher of a motivational book, 'How to Succeed in High School which has sold 20,000 copies. He has donated copies of his book to several schools in Kiharu constituency.  Personal life  Ndindi is married to Sophia Wambui. He always concludes his Facebook posts with a declarative 'We are African and Africa is our business.'

Originally conceived as a follow-up to the band's first album, Short Bus that would have been titled Rebus, the project changed course due to the collapse of the Pledge Music crowd funding platform. Despite this, some material from the sessions will still appear in the final release. The album's name was changed to They Got Us Right Where They Want Us, At Each Other's Throats prior to receiving its final name, Murica. The album is scheduled for release in 2020. Background and recording After releasing their seventh studio album, Crazy Eyes (2016), and touring in support of it in 2017, frontman Richard Patrick turned to making new music in 2018. The start of the project was spurred by a particular event; Patrick was attending a Veruca Salt concert which also was being attended by original Filter member Brian Liesegang, who had left the band shortly after the release of their first album, the platinum selling Short Bus (1995) due to creative differences with Patrick. Knowing both were there, Veruca Salt member Louise Post, stopped mid-concert to call both out, stating that they need to \\"bury any bullshit, forget the crap, and get their shit together\\" in regards to making new music together. The two took the message to heart, and decided to work on a new album together. By October 2018, they had announced the concept; the two decided on calling the album Rebus‚Äîan allusion to the only Filter album the two had worked together on‚Äîand centered the album's conception around the idea of recording a follow-up to that album, but with more modern sounds and concepts. The band had planned to procure funding for the album creation process through crowd sourcing platform PledgeMusic. However, the band had gone quiet on the progress of the project through the mid-part of 2019, until July 2019, when Patrick announced that the collaboration with Liesegang had been cancelled due to the bankruptcy of the Pledgemusic company and \\"a variety of other reasons\\". He announced that the scope of the album would be changing - Liesegang would not be working on the album moving forward, and that it had changed names to They Got Us Right Where They Want Us, At Each Other's Throats. Despite this, Patrick noted that he still hoped to include three of the songs that he had written Liesegang on the album, titled \\"Murica\\", \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\", and \\"(Command-Z) High As A Muv Fucka\\". Patrick once again went silent on the project until June 2020, where he announced it had been retitled again, to Murica, and that it was scheduled for release by the end of 2020. Themes and composition The track \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\" was described as having a heavy guitar riff similar to that of the heavier song from Filter's Short Bus and The Amalgamut albums. Thematically, it is a politically charged song, criticizing the lack of action towards various modern social issues.

Support for macOS and Linux was added in June 2019. The goal of the game is to obtain the highest score possible in a single session, which can span multiple islands. Players earn points by strategically placing buildings from their inventory onto a procedurally generated island. Earning points restocks the building inventory, eventually unlocking new types of buildings and the ability to move to a new island and continue the session. The session ends when no more points can be gained because no buildings are available or there is no space to place them. Islanders was developed over seven months while the members of Grizzly Games were completing degrees in game design at HTW Berlin. The developers were inspired by a mutual love of city-building games, and chose to embrace simplicity in designing Islanders because of the limitations of working with a small team. Employing procedural generation of new islands enabled them to keep the game's mechanics simple while still providing the player enough variety to make the game engaging for repeat sessions. Critical reception to Islanders was generally positive, with most reviews focusing on the game's minimalist, low poly visuals and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics. In April 2019, it was one of the top twenty best-selling games on Steam. Several video game journalists placed it on lists of favorites for 2019.  Gameplay  A market building being placed, showing potential point gains and losses within its scoring radius. The inventory at the bottom shows all buildings available for placement. At the start of each session, players are presented with a small procedurally-generated island and a pack of basic buildings to place. There are several types of islands, some of which have terrain that restricts the placement of certain buildings. Placing a building earns points, influenced by the natural features and other buildings within its scoring radius. The size of the scoring radius varies between building types. Buildings gain points from being placed near relevant structures, but lose points for incompatible buildings. A circus, for example, gains points for being placed near houses, but loses points for being near mansions. Points are shown in preview before building placement, with gains shown in gold and losses in red. Once placed, buildings cannot be removed or built over, so careful placement and forward planning are important to maximize the score. Earning points refills the player's inventory of buildings and gradually unlocks more advanced building types such as gold mines and resorts, which have higher scoring potential. Scoring points fills up the island gauge at the bottom of the screen; when filled, the player can click on it to move to the next island. The number of points required to restock the inventory and move to new islands increases with each unlock. Players are free to remain on their current island and continue to build and increase their score until they decide to move on. The session ends if the player runs out of buildings to place, or space to place buildings, before unlocking the next island. The player's score is cumulative across all islands in a session, and the overall objective is to reach a high score for the entire session. The game intentionally omits many features common to city-builders, such as resource accumulation, traffic management, and technology research. There are no sidequests or optional objectives, although there is a short list of achievements to earn. The sole multiplayer element is the global high score board that ranks every player's highest-scoring game. Several post-release updates expanded the game with new content. Early updates added new island types and new buildings, such as seaweed farms and monuments, as well as new gameplay features, such as a photo mode that removes the user interface elements to allow for uncluttered screenshots. A sandbox mode added in June 2019 removes the scoring mechanic and provides the players with an unlimited selection of buildings. The same update added an undo button to the regular mode to allow players to remove the last building placed.  Development  Grizzly Games is composed of Paul Schnepf, Friedemann Allmenr√∂der, and Jonas Tyroller, who met during the Bachelor of Arts in Game Design program at HTW Berlin. Schnepf and Allmenr√∂der first worked together on a second-year project, a short experimental game called ROM. Later in their second year, they worked with another student, Shahriar Shahrabi, to develop minimalist wingsuit flight simulator Superflight, founding Grizzly Games as a means to release it. Shahrabi left after Superflights release. During their third year, Tyroller joined Grizzly Games and development began on Islanders. The development of Islanders began with a three-week process of researching, prototyping, and refinement of several concepts. Inspired by a mutual childhood love of city-building games like Anno, The Settlers, and SimCity, the team decided to move forward with the concept that became Islanders. The game had a short development cycle of seven months: four months of major development time, and another three months of refinement and preparation before release. In an interview with Game World Observer, Allmenr√∂der described the game as an evolution of ideas explored in the earlier Superflight, particularly the embrace of minimalism and procedural generation. Because there were only three team members, each had to fill multiple roles in the development process. Rather than struggling against the limits of working with a small team, they adopted simplicity as a design philosophy and decided to create a game that was simple enough to be played in short sessions, but engaging enough to be returned to repeatedly. The game's use of procedural generation had its roots in the development of Superflight. In order to test game mechanics, the developers created a script that quickly assembled new levels from pre-generated blocks. They found that having new levels each time they played kept their experience entertaining without extending development time, so they decided to use the process for Islanders. When developing the mechanics of the game, Allmenr√∂der explained that his team constantly discussed simplifying the systems they were implementing: \\"Every time we made a decision, we asked ourselves: Can we make it simpler? Can the game still be fun if we cut this feature?\\" The gameplay went through various iterations, including one with a day-night cycle, before the team settled on a simple proximity-based scoring system.  Reception  Critical reception to Islanders was largely positive. Reviewers praised the game's intentionally simple mechanics, as well as its minimalist, low-poly visual aesthetic and relaxing soundtrack. It was commercially successful; in April 2019, it was one of the top twenty highest-selling games on Steam. In July 2019, Rock, Paper, Shotgun placed it on a list of the year's best games so far. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku placed the game on his list of the top 10 games of 2019. Paul Tamayo, also of Kotaku, named it as one of the most relaxing games of 2019. In his full review on release, Plunkett called Islanders \\"pure city-building. No fuss, no distractions.\\" Michael Moore at The Verge found that the transformation of pristine natural islands into densely packed settlements reflected \\"humanity's exploitative relationship with nature,\\" and noted that the short time spent building up each island felt \\"like a more honest simulation of how humans actually build cities.\\" Writing for Polygon, Cass Marshall praised the developers' decision to focus on the core gameplay experience, calling it a \\"beautiful example of intent in design.\\" Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun found the game deceptively simple, remarking \\"there‚Äôs a fierce brain throbbing away beneath those sedate low-poly models.\\" Kelly Pask of PCGamesN felt that unlocking new buildings and increasing point combos gave the game a feeling of constant progression while maintaining \\"sandbox purity.\\" James Cunningham of Hardcore Gamer called it \\"the kind of relaxed affair that's more concerned with letting you create than getting lost in the details.\\" Christopher Livingston of PC Gamer highlighted the relaxing play style and suggested the game for players who \\"enjoy city-building but hate dealing with traffic problems.\\" Benja Hiller of German indie magazine Welcome to Last Week felt similarly, remarking that \\"there are no annoying people. Nobody who wags his finger maliciously in front of you and says: Now take care of the road damage.\\" Samuel Guglielmo of TechRaptor enjoyed the art style, which prompted him to place buildings \\"in locations that looked pretty\\" even if it meant scoring fewer points. The game's simplicity did attract criticism from some reviewers. French gaming site enjoyed the color palette and \\"soft and relaxing shapes\\" of the game's models, as well as the selection of achievements that could be earned. However, their reviewer found that the single-song soundtrack quickly became repetitive and wished there were more objectives aside from simply earning points. Guglielmo similarly found the soundtrack limited. Alessandro Barbosa of Critical Hit found the lack of an undo button at launch frustrating, but overall found the game \\"immensely satisfying.\\" Rogan Chahine of Indie Game Website found the game simplistic, but called it an excellent choice for players \\"with a few minutes to spare.\\" Rahul Shirke of IND13 wished for an option to choose the size or type of island, as he found repeatedly working through basic island types at the start of each round \\"a waste of time when you just want to get to the more spacious islands.\\" Both Nicol√≥ Paschetto of Italian gaming site The Games Machine and Alice Liguori of Rock, Paper, Shotgun were disappointed that the game did not have animated inhabitants to give the islands a sense of life.

He invented several Indian dishes which have since become popular worldwide, including butter chicken, tandoori chicken and dal makhani. He was the founder of the restaurant chain Moti Mahal Delux. Early life Kundan Lal Gujral was born in c.1902 to Diwan Chand Gujral and Maya Devi in Chakwal District of Undivided Punjab, British India. His only brother Chunni Lal died at the age of 18 due to Pneumonia. His father was a cloth merchant. Kundan Lal Gujral completed his matriculation in Pakistan. In c.1920 he started working at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, Pakistan. He married Ram Prakash Devi and was blessed with a son, Nand Lal Gujral on 26 November 1935. In 1947, during the partition of India he migrated with his family to India and settled in Delhi. He then went on to start an eatery by the name of Moti Mahal in Daryaganj, Delhi. Known for Kundan Lal Gujral is known for the famous culinary inventions such as tandoori chicken, butter chicken and dal makhani. =The invention of tandoori chicken= Gujral started as a chef in a small restaurant owned by Mokha Singh Lamba in Gora Bazaar, Peshawar, Pakistan. He experimented by skewering yogurt marinated pieces of chicken and sticking them into the tandoor (which was previously used only for Breads). This experiment led to the famous dish tandoori chicken. Tandoori chicken is another popular dish in Indian restaurants around the world. =The invention of butter chicken= To avoid the wastage of the leftover or not sold tandoori tikkas (marinated pieces of chicken cooked in a tandoor) and due to the lack of refrigeration facilities at that time, Gujral added tomato gravy with butter and cream to the tandoori tikkas to soften the chicken so that he can sell it again the other day. This culinary accident led to the famous butter chicken. Today, butter chicken is the most popular curries in Indian restaurants around the world. =The invention of dal makhani= Gujral is also known for inventing dal makhani which is a mildly spiced pulses curry made with the combination of tangy tomatoes, butter, and rich cream. This combination of mixed spices and dairy products is known as famous dal makhani.  Legacy  After having fled Pakistan, Kundan Lal Gujral settled in Delhi and opened a small dhaba (roadside eatery) to introduce Delhiites to the tandoori chicken. He bought a small space in Daryaganj and set up Moti Mahal. The place quickly proved popular and within a year Kundan Lal Gujral bought the adjoining area, turning his eatery into a 400 seat restaurant. Dignitaries like former Indian Prime Ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, former Indian President Dr. Zakir Hussain, actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev are among the famous patrons. He served his iconic dishes, the butter chicken and the dal makhani here. Later in 1970's Kundan Lal son, Nand Lal Gujral expanded Moti Mahal in South Delhi to establish Moti Mahal Delux chain of restaurants. Currently, Kundan Lal Gujral‚Äôs grandson, Monish Gujral has instituted Moti Mahal Delux Management Services in 2003 by expanding the business into franchises across India. Today, it has grown from a small restaurant in Old Delhi to a modern eating chain with more than 150 franchises in India and worldwide.

A majority stake is held by Natural Le Coultre S.A. of art dealer and shipper Yves Bouvier. The facility opened in May 2010 in a duty-free zone near Singapore's Changi Airport and is modelled after similar institutions in Geneva and Luxembourg. The Freeport has been on sale since 2017, although no buyer has yet been found.  History  The Freeport concept was pioneered by Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier through his art shipping company Natural Le Coultre, who also founded the Freeports in Geneva and Luxembourg. Following the success of the concept in Europe, Bouvier expanded it to Asia in the early 2000s at a time when Singapore was beginning to implement a series of laws that increased banking secrecy, strengthened trusts and reduced taxes in order to develop into a global hub for private banking. At the same time, banking secrecy was rolled back in Switzerland, following greater scrutiny on the country's role as a tax haven. Bouvier and diamond dealer Alain Vandenborre are both shareholders in the Singapore Freeport. The facility is also supported by various Singaporean institutions and authorities, including the city-state's Economic Development Board and Singapore Customs, and is supervised by the Singapore Police as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. It is also closely monitored through regular assessments by organizations such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Ministry of Home Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance because of the potential risk of money laundering and terrorist financing activities posed by the Freeport.  The facility  The Freeport building was designed by architects and security experts from Switzerland. Owing to its security features, the facility has been described as \\"part bunker, part gallery\\" and \\"Singapore‚Äôs Fort Knox for fine art and collectibles.\\" The Freeport's interior features furniture by contemporary designers Ron Arad and Johanna Grawunder. Covering 30,000 square meters, the facility sports climate-controlled storage rooms. Among its most prominent corporate clients was auction house Christie's, which rented more than a third of the Freeport's storage space until it pulled out in 2018, and Deutsche Bank, which used it to store gold bullion worth $8.9 billion but stated it is no longer a customer there. The Freeport has been credited as one reason, besides the government's exempting of investment-grade precious metals trading from goods and services tax, that Singapore has been slowly reclaiming its role as a physical gold trading hub. According to Bloomberg, the Freeport has reportedly accumulated losses of S$14.4 million over about ten years until 2018, and any potential buyer would inherit a S$20 million debt to Singapore's largest bank, DBS Group Holdings. Just like the Geneva and Luxembourg facilities, the Singapore freeport, as the entire freeport concept, has been called into question since the Bouvier Affair, in which Yves Bouvier allegedly misrepresented the cost of artworks and subsequently overcharged clients. A 2018 European Commission report also observed that freeports increased in demand as banks began fighting illegal financial activities, making them potential hotspots for financial crime. = Alleged role in illicit financial activities =  2013 Economist article  An article published by The Economist in 2013 named the Singapore Freeport as one of such facilities possibly used by ultra-rich elites to evade taxes thanks to the facility's confidentiality. This prompted Singapore Customs to demand the Freeport's management to respond to The Economist‚Äôs claims. The Freeport denied the truthfulness of the article.  2014 NRA Report  A 2014 National Risk Assessment Report by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) identified the Freeport as a potential risk for illicit financial activities. Company Chairman Tony Reynard at that time denied this possibility, stating that \\"all operations at the Singapore Freeport are under the supervision of Singapore Customs, which can access anything at any time.\\" However, Freeport managers have admitted to having no knowledge of what is being stored inside the facility due to the strict policy of discretion with the clients.  2016 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report  In its 2016 mutual evaluation report on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, the FATF identified the Freeport as \\"as an emerging risk to consider\\" as it presented \\"a medium to high\\" money-laundering and terrorist-financing risk. The report further noted that \\"The relevant authorities‚Ä¶did not demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of what activities were being undertaken in the Singapore Freeport.\\"  Storage of looted objects  In 2016, a UNESCO report on the protection of cultural heritage sites identified the Freeports in Geneva, Luxembourg and Singapore as a ‚Äúpossible problem for the protection of cultural property and its illicit trafficking‚Äù and warned that these facilities could be used \\"to store works of art from thefts, lootings or illicit excavations for resale in the black market...even many years later.\\"  References   External links  * Official website  See also  * Geneva Freeport * Luxembourg Freeport Category:Free ports Category:Buildings and structures in Singapore Category:Tax avoidance Category:Offshore finance ","title":"Singapore Freeport"},{"id":"61423990","text":"Shammetovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Akkuzevsky Selsoviet, Ilishevsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

It was also used for direction-finding and positioning for navigational purposes and for detecting atmospheric events for battlefield weather prediction. Development and Design Infrasound is the area of acoustics that deals with frequencies below the audible region of human hearing. For army infrasound applications, the target frequency range was in the 1-20 Hz band. Infrasound has the ability to reach distances of 100-500 km. There are natural sources of infrasound emissions, such as avalanches, tornados, volcanoes, earthquakes and man-made sources of infrasound, such as aircraft engines, helicopters, artillery, ship engines, bombs, and explosions. Because there were so many different sources of infrasound, methods of detecting were of interest for the military and civilians. Long distance propagation of infrasound is allowed by ground reflection and molecular attenuation. The ground acts as a reflecting service for incoming energy and molecular attenuation is zero at infrasonic frequencies. The infrasonic sensing array contained a minimum variance distortion-less response beam former to enhance the detection and estimation performance of the acoustic system by improving the signal to noise ratio. The outputs of a spatially distributed array of sensors were combined by the beam former, where the signals from one direction were added, while the effects of noise and interference from other directions were reduced. The main obstacle in the detection and analysis of infrasonic signals was the intrinsic pressure fluctuations due to air turbulence/wind noise, which was always present. Wind noise, caused by the passage of air over the microphone, limited the ability to collect infrasonic signature in a covert area. Wind noise levels increased with decreasing frequency and mean noise levels could have been equal or greater than the levels of the signal to be detected. To solve this problem, signal processing, physical wind guards/filters, multiple sensors for spatial averaging, and wind hose/pipe filtering techniques could have been used. It was shown that wind barriers could be used for wind noise reduction as they break up turbulence and effectively preform spatial average on turbulence scales smaller than the size of the barrier. Microporous hoses stemming from a central microphone were used for applications where the source direction is unknown. These hoses make the filter‚Äôs instrument response and wind‚Äìnoise reduction uniform for all signals and wind directions, simplifying the array process. Applications Infrasonic sensing arrays supported the U.S. Army‚Äôs 501st Military Intelligence Brigade in South Korea, fielded in 2001. It was also fielded to Iraq and Afghanistan in 2004. Information obtained with the research of infrasonic sensing arrays lead to the development of The Unattended Transient Acoustic MASINT Sensor (UTAMS) computer carried by the Aerostat of Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS), which was an acoustic sensor used to detect the point of origin and the point of impact of missiles, IEDs, and missiles. Other applications included use by military or search and rescue teams, by field researchers studying volcanology or seismology, and by other geo-acoustic scientists and engineers. Infrasound sensing systems were used for the global monitoring of international compliance with weapon test ban treaties. Military use also involved long-range detection and direction- finding of air or ground vehicles, and detecting and locating artillery fire.

He appears for the first time in \\"Part II\\" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a background character. He, along with its first leader Hashirama Senju, is one of the co-founders of village from the ninja world . Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent. He transplants his eye power into a child named Nagato, the public leader of the terrorist organization Akatsuki, to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the primary antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including a Boruto feature film. Many Naruto video games have featured him as a playable character. Kishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, Naoya Uchida voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, Neil Kaplan provides Madara's voice with Xander Mobus voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario. Creation and design Madara originated from Masashi Kishimoto's desire to elaborate on the ending to the manga series Naruto. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as \\"Part II\\" in the manga and Shippuden in the anime, Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki and in turn Madara as their enemies. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains \\"flamboyant\\" was one of the \\"guiding principles\\" he followed. It was his desire, to create villains with \\"powerful aura\\". Madara appears late in the manga, as one of the masterminds leading to the fourth shinobi world war, in the final arc. Nevertheless, he wanted to make him an engaging antagonist who would clash with Sasuke Uchiha and the creature known as the Ten-Tailed Beast to give the storyline a proper conclusion. According to Kishimoto, Madara is not just like any other character introduced in the series. He created Madara as a character with no weaknesses. As one of the antagonists in the story, Kishimoto designed Madara as the antithesis to the protagonists' values, a perfect anti-hero. Kishimoto also said Naruto always defeated his enemies without intending to kill them by settling disputes with words since his battle with Nagato. Naruto, truly forgave his enemy, instead of having the protagonist kill them, which Kishimoto liked but no shonen manga truly followed. Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more interesting and challenging, rather than killing them. So from the Nagato battle onwards, he decided to introduce the resurrected Madara to have someone to beat. According to Kishimoto, this was one of the reasons why he introduced Edo-Madara into the storyline. But he confessed this was complicated at first. It ended up with confusion about the difference between the two characters. Japanese voice actor Naoya Uchida enjoyed voicing Madara's character, most notably in his final recording where he sent regards to fellow actor Kazuhiko Inoue (Kakashi Hatake) and Wataru Takagi (Obito Uchiha). Neil Kaplan first voiced Madara in the video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. Because CyberConnect2's fighting game's storyline preceded the television series' plot, he was asked by their staff to read the series' manga to get an idea of the character. Kaplan said this made it difficult for him to voice Madara for the first time. Appearances =In Naruto= Madara is mentioned in the second part of the manga Naruto but does not appear in most of the series except the war arc. During his childhood, he met a child named Hashirama, but amidst the conflicts of their respective clans resulting in war, their friendship ends. After failing at several attempts to kill or defeat his rival, Madara became friends with him and accepted his treaty offering peace between the two clans. The Uchiha, Senju and all of their affiliated clans came together to form a village, which Madara named Konohagakure. Madara took a merciless approach and did not like Hashirama's compassionate methods. After the death of his brother, Izuna, Madara became cynical and vengeful and held a grudge against the Senju Clan for slaughtering his brothers in the War. After his defection from Konoha, he believed there is no real peace. Losing all of his family and conflicted over his own clanmates, he decided to free the world from its pains, by casting upon the whole world so that there would be no war and no death. Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama's hand, but he survives and goes into hiding. He awakens the legendary Eye Technique Rinnegan using Hashirama's DNA. Before dying, Madara takes Obito as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. After Madara's death, his greatest lasting influence was on Obito, one of his descendants, who used Madara's knowledge to create Akatsuki. When Obito moves into the final stages of Madara's goal by initiating the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kabuto Yakushi forms an alliance with him, eventually reviving Madara's reanimated corpse. By nightfall, Madara releases himself from Kabuto's contract and rebounds his soul to the modified immortal body enabling him to act on his own will. Madara decides to reclaim the Nine- Tails creature sealed within Naruto and defeats the Kages, only to reunite with Obito while he is engaged in combat with the shinobis. Madara fully resurrects himself by sacrificing defeated the Obito, ordering Black Zetsu to take control over Obito's body and perform the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique. Restored to life, Madara unlocks his full potential and manages to break free of his restraints. Defeating his enemies, Madara goes after the Tailed beasts to revive Ten-Tails. Madara is then confronted by Might Guy, Minato Namikaze, Gaara and Rock Lee who each use all of their forces to kill him but fail. Before killing most of his enemies, Madara is confronted by the healed Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha who overwhelm him. Madara is forced to escape and regain Obito's Rinnegan. Upon returning to the field, Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The entire world becomes trapped in the dream. Sasuke manages to save Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura from this Illusionary Technique, and Black Zetsu stabs Madara, gaining control over his body. Black Zetsu reveals that it was never Madara's will but Kaguya's Madara swells in size, Kaguya taking his place. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi manage to seal Kaguya, who reverts into ten tails before being sealed spitting out Madara. Eventually, Madara dies because of the toll of both the tailed beasts and Demonic Statue removed from his body. In his final moments, Madara finds real peace within the dreams of Hashirama, stating that his dream for peace has died while Hashirama's dream for peace lives on and will always keep living on as it is the better of the two. Before dying, he acknowledges the friendship of Hashirama and agrees with him when he said, that they are still friends despite everything. =In other media= Madara appears in the original video animation Hashirama Senju vs. Madara Uchiha (2012); Obito narrates the origin of Konoha. In the beginning, ninja fought for their own clans. The most powerful among them are two clans: the Senju led by Hashirama, and the Uchiha led by Madara. This was distributed as part of the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Although Obito impersonates Madara, the character made his debut in a video game in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. His Ten-Tailed Beast Host incarnation also appears in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. In The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), Madara appears for a brief moment to be seen fighting with Hashirama They are depicted as the reincarnation of Indra and Ashura, which gradually leads to the final battle between Sasuke and Naruto. Madara also appears in the iOS and Android mobile game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing. Apart from the Naruto games, the character also appears in the crossover fighting games J-Stars Victory VS and Jump Force as downloadable content. Several merchandise items based on Madara have been released, including key chains, action figures, and many more items. Reception Madara has been a popular character from the Naruto series. He is featured in most of the powerful anime character lists from different anime reviewers. Comic Book Resources listed him third on their list of \\"25 Most Powerful Anime Villains\\", praising his strength. Comic Book Resources also featured him on their list of \\"10 Anime Characters Who Got Stronger After Coming Back From The Dead\\" and gave him the ninth spot. Comic Vine rated him 34th on their \\"Top 100 Anime Villains\\" list. TheGamer, a news website focused on video game journalism, however, ranks him at fifth on their list titled \\"Final Form: The 25 Strongest Anime Villains Ever, Officially Ranked\\". Madara is also sixth on Screen Rant's list titled \\"20 Most Powerful Naruto Characters, Ranked\\"; author Bobby Anhalt writes that, \\"Madara Uchiha is a force to be taken seriously.\\" UK Anime Network felt Madara's introduction was one of the franchise's strongest developments not only for the direction he took fight scenes but because of his effect on the main storyline. His next battle against the five Kages, the leaders of each ninja village, also earned acclaim for its execution, making the final story arc more appealing. UK Anime's reviewer also liked Naruto's fight against Obito which began in the same narrative. The Fandom Post praised this fight, noted how each Kage tries to defeat Madara on their own, but he is overwhelming does not care about his rivals. Siliconera enjoyed Madara's moves from the video game Storm 4 based on the his Susanoo technique which was appealing to see in combat. Anime News Network author Amy McNulty, in her review of episode 392 from the anime, writes that Madara has been built up as the ultimate villain for Naruto, and he is living up to that promise. Jason Thompson, also writing for Anime News Network criticized the character calling Madara a \\"jerk\\"; but he liked his perfect Sussano'o, which to him looks cooler than the others and is much more powerful. Madara's origins received a good response. Screen Rant, in their article \\"15 Things You Didn't Know About Madara\\", pointed out that the power that Madara sought eventually took over his innocence that was once a part of him. They also praised some of his good qualities including his ideas about gender, money, and power. While describing his love for his brother Izuna, they compared it with Itachi's for Sasuke. According to Screen Rant, Madara is \\"one of the best evil characters in the series\\". When first seeing Madara's past, The Fandom Post enjoyed the chaos between the Uchiha and Senju clans. Despite fighting through wars, Madara still showed humanity to the point the reviewer hoped for a spin-off based on the war. In its next review, The Fandom Post enjoyed how his relationship with Hashirama was handled. When Hashirama tried offering him peace it gave the series more of a back story as it focused on the characters' past and the founding of the Hidden Leaf village. Another reviewer from the same site noted that these backstories also helped fans understand the chaos that occurred within the Uchiha clan, which was previously explored in the stories of Sasuke and Itachi. Sasuke needed to resolve whether or not to team up with Madara and destroy the ninja world, leading to his decision to stick with Itachi's ideals instead. Some critics disliked the handling of the character. In an article from Screen Rant, titled \\"15 Things Wrong With Naruto We All Choose To Ignore\\", author Daniel Forster criticized Black Zetsu's betrayal to Madara saying he found Kaguya a poor substitute for Madara who was noted for coming across as a well-developed antagonist. Anime News Network's Amy McNulty, however, thinks this is not that annoying, but she is unsure if it's a smart move to stab Madara, a genius, using Zetsu whom he believed was \\"his will incarnate\\". Comic Book Resources author Renaldo Matadeen criticized the handling of Madara as a villain despite appearing late in the story, and found his characterization weak. While agreeing that Kaguya should not have replaced Madara as the final villain for the Shinobi War, Anime UK News felt that Kaguya was more fleshed out in the anime adaptation making her unique in terms of origins compared with Madara's past. Her descendants had a closer relationship with the protagonists, Naruto and Sasuke.

It stands near the hamlet of Le Day and crosses the Orbe. This has been dammed since 1955 by the Le Day dam (Le barrage du Day), which lies 450 m downstream. The double-track bridge is used by TGV Lyria services between Paris and Lausanne on the Lausanne‚ÄìVallorbe line of the RER Vaud (R√©seau express r√©gional vaudois) and the line from Vallorbe to Le Pont in the Vall√©e de Joux with its extension to Le Brassus.  Lattice truss bridge (1870)  The bridge opened by the Jougne-Ecl√©pens Railway (Chemin de fer de Jougne √† Ecl√©pens, JE) in 1870 was a lattice truss construction of wrought iron originally supported by two stone masonry pillars. Their three uneven openings created spans of 36.5 + 56.0 + 23.5 m. It was 5.0 m wide and had a height of 59 m above the valley floor. Because of heavier locomotives and trains it was strengthened in 1899 and 1900. In the 1920s, further strengthening was needed to enable electrification. Extensive research resulted in its reconstruction as a massive arch bridge as the cheapest solution.  Reconstruction as a stone arch bridge (1925)  The viaduct of Le Day was therefore rebuilt from 1923 to 1925 before the Grandfey Viaduct near Fribourg without interruption to traffic. It was also provided with a pedestrian walkway. During the reconstruction project carried out by the SBB under the direction of Adolf B√ºhler, arches for the new bridge were first built into the existing openings below the iron superstructure, with the apexes of the arches reaching just below the lower girders of the lattice girders. The falsework was built by Richard Coray. Subsequently, the existing superstructure was carried by smaller supporting arches based on the pillars. Finally, sections of the iron structure were demolished and the new superstructure was built. The bridge, which had a total length of 161.25 m, was given a main span with a clear width of 44.00 m. Nine supporting arches with a clear width of 4.50 m are carried by the main arch. The arches in the different-sized side openings naturally have smaller masses. The slightly overhanging superstructure now has a total width of 8.4 m. The arches are made of natural stone because concrete from the local gravel would not have had sufficient strength and the SBB wanted to avoid a contrast with the existing pillars. Only the parts of the pillars above the footbridge, the supporting arches and the remaining superstructure were built in stamped concrete and then covered with natural stone. The walkway on the longitudinal axis of the bridge was built of reinforced concrete. The two large pillars originally stood above the streambed. Their pedestals have been in the water since the construction of the Barrage du Day.

Work and reception Selvin's art has included intimate, domestic-related ceramic pieces and still lifes, more expansive mixed-media tableaux, and large-scale outdoor installations. Writers identify the following as characteristic of her work: abstracted, minimal forms that serve as sites to explore painting and composition as much as structure;Baizerman, Suzanne. \\"Still Life in Clay,\\" Oakland Museum Magazine, Spring 2002, p. 16. purposeful investigation of the vessel form, often in relief-sculpture-like and spartan arrangements;Berkeley Art Center. Local Treasures: Bay Area Ceramics (Catalogue), Berkeley, CA: Berkeley Art Center, 2012. a loose, tactile, unconventional approach to surface and materials, including what American Ceramics described as \\"an almost primal emphasis on process over product\\"; and a rejection of functionality, enabling intellectual engagement with themes involving the history of utilitarian objects, domestic space, contemplation of the quotidian, and the passage of time. Selvin draws on diverse influences in her work, from early Japanese pottery to the California Clay Movement artists and Abstract Expressionists (particularly their emphasis on spontaneity, materials, and the dissolution of boundaries between surface and form) to less evident sources, such as the austere, slice- of-life photography of Walker Evans. Nancy Selvin, Quilted Teapot #1, ceramic and mixed media, 5.875\\" x 7.5\\" x 7.25\\", 1978. Smithsonian American Art Museum collection. =Early work (1970s and 1980s)= Selvin's early work focused on intimately scaled, nonfunctional houseware forms as a format to explore more complex aesthetic and thematic concepts such as abstraction, form and function, and domestic rituals. These free-standing, hand-built vessels often featured large handles, unconventional finishes, and trompe l'oeil details. In her \\"Quilted Teapot\\" series, she disguised the solidity of clay by slumping and creasing it to create pots in the form of patchwork quilts, which she finished with airbrushed china paint, glaze, decorative decals and images of her surrounding environment.Hammel, Lisa. \\"Craftsmen Offer a Toast To Those with a Taste For the Unconventional,\\" The New York Times, June 25, 1977. Retrieved July 17, 2018. Described in The New York Times as \\"whimsical multicolor confections,\\" the teapots convey anthropomorphic qualities as well as freighted cultural, social and feminine associations in their decoration.Levin, Elaine. \\"Ceramic Metaphors,\\" Artweek, December 26, 1981.Anable, Anne. \\"The Art of Drinking,\\" The New York Times, June 26, 1977. Retrieved July 17, 2018. At this time, Selvin also produced handmade paper works that embedded ribbons and lace and clay wall pieces that reproduced arrangements of paper, tape and cardboard. In the early 1980s, Selvin's work evolved in a more formal, painterly direction away from freestanding objects and toward arrangements suggesting Western still lifes, expanses of landscape, and Asian craft traditions. Her \\"Teabowl\\" series (1981‚Äì2) offered spare, rhythmic, arrangements of simple elements engaging form, plane and line: chunky, squared ceramic tea bowls and thin rods of colored glass set on pearlescent, angled, lacquered trays. Surfaces came to the fore, with glaze (unexpectedly on the bowl interiors) and lacquer surfaces that echoed one another (as did the bowl and tray shapes, the latter sometimes functioning like shadows); matte exteriors with airbrushed layers of splatters provided a contrast to the glisten of the glazes, which sometimes oozed over the bowl lips like cake frosting.Levin, Elaine. The History of American Ceramics: 1607‚ÄìPresent, New York: Abrams, 1988. Los Angeles Times critic Suzanne Muchnic noted Selvin's \\"poetic sensibility and use of seductive color,\\" which she wrote enabled the work to tow a line \\"between the honest earthiness of exposed clay and the precious refinement of lacquer over wood.\\" Nancy Selvin, Still Life: Raku and Steel, raku ceramic and steel, 46.5\\" x 12.125\\" x 15.25\\", 1997. Oakland Museum collection. =Still lifes and constructions (1988‚Äì )= In the late 1980s, Selvin began creating larger tableaux of ceramic objects in minimal contexts that referenced architecture and domestic space. While this work was more personal and sometimes suggestive of narrative (with the introduction of enigmatic text, as in Rough White, detail), formal concerns of composition, color and surface, as well as process, continued to dominate.Levin, Elaine. \\"Ceramic Still-Life: The Common Object,\\" Ceramic Art and Perception, No. 32, 1998, p. 52‚Äì58. The constructions often took the form of rows and arrays of hand-built, pared-down bottle, oil-can, bowl and book forms emphasizing silhouette over three-dimensionality; their irregular, leaning \\"postures\\" evoked anthropomorphic qualities‚Äîparticularly in groupings where differences registered‚Äîrendering them both familiar and foreign.Clowes, Jody. \\"Nancy Selvin,\\" American Craft, August/September 1992, p. 72-73. Selvin arranged them on ledges, double-sashed wood windows and custom tables made from building-supply materials that she treated as equal design components.Brin, David M. \\"Nancy Selvin's Abstracted Forms,\\" Ceramic Art and Perception, No. 33, 1998, p. 19‚Äì21.Dickensheets, Scott. \\"Great Bowls of Fire,\\" Las Vegas Weekly, October 12, 1999. Nancy Selvin, Rough White, mixed media, 2003 (detail). Selvin painted her forms loosely with underglaze (rather than glazing them overall), in order to explore color apart from form and to meld color and texture. The resulting work features a wide range of material and surface contrasts (exposed raw clay, ghostly layers of matte underglaze, fragmented text, splattered glaze, slate, metal, chalky drywall) and visible processes (expressionistic gouges and brushstrokes, seams, screened images, pencil markings, incised lines) that both individuate and unify the pieces and also draw in the viewer.Pomento, Dawn. \\"Nancy Selvin at Charleston Heights Art Center Gallery,\\" Artweek, December 1999, p. 27. Curator Suzanne Baizerman wrote that this approach lent Selvin's work, such as Still Life: Raku and Steel (1997), both a sense of thoughtful contemplation‚Äîin their minimal forms and compositions‚Äîand unstudied spontaneity, expressed through rustic surfaces and gestural brushstrokes. Initially, Selvin worked with saturated colors that muted the effects of light and shadow; her pieces from the late 1990s onward were increasingly painterly and adopted more limited palettes, often of earthy yellow, white and cream tones. Reviewers describe Selvin's still lifes as both poetic and meticulously ordered, likening them to haiku and the bottle paintings of Giorgio Morandi; curator Mary Davis MacNaughton called it \\"quiet, understated work [that] encourages us to look for the visual beauty in everyday objects.\\" Others note a vacillation between completion and dissolution, and evolution and decay, suggesting a timeless quality, like relics unearthed from an archaeological site rather than created. Selvin's conscious stripping of practicality from her objects‚Äîplugged bottles, illegible labels, \\"books\\" without pages to turn, impractical tables‚Äîis a key component of the work, moving it beyond utilitarian and purely formal concerns to engage in metaphorical, often wry explorations of form, function and art, and appearance, illusion and reality.

In addition to her vessel still lifes, Selvin has created ceramic, book-like works combining enigmatic imagery and fragmentary text that recall ancient cuneiform tablets and explore narrative and abstraction.Hanessian, Holly. \\"Contemporary Codex: Ceramics and the Book,\\" Contemporary Codex: Ceramics and the Book (Catalogue), Mount Pleasant, MI: Central Michigan University, 2004.Rousseau, Claudia. \\"Artifice vs. Reality: Ceramic books at Pyramid Atlantic,\\" Gazette.net, July 13, 2005.Morrisroe, Julia. \\"Once Upon a Time: Narrative, Metaphor and the Artist Book,\\" Contemporary Codex: Ceramics and the Book (Catalogue), Mount Pleasant, MI: Central Michigan University, 2004. She has also produced large, abstract gouache-on-paper drawings that critics describe as luminous, textured with scratches, smears and blotches, and simultaneously simple and monumental. In the later 2010s, Selvin has turned to large, free-standing, hand and slab-built terra cotta jars and urns that sometimes reference women Abstract Expressionists, such as Trophy: Helen (Frankenthaler) (2016). Artist-writer Julia Couzens described this work as plainspoken and evocative of homespun quality, simple elegance, and the patina of use as a visceral record of time.Couzens, Julia. \\"Of Fire, Slippage, and Tender Edges: the ceramic art of Tony Marsh, Nancy Selvin, and Linda Sormin,\\" Exhibition essay, San Francisco, CA: Patricia Sweetow Gallery, 2019.

History Map of the area of the district of Vila Leopoldina in 1894, by E. Richter e Cia. To the right, the area of the (future) Regulator Warehouse is identified as belonging to Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana. Besides the railway crosses the region west to district of Lapa, which was created in 1894 with the name of Vila Leopoldina, not any station, stop, or derivative installation was built until 1925, when the recent founded S√£o Paulo Coffee Institute built a Coffee Regulator Warehouse next to Km 11 of the main Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana track, in an area given by the company. Next to the warehouse, a small traffic control checkpoint was built, as some commuter trains stopped there occasionally, besides the Km 11 post wasn't a station. On 12 October 1926, a misplaced track switch key made a N2 night train (with 11 cars), going from the countryside to S√£o Paulo terminal, to enter a detour in the Regulator Warehouse and crash with a coffee cargo train. The accident left 3 deaths and 38 wounded. The railway traffic head, Lu√≠s Orsini, attributed the accident to a failure in the switch keys. In 1937, the warehouse was bought by Sorocabana and worked until mid-1960s, when part of it was transferred to the General Warehouses Company of the State of S√£o Paulo (CAGESP) and another part was given back to ICESP, being renamed Regulator Warehouse No. 27, with . In 1969, the warehouse was returned to CESP, which demolishes it, rebuilding in its place two warehouses with a total area of , and its rail branches were deactivated. With the construction of Jurubatuba Branch (current CPTM Line 9-Emerald) in 1957, it was, for a time, the initial station of the branch. Besides the passengers movement growth boarding and leaving in the post of Km 11, it was promoted to the category of a stop, renamed Imperatriz Leopoldina. Until 1962, the station access had precarious pavimentation, obligating the prefecture to fix it in that year. After a commuter riot, angry with a failure, the stop was destroyed and Sorocabana was obligated to improve its installations, being reopened in 1966. In 1977, a bidding for the FEPASA stations remodeling was published, and Imperatriz Leopoldina was promoted to the category of station, being reopened on 25 January 1979. =Projects= When projected by the consortium Engevix/Sofrerail in 1973, the building of Imperatriz Leopoldina station aimed to attend the demand of a region with industrial zone. In the 1990s, many industries left Vila Leopoldina and its hangars were demolished and replaced by residential condominiums. In 2004, CPTM hired a new project for the station, won by the companies EGT Engenharia Ltda. and Copen Engenharia Ltda, by the cost of R$ 567,693.00 (US$ ). On June 2007, the project was presented in public audiences, almost reaching the deadline for the beginning of the construction, but it never began.

Biography Cecil Spooner was born on January 29, 1875, in New York City. Her mother, Mary Gibbs Spooner, ran a theater in Brooklyn. Spooner made her New York theater debut in 1903 in My Lady Peggy Goes to Town, adapted from the 1901 novel of the same name by Frances Aymar Mathews. She continued to appear on Broadway throughout the decade. Spooner married Charles E. Blaney, who had written several of the Broadway plays in which she appeared, in 1909. That same year, Spooner made her motion picture debut in the Edison Studios adaptation of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper. Spooner played the roles of the prince, Edward, and the pauper, Tom Canty. She was praised by a reviewer for Moving Picture World for her ability to convey the distinctions between the two characters. In 1914, Spooner wrote, directed, and starred in the silent film Nell of the Circus. On December 9, 1914, Spooner was arrested at the Bronx theater that she managed for \\"indecency.\\" The police and the local community had taken offense to the play Spooner had opened the night before, The House of Bondage, and its treatment of \\"white slavery,\\" a euphemistic term for sex trafficking. Spooner was released into the custody of her lawyer; she revised the play twice to remove the \\"objectionable\\" content, but the show ran for only eight performances and was reviewed negatively by theater critics. Spooner appeared in several films in the early 1920s, and she returned to Broadway in the late 1920s and early 30s. Her last known acting role was in a 1950 episode of the TV show The Lone Ranger. Cecil Spooner died on May 13, 1953, in Sherman Oaks, California.

He was the son of William Livingstone, minister of Kilsyth, and afterwards of Lanark, said to be a descendant of the fifth Lord Livingston. His mother was Agnes, daughter of Alexander Livingston, portioner, Falkirk, brother of the Laird of Belstane. He was educated at Stirling High School and graduated with an M.A. at the University of Glasgow in 1621. Against his father's wish, he preferred to enter the ministry rather than adopt the life of a country gentleman. He studied theology at St Andrews, and was licensed in 1625. For a time he assisted the minister of Torphichen, and was afterwards chaplain to the Countess of Wigtown at Cumbernauld. While engaged in the latter capacity he took part in the memorable revival at the Kirk of Shotts. He declined presentations to several parishes, chiefly on account of his reluctance to obey the Five Articles of Perth. In 1630 he went to Ireland, on the invitation of Viscount Clandeboye, and became minister of Killinchy, County Down, being ordained by Andrew Knox, Bishop of Raphoe, and a company of Scottish ministers who had taken up a kind of middle position between Presbyterianism and Prelacy. In 1631 he was suspended for nonconformity, but was soon reinstated through the friendly offices of Archbishop Ussher. Unfortunately he had a bitter enemy in Robert Echlin, the Bishop of Down and Connor. On 4 May 1632 Echlin had him deposed and excommunicated for the same cause. Having resolved to emigrate to America, he left Ireland in September 1636, along with a number of his parishioners and other Scottish and English Puritans ‚Äî 140 in all. They sailed for New England in the Eagle Wing, but through contrary winds were obliged to return home. In 1638 he signed the National Covenant, and was commissioned to proceed to London with copies of it for supporters of the Scottish cause at Court. On 5 July 1638 he was admitted minister of Stranraer, where he remained for ten years. It is recorded that his half-yearly communions there were attended by as many as five hundred of his old parishioners of Killinchy. In 1640 he was chaplain of the Earl of Cassillis's Regiment in England, and wrote an account of the skirmish at Newburn, which he had witnessed. When minister of Stranraer he frequently crossed to Ulster, and officiated to the Scottish troops quartered there. In 1648 the Commission of Assembly sent him to dissuade those troops from joining with the army of the \\"Engagement,\\" but his mission was a failure. On 13 July 1647, William, Earl of Lothian, presented Livingston to Ancram, and he was admitted and installed on 25 April 1648. He was a member of the Commission of Assembly in 1649. Next year he was one of those appointed to negotiate with Charles II., at Breda, as to the terms on which he should receive the Crown. While the royal ships were lying at anchor off Speymouth, Livingston obtained the King's oath of fidelity to the Covenants. He did not, however, trust Charles, and soon afterwards he identified himself with those who opposed the coronation and the conduct of the government. He was asked by the General Assembly of 1650 to write a History of the Church of Scotland from 1638, but this was never completed. In October 1651 he was chosen Moderator of a general meeting of the Protesters. He preached before Cromwell in London in 1654, and was authorised by the Protector to recommend candidates for vacant parishes. Between 1655 and 1659 he declined calls to Antrim, to his former charge at Killinchy, and to Glasgow. He was summoned before the Privy Council 11 December 1662, the same day as Robert Traill, and, refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance, was banished. He went to Rotterdam in April 1663, where he spent his last years in almost constant study, and in the preparation of a Latin version of the Scriptures which was never published. He died 9 August 1672. He is described as having been \\" modest in manner, sweet in temper, of retired and contemplative habits; so that, though he joined the more extreme Presbyterians, in his moderation he deeply lamented the division that had torn the Church asunder.

Plaque to the John Livingston at Stranraer Ancrum Market Cross Livingston's portrait Rotterdam 1649 by Joan Blaeu Rotterdam Stairs 1652 John Livingstone (1603‚Äì1672), Scottish divine, was born in Monyabroch now known as Kilsyth, Stirlingshire, on 21 January 1603. His father was William Livingstone, minister of that parish and afterwards of Lanark, who was descended from the fifth Lord Livingstone, and his mother was Agnes Livingstone, of the house of Dunipace. He was educated at the grammar school of Stirling by Mr William Wallace, studying Latin and Greek, and stayed there from 1613 until 1617 when he was called to Lanark as his mother was dying. In his first year he was often beaten, once being hit in the face by a ruler. He was persuaded to stay and extra year at school and this was largely self study and was the most profitable he says. At Stirling he took the Lord's Supper in Mr Patrick Simson's church which initially caused him to tremble. He continued his education at the University of Glasgow, under Boyd of Trochrigg, from where he graduated in 1621. His father wished him to marry and to settle down on an estate which he had purchased, but he resolved to study for the church, and having completed his theological course, received license to preach in 1625. He had been devout from his early years and did not remember, as he tells us in his ‚ÄòAutobiography,‚Äô any particular time of conversion. Early ministry He acted as assistant for a time in the parish of Torphichen, and afterwards as chaplain to the Countess of Wigton. He was in great request as a preacher and was still unordained, when, on the Monday after a communion, on his 27th birthday, in June 1630, he preached in the Kirk of Shotts, Lanarkshire, a sermon which is said to have produced a serious change in five hundred of his hearers. Patrons and parishes were anxious to secure his services, but his refusal to give the promise then required of obedience to the articles of Perth stood in the way of his receiving ordination. He would often preach for less than half an hour which was considered short at the time. Killinche ministry As there was no prospect of a settlement at home, Livingstone went over to Ireland in 1630 on the invitation of Lord Clandeboye, and soon afterwards became minister of Killinshie or Killinchy in the diocese of Down. Livingstone came after being urged by Robert Cunningham, minister of Holywood. He was ordained by some Scottish ministers under the presidency of Andrew Knox, bishop of Raphoe, who, to accommodate his countrymen, omitted those portions of the English ordinal to which they objected. In 1631 Livingstone was suspended for nonconformity by Robert Echlin, the Bishop of Down and Connor, but was restored on the intervention of Archbishop Ussher. A few years later, at the insistence of Bishop Echlin, he was deposed and excommunicated for the same cause. In September 1636 he and other Scots and English puritans to the number of 140 sailed for New England in a ship called the Eagle Wing, which they had built for the purpose. They were chiefly Presbyterians, but some of them inclined to Independency and others to Brownism. There were four Scots ministers on board: Robert Blair, their leader, James Hamilton, Livingstone and John M'Clellan. Meeting with a great storm halfway across the Atlantic, they were obliged to put back, and returned to Lochfergus, where they had embarked nearly two months before. Livingstone soon afterwards went over to Scotland, and when the national covenant was signed in March 1638 he was sent up to London with copies for friends at court. Stranraer ministry In July of that year he was inducted to the parish of Stranraer, where his ministry produced a great impression, and his communions were attended by crowds from Ireland. He was a member of the Glasgow assembly of 1638, and of all subsequent assemblies till 1650, except that of 1640. In that year he went as chaplain of the Earl of Cassilis's regiment to Newcastle, and was present at the skirmish of Newburn, of which he wrote an account. He and other Scots who returned from Ireland formed the nucleus of an extreme party, which introduced innovations previously unknown in Scotland, such as the omission of the Lord's Prayer, creed, and ‚ÄòGloria Patri‚Äô in public worship. These novelties were condemned by the early covenanting assemblies, but soon spread and gradually leavened the whole lump. During his ministry at Stranraer Livingstone frequently spent some months of the summer in Ulster, supplying vacant charges or officiating to the Scottish troops quartered there. In 1648 the commission of the assembly sent him to dissuade these troops from obeying the order of the Scottish estates to join the army then being raised in support of the ‚ÄòEngagement,‚Äô but in this mission he was not successful. Ancrum ministry In August of that year he was translated to the parish of Ancrum, Roxburghshire, on the presentation of the Earl of Lothian. He was one of the commissioners appointed by the church to treat with Charles II at Breda in 1650, and while the ships conveying the royal party were lying at anchor off Speymouth, on their return to Scotland, Livingstone received the king's oath of fidelity to the covenants. He did all this most reluctantly, not believing in the king's sincerity, and he afterwards joined the ultra-rigid party who opposed Charles's coronation and administration of the government. His party soon protested against the resolutions of the church that those who had taken part in the ‚ÄòEngagement‚Äô might, on making professions of penitence, be allowed to serve in defence of the country. With his friends, Livingstone subsequently disowned the authority of the general assembly, and formed the first schism in the reformed church. He was elected moderator of the meeting of protesters held in October 1651, but he was among the less resolute of the party, and withdrew from their councils when he recognised their dangerous tendency. After Cromwell had put an end to the meetings of the general assembly, Livingstone resolved to introduce a system for managing Scottish ecclesiastical affairs similar to that of the ‚Äòtryers‚Äô in England, and sent for Livingstone and two other protesters to secure their co-operation. ‚ÄòBeing at London,‚Äô he says, ‚ÄòI found no great satisfaction, and therefore I left the other two there and came home.‚Äô After the Restoration he was called before the privy council, and on refusing to take the oath of allegiance because of its Erastian terms, was banished. Following his banishment there was an incident in his parish at Ancrum when a Mr. James Scott, a person under sentence of excommunication, was presented to the charge. On the day fixed for his settlement in the parish, several people met to oppose it, and particularly a countrywoman desiring to speak with him, with the view of dissuading him from intruding himself upon a reclaiming people, pulled him by the cloak, entreating him to hear her a little; on which he turned and beat her with his staff. This provoked a number of boys to throw a few stones, but which did not touch him or any of his company. The occurrence was, however, magnified into a great offence, and the sheriff and justices fined and imprisoned some of the people. But the punishment being deemed too lenient, the offenders were taken to Edinburgh, and dealt with as criminals. The boys admitted throwing the stones, and were sentenced to be scourged through the streets of Edinburgh, burned in the face with a hot iron, and then sold as slaves to Barbadoes. Two brothers of the woman, named Turnbull, were banished to Virginia, and the woman was ordered to be whipped through the streets of Jedburgh. The bishop of Glasgow, when applied to for a mitigation of the sentence, lest the woman should be with child, mildly answered that he would make them claw the itch out of her shoulders. In Rotterdam He chose Rotterdam as his place of exile, and spent the remainder of his life there, often preaching in the Scottish church and devoting himself to theological study. He died 9 August 1672, aged 70, and is widely remembered as a preacher of extraordinary popular gifts. His own estimate of his sermons was, however, a very modest one, and he describes himself generally as ‚Äòtimorous, averse from debates, rather given to laziness than rashness, too easy to be wrought upon.‚Äô In his later years, he expressed a great abhorrence of sectarianism. He had a good knowledge of Latin, Hebrew, and Chaldee, and could read French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and German.

It is named after P. W. Anderson, who discussed this phenomenon in 1959, briefly after BCS theory was introduced. One consequence of Anderson's theorem is that the critical temperature Tc of a conventional superconductor barely depends on material purity, or more generally on defects. This concept breaks down in the case of very strong disorder, e.g. close to a superconductor-insulator transition. Also, it does not apply to unconventional superconductors. In fact, strong suppression of Tc with increasing defect scattering, thus non-validity of Anderson's theorem, is taken as a strong indication for superconductivity being unconventional.

Dobson was an important figure in the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, later known as the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. He later served as the secretary of the International Whaling Commission from 1949 to 1959 and the president of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea from 1952 to 1955. As a cricketer, he made one first-class appearance for the Gentlemen of England. Early life and civil service career The son of the poet Henry Austin Dobson, he was born at Ealing in June 1885 and was raised with a strict upbringing in the Plymouth Brethren. He was educated at Clifton College, before going up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of England against Surrey at The Oval in 1905. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Gentlemen of England first-innings without scoring by Jack Crawford, while in their second- innings he was dismissed for a single run by Ernest Nice. After graduating from Cambridge, he entered into the civil service. He was appointed to the position of assistant to the head of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in January 1908. Dobson served in the First World War with the Royal Hampshire Regiment, with him holding the rank of second lieutenant in November 1916, with promotion to the rank of lieutenant coming in April 1918. Post-war career and life Following the war, he returned to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. He was made a CBE in the 1930 New Year Honours, before being made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1932 New Year Honours. Seven years later he was made a Companion to the Order of the Bath in the 1939 New Year Honours. Following the death of his father, he managed his literary estate and kept a library of his fathers works, which he donated to the Senate House Library at the University of London in 1946. Dobson was the secretary of the International Whaling Commission from 1949-59, before serving as the president of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea from 1952-55. Dobson died at Bury St Edmunds in May 1962, and was survived by his son, the librarian Christopher Dobson. Two years after his death, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee named Dobson Dome after him.

Career Wei attended National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan alongside Stan Shih, before earning his doctorate from the University of Washington in the United States. He then began teaching at NCTU in 1976. In 1979, Wei and Lin Jung- sheng cofounded Wang Labs. Wei was later appointed vice president of National Chiao Tung University. Months after the Chen Shui-bian presidential administration took office, Wei was appointed leader of a secondary technology consultation task force in November 2000. On 6 March 2001, Wei succeeded Weng Cheng-yi as minister of the National Science Council (NSC). After taking his position at the NSC, Wei resigned several other positions, including his administrative post at National Chiao Tung University and the government- convened technology task force. Weeks after Wei assumed the NSC post, the Third Nuclear Power Plant in Pingtung was damaged by fire, and Wei led an independent task force to look into the matter. Wei's investigation ruled out electrical system design as a cause of the fire. Like his predecessor Weng Cheng-yi, Wei struggled to establish the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park, due to noise concerns, as the site was near the proposed route of the Taiwan High Speed Rail. Due to this issue, NSC vice chairman Hsueh Hsiang-chuan resigned, and was replaced by Huang Wen-hsiung. In May 2001, Wei reached an agreement with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in the United States regarding ROCSAT-3. In July 2001, amendments to the Animal Protection Law took effect, offering stricter protections for animals used in laboratory research. Wei stated that enforcement of the amended law would improve Taiwan's international image. Wei was retained as National Science Council minister when the Yu Shyi-kun cabinet took office in February 2002. As minister of the National Science Council, Wei expressed caution about commencing scientific exchanges with China, and supported the passage of laws that codified oversight of Taiwanese technology workers in China. He also sought to acquire land and expand science parks in Taiwan. A May 2003 survey run by the Humanistic Science, Cultural and Educational Foundation ranked Wei the fifth-best government minister. From October 2003 to March 2004, the National Science Council ran a science education radio program called Science 180. After French president Jacques Chirac expressed reservations about the 2004 Taiwanese cross-Strait relations referendum, Wei cancelled a scheduled trip to France in January 2004. Wei's resignation as minister of the National Science Council took effect on 20 May 2004. After leaving public service, Wei returned to National Chiao Tung University as an adjunct professor and served on the board of directors of several companies.

A few days prior, oil prices on the NYMEX closed at $86. Oil prices topped at $103 on February 24 where oil production is curtailed to the political upheaval in Libya. Oil supplies remained high, and Saudi Arabia assured an increase in production to counteract shutdowns. Still, the Mideast and North African crisis led to a rise in oil prices to the highest level in two years, with gasoline prices following. Though most Libyan oil went to Europe, all oil prices reacted. The average price of gasoline in the United States increased 6 cents to $3.17. On March 1, 2011, a significant drop in Libyan production and fears of more instability in other countries pushed the price of oil over $100 a barrel in New York trading, while the average price of gas reached $3.37. Despite Saudi promises, the sour type oil the country exported could not replace the more desirable sweet Libyan oil. On March 7, 2011, the average price of gas having reached $3.57, individuals were making changes in their driving. The weakened U.S. Dollar resulted in a spike to $112/barrel with the national average of $3.74/gallon ‚Äì with expectations of damaging the U.S. economy suggestive of a long-term recession. As of April 26, the national average was $3.87 ‚Äì with a fear of $4/gallon as the nationwide average prior to the summer driving season. The national average rose on May 5, 2011 for the 44th straight day, reaching $3.98. However, that same day, West Texas Intermediate crude fell below $100 a barrel, the lowest since March 16. This came after crude oil for June delivery reached $114.83 on May 2, the highest since September 2008, before closing at $97.18 on May 6, a day after dropping 9%, the most dramatic single-day drop in over two years. Gas prices fell slightly on May 6, and experts predicted $3.50 a gallon by summer. In mid-June, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery fell nearly $2 to $93.01, the lowest price since February. The dollar was up and the euro and other currencies down, and the European economic crisis made investors concerned. London Brent crude fell 81 cents to $113.21. On June 15 the Energy Information Association said oil consumption was down 3.5% from a year earlier, but wholesale gasoline demand was up for the first time in several weeks. The price of gas on June 17 was $3.67.5 a gallon, 25.1 cents lower than a month earlier but 96.8 cents above a year earlier. On June 24, the price of gas was $3.62.8 and expected to go much lower due to the opening of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. U.S. oil prices fell below $90 before rising again, and Brent crude fell 2%. However, on June 29, West Texas intermediate crude had risen to $94.96, almost $5 above the lowest point reached after the previous week's action. One reason was the falling dollar, as Greece appeared less likely to default on its debt; concern over the Greek debt crisis had caused falling oil prices. After another week, oil for August delivery had risen from $90.61 to $98.67 and gas prices were up five cents. Increased worldwide demand was one reason. Brent Crude remained high at $118.38 partly due to supply problems in Europe, including lower North Sea production and the continuing war in Libya. On August 4, the price of oil dropped 6% to its lowest level in 6 months. On August 5, the price had dropped $8.82 in a week to $86.88 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The same pessimistic economic news that caused stock prices to fall also decreased expected energy demand, and experts predicted a gas price drop of 35 cents per gallon from the average of $3.70. On August 8, oil fell over 6%, in its largest drop since May, to $81, its lowest price of the year. On September 24, oil reached $79.85, down 9% for the week, due to concerns about another recession and the overall world economy. The average price of gas was $3.51, with predictions of $3.25 by November, but it was below $3 in some markets. During October, the price of oil rose 22%, the fastest pace since February, as worries over the U.S. economy decreased, leading to predictions of $4 by early 2012. As of November 8, the price reached $96.80. Gas prices were not following the increase, due to lower demand resulting from the economy, the normal decrease in travel, lower oil prices in other countries, and production of winter blends which cost less. The average rose slightly to $3.41 but predictions of $3.25 were made.  2012  Brent versus WTI Shortages of oil could have resulted if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, through which one- fifth of exported oil travels, as a result of sanctions due to the country's nuclear policies. The price of oil stayed near $100 throughout January because of concerns over supplies, and the European debt situation. The average price of gas was $3.38 on January 20, up 17 cents from a month earlier. Another factor was planned closing of refineries in the U.S. and Europe due to lower demand. By early February, the national average was $3.48, though oil prices were at $98, the lowest in six weeks, and U.S. demand was the lowest since September 2001. On February 20, benchmark March crude oil reached $105.21, the highest in nine months. This came one day after Iran's oil ministry announced an end to sales to British and French companies; though this would have little actual impact on supplies, fears resulted in higher prices. Also, approval of the bailout plan for Greece was expected, and China's action to raise the money supply was likely to stimulate the economy. Brent crude was up 11% for the year to $119.58 on February 17, with cold weather in Europe and higher Third World demand, and West Texas Intermediate crude was up 19% to $103.24. The average price of gas was $3.53. On February 29, the average was $3.73. The average peaked at $3.94 early in April, and on April 24, it was $3.85 compared to $3.86 a year earlier; it had been two years since gas prices were lower than the previous year. Crude oil prices were down; West Texas Intermediate was $103.55 a barrel, down from over $107 late in March, and Brent Crude $118.16 after peaking above $128 in March. On May 7, benchmark U.S. crude reached $95.34, the lowest price of the year, after voters in France and Greece ousted government officials who would cut spending to solve the debt crisis. Benchmark oil in New York actually rose for two days straight early in June, to $84.29. With U.S. oil supplies the highest since 1990, gas reached $3.57 on June 5. After falling again to its lowest price since October 2011, Benchmark crude rose 5.8% to $82.18 on June 29, with Brent crude up 4.5% to $95.51. European bailout efforts included lending money to banks, decreasing likelihood of failures. Also, European countries decided not to buy Iranian oil. The price of gas was $3.35, the lowest since January 6. On July 17, Benchmark Crude reached $89.22 and Brent crude $104 after good economic news in the United States. Gas rose to $3.40. On August 7, a California refinery fire contributed to a jump in oil futures. Other refinery problems, a pipeline leak, fears about Iran, the crisis in Syria, North Sea problems, and Tropical Storm Ernesto all contributed to a 20% jump in oil prices in six weeks. The price of gas reached $3.63 but was not expected to go much higher. Good economic news in the United States contributed to oil reaching its highest price since May on August 17, with Benchmark Crude reaching $96.01, while Brent crude fell slightly to $113.71. Early in September, a mix of bad economic news from the United States and good economic news from Europe caused the price of oil to fall slightly. On September 4, Benchmark Crude reached $95.41, with Brent crude at $114.84. The price of gas went down slightly to $3.82 but was still the highest ever for Labor Day weekend. Hurricane Isaac contributed to a temporary spike in gas prices, but on September 12 gas once again rose, to $3.86, as refineries cut production prior to the switch from summer blend gasoline to winter blend. Benchmark Crude also reached its highest level since early May and continued to rise above $99 after Federal Reserve announcements of actions to improve the economy and the 2012 diplomatic missions attacks. Brent crude rose slightly to nearly $116. Early in October, the average gas price was $3.78 and falling, though still a record for the month. Late in the month, the average reached $3.62 after a 13-cent drop in a week, the most since November 2008. Brent crude was down $8 in the previous month. By the start of November, the average was $3.54, partly due to lower demand after Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil futures fell after Barack Obama was re-elected November 6. After Thanksgiving, lower U.S. oil inventories, good economic news in the United States and good news relating to the Greek bailout helped push Brent crude up to $111.04, and benchmark oil for January delivery to $87.92; benchmark oil reached $86.24 on November 28, and gas was $3.41. On December 13, Brent crude was down to $109.20, while benchmark oil fell slightly due to U.S. fiscal cliff concerns and rose due to Federal Reserve efforts to help the U.S. economy, ending the day at $86.77. In mid- December, gas prices reached $3.25, the lowest for 2012. Oil was trading for between $84 and $90.  2013  On January 17, with good economic news in the United States, Benchmark oil reached its highest level since September, going over $95. Brent crude rose above $110. Gas was at $3.29. Refinery shutdowns led to a dramatic rise in gas prices. Late in February, gas was at $3.78, up 14 cents from a week earlier. On February 25, with European stock markets doing well, Benchmark crude for April rose above $94 after a significant drop the previous week due to news the Federal Reserve might end its stimulus efforts, making the dollar stronger. Brent crude was over $115. Two days later gas reached its highest point, $3.79 a gallon. By mid-April, with low demand expected due to negative economic news, gas was down to $3.56 as Brent crude fell to $103.04, its lowest price since July. With economic problems worldwide leading to low demand, gas prices fell 3% in April, the most in a month in ten years, to the lowest level for that month since 2010. Before Memorial Day, when gas was $3.63, gas supplies fell even though oil supplies were the highest in 35 years. U.S. economic news was also negative. On May 30, Benchmark crude for July rose slightly to $93.61 after falling the previous day, and Brent crude fell slightly to $102.19. On June 5 the price of oil rose again with supplies lower. Benchmark crude rose above $94. The price of gas was $3.62. On June 12, the International Energy Agency said demand for oil would still rise in 2013, but not as much as previously believed due to the economy. Also, May OPEC production was the highest in seven months. Benchmark crude fell slightly to $95.31, and Brent crude rose to $103.27. On June 20, with the Federal Reserve stating that its stimulus program could end if the U.S. economy continued to improve, as well as economic problems in China, Benchmark crude fell below $97. Brent crude fell to $104.24. On July 10, oil prices were the highest in more than a year as a result of lower supplies and trouble in Egypt. In the past week, Brent crude had climbed 7% to $108.51. Because too much oil was being produced for the infrastructure to handle it, West Texas Intermediate was lower than Brent crude for several years; it has returned to being consistent with Brent. On July 5 it reached $103.22. On July 19 with good economic news in the United States, Benchmark crude reached $108.05, while gas was $3.67, the highest on a Friday since March 22. Brent crude was at $108.07. Gas was $3.63 on August 1, though good economic news in the U.S., China and Europe meant oil was going up again after a decline the previous week. Benchmark crude reached $107.89, while Brent crude was $109.54. On August 16 Benchmark oil was $107.46 after six days of increases as Egypt's problems continued. The concern was access to the Suez Canal, which appears unlikely to be a problem but still concerns companies. Brent crude was $110.48 on August 19. On August 28 West Texas intermediate reached $110.10, the highest since May 2011, and Brent crude reached $116.61, its highest point since February 19, due to concern about U.S. involvement in Syria. Meanwhile, inventories in the United States had their biggest increase in four months. Benchmark crude rose to $107.56 on September 11 due to lower supplies after dropping due to hopes for a peaceful Syria solution; Brent crude rose to $111.50. Gas was $3.59 at the start of the month, but at the end of September, the price of gas was $3.39, the lowest for the time of year since 2010. The New York Mercantile Exchange price on September 27 was $102.87. Refineries had no hurricanes or other problems. Benchmark crude fell to $103.31 on October 3 after the U.S. government shutdown, and Brent crude was $109. On October 21, Benchmark crude was $99.22, the first time below $100 since July. Higher supplies and fewer threats from the Middle East were the reasons. Brent crude was $109.64 and gas reached $3.35. On November 13, Brent crude reached $107.12 and was $13.24 higher than West Texas Intermediate, the largest difference since April, due to trouble in Libya and sanctions against Iran. On November 25, Benchmark crude decreased to $93.92 while Brent crude reached $110.41 after the agreement regarding Iran's nuclear program. On December 16, Benchmark crude rose to $97.44 and Brent crude reached $110.53 with good economic news from Europe and more Libya trouble. Gas was $3.23, three cents higher than a month earlier. On December 27, due to a better economy in the United States leading to higher demand, oil closed about $100 for the first time since October. Gas was $3.27, two cents below a year earlier.

However, he was an important disciple of Yanguan Qi'an, a renowned 9th generation Zen master descended from Mazu Daoyi. Foguangshan 1989 During the Jowa period (834-848 CE), Empress Dowager Tachibana Kachiko dispatched Egaku on several trips to Tang China for pilgrimage and to invite a Zen monk back to Japan to propagate Zen Buddhism in Japan. In 841 CE, Egaku went on his first trip to Tang China. He went on a pilgrimage to Mount Wutai. Later he traveled to Hangzhou's Lingchi Monastery to meet Yanguan Qi'an. Egaku conveys Tachibana Kachiko's wishes to invite Yanguan Qi'an back to Japan to propagate Zen Buddhism. However, Yanguan Qi'an instead suggested Gik≈´ as a replacement. On this trip, Egaku also took vows of providing support for the Sangha. This vow required him to return to Japan. Gik≈´ did not return with Egaku on this trip. Egaku returned to Tang China in 844 CE. Armed with religious offerings made by the Empress Dowager, he went again on pilgrimage to Mount Wutai. Later he went to Lingchi Monastery to honor Yanguan Qi'an. However, Yanguan Qi'an had already died two years earlier. Gik≈´ agrees to accompany Egaku back to Japan. However, in 845 CE, the Huichang Persecution intervenes and reaches its zenith and Egaku had to pretend to return to secular life. The Huichang Persecution ends when Emperor Xuanzong ascends the throne in 846 CE. Egaku then returns with Gik≈´ to Japan in 847 CE. Aristocratic Heian society enthusiastically received Gik≈´'s arrival in Japan as he was the first Zen monk from China who exclusively taught Zen Buddhism in Japan. ≈åtsuki 2008 Tachibana Kachiko first housed him in the western wing of T≈ç-ji Temple; then moved him to Danrin Temple once it became completed. Groner 1997 Gik≈´ taught Zen Buddhism for several years there and then returned to Tang China. Hibino 1972 After Gik≈´ returns to Tang China, Egaku a few years later returns to Tang China.Tanaka 2011 On this trip, Egaku had an \\"agate-colored stele\\" made on his behalf in Suzhou's Kaiyuan Monastery by the Chinese Zen monk Qieyuan, entitled \\"Record of the Nation of Japan‚Äôs First Zen School.\\" Chen 2010 This agate stele once stood in Heian-ky≈ç's Rash≈çmon, and T≈çdai-ji once preserved four large fragments of this stele. The significance of this agate stele is that it was one of the few contemporaneous records describing Egaku‚Äôs recruitment of Gik≈´ as the first Zen monk to Japan. It was one of the sources used by Kokan Shiren to write the Egaku article found in Japan's earliest Buddhist history, the Genk≈ç Shakusho.

Brent crude was $107.78. Gas was $3.33. With the Iran agreement and increased production from Libya and the North Sea, Benchmark oil was around $92 on January 13 and Brent crude was $105.98. After good economic news from Japan, Benchmark crude fell slightly from its highest close of 2014, $98.23 on January 30. Brent crude fell to $107.25. The difference between the two fell below $10 for the first time since November, partly due to cold weather in the United States which resulted in high heating oil demand. Early in February gas was $3.27. Cold weather led to the price of oil staying above $100 for most of February, but lower prices were expected. With United States fourth quarter economic growth expected to be lower than an early estimate, Benchmark crude fell slightly on February 27 to $102.40, with Brent crude reaching $108.61. On March 24, due to the dispute over Crimea, problems in Libya, and the Houston Ship Channel collision, Benchmark crude rose above $100 and Brent crude rose to $107.41. Economic problems in China kept prices from going even higher. Later in the week, good economic news from the United States, lower oil supplies in Oklahoma and a force majeure by Shell Nigeria pushed prices slightly higher, to $102.12 for Benchmark crude and $108.29 for Brent. On April 7, Benchmark crude fell below $101 and Brent crude fell to $105.64 with news that Libya might open more terminals in May, but more Ukraine problems pushed the prices back up on April 8. Gas was $3.59, matching the level in 2013. Continued Ukraine problems pushed oil higher on April 24, with Benchmark crude at $101.94 and Brent crude at $110.33, though an April 23 report said U.S. oil supplies were higher than expected. The price of gas was $3.68.5, the highest since March 2013. On April 30, Benchmark crude dropped below $100 for the first time in three weeks as oil supplies continued to rise and the unusually cold winter resulted in negative U.S. economic news. Gas was up 14 cents for the month, the most in three years. More Ukraine trouble pushed Benchmark crude above $100 and Brent crude over $108 on May 12, and further problems in Libya helped push Benchmark crude over $102 and Brent crude over $110 by May 15, though negative economic news in the U.S. and an unexpected increase in oil stockpiles pushed Benchmark crude back down temporarily. Continued concerns over Ukraine and Libya pushed oil back above $104. The price of gas was $3.65. Trouble in Iraq resulted in higher prices for oil and gas in June. West Texas crude reached $106 and Brent crude $115.75. At the end of the month Benchmark crude was just above $105 while Brent crude fell below $113. The price of gas was $3.66. After three weeks of going down, U.S. crude fell below $100 for the first time since May on July 15. However, with Middle East and Ukraine problems sending oil higher, Benchmark crude finished July 18 just above $103, with Brent crude staying above $107. With low demand and plentiful supplies, and despite good economic news from China and the United States, Brent crude fell below $107 on July 24, and U.S. crude dropped to $102.10. On July 28, gas was $3.52, down five cents from a week earlier, due to refiners cutting prices. Two weeks later gas was $3.48, less than a year earlier. And on August 14, light sweet oil was $95.58, the lowest since January, while Brent crude reached $102.01, the lowest since June, after falling the most in one day since January. Production in Libya was up, and economic slowdowns were expected in Europe and China, making even lower prices likely. As of Labor Day, gas was $3.41, 18 cents lower than in 2013. Low demand and high North American production cancelled out effects of troubles in the Middle East and Ukraine. West Texas crude was below $94 on August 27 and Brent crude below $103. On October 16, West Texas crude fell below $80 for the first time in more than two years, while Brent crude reached $82.60, the lowest since November 2010. OPEC Members were not expected to act as increases in the U.S. supply resulting from high tight oil (shale oil) production added to a worldwide surplus. On October 31, the average price of gas reached $3 and was expected to go below that figure for the first time since December 2010. Demand for oil was down and there were many new sources. United States oil production was up 70% since 2008, and Iraq and Canada were producing more. According to the Lundberg survey released December 7, gas was down 12 cents from two weeks earlier to $2.72. Demand was low while production was high, and the strong dollar contributed. With demand low in China and Europe and OPEC deciding not to cut back, West Texas Intermediate reached $63.50 on December 8, the lowest since July 2009, while Brent crude reached $66.90, a level not seen since October 2009. After Saudi Arabia oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said OPEC members could not cut production on their own, oil prices rose slightly December 18 but finished the day lower with Benchmark crude at $54.11 and Brent crude $59.27, both the lowest since May 2009. Gas was $2.49 a gallon. Days later gas was $2.38, the lowest in five years, after 89 straight days of going down, the longest continuous decline ever according to AAA. The price of oil was down 50% since April, while gas had fallen 36%. Economic problems in Europe and Asia, high gas mileage, a strong dollar, higher U.S. production and no action by OPEC have been credited.  2015  On January 16, Brent crude rose as high as $50.16 before falling back, and the International Energy Agency said production was down due to lower prices and higher prices were likely late in 2015. West Texas Intermediate, down 10% for the month, closed at $48.48 on January 14 after closing at $45.89 the previous day. Gas was $2.12. After the January 23 death of King Abdullah led to concerns about the future, West Texas Intermediate climbed as high as $47.76 and Brent crude reached $49.80. From January 30 to February 3, oil rose 20%, but on February 4, U.S. crude futures fell 8.7% to $48.45, the most in one day since November 28, 2014. Brent crude fell from $59 to $54 two weeks after reaching $45. U.S. inventories were the highest since 1982, while the dollar was recovering from \\"its worst day in more than a year\\". Although inventory remained high, Brent crude reached its highest price of 2015 on February 17, closing at $62.53 after reaching $63. Problems in the Middle East, especially Libya, contributed to the rise. Fighting in Ukraine was also a factor. At the end of February, with refineries changing to summer blend, the price of gas was $2.37, up from $2.03 in January. Other factors included an explosion at a Torrance, California refinery and a strike involving steel workers at 20 refineries. On March 13, oil declined 5% for a total drop of 10% for the week. Benchmark crude reached $45.16 and Brent crude was $56.24. Supplies continued to increase and the price was expected to fall until changes by refineries for summer. Gas reached $2.46 March 7 but fell to $2.44 a week later. U.S. inventories were the highest since records had been kept, but on March 18, with the Federal Reserve indicating interest rates would not rise quickly, oil prices increased 6%. Brent crude rose 16% in April, reaching $64.95, its highest price for 2015, on April 16. U.S. crude was $56.62 on April 17. Reasons were a drop in expected tight oil (shale oil) production in the United States and the war in Yemen. Gas was $2.41, up a penny in a week. On May 5, gas reached $2.63 after rising for 19 days; gas was going up faster than oil, which reached its highest 2015 price, $61.10 for U.S. crude and $68.40 for Brent crude, before settling at $60.40 and $67.52 respectively. The dollar was lower but different sources conflicted over whether U.S. inventories were down for the first time in 2015, or up as they had been. West Texas Intermediate closed slightly higher at $58.98 on May 19, and Brent crude rose slightly to just over $65 as U.S. supplies, still near records, fell while refineries increased production. On May 26, gas was $2.74. On June 10, West Texas Intermediate reached $61.43, the highest price since December. Demand was expected to stay high, but OPEC production was also staying high. Brent crude was $65.70 while gas was $2.76. On July 1, with an increase in U.S. inventory for the first time in two months, U.S. benchmark oil fell by the most in one day since April 8 to $56.26, the lowest since April 22, while Brent crude fell to $62.01. Gas was $2.77. Oil fell by about $10 in July as the U.S. dollar was strong, supplies were high, and the Chinese stock market was down. Near the end of the month, Brent crude reached $53.31, close to the lowest in six months, while U.S. crude, at $48.52, was close to a four-month low, and gas was $2.69. A week later, with supplies high and summer driving in the United States ending, oil fell below $45, close to the six-year low reached in March. Brent crude was below $50. Gas was $2.64. On August 11, U.S. crude reached $43.08, its lowest price since February 2009. Brent crude was below $50. Gas was $2.59. On August 26, U.S. crude reached $38.60, once again its lowest price since February 2009, before jumping more than 10% the next day to $42.56 for its biggest increase in one day since March 2009. Brent crude was up 10% to $47. U.S. supplies had fallen dramatically, especially in Cushing, Oklahoma. Gas was $2.56, the lowest at this time of year since 2004, though refinery problems kept it from being lower. During August, Brent reached a low of $42.23 and U.S. crude was as low as $37.75. Then U.S. crude jumped 28% in 3 days, the most since 1990. Brent crude also climbed 28% above $54, the highest in a month. On September 11, Goldman Sachs predicted continued surpluses and falling prices, and U.S. crude fell to $44.74 while Brent crude reached $47.93. Gas was $2.37. A drop in supplies from Cushing, speculation about Federal Reserve action on interest rates, and U.S. help for Kurds in Syria contributed to a rise in U.S. crude to $47.15, while Brent was $50. On September 25, the price of gas was $2.29. On September 29, with U.S. crude inventories up and Cushing supplies falling more slowly, West Texas Intermediate finished at $45.23, with Brent crude falling to $47.97. After an International Energy Agency prediction of high supplies for the next year, U.S. crude fell the most in a week in more than two months, ending October 15 below $47, and Brent crude had its biggest loss for a week in nearly two months, just under $50 on October 16. With Middle Eastern countries producing more oil than needed and Iran expected to add even more as a result of the nuclear deal, as well as slow growth in China, U.S. crude fell below $46 on October 19 and Brent crude reached $48,51 early October 20. Gas was $2.25. On November 4, prices fell over 3% as a result of higher U.S. inventories and U.S. output, before rising slightly, Brent crude recovering to $48.76 and West Texas Intermediate reaching $46.37. Gas was $2.19, the lowest for the time of year since 2004. On November 19, U.S. crude fell below $40, and Brent crude slipped below $44. Gas was $2.13. Higher demand, winter weather in the United States and a promise by Saudi Arabia to work toward stabilizing prices sent West Texas Intermediate back over $42 and Brent crude over $44 on November 23. On the first week of December Brent crude fell to $42.43 and U.S. crude slipped below $40 after OPEC first said it would increase production and then decided not to make changes. Other factors were a weak dollar and a strong Euro. On December 11, oil fell to $35.62. The next day, gas was $2.02, the lowest in over six years. On December 21, Brent crude fell as low as $36.35 a barrel; this was the lowest price since July 2004. U.S. crude rose slightly to $36.14. Gas fell below $2 for the first time since 2009. On December 30 with U.S. supplies still high, light sweet crude fell to $36.60, while Brent crude reached $36.46. Oil ended the year down 30%.  2016  On January 6, 2016, the price of WTI crude hit another eleven-year low, as it dropped to 32.53 a barrel for the first time since 2009.Oil price crashes to $33 ‚Äì and could go as low as $18, TheWeek 07 January On January 12, in its seventh losing day, crude oil dropped below $30 for the first time since December 2003, ending the day at $30.44, as gas fell below $1.97. Brent crude hit $27.10 on January 20, the lowest since November 2003. Oil rose again before falling January 25, Brent crude reaching $30.86 and U.S. oil $30.68. After OPEC encouraged production cuts and U.S. GDP data suggested fewer interest rate increases, U.S. oil had four days of gains to finish January at $33.62. Brent was $34.74. Gas was $1.81, the lowest since January 2009. A February 7 meeting between Ali al-Naimi of Saudi Arabia and Eulogio Del Pino of Venezuela failed to produce desired results, and oil fell the next day, with Brent crude at $33.53 by noon and U.S. crude at $30.27. On February 11, U.S. crude reached $26.21 after reaching $26.05, its lowest price since May 2003. The next day oil rose 12.3 percent to $29.44, the most in one day since February 2009. Investors wanted to be ready when the price started going up. Also, OPEC was \\"ready to cooperate\\" on lower production. On February 22, Benchmark U.S. crude rose 6.2% to $31.48 and Brent crude went up 5.1% to $34.69 after news that supplies were expected to grow more slowly. By the end of the week, WTI was up 3% to $32.78, and Brent was up 7% to $35.12 after rising as high as $37, the most since January 5. Pipeline outages in Nigeria and Iraq, a lower number of active U.S. rigs, and lower gasoline inventories for the first time since November were reasons. Gas was $1.73, down 10 cents from the previous month, but with the switch to summer blend in California, gas was $2.34 and on its way back up. After inventories fell faster than expected, U.S. crude was $37.94 on March 9, while Brent crude was up again to $40.84 after six straight up days and its highest level in three months the previous day then a 3% drop due to concerns about too much oil. Prices were up 25% after major oil producers said they would keep supplies at January levels. After reducing the number of rigs for 12 weeks, U.S. producers added one rig with oil up 50%. With gasoline demand up, Brent crude reached its highest level of the year at $42.54 before falling to $41.20 March 18 in its fourth straight week of gains. U.S. crude also reached a high at $41.20 before falling to $39.44, ending its fifth straight week higher. Gas was $2.02, up 17 cents in 2 weeks. On March 31, U.S. crude reached $37.57, the lowest since March 31, as the country's supply hit a record for the seventh week. Brent crude was $38.81. In the first week of April with a weak dollar, oil jumped 7%, with Benchmark crude reaching $39.72 and Brent at $41.94. The next Tuesday, Brent hit $43.58, the highest of the year. With a planned meeting of oil producers to discuss keeping output where it was, on April 15 oil fell over 3%, with U.S. crude reaching $40.33 by midday and Brent at $42.82. With high demand in the U.S., lower production worldwide and problems in oil fields, oil rose for the third straight week, with Brent crude rising 4.5% for the week to $45.11 and West Texas Intermediate up more than 8% at $43.73. On April 26, U.S. inventories were down after analysts had expected a supply increase, and the dollar was weak. U.S. crude was up 3% to $44.04 while Brent crude was up to $45.74. The fire in Canada, attacks in Nigeria, and economic problems and the Zika virus in Venezuela led to supply problems and the highest prices in seven months on May 16. With U.S. supplies down more than predicted, WTI reached $49.56 on May 25, the highest since October. Brent crude was $49.74. On June 7, with the dollar lower and interest rates not expected to rise after U.S. economic news, Benchmark crude closed over $50 for the first time since July 21. Brent crude was $51.44. With the June 23 United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union, U.S. oil fell $2.05 to $48.06 and Brent crude fell $2.13 to $48.78. Gas was $2.29 on June 30, the lowest for the July 4 holiday in 13 years. On July 7, although supplies were down, they were not as low as forecast, and U.S. crude reached $47.20, down 4.7%. Brent crude reached $46.27, the lowest since May 11. For the week ending July 15, crude supplies fell, but gasoline supplies rose. After gains on July 20, WTI fell to $44.75 and Brent crude went down to $46.20. Gas was $2.19, the lowest since 2004 at that time of year. On August 5, WTI fell to $41.52 as the dollar rose as a result of better U.S. job news than expected, while Brent crude fell to $43.95. Oil prices had fallen more than 20% since June and were rising earlier in the week. On the week ending August 12, Benchmark crude rose 6.4%, and it went over $45 on August 15. Brent crude was $47.59. Gas was $2.12. On August 31, U.S. government data showed a higher than expected increase in oil supplies, and the prediction that supplies would stay high. If the Fed raised interest rates, a higher dollar and lower oil prices would result. U.S. crude fell to $43.16 on September 1, its lowest level in 3 weeks. Brent reached $45.52. Oil had gone up 11% for the month with the expectation that OPEC would limit production. Colonial Pipeline lost a major pipeline September 9 after a leak. As of September 19, the national average was up 2 cents to $2.20, though some areas, especially in the Southeast, saw increases of 20 to 30 cents. The pipeline returned to service after completion of a bypass on September 21. On September 23, Brent crude fell slightly to $45.89 in anticipation of a September 26 OPEC meeting. On September 29, WTI rose to $47.83 and Brent crude hit $49.24 after OPEC's decision to decrease production resulted in the biggest gains since April. Oil ended September higher for the second month. With the dollar strong after improvement in the U.S. economy, and stock markets weak, West Texas Intermediate fell October 3 after reaching $48.87, the highest point since July 5. Brent crude fell after hitting $50.90, its highest in six weeks. On October 10, with Russia planning to join OPEC and Algeria saying others should, Brent crude reached its highest point in a year at $53.73, while WTI hit $51.60, the highest since June 9. A week later, with supplies high and added U.S. production capacity, WTI fell just below $50 and Brent crude ended the day at $51.16. With lower inventories, on October 19 WTI reached $51.93, the highest since July 2015, while Brent crude reached $53.14. After an October 29 meeting by both OPEC members and nonmembers on the agreement to limit output resulted only in an agreement to meet again on November 30, and with high inventories at Cushing, Brent crude reached $48.17, the lowest since September 29, and WTI was down to $46.86, its lowest since September 27. A strong dollar and higher than expected U.S. and world supplies led to an end to rising prices on November 17, with U.S. crude reaching $45.52 and Brent crude $46.26. Then oil reached its highest point in 3 weeks on November 21, with Brent crude up 11% in a week, reaching $49, after Saudi Arabia began attempting to persuade other OPEC countries to participate in its plan, while WTI reached $47.80. OPEC countries met November 30 and agreed to limit output for the first time since 2008. As a result, Brent crude went over $50, the highest in a month, while West Texas intermediate stopped just short of $50. Brent reached $57.89 and U.S. crude reached $54.51 on December 12, both the highest since July 2015, after Russia and other countries not part of OPEC also agreed to limit production. For the week ending December 16, U.S. oil supplies, expected to fall, actually rose. WTI fell to $52.49 and Brent crude ended December 21 at $54.46. On December 27, the first day of trading after Christmas, with the output reduction to start January 1, Brent crude hit $56.09 and U.S. crude CLc1 reached $53.90. With a continued increase in U.S. supplies and nine weeks of increases in oil rigs, oil fell slightly at the end of the week, with WTI ending the year at $53.72 for a 45% gain, and Brent at $56.82, up 52%. Both gains were the most since 2009.

U.S. output was higher. Also, China's economic problems caused concern. Brent fell 3% in the second week of the year to $55.45. WTI fell to $52.37 for a nearly 3% loss. On January 18, with a strong dollar and expectations of higher U.S. production, Brent fell to $53.92 and WTI to $51.08. With U.S. production and inventories up, even a lower dollar and decreased production by OPEC nations did not cause oil prices to rise as much as they could have. WTI reached $53.07 and Brent $55.44 on January 26. On February 8, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported the second- largest increase in oil supplies, the day after WTI reached $52.17 and Brent reached $55.05, the lowest in three weeks for both, thanks to a strong dollar. Still, prices moved higher on February 8. With the increase in U.S. supplies and OPEC's plan to keep cutting production, oil ended the next week down, with WTI at $53.40 and Brent crude at $55.81. On February 22, Qatar oil minister Mohammed Saleh Al Sada said countries not in OPEC were not cutting production as much as expected, and oil fell as a result. Continued increases in U.S. crude inventories also contributed to a decline, with WTI at $53.59 and Brent at $55.76. After U.S. inventories reached a record at the end of February, oil fell for three straight days and closed at its lowest level in nearly a month, with WTI at $52.61 and Brent at $55.08. Oil continued to fall, with Brent crude reaching $51.50, the lowest since November 30, on March 9, a day after a 5% drop, the most it had moved in a day all year. WTI fell more than 5% March 8 and closed at $49.28 the next day, the lowest since November. WTI fell to $47.36 on March 14, while Brent crude reached $50.25, before lower inventories resulted in higher prices. Crude inventories set a record but gasoline inventories went down more than expected and summer gasoline demand was expected to increase, so while WTI fell to just over $47 on March 22, it finished the day at $48.04. Brent crude fell below $50 but recovered to $50.64. On March 30 with Kuwait's support for continuing OPEC production cuts, U.S. crude rose above $50 for the first time in three weeks, with Brent crude reached $52.92. Despite high U.S. crude inventories while gasoline inventories moved lower, prices continued to rise, reaching their highest point since March 8 on April 6, with WTI reaching $51.70 and Brent crude $54.89. After Saudi Arabia announced plans to continue lower production beyond the first half of 2017, on April 12, WTI reached $53.36 and Brent crude reached $56.40. On April 14, gas was $2.41, up 33 cents from a year earlier. On April 19, oil fell 3.8% with the news of an unexpected increase in U.S. gasoline supplies and the news that U.S. crude supplies fell less than they should have with production at its highest since August 2015. WTI still remained above $50 while Brent crude closed just under $53. On April 24, WTI fell below $50 and Brent crude closed at $51.60 due to doubts about OPEC extending production cuts and a statement by Russia that it would increase production. Despite plans to extend production cuts, on May 4, oil fell to its lowest level since November, with WTI falling to $45.52 and Brent crude reaching $48.26. But with the news that Saudi supplies to Asia were less than expected, and with U.S. inventories down the most since December, and despite higher production from non-OPEC nations reducing demand for OPEC oil, Brent crude finished at $50.72 on May 11 and U.S. light crude rose more than 1% to $47.83. With expectations production cuts would continue, Brent crude was up for the second week and WTI finished May 18 at $49.35, its highest close since April 26. On May 25, all countries agreed to continue cuts but Brent crude still fell 4%. And despite a sharp drop in U.S. inventories, oil fell another 1% on June 2, with Brent crude reaching $50.25 and WTI down to $47.91. By June 9, Brent crude was at $47.67, down 12% from May 25, and WTI was at $45.44, down 11%, with limits on production not having the expected effect as supplies continued to rise. OPEC actually increased production and on June 14, Brent crude fell to $48.25 and WTI to $45.94. Excessive worldwide supplies and high U.S. production led to the fourth straight down week as Brent crude finished June 16 at $47.37 and WTI rose to $44.74, a day after oil reached its lowest level in six months. Prices rose slightly with news that although American producers added rigs for a record 22 weeks, the rate of increase was slowing, and that some countries were starting to export less. With production increasing in Nigeria and Libya, even though U.S. supplies of oil and gasoline were down, Brent crude rose slightly to $44.91 after reaching its lowest point since November, and WTI reached $42.53, its lowest since August, on June 21. With U.S. inventories again continuing to increase and gasoline supplies up despite increased demand, Brent crude fell to $46.32 and WTI reached $43.86 on June 28. After eight days of gains due to an expected end in a rise in U.S. production, Brent crude fell to $49.43 and WTI to $46.85 on July 4. On July 7, even though U.S. oil and gasoline inventories fell late in June, with both OPEC and U.S. production up, Brent crude fell to $47.53 and WTI to $44.95. The next week, Brent crude rose 3.5% to $48.24 and WTI 4% to $45.98 as U.S. inventories continued to fall and U.S. production forecasts were cut, though oil inventories were still high, reducing gains from earlier in the week; Sanford C. Bernstein speculated OPEC nations may not have made the cuts intended. On July 31, Brent crude reached $52.93, its highest point since May. With record demand reported in the United States and lower inventories along with good news on U.S. jobs but continued high production from OPEC nations, on August 4, WTI ended the week at $49.58 and Brent crude reached $52.42 after almost reaching a 10-week high earlier in the week. Both were down less than 1% for the week. Oil reached its highest level in two and a half months on August 9 but OPEC and exempt nations Nigeria and Libya reported increased output, and oil fell 1.5%, with WTI back below $50 at $48.62 and Brent crude at $51.91 early the next day. Oil fell 2.5%, more than expected, on August 14. Early the next day WTI was $47.65 and Brent crude was $50.79, both up slightly. Lower production by Libya and China were reported, and a stronger dollar resulted from North Korea delaying a decision to fire a missile toward Guam. On August 23, oil fell slightly due to higher Libya output, while U.S. gasoline supplies higher than expected even though crude inventories fell, with WTI at $47.63 and Brent crude at $51.61. However, Hurricane Harvey led to higher gas prices and to a reduction of nearly 25% in refinery capacity and 15% in U.S. production. Brent crude fell slightly to $50.93 on August 29, but the difference between Brent and U.S. CLc1 reached the highest level in over two years before declining to $4.92. While Harvey has had little effect on crude prices, the price of gas reached $2.59 on September 2, up 17.5 cents since August 23 and 16.7% higher than 2016, with more dramatic increases in states dependent on the Colonial Pipeline, which closed until inspection was complete. As of September 11, the price of gas was $2.67. Brent crude rose 40% from June to October as oil producers were expected to continue lower production, with an increase of 20% in the third quarter, the most for the quarter since 2004, and reaching $59.49 during the final week of September. The increase that week resulted from a threat by Turkey to close a pipeline as a result of the Kurdistan vote for independence. Turkey did not act and oil fell 6% to $56.00 (including a 2.5% drop on October 1) as a result of investors taking advantage of higher prices and forecasts for increased U.S. tight oil (shale oil) production. U.S. CLc1 fell only slightly to $50.42. On October 12, with U.S. supplies up, WTI was $51.01 and Brent crude $56.65. After four days of higher prices, oil dropped significantly October 19 and rose slightly the next day, with WTI reaching $51.41 and Brent at $57.31. U.S. oil inventories were down 15% since March and lower than in 2016 due to higher exports resulting from WTI being significantly lower than Brent. However, threats to oil supplies due to fighting in Kurdistan were less than feared. On November 1, WTI reached the highest level since 2015 before settling at $54.30. The next week, WTI reached $57.92, highest since July 2015, and Brent crude $64.65, highest since June 2015. Demand was high, and OPEC cuts and \\"rising political tensions\\" were other reasons. On November 24, WTI reached $59.05, the highest in two years, due to the Keystone Pipeline closing, and optimism about the OPEC deal extension. Gas was $2.52. On November 27, U.S. CLc1 fell 1.4%, finishing the next day at $57.99, with Brent crude at $63.61. Crude supplies had risen the previous week after forecasts for an increase. There was concern about a November 30 meeting to extend OPEC production cuts, while Russia was expected to increase production. A strong dollar caused prices to fall slightly December 8, with WTI at $56.64 and Brent crude at $62.09. With an outage on the Forties crude pipeline in Great Britain, prices were staying high. Oil fell slightly on December 11 with WTI at $57.10 and Brent crude $63.08 as U.S. production reached levels not seen since the 1970s and the number of rigs continued to increase. During the last week of 2017, WTI went over $60 for the first time since June 2015 before falling back to $59.69, while Brent crude passed $67 for the first time since May 2015 before falling to $66.50. Pipeline problems in Libya and the North Sea added to production cuts by OPEC and Russia.  2018  Both WTI and Brent began the year above $60 for the first time since 2014. Later in the week WTI reached $62.21 and Brent $68.27, both the highest since May 2015. Protests in Iran added to other factors that were keeping prices high. With U.S. inventories the lowest in three years, and cold weather decreasing U.S. production, oil reached its highest price since December 2014 in mid-January. On January 15, Brent reached $70.37, and the next day, WTI hit $64.89. U.S. production increased and demand was predicted to go down when winter was over, so prices went down. With U.S. crude supplies up for the first time in 11 weeks, WTI ended January at $64.73 after falling for two straight days for the second time in the month. In February, with U.S. crude supplies up, WTI fell to $61.79, the lowest level in a month, and Brent fell below $66 for the first time in 2018. With both crude oil stocks and gasoline inventories up, and U.S. production at a high, WTI finished February down 4.8%, the first loss for a month since August, and Brent finished down 4.7%. With reports of higher U.S. crude inventories, a stronger dollar and the stock market down (partly the result of the resignation of Gary Cohn), oil fell 2% March 7, with WTI reaching $61.21 and Brent $64.34. Crude oil supplies continued to rise and oil fell 1.2% early in the week of March 12, with WTI reaching $61.14 and Brent reaching $64.97 early March 15. Then crude supplies fell and WTI ended March 21 at $65.41 while Brent reached $69.47, both the highest since early February. WTI ended March at $64.94, up 5.6% for the month and 7.7% for the first quarter. Brent finished at $70.27 for an increase of 8.6% for the month and 6.3% for the quarter. One reason was concern over the United States putting sanctions on Iran once again. Also, OPEC wanted prices higher and intended to set targets for crude stocks accordingly. Production in Venezuela was down as well. On April 11, with the United States planning a response to the Douma chemical attack in the Syrian Civil War, WTI ended the day at $66.82, with Brent at $72.04, both the highest since December 2014. WTI fell from $69.56 and Brent from $74.74, both the highest since November 2014, on a week when U.S. inventories were lower and gasoline demand was higher. WTI ended May 18 down slightly at $71.28 but still higher for the third week after reaching its highest level in three and half years twice. Brent rose for the sixth week in a row, the most since 2011, finishing at $78.51 after going over $80 for the first time since November 2014 the previous day. The threat of more sanctions on Iran, the lowest OPEC petroleum stocks in three years, and supply problems in Venezuela were reasons. Prior to Memorial Day, the number of active U.S. oil rigs increased and WTI fell 4% to $67.88, while Brent fell 3% to $76.44, the lowest since May 8. Media reports indicate OPEC will increase production. Gas was $2.97, the highest of the year. With OPEC's announcement that it would keep production low through the rest of 2018, WTI rose from its lowest close since April 17 to finish May 30 at $68.21 after five straight days of decline, the longest streak since February. Brent finished at $77.50. The difference between WTI and Brent was increasing, possibly due to tight oil (shale oil). On June 14, WTI reached $66.89, its highest settlement in two weeks as a result of the largest U.S. supply drop since March, though not as high as it could have been due to record U.S. production for the week. Brent fell to $75.94 due to expectations of higher production from OPEC. On June 22, WTI finished at $68.58, up 4.6%, and Brent was up 3.4% to $75.55, after OPEC said it would cut production, and U.S. supplies fell with the first reduction in the number of rigs in three months. WTI ended the first half of 2018 up about 23% to $74.15, the highest since November 2014, up 14% for the second quarter and 11% for the month. Brent was $79.44, the highest since May. Factors included threats to supplies from Libya and proposed sanctions on countries importing oil from Iran. With expectations of increased production worldwide, Brent dropped more than 2% on July 2 to $77.30, while WTI fell slightly to $73.94 due to lower U.S. supplies and Libya exports. For the week ending July 13, WTI fell 3.8% to $71.01 after falling below $70 on July 12. Brent fell 2.3% to $75.33 after reaching $73.40 on July 11, a day when the return of oil from Libya and a change in attitudes toward Iran sanctions led to a nearly 7% drop. Lower U.S. supplies were less of a factor. WTI rose to $69.46 on July 19 with the announcement that Saudi Arabia exports were expected to fall to prevent oversupply and news of lower than expected U.S. gasoline supplies, but Brent fell to $72.58 with the end of a strike by Norwegian oil workers. The biggest one-day decline in oil prices in three weeks happened August 8 as crude supplies fell less than expected and demand in China also fell. WTI fell 3.2% from $69.17, the highest since July 30, to $66.91, the lowest since June 21. Brent also fell by 3.2%, to $72.28, the lowest since July 17. WTI fell 3% on August 15 to $65.01 for its lowest close since June 6, while Brent fell 2.4% to $70.76, the lowest since April 9. Crude inventories were rising despite a forecast they would fall. Then oil rose for five straight days, with WTI reaching $67.86, the highest in two weeks, and Brent reached $74.78, the highest since July 30, as U.S. crude supplies fell more than expected. Possible sanctions on Iran have also contributed. On August 28, WTI fell slightly to $68.53 from its highest finish since August 7; there had been increases seven of the previous nine days. Brent was also down a few cents to $75.95 after the highest finish since July 10. sanctions on Iran and problems in Libya and Venezuela kept prices high. Gas was $2.24. Despite lower U.S. crude supplies, a number of factors including lower expected demand, problems between the U.S. and China, higher U.S. gasoline and distillate supplies, and economic problems in emerging markets contributed to the lowest finish since August 21 for WTI at $67.77 on September 6. Brent was $76.55. With Hurricane Florence weakening, higher OPEC output and record supplies worldwide, on September 13, WTI fell 2.5% from $70.37, the highest since July 20, while Brent crude fell 2% to $78.17 from the highest since May. WTI rose nearly 3% October 1 to finish at $75.30, the highest since November 2014, while Brent reached $84.98, the most since October 2014, with the agreement to replace NAFTA and lower Iranian production given as reasons. WTI finished the third quarter down 1.2% but rose 3.5% in its last week, while Brent was up 4.1% for the quarter and 5% for the week. With OPEC production up, on October 4, WTI fell by the largest percentage in a day since August but still ended higher for the fourth week in a row, at $74.90. Brent was $84.72 after falling 2%. WTI finished at $71.34, down 4% for the week ending October 12, because of higher output and concerns about an economic slowdown. Brent was $80.34. With the fourth increase in U.S. crude supplies, and despite lower production due to Hurricane Michael, on October 18 WTI closed at $68.65, the lowest since September 13, after falling 4% over 2 days. Brent fell to $79.29, lowest since September 21. WTI fell 2.4% to $67.59 in the week ending October 26, the third down week, and Brent fell 2.7% to $77.62, due to higher production and worries about the world economy. The U.S. became the leading world oil producer, exceeding 11 million barrels a day for the first time ever. This along with the highest OPEC production since 2016 led to WTI dropping 2.5% on November 1 to $63.69, its lowest finish since April, after falling 10.8% in October. Brent fell 2.9% to $72.79, the lowest since August 21 and lower than the 200-day average for the first time since September 2017, after an 8.8% fall in October. Both benchmarks fell the most for a month since July 2016. Possible reductions in oil production, weak growth worldwide and the Trump administration policy of making exceptions to sanctions against Iran, for some buyers of Iranian oil all contributed to oil's sixth weekly loss. WTI dropped 6.2% for the week ending November 16 despite falling to $55.69 on November 13, the lowest close since November 16, 2017. Brent reached $66.76 on November 16, down 4.9%, after falling to $65.47 on November 13. Low demand and high U.S. inventories contributed to a 6.6% decline for WTI to $53.43, the lowest since October 26, 2017, on November 20. Brent fell 6.4% to $62.53, the lowest since February. At Thanksgiving, gas was $2.62, down more than 20 cents since the start of October. Oil fell the most for any month in ten years. WTI finished at $50.93, up 1% for the week but down 22% for the month, while Brent was $58.71, down 12% for the year. Higher production in the U.S., Russia and some OPEC countries meant too much supply. Losses would have been higher except for speculation about OPEC cuts. For the week ending December 21, WTI fell 11.4% to $45.59, the lowest since July 2017, and Brent fell 10.7% to $53.82, the lowest since September 2017. Higher U.S. interest rates, more active U.S. oil rigs, higher U.S. crude production and lower expected worldwide demand did not cancel out proposed production cuts by OPEC nations, including definite plans by Saudi Arabia. The same week, gas prices reached $2.37, the lowest in December in two years. WTI ended 2018 at $45.41 a barrel, off 10.8% the month, 38% for the fourth quarter, and 24.8% for 2018. Brent finished at $53.80 off over 8% for the month, 35% for the quarter, and 19.5% for the year. U.S. crude supplies were down while gasoline supplies were higher. 2019 Gasoline started 2019 at $2.23. WTI jumped 5 percent to $52.58 early on January 9, and Brent crude reached $61.58, with an announcement of expected production cuts by Saudi Arabia, though higher U.S. gasoline stocks kept oil from going even higher. Over eight days, oil was up 17 percent. Oil finished January up 18.5 percent (the best ever with records going back as far as 1984) with WTI at $53.79 one day after its highest finish since November, and Brent up 15 percent for the month to $61.89; both gains were the most for a month since April 2016. U.S. crude supplies were lower than expected and sanctions on Venezuela also contributed, as well as interest rate policy which sent stocks higher and the dollar lower. On the first week in February, WTI fell 4.6 percent, the most since December. Brent crude fell 1 percent. Reasons included an increase in U.S. oil rigs and efforts to get around Venezuela sanctions, as well as concerns over actions by OPEC nations. But WTI rose 5 percent the second week to $55.59, with Brent crude ending the week at $66.25, both the highest since November 19, with lower OPEC output and progress in trade talks between the United States and China. WTI rose 6.4 percent in February while Brent crude went up 6.7 percent. On March 1, WTI fell 2.5 percent to end the week at $55.80 while Brent crude fell 1.9 percent to $65.07. This was true even though OPEC output reached its lowest level in four years. U.S. economic reports indicated slower growth. On April 2, WTI closed at $62.58, its highest level since November 5, and Brent closed at $69.37, its highest since November 12. Brent ended the first week of April up 4.1 percent with its first close above $70 since November, and WTI was up for the fifth week, the longest streak since November 2017, finishing 4.9 percent higher at $63.08. Reasons included sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. U.S. inventories were down, but even a higher number of oil rigs did not cancel out the other factors. In the second week of April, WTI had its sixth gain for the week, while Brent had its third week with an increase. Both fell slightly April 15, WTI to $63.40 and Brent to $71.18, after a report Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov wondered if his country should continue participating in OPEC's lower production goals. U.S. crude production was \\"in record territory\\" and expected to go higher. The third week of April, though short because of the Good Friday holiday, ended with WTI at $64 for its seventh gain for the first time since February 2014. Brent rose for the fourth week, ending at $71.97. This happened even though U.S. crude stocks fell. On April 22, WTI rose to $66.30, with the highest settlement since October resulting from the Trump administration ending waivers for Iranian oil exports, even though U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that other countries would make up the difference. Though WTI fell due to higher U.S. crude supplies, Brent reached the highest close since October on April 24 before falling to $74.35 the next day. Gasoline reached $2.84 nationally and $4.70 in parts of California, finally reaching $2.91 on May 4 after rising 67 cents during 2019, the most since 2011 during the same period. WTI fell for the third week, to $61.66 with Brent falling to $70.62 after Trump's tariffs on imports from China increased, despite lower U.S. crude inventories. On May 23 when oil fell the most in a day since December (also falling below the 200-day moving average), WTI finished at $57.21, lowest since March 12, in a week when WTI lost nearly 7 percent; Brent finished the week at $68.69 for a nearly 5 percent loss. The declines for the week were the most all year. The trade war with China caused concerns, though possible actions by Trump helped slightly on May 24. Gas was $2.83, 14 cents lower than the previous Memorial Day. Although oil went up 2 percent June 13 after attacks on tankers, for the week oil was down as a result of forecasts for lower worldwide demand, with WTI finishing at $52.51 and Brent at $62.01. The next week WTI rose almost 9 percent for the week, the most since December 2016, to $57.43, the highest finish for the month. Brent was up 5 percent to $65.20. Reasons for the jump included expectations of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and Iran shooting down a drone. Gas was $2.68, but expected to go higher, especially in the mid-Atlantic states, after a Philadelphia refinery fire. Oil ended higher for the third of four weeks on July 12, WTI at $60.21 and Brent at $66.72 because of problems in the Middle East, lower U.S. inventories and Hurricane Barry. Both WTI and Brent reached their highest numbers since May. Other factors included OPEC nations continuing lower production into 2020, and manufacturing slowing in much of the world. The next week oil fell 7.6 percent, the most since May, WTI ending the week at $55.63 and Brent down 6 percent to $62.50, due to high world supplies and less damage from Barry than feared. U.S. crude inventories went down for the sixth straight week, the most since the beginning of 2018, and decreased production caused by Barry ended, so WTI ended July 24 at $55.88 and Brent at $63.18. WTI fell 7.9 percent on August 1, the most in one day in four years, to $53.95, the lowest since June 19. The next day WTI finished the week down, in response to Trump's plans for more tariffs. Brent fell 7 percent on August 1 and also ended the week lower. U.S. oil supplies were down for the first time in three weeks and WTI fell slightly on August 21 to $55.68, while Brent went over $60 for the first time in a week. Gasoline supplies went up after being expected to go down. With China responding to Trump tariffs by adding tariffs of its own to American products, WTI ended the week down just over 1 percent, to $54.17. Gas was $2.59 after falling for five weeks straight. Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said \\"[W]e suffer from a lack of clear direction.‚Äù Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said, \\"The threat of a presidential tweet that could dampen world demand is real\\". Oil went up August 27 with less concern about the China trade war, less chance Iran could export oil, expectations of lower U.S. supplies, and many producers following OPEC guidelines. WTI was up 2.4 percent to $54.93 and Brent rose 1.4 percent to $59.51. After three weeks of decreases in U.S. oil rigs and in U.S. crude supplies, WTI rose 2.6 percent to $56.32 on the first week of September, while Brent rose 3.9 percent to $61.54. On September 14, the 2019 Abqaiq‚ÄìKhurais attack caused the loss of 5 percent of the world's oil supply, and WTI jumped 14.7 percent, the most in one day since 2008, to $62.90, the highest since June. Brent rose by 14.6 percent, the most ever in one day, to $69.02. WTI rose 5.9 percent for the week, the most since June, to $58.09. Brent was up 6.7 percent, the most since January, to $64.28. Saudi Arabia restored production to where it was before the attacks. WTI finished the quarter at $55.23, down 5.2 percent, and Brent was $60.23, up 3.1 percent for the month but down 5.5 for the quarter. Gas was $2.64, down several cents for the week. After Trump announced a trade deal with China on October 11, oil fell 2 percent after reports that China wanted more talks before signing phase one of the deal. WTI had jumped 3.6 percent at the end of the week to the highest in two weeks before falling to $53.59. Brent rose 3.7 percent and then fell to $59.35. Slow growth in China and the fifth week of higher U.S. inventories led to a 1.7 percent loss for the week by WTI, ending the week at $53.78. Brent fell 1.8 percent to $59.42. On October 25 WTI finished at $56.66, the highest level since Sept. 24, after going up 5.2 percent. Brent finished at $62.02, its highest level since Sept. 26, after going up 4.4 percent. Reasons included the lowest number of active U.S. oil rigs since April 2017 and a decline in U.S. oil inventories. Then WTI fell as low as $54.61 and Brent fell to $60.66 with U.S. crude inventories expected to rise and a Russian official claiming it was too early to talk about OPEC production cuts. Oil reached its highest level in two months on November 21, with WTI at $58.58 and Brent at $63.98. Lower global supplies, partly the result of OPEC actions, were reasons, though high U.S. shale oil production and lower demand meant the trend might not continue. Brent rose 1.4 percent on the week ending December 20 to $66.14. This was the sixth rise in seven weeks, and the third up week for WTI, which ended at $60.44. Reasons included OPEC plans for more cuts and positive expectations about the world economy and U.S. relations with China. With U.S. crude inventories down more than predicted, WTI reached $61.68 on December 26, the highest since September, and Brent was at $67.92, also the most in over three months.

Schooling At the place of his birth, he finished elementary school and high school in Hradec Kralove. As a child, he showed a fondness for painting, while he showed less interest in school materials. At the age of fifteen, he made copies of paintings and illustrations in oil paints. In 1885 he went to the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He completed his studies in 1891, proving to be a student with enviable successes. His final work at the academy was \\"The Last Moments of Hus's Freedom\\" which was exhibited at the Jubilee Mediterranean Exhibition in Prague (1891). After his studies, for one year (1891-1983), he attended lectures at the Department of Historical Painting, with Professor August Eisenmenger at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, and after that, he worked as a freelance artist. Work He spent the next two years in the town of Arco Varignane, moving to Tyrol on the advice of a doctor, after he had returned symptoms of tuberculosis, from which he became ill during his studies. In Tyrol, where he resided (1893-1895) , he painted about forty works, including his most beautiful historical composition, \\"The First Death Victim\\" or \\"The Avely Death. During his studies in Prague in 1887, he was in Belgrade during a ceremony organized in honor of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, and at the time he saw that Belgrade did not have a private art school, so he decided to found one. In July 1895 he came to Belgrade again and in September of the same year, he opened the Serbian Drawing and Painting School, situated in the neighborhood of Kosanƒçiƒáev venac (Kosanƒçiƒá wreath), from Kalemegdan to Brankovog mosta (Branko's Bridge). After the attempt of Stevan Todoroviƒá thirty years earlier, Kutlik became the founder of the first private painting school in Belgrade, which became the cornerstone of art education in Serbia.The school had classes for full-time and part-time students, for artisans and for women (since 1897). Students were enrolled in the school regardless of nationality or religion.Initially, he gave only practical courses and later, theoretical instruction was introduced. French and German classes were also held for a while. The school had its own library and reproductions of paintings, reliefs and plaster models. He regularly published annual reports, and organized exhibitions of his students, with some of his work. His most notable student was Serbian painter Nade≈æda Petroviƒá,, though he had other Serbian artists equally talented in their own particular genre such as Milan Milovanoviƒá, Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá, Borivoje Stevanoviƒá, war painter Dragomir Gli≈°iƒá, Djordje Mihailoviƒá, Ljubomir Ivanoviƒá, Branko Popoviƒá, Natalija Cvetkoviƒá, Anƒëelia Lazareviƒá, and Rafailo Momƒçiloviƒá. In the summer of 1899, he married Milad Nekvasilov (Czech. Milada Nekvasilov√°), the daughter of Czech engineer Frantisek Nekvasilov. They both believed in his healing. They went on a wedding trip to Austria-Hungary. They also arrived to visit Kirill's parents, who in the meantime moved to Dehtare, Slovakia. Nine months later, however, Cyril had overcome the disease. He died on 4 April 1900 and was buried in the Belgrade New Cemetery,in the Nekvasila Family Tomb. His paintings were exhibited posthumously in Paris at the Exposition Universelle in 1900. Legacy Kiril Kutlik is part of an Early Modernist Movement in Serbia along with Anton A≈æbe, Beta Vukanoviƒá, Nade≈æda Petroviƒá, Mihailo Valtroviƒá, Milan Milovanoviƒá, Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá, Borivoje Stevanoviƒá, and Ljubomir Ivanoviƒá.

One contemporary source puts her age in 1812 as nine years old, meaning she would have been born in 1802 or 1803. Her father is usually named as the Italian noble Francesco Vio, but the fact that she was born in L√ºbeck makes it more likely that her parents were (Georg Friedrich) Wilhelm Vio and Philippine Vio (n√© Dupont) who were engaged in L√ºbeck from 1799 to 1809 and performed with Betty beginning in 1810 at the Bergisches Theater in D√ºsseldorf. Vio studied singing with Antonio Salieri and Giuseppe Ciccimarra in Vienna and was engaged at the Vienna State Opera in 1825. In 1829, she was hired at the Berlin Court Opera as a replacement for Henriette Sontag but followed her first husband Josef Spitzeder, whom she married in 1831, to Munich in 1832. After his death, she returned to Berlin, where their daughter Adele Spitzeder was born. She later married Franz Maurer and moved to Graz and had some engagements at the Carltheater in Vienna. In 1844, her daughter Adele persuaded Vio to move back to Munich, where the family lived with Adele's half-siblings and cousins. Vio died on 15 December 1872 in Munich.

Biography He was born in Durr√´s to a Serbian family from modern-day Montenegro, to father Evangel Bocariƒá and mother Anƒëelka Raiƒçeviƒá. At the age of fourteen, he left his parents' home and went to study painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Athens. In 1883 he returned to his homeland for the sake of making portraits of Petroviƒá dynasty, as well as prominent citizens of Budva and Kotor. In 1891, in Zadar, he married Anna Tofolo, with whom he had a son Sava and daughters Milica and Marija. He moved to Zagreb the following year. In addition to working on portraits, he also made religious compositions for Serbian Orthodox churches there. In 1896 he was already in Mostar, where his younger brother ≈†piro Bocariƒá joined him in 1897. They were the originators of the first, modern civic portraits in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1897 he moved to Sarajevo with his family. The image of \\"Guslar in the choir\\" was a reason because of which he had to flee to Belgrade before the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In the latter year of the 19th century, a plaster bust of Prince Nikola of Montenegro was made, so it is assumed that he resided in Montenegro that year. In 1900 he participated in the Exposition Universelle or better known as the World Exhibition in Paris, representing the Kingdom of Serbia. In the same year, he went to Istanbul to teach for the next five or six years. During this period, he designed the emblem of Ethiopia, which was in official use until 1975 and was commissioned for Emperor of Ethiopia Menelik II. From 1906 to 1908, he moved from Constantinople to Skopje where he continued to teach. In 1909 he ran the Balkan Art School in Thessaloniki. As of 1911 to 1932 he lived in Novi Sad and worked as a professor at the Women's School. Bocariƒá intensified his work on religious compositions and painted portraits of distinguished personalities living then in Vojvodina. In 1932 he settled in Perast where he continued to do what he preferred the most and that was painting portraits. There he also collaborated with like-minded painters who identified themselves with the same group of academically-trained, artists from the region. He died in Perast in 1944. Painting At its core, Bocariƒá was a romantic, he found reality in the nature of the story, but in his paintings, he could find a foothold in contemporary solutions as well as in his Woman in White. Painting a slender figure in a peplos, with a mantle on her right shoulder, Bocariƒá, through decorative elements (carpet and curtains in the background, linear rhythms), experiences the art of French masters, perhaps most of Th√©odore Chass√©riau, a master of decorative style. Many of the portraits that Bocariƒá did in Mostar and in Sarajevo are a series of parade creations, often made from photographs. Painting by Anastas Bocariƒá is really just a vestibule of Serbian modern art. Its true beginning can be accurately determined by the fact that zoographic painting pressed these spaces until the end of the nineteenth century.

A simple single-nave design, it is situated at the outskirts of the modern-day village of Abeliani, formerly known as Abelia. A reference to the diarchy in Georgia under the Mongol rule in an inscription on the church's southern wall makes it possible to date the construction to the period of 1250‚Äì1259. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia.  Location  The Abelia church is located at the foothills of Mount Sameba in the Kvemo Kartli region. This locale, first mentioned as Abelia in a document dated to 1580, was populated already in the Early Bronze Age as evidenced by the archaeological digs in the 1950s. The site has also yielded a 5th‚Äì3rd century BC necropolis with bronze, iron, and glassware artifacts, including seals with hunting scenes. The area, completely deserted in the 18th century and subsequently largely reclaimed by nature, was visited and its antiquities, including the Abelia church, were first described by the Georgian scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili in the early 1900s.  Architecture  Abelia church. Southern and western facades. Abelia is a small single-nave church which has largely preserved its original architectural form. It is built of large regular grey porous dolerite blocks and faced with hewn stone, with the exception of the vault which is made of rubble. An elongated hall is divided into two chambers by a middle supporting arch and terminates in a semi- circular apse on the east. The apse characteristically narrows in towards the conch. The sole entrance is on the south and each wall, with the exception of the northern one, is pierced with a single window. The interior had once been frescoed; with time, they have mostly faded away. Outer walls are extremely poor in decoration. On either side of the architrave stone there are two prominent brackets which had once probably supported arches of the now-lost annex. The church was renovated through a government-funded program in 2006.  Inscription  The southern facade is adorned with a lengthy inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, arranged in 23 horizontal lines. The inscription is made in the name of Arsen Mshuidaisdze, archbishop of Manglisi, and mentions the coregnant kings of Georgia, David Ulu and David Narin, the former's wife Queen Tamar-Khatun and their son Giorgi. Tamar was a Christian, and royal name, of Jigda-Khatun, a Seljuq or Mongol princess by origin. The text then goes on lamenting hardships the church-builders had to endure at the time when \\"the Tatars had conquered this kingdom and the whole of the country\\", a reference to the Mongol domination of Georgia.

Lying-in is an archaic term for childbirth (referring to the month-long bed rest prescribed for postpartum confinement). The Lying-in Hospital moved to a purpose-built facility in New Bridge Street designed by John Dobson in 1826. After the Lying-in Hospital in New Bridge Street was deemed inadequate, a new facility was built in Jubilee Road and officially opened by Princess Mary as the Princess Mary Maternity Hospital in 1923. During the Second World War the hospital moved to the old home of the Northern Counties Orphans' Institution in Jesmond.

It has two plots. The main plot involves a number of unsolved murders of homeless people. The second involves a charge of rape by a male employee against his female supervisor in an advertising agency. In the main plot Lindsay and her partner, Rich Conklin, get involved in the homeless murders when a homeless woman comes to Lindsay to complain that the detectives who should be investigating the cases are doing basically nothing. The murders are occurring in a jurisdiction outside of Lindsay's area of responsibility. She makes waves and files a complaint against one of the detectives who is in charge of the investigations. Then a murder happens on Lindsay's turf. In the meantime the detective against whom Lindsay filed a complaint files one against Lindsay and both officers go before a review board. To make matters worse Lindsay begins feelings weak and fears an old illness that nearly killed her has come back. The second plot involves another member of the Women's Murder Club, Yuki Castellano, an attorney with the district prosecutor's office. She is prosecuting the rape case. She is finding this case full of twists and turns and she is going head to head against a very accomplished defense attorney. Yuki worries not only about winning such a case, but her husband seems to be going through some sort of problems and Yuki would like to know exactly what they are. Reviews A review of this book in Book Reporter is positive. The review concludes, \\"While THE 17th SUSPECT is complete in itself, it does leave an element of the book dangling treacherously at the conclusion.

It gained critical acclaim due to its original concept of being one of the first snowmobile racing titles. The game features snowmobiles (referred to as sleds), stunts and fourteen snow-covered courses consisting of slippery slopes, inclement weather and treacherous cliffs. Six racers were selectable from the outset and two more were unlockable, each of which had different snowmobile handling attributes. Gameplay The game has purchasable upgrades for the riders' snowmobiles which can improve handling, acceleration, and more. A trick feature may be performed by using two shoulder buttons in combination with the direction pad. The combination of buttons used determines what trick is performed. It is also possible to multi-combo on higher jumps to gain an even higher score. After defeating the mountain races, the player can unlock the storm sled, which is a thin, quick and agile sled capable of outracing even the fastest standard sleds. Sled Storm offers two forms of racing for both multi-player and solo competition: Championship and Quick Race. Quick Race allows the player to play any of the available courses unlocked during the Championship Mode. The player selects from a pool of characters, each with a unique sled rated in five areas: top speed, acceleration, handling, stability and tricks. After selecting a character, the player can set the number of laps (from two to nine), time of the race (day or night), and even the weather conditions (clear, snow or rain). Championship Mode involves competing in a series of races to earn money as well as open up additional tracks and hidden characters. Two types of championship racing are available: Open Mountain and the Super SnoCross. The Open Mountain Championship involves straightforward racing down alpine terrain to receive a cash prize for winning. Cash may then be used to purchase upgrades such as treads, skis, brakes and spotlights. The Super SnoCross involves racing strictly for points earned by performing tricks on motocross-inspired courses. Earning enough points unlocks additional playable characters Sled Storm also features a Time Trials mode, in which the player races to earn a spot on the leader board for the fastest time. After the Time Trials, there are a number of customizable features to tailor the game to individual preferences. After completing a few circuits, the player is able to mix and match the unlocked courses to form a custom championship. The AI can also be tweaked by toggling \\"Catch Up Logic\\", meaning the CPU-controlled racers will move faster once the player passes them. Finally, the multi-player perspective can be set to either a portrait or landscape view to show more or less of the screen while racing. Players can also save unlocked characters, upgraded sleds and circuit progress using a memory card with one block free. The game includes support for the DualShock Analog Controller to offer both analog control as well as vibration feedback while racing. In addition, the included soundtrack features songs from the likes of Rob Zombie, Econoline Crush, √úberzone, E-Z Rollers and Dom & Roland. Once players are through racing, they can put the disc into a standard CD player and listen to the music. Development The first game in the Sled Storm series was released on the PlayStation video game console. The extreme racing element of Sled Storm derived from an earlier Electronic Arts game called Road Rash. While the environments and vehicles are completely different (motorcycles versus snowmobiles and the open road versus alpine courses), there are several similarities. Both titles rely on fast-paced racing with a number of hazards placed in the player's path and include the ability to ram opponents off the track. Both also feature cash prizes that allow the player to purchase faster vehicles. The courses were extensively produced as they contained many shortcuts and alternate routes to complete a level. They could be played with day, night, sunny, and snow settings to make each race experience slightly different. Sled Storm significantly expanded on the number of features found in Road Rash and was one of the few racing titles for the original PlayStation to include four-player support through a PlayStation Multitap and feature split-screen action with more than two players. Reception and legacy Sled Storm was met with critical acclaim upon its release on July 31, 1999. The game received an average score of 83% based on 24 reviews on the review aggregator Game Rankings. Alex C of Computer and Video Games gave the game an average score, although he praised the game for having a \\"killer combination of brilliant programming and an idea fresh as a mountain stream\\", and also claimed that the \\"vehicle physics\\" and \\"exciting course design\\" made the game \\"totally absorbing, plus its great to watch.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly was positive of the game and commented on how \\"the crew likes this game ‚Äì even John, who has previously complained about how horrible Extreme Sports games are and how they all need to die.\\" The game also received the Game of the Month and the Editor's Choice Silver Award from the publication that same year. GamePro gave the game 4/5 and in the review claimed that \\"EA offers a user-friendly, high-action racing game for the winter-sports enthusiast who likes to stay warm and cozy\\" and concluded the review saying, \\"If you like racing games, check this one out. It's low- maintenance winter sport excitement, with an extreme look and feel. Sled Storm takes snow business seriously!\\" Chris Charla reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"An amazing physics engine combined with the novelty of snowmobiles makes this the most unique PlayStation racer since Jet Moto 1. A must-buy.\\" Game Revolution described the game as \\"a pleasant surprise\\" and cited that the game \\"has plenty of big tracks, a variety of tricks and upgrades, and multiplayer support,\\" and also explained how \\"The level design and character animation are also commendable. The levels are long and showcase a great variety of terrain and creative jumps\\"; the review also praised the audio, claiming, \\"the sound effects are good enough to keep your heart pounding as you wind the turns,\\" ending the review with, \\"If you are a snowmobile racing fan looking for a snowmobile racing game, then Sled Storm is a must buy. Look no further, this game is for you.\\" Nelson Turac of GameSpot awarded the game a score of 8.1 of 10 and praised the general aspects of the game, saying that \\"the speed, control, and graphics seem to strike an excellent rapport with the gameplay design. The game runs at a crisp frame rate throughout the track, with never any slowdown (even in split-screen mode)\\" and later applauding the visual effects: \\"The graphics overall look solid, and some lighting effects are rather impressive - notably in later stages when night racing becomes available (another challenge gamers must adapt to).\\" He also praised the audio, saying, \\"Their musical offerings blend in well with the game's intense racing mentality, while the sound effects and racer trash-talk seem adequate enough.\\" He concluded that ‚Äúany gamer looking for a uniquely fresh adrenaline rush, Sled Storm makes for one very worthy purchase\\". Doug Perry of IGN awarded the game 8.0/10 and commended the game, saying that he ‚Äúliked this game from the beginning. It's well designed, smart looking, and realistic as they come.\\" He also added that \\"From the slick, easy-to-access interface, to the muscular upgrade system, to the deep, well-designed courses, Sled Storm is addictive and fun.\\" Sled Storm is often recognized as the key title involved in popularizing the snow racing game genre. The idea of the player being able to compete in several different Arctic environments, not only with yourself but with several other players, and perform several different stunts and tricks has been a formula used in many games since. Examples include Ski-doo X-team Racing, Sno-Cross Extreme, Evolution Snocross, SSX and Arctic Thunder. The game is also arguably the reason that EA Sports BIG was introduced in the year 2000 as several other titles were created around the design and gameplay of the original Sled Storm . =Soundtrack= Sled Storm included a soundtrack which could be played on a normal CD player. #Rob Zombie ‚Äì \\"Dragula (Hot Rod Herman Remix)\\" #Econoline Crush ‚Äì \\"Sparkle And Shine (Throttle Mix)\\" #Econoline Crush ‚Äì \\"Nowhere Now (White Out Mix)\\" #Econoline Crush ‚Äì \\"Surefire (Avalanche Mix)\\" #E-Z Rollers ‚Äì \\"Cop Theme\\" #Dom & Roland ‚Äì \\"Chained On Two Sides\\" #Dom & Roland ‚Äì \\"Thunder\\" #√úberzone ‚Äì \\"Botz (Synthetik Remix)\\" #Jeff van Dyck ‚Äì \\"Sweet Baby\\" #Jeff van Dyck ‚Äì \\"That's Grouse\\" References Category:1999 video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:EA Sports games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"Sled Storm (1999 video game)"},{"id":"61425491","text":"Cristina Elizabeth Recalde Caba√±as (born 29 March 1994) is a Paraguayan footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Club Sol de Am√©rica and the Paraguay women's national team.

Her work encompasses illustration, installation, sculpture, and photography. Shortt's work has been shown in museums and public parks throughout New York City, and deals with various themes, including equality, disability, community, and race. Work =Elmhurst Sculpture Garden= In 2017, Shortt established the Elmhurst Sculpture Garden in an abandoned parking lot in Elmhurst, Queens, New York with the help of local community volunteers and artists. With additional funding by the Burning Man Global Arts Grant in 2017 and the National Endowment of the Arts Grant in 2018, the community garden was able to expand in area space.Fiscal Year 2019, First Round Artistic Discipline/Field List, National Endowment of the Arts pg 76. Accessed July 26, 2019. Under Shortt's leadership, the garden serves as an arts incubator for artists to exhibit their pieces, as well as receive guidance in obtaining grants to revitalize public spaces in their communities. = Public art = Peppermint Pieces and Waking Blind In 2018, Shortt produced two pieces inspired by her retinitis pigmentosa condition. She was selected to display one of her outdoor art installation pieces, Peppermint Pieces, as part of the Art in the Parks: Active Open Space initiative, which is funded by the Public Health in New York, Inc. on behalf of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in partnership with the City of New York Parks and Recreation. Peppermint Pieces is a multimedia piece made of wood and aluminum on display in Captain Tilly Park in Jamaica. Shortt's cement sculpture piece, Waking Blind, is also inspired by the artist's eye condition, which is displayed in Elmhurst Sculpture Garden. Pavillion Landing Shortt was among the recipients of the Art in the Parks: Alliance for Flushing Meadows Corona Park 2019 Grant to create an art installation that follows the theme, Flushing Meadows Corona Park: A Park for the Future. Inspired by the 1964-65 New York World's Fair, Shortt created the sculpture piece, Pavillion Landing, with the aid of park goers and community members during several collaborative sculpting sessions at the park. The piece, which features stranded intergalactic children, is on display at the David Dinkins Circle in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park. Rigged? In 2018, Friends of MacDonald Park in Forest Hills commissioned Shortt to create an outdoor piece that addressed the political, social, and economic systems in the United States, which resulted in the creation of the piece Rigged?. The maze structure, with its accompanying cement rabbits and carrots, is continuously updated depending on the general public's feedback about the piece. = Women Who Build - Artists Who Own= In 2016, Shortt led an investigative project that analyzed the role of women, or the lack thereof, in the construction industry. With funding provided by the Awesome Foundation, the Queens Council on the Arts, and Culture Push, with additional support from the Eileen Fisher Activating Leadership Grant, Shortt separated the project in two phases. The first phase involved a construction workshop series, where over 100 women were taught basic construction skills and equipment handling. The first phase concluded with the creation of a tiny house on wheels, which is now used as a tea and zen garden. In the second phase, Shortt commissioned 13 artists so that they can create various interactive installations that prompted community engagement and conversation over the housing crisis in New York City. Among the installations include performing art pieces, participatory embroidery, photography, and more. All installations were then photographed and documented in the exhibition Dwelling at the Queens Museum. = RPGA Studio, Inc. = In 2009, Shortt established Rego Park Green Alliance, an art organization that addressed community awareness of several important issues affecting the communities of Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, Rego Park, and other surrounding neighborhoods in Queens.

He was the son of W. C. Shelly, a onetime Member of the BC Legislative Assembly (1928‚Äì33) and provincial finance minister. The elder Shelly was also co- founder of Shelly Brothers Ltd., a successful commercial bakery in Vancouver. In the early 1930s, Leon Shelly was involved in managing and developing the Grouse Mountain Resort in North Vancouver, another of his father's business ventures. In 1936, Shelly assumed control of two existing motion picture service companies in Vancouver. Motion Skreenadz Limited had been founded in 1920, and was initially operated by J. Howard Boothe and Harry Rosenbaum. Skreenadz specialized in the production of theatrical advertising trailers or \\"screen ads,\\" but later expanded to make promotional shorts and travelogues for the local market.\\"Screen Ads by Skreenadz,\\" a contribution on the film history blog Seriously Moving Images (Dec. 2018). The blog entry features video files showing three extant examples of Skreenadz advertising trailers, ca. 1928‚Äì37. Vancouver Motion Pictures Limited, founded in 1928 by Roger Bourne and Charles Lambly, initially provided film laboratory and technical services. The companies both had offices in the film exchange building at 1216 Burrard (at Davie) in downtown Vancouver. With the help of cinematographer and technical wizard E. Wallace (Wally) Hamilton, Shelly updated the facilities and equipment necessary for film production, including optical sound recording, an essential component for commercial motion pictures. By the late 1930s, Shelly was producing quality industrial and sponsored films for the BC market, eventually combining the operations of the two companies under the name Vancouver Motion Pictures.  Vancouver Motion Pictures  Under Shelly's leadership, Vancouver Motion Pictures emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as an active and busy production house, creating dozens of sponsored promotional and industrial shorts. The company and its staff would play an important early part in the development of the Vancouver film industry. Notable clients included the BC Government Travel Bureau, BC Packers, Kelly Douglas Limited, and the Powell River Company. Shelly's operation brought professional colour film production to Vancouver, adopting the Cinecolor bi-pack (two-negative) colour process. On three bigger-budget 35 mm films produced for the Travel Bureau in 1940‚Äì42,Beautiful British Columbia, British Columbia Sports [aka Evergreen Playland], and North of the Border. intended for theatrical distribution to US audiences, he hired experienced crew members from Hollywood, including cinematographer Ray Fernstrom, narrator Gayne Whitman, and editor Ed Taylor. The regular staff working at Vancouver Motion Pictures included many people who would play important roles in the development of the Canadian film and television industry. They included directors Oscar C. Burritt, Lew M. Parry, and Ed Taylor; cinematographers Oscar C. Burritt, Wally Hamilton, Ernie Kirkpatrick, Don Lytle, and Mel Parry; editors Maureen Balfe and Hellen Semmens; and titling artist/art director/animator Marguerite Roozeboom (n√©e Goulding). In 1942‚Äì43, VMP began filming BC sequences for the National Film Board of Canada, which used the material in films for its propaganda series Canada Carries On and World In Action. In spring 1943, a film industry trade journal reported that the company \\"working full blast these days in commercial and government work.\\"Canadian Moving Picture Digest, March 20, 1943, p. 8.

Much of the VMP staff went east to work there. However, Lew Parry stayed in Vancouver and started his own production company, eventually becoming BC's most prolific filmmaker. Marguerite Roozeboom was art director and animator on many of Parry's films, and eventually founded Pageant Productions with her husband, cinematographer Bill Roozeboom.Duffy, Camera West, pp. 12‚Äì15. Based in Toronto, Shelly was able to expand his clientele base to include interprovincial and national companies. One of his productions, Beans of Bounty (1948), was co-winner in the Non-Theatrical category at the first Canadian Film Awards presentation in 1949.

Originally named 'Mullard Jubilee, it was introduced into Australia in 1970 as 'Electron'. The rose was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 1973. Description 'Electron' is a medium-tall upright shrub, up to 2‚Äî4 ft (60‚Äî120 cm) in height. Blooms are 4‚Äî5 in (10‚Äî12 cm) in diameter, with 32 to 40 petals. The rose has a sweet, Damask fragrance. The large, high-centered, cup-shaped petals are generally borne singly on long stems. The petals are bright pink in color. The plant has very prickly stems and dark green glossy leaves. 'Electron' thrives in cool climates, but is prone to fungal diseases in warmer areas. It is recommended for USDA zones 4 and warmer. History =McGredy roses= The Sam McGredy family represents four generations of rose hybridizers from Northern Ireland. The first Samuel McGredy (1828 -1903), established the family nursery in Portadown, County Armagh. Originally, the head gardener at a large estate, in 1888, McGredy moved his family to Portadown, leased 10 acres with a greenhouse and established a nursery with his son, Samuel II (1861-1926). The nursery sold a variety of plants, but they were best known for their fruit trees and show pansies. Samuel McGredy II began breeding roses in 1895. He submitted his first roses at the National Rose Society in London in 1905, where he won his first gold medal, the salmon-pink, \\"Countess of Gosford\\" rose. He produced many award winning roses during his career as a rose breeder. McGredy was awarded the National Rose Society's Dean Hole Medal in 1921. The business passed to his son, Samuel McGredy III (1897-1934), after Samuuel II's death in 1926. Samuel III (Sam) expanded rose production at the company. He named many roses after family members. 'Margaret McGredy', named after his mother, was used, along with an unnamed seedling, to hybridize the world famous hybrid tea, Rosa Peace. The nursery's rose breeding program declined after McGredy's early death of a heart attack at the age of 38 and the beginning of World War II. His son, Samuel IV was two years old at the time of his father's death. Rosa 'Eye Paint', 1976 When Samuel McGredy IV (Sam) (1931-2019) took over the family business in 1952, he knew very little about rose breeding. He sought out the renowned rose hybridizers at the time: Reimer Kordes from Germany, Eugene Boerner from the United States and Niels Poulsen from Denmark, in order to educate himself on modern rose hybridization. Soon after, he created a new rose breeding program at the nursery. McGredy's first commercial success was his Gold Medal winner, floribunda rose, 'Orangeade' in 1959. During the 1960s, McGredy was best known for his hybrid tea and floribunda roses. Rosa 'Handel', 1975 In 1972, alarmed over the increasing political violence in Northern Ireland, McGredy and his family moved to Auckland, New Zealand. He transplanted his nursery stock and renamed the company, McGredy Roses International. New Zealand's climate, ideal for plant cultivation, allowed McGredy to breed roses outdoors without greenhouses. He soon introduced a new series of what he called 'hand painted' roses, brightly coloured striped roses and roses splashed with two or more colours. Some of his most popular rose cultivars include Rosa 'Dublin Bay, Rosa 'Sexy Rexy', Rosa 'Olympiad' and Rosa 'Handel'. When McGredy retired in 2007, he closed the nursery. He died in 2019. ='Mullard Jubilee'= McGredy's early goals in rose breeding were the development of healthy, vigorous roses that would meet the growing demand for distinctive roses, both in the United Kingdom and the United States. By the 1960s he was becoming more innovative, creating new vibrantly coloured, distinctive hybrid tea and floribunda roses. In 1962, McGredy used the hybrid tea, Rosa 'Paddy McGredy' and floribunda rose, Rosa 'Prima Ballerina', to develop a new electric pink hybrid tea rose. That year, the Mullard Electronics Company in Britain, offered McGredy the unprecedented fee of ¬£10,000 ($24,000) for a new rose cultivar to be named for the company. The company requested a future award- winner, a \\"world-beater\\", according to McGredy. The new electric pink rose was chosen to bear the Mullard name and was introduced in Europe as 'Mullard Jubilee' in 1970. The new cultivar was also introduced into Australia in 1970 as 'Electron'. In his 1982 book, Look to the Rose, McGredy discusses his famous rose: The rose won several awards, including gold medals from the Royal National Rose Society (RNRS) (1969), The Hague Rose Trials (1970), Belfast International Rose Trials (1972) and Portland Rose Society (1973). The cultivar was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 1973.

Biography Nina Yeliseyevna Afanasyeva was born on February 29, 1939 in the village of Varsino. Her parents were Sami, and she grew up with the Kildin S√°mi language as her mother tongue. In 1963, she completed her studies in pedagogy at the Institute of the Peoples of the North in Leningrad and worked until 1983 as a teacher of Russian language and literature as well as German in adult education in the cities of Apatity and Murmansk. Since 1980, Afanasyeva has been working on the conservation and development of the endangered Sami languages on the Kola Peninsula. She is co-author of the first Kildin Sami-Russian dictionary, which was published in 1985 under the editorship of Rimma Kurutsch. In addition to the dictionary, Afanasyeva co- authored the publication of a series of textbooks and didactic materials for the Kildin language. She is also the author of a Kildin Sami-Russian phrasebook (2010). Since the time of perestroika, Afanasyeva has been active as a Sami politician and minority activist. She was instrumental in founding the Association of S√°mi in Murmansk Oblast in 1998 and headed this NGO from 1990 to 2010, serving as president. Afanasyeva is fluent not only in Kildin Sami and Russian, but also in Northern Sami and German. She has been working publishing a dictionary for her native dialect, which has hardly been documented by linguists so far. For this purpose, she has been working for several years on the systematization of the familiar vocabulary and collects, with the help of the few surviving speakers, new words, phrases, and place names from the area of their forcibly-displaced birthplace. On November 23, 2012, Afanasyeva and Alexandra Antonova were awarded the Sami Language Prize Gollegiella (\\"Golden Language\\") together during the session of the Norwegian Parliament in Oslo. The award was presented on December 19 at the Norwegian Consulate General in Murmansk.

Godsey is the co- founder of the Ohio Innocence Project (OIP), which seeks to exonerate and overturn the convictions of people who have been wrongfully convicted. Drawing on Godsey's experience as a prosecutor for the Southern District of New York prior to his work at OIP, the book examines how the culture of the justice system is complicit in wrongful convictions. It was published in 2017 by the University of California Press.  Synopsis  The book is part-memoir in which Godsey describes his personal journey from being a \\"hard-nosed prosecutor\\" to the co-founder of the Ohio Innocence Project. Godsey began teaching law in 2001, and was assigned to serve as the faculty supervisor for the Kentucky Innocence Project. He did not believe that innocent people were in prison, and thought that students were naive to try to prove the innocence of those who had been convicted. The book's six main chapters each focus on one of the systematic flaws Godsey sees: \\"blind denial,\\" \\"blind ambition,\\" \\"blind bias,\\" \\"blind memory,\\" \\"blind intuition,\\" and \\"blind tunnel vision\\". The two most frequent contributors to wrongful conviction are false eyewitness accounts and problems with forensic science. The book illustrates how these problems have led to wrongful convictions in cases taken up the by Ohio Innocence Project. Godsey writes that judges, prosecutors, and police contribute to wrongful convictions by taking ‚Äúunreasonable and intellectually dishonest positions‚Äù and that they operate \\"under a bureaucratic fog of denial.\\" He sees the system as routinely dehumanizing suspects in the eyes of prosecutors. = Blind Denial = In the chapter on \\"blind denial\\", Godsey addresses prosecutors' and law enforcement's psychological denial of their fallibility and the possibility that they could have made a mistake. He gives the example of Clarence Elkins, who was convicted on rape, assault, and murder charges in 1998. He was initially convicted on the basis of \\"looking like\\" the attacker, despite an alibi and an absence of physical evidence. When later DNA testing showed that he was not the source of the skin cells and semen found at the crime scene, prosecutors put forth improbable theories to explain why Elkins must still be guilty. Godsey uses this example to illustrate the judicial system's resistance to new evidence and the possibility of having been wrong. = Blind Ambition = The chapter \\"blind ambition\\" addresses the political factors affecting judges and prosector. Godsey writes that elected judges know that a \\"tough on crime\\" approach wins votes, leading some judges to lean on a record of toughness rather than fairness. Here, Godsey cites the case of Chris Bennett, who was convicted of vehicular manslaughter and sought to overturn the conviction based on evidence that he was a passenger rather than the driver of the car involved in an accident. In the cases of both Clarence Elkins and Chris Bennett, local prosecutors and judges denied the validity of new evidence, and the convictions were over turned at the state level. Godsey sees these local officials' unwillingness to overturn a conviction as a symptom of the political system that incentivizes conviction over exoneration. = Blind Bias = The bias Godsey refers to in the \\"Blind Bias\\" chapter is Confirmation bias, the tendency of people to favor evidence that supports what they already believe. In this chapter, he notes that prosecutors often tell forensic specialists what the prosecutors want to find or believe to be correct; that foreknowledge undercuts the scientific method and primes the forensic experts to come to particular conclusions. = Blind Memory = The \\"blind memory\\" chapter addresses addresses the fallibility of human memory and memory's susceptibility to the power of suggestion. Citing memory expert Elizabeth Loftus, he notes that human memory is subject to constant subconscious editing that changes the details of what is remembered, while leaving the thinker unaware of how the memory has changed over time. He gives the example of John Jerome White, who was convicted of rape, and who served twenty-two years before being exonerated by DNA evidence. White did not match the description of the perpetrator that the victim gave to police, but his face was in the first batch of photos shown to the victim, and she selected his as a possible culprit. When the victim was then shown a lineup of possible suspects, she again selected White as the perpetrator. DNA evidence later showed that the probable actual perpetrator was in the lineup as well, but was not selected. Godsey hypothesizes that when the victim was initially shown an array of photographs and selected White, White replaced the actual attacker in her memory. Similarly, Godsey notes a study showing that police interrogation techniques can cause a person to form new artificial memories. Godsey contends that human memory is highly fallible, but is treated as evidence all the same. = Blind Intuition = In the \\"blind intuition\\" chapter, Godsey discusses human's belief in their ability to correctly identify deceptive behavior. He cites the case of David Ayers, who spent twelve years in prison before his murder conviction was overturned. When he sued the detectives whose testimony had led to his wrongful conviction, one claimed to have never arrested an innocent person in her career, saying that she was \\"a human lie detector, with no rate of error.\\" Ayers won his suit. = Blind Tunnel Vision = In the chapter on \\"blind tunnel vision,\\" Godsey describes a prosecutorial penchant for becoming attached to one interpretation of events and being unwilling to consider alternatives. He returns to the case of Clarence Elkins and the prosecutor's adherence to a version of events not supported by a preponderance of evidence. He notes that while Elkins spent seven and half years in jail for crimes he did not commit, the actual perpetrator remained free for several years and committed further crimes before being caught. Thus, the prosecutor's attachment to an incorrect version of events led to both Elkins's unjust imprisonment and to several additional crimes. = Conclusion = In a final chapter entitled \\"Seeing and Accepting Human Limitations\\", Godsey argues that knowing the human propensities outlined in the preceding chapters, the justice system needs to be reformed to limit the impact of these failings. He writes that greater care in handling witnesses and more comprehensive use of video recording to capture interrogations from beginning to end can help fight the \\"massive disaster\\" of wrongful convictions.  Reception  Blind Injustice was published in 2017 and received several positive reviews, largely in politically progressive media outlets. Rutgers University law professor George C. Thomas III wrote an extensive review for the Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law; he wrote ‚ÄúGodsey‚Äôs book is splendid. Everyone who cares the least bit about justice must read it.‚Äù The Progressive listed it as one of \\"Our favorite books of 2017.\\" A review in Salon described the book as \\"compelling\\" and called Godsey \\"one of the heroes we need now more than ever\\" for his work exonerating the wrongfully imprisoned.  Related work  The book served as the basis for the 2019 opera of the same title, which was developed as a collaboration between the Ohio Innocence Project, the Young Professionals Choral Collective in Cincinnati, and the Cincinnati Opera.

The palazzo is also called the House of Desdemona. History Palazzo Contarini Fasan is a peculiar structure built in the 15th century and once owned by the Contarini family. Over the centuries, the palazzo has attracted substantial attention as a home of Desdemona, a character from Shakespear's Othello. According to a legend, Nicola Contarini, a famous heroic leader in the wars against the Turks in the 1500s, once lived in the palazzo. He was said to have had the very dark skin so as to be nicknamed \\"Moor\\". Contarini's wife, Palma Querini was exhausted by the brutal jealousy of her husband, so she returned to her family. Another legend says that Shakespeare's Othello in fact was modeled after Cristoforo Moro (hence the nickname \\"the Moor\\"). Moro was Admiral of the Venetian fleet. In 1515, he married a daughter of Donato from Lezze, nicknamed \\"White Devil\\" (hence the name \\"Desdemona\\"). In 1508, Moro lost his wife while travelling to Crete under dubious circumstances. Architecture The palazzo is a narrow building with a high fa√ßade. The window layout is typical for the Venetian Gothic architecture and consists of three levels. In the ground floor, there are three small rectangular windows (there is no access to the water); on the first noble floor there is a trifora with balcony with openings supported by small columns of white stone. The second noble floor has two monoforas. Between them, under a small square opening, there is a large bas- reliefed coat of arms of the Contarini family. The top of the fa√ßade terminates with a dentilled cornice with the 15th-century frescoes that once embellished the surface. On the left side, an overpass connects the building with the adjacent structure. The overpass has a single-light window, similar to those on the facade. The renowned art historian John Ruskin wrote in his The Seven Lamps of Architecture that the palazzo was \\"the most elaborate piece of architecture in Venice.\\" Gallery Naya, Carlo (1816-1882) - n. 64 - Venezia - Palazzo Contarini Fasan 3.jpgPhoto by Carlo Naya (1870s) Palazzi Contarini Fasan e Ferro.jpgFrom La patria, geografia dell‚ÄôItalia by Gustavo Strafforello (1902) Palazzo Contarini Fasan on Grand Canal by Boston Public Library.jpgPhoto by Paolo Salviati Casa Contarini Fasan Venice Ruskin.jpgFrom Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites by Robert Hewison (2000) Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6342968.jpgBalcony, photo by Paolo Monti (1969) Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Venezia, 1969) - BEIC 6331405.jpgBalcony details, photo by Paolo Monti (1969) References Category:Houses completed in the 15th century Contarini Fasan Contarini Fasan Category:Gothic architecture in Venice ","title":"Palazzo Contarini Fasan"},{"id":"61425963","text":"Fernando Valles (born 9 October 1944) is a Mexican gymnast.

This musical art is thought to be predated Angkorian period and probably dated back to as early as the 9th century. Mohaori became more popular and further developed in the Post-Angkorian era until the present days. The songs and lyrics of Mohaori music normally depict the beauty and admiration of nature, and the confession of love. The Music played by this Khmer ensemble is gentle and fluid which is suitable for an entertainment in Cambodian social and traditional events. Nowadays, Mohaori is still a popular Khmer traditional music played in various occasions and festivities.  Etymology  The word Mohaori or Mahori is derived from the sanskrit word \\"Manohari\\" for female and \\"Manohara\\" for male and came into existence since before Angkorian period. Based on Khmer inscription, K 400 dated in 9th century, these words are the name of the male and female servant of Devatas (angels) which have the role of playing music. Moreover, the stone inscription K 806 of Pre Rup temple dated in 10th century, also associated with these words which used in the poetry \\"Kavei Manohar\\" means Manohara author. The word Mohaori is derived from these words: Manohara > Manohari and eventually became Mohaori until today. Based on this Khmer artistic evidence, this Mohaori art or ensemble is the name of an art which dated back more than a thousand year. Although, there were many obstacles (wars, foreign invasions,...) the life of Khmer people have been closely linked with this art and catch up with it until now. Moreover, based on a research Music and Dance in Ancient Cambodia compiled by Saveros Pou as confirmed as evidence in Old Khmer Epigraphy, the Manohara and Manohari were name of favourite (music) artist that does not exist in the present day. The form of Mahaori illustrated through the Mohaori assemble accompanied by soft- sounded musical instruments which make the liseners feel entertained, happy, and release stress. In Khmer language, Mohaori is also the name of a kind of bird with beautiful and melodious voice which its name shared the same characteristic of Mohaori music.  History  Emile Gsell. Mohaori existed longs ago in ancient Cambodia since the time Khmer people settled in Cambodia. This type of music is not entirely derived from India. Mohaori was probably existed before or during Angkorian period and later adopted by the Thais of Ayutthaya Kingdom. In 1931, Prince Damrong, the author of the History of Thai Music had asserted that the Thai mahori was of Khmer origin and created by the ancient Khmer and later adopted and elaborated in Thai society. This means that the Khmer Mohaori orchestra had already established during Angkor period, though believed having established much older. After the fall of Angkor, Mohaori became popular in Thai Ayuthayan court and more developed in the Khmer court of Longvek. Later on Mohaori become the traditional ensemble for both states. During Longvek era, the Mohaori was played by men musicians only but later during Udong, the players were mostly women and the female singer sang a beautiful song as melodious as the voice of Nori or Mohaori bird. In observation, Mohaori ensemble was likely created from Phleng Kar ensemble (Marriage ensemble) and Pinpeat ensemble in combination. As most of the musical instruments used in this ensemble are taken from both Phleng Kar ensemble and Pinpeat ensemble. Some believd that Mohaori music once was the property of the royal palace for the Kings, ministers, officials, and high- ranking people only. But later on, it became ordinary music for the public and citizens across Cambodia.  Musical Instruments used in Mohaori Ensemble  The characteristics of Mohaori is that it is the musical ensemble which has a proper clear, fixed, and well-organized for both the lyrics, music rhythm, and wording of the sing which make the listeners feel comfortable, entertained, and fresh.

Its construction followed unsuccessful attempts in 1793 and 1810 to construct a canal from Abergavenny to the Wye at Hereford. Two other similar but unsuccessful tramroad schemes were also promoted in 1810. The railway was constructed from a coal wharf on the canal east by way of Llanfoist, across the River Usk by means of a bridge constructed immediately adjacent to the existing road bridge, on its upstream side, but at a higher level above the river, then north past Abergavenny to the village of Llanvihangel Crucorney where it met with the Grosmont Railway.

Howell, and later transferred to the city's Metropolitan Utilities District. It was the first formally recognized broadcasting station in the state of Nebraska, and was deleted in mid-1923. History Future U.S. senator Robert B. Howell was WOU's original licensee.\\"Gas Man Candidate for U. S. Senate\\", Gas-Age Record, July 29, 1922, page 134. WOU was first licensed on late 1921 to Robert B. Howell, general manager of Omaha, Nebraska's Metropolitan Utilities District. Howell's interest in radio broadcasting dated back to 1908, when, in the face of opposition from one of the city's newspapers to his plan for Omaha to purchase the local water works, he investigated the possibility of establishing a radio station to promote his proposal. Technical limitations made this broadcasting idea impossible at the time, however the later development of vacuum-tube radio transmitters would make the concept practical.\\"Why I Believe in Government Radio\\" by Charles E. Duffie, Popular Science Monthly, October 1922, pages 65-67. In March 1921 Howell suggested to Postmaster General Will H. Hays that the U.S. government should establish its own official broadcasting stations. In early September 1921, Howell conferred with Hays prior to leaving for Europe to conduct a survey of radio broadcasting development. A contemporary wire report stated that Hayes expressed the hope that \\"in the near future radio phones could be utilized to broadcast weather and market reports and other information\\".\\"Radio Telephone\\", New Britain (Connecticut) Herald, September 2, 1921, page 4. Shortly thereafter the Commerce Department, which regulated radio at this time, issued a regulation formally creating a radio broadcasting service classification. Effective December 1, 1921, broadcasting stations could be established which held Limited Commercial licenses that authorized operation on two designated broadcasting wavelengths: 360 meters (833 kHz) for \\"entertainment\\", and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \\"market and weather reports\\".\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. On December 29, 1921 a license with the randomly assigned call letters WOU was issued to Robert B. Howell, for operation on both 360 and 485 meters.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #264, issued December 29, 1921 to R. B. Howell for operation on 360 and 485 meters for a one year period. This was the first broadcasting station to be authorized to broadcast on the 485-meter \\"market and weather report\\" wavelength, and also the first broadcasting station in the state of Nebraska. In early 1922, station ownership was transferred to the Metropolitan Utilities District.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1922, page 7. WOU apparently made few broadcasts, and was soon overshadowed by the establishment in 1922 of the Omaha Grain Exchange's broadcasting station, WAAW (now KCRO), and one of the U.S. Post Office's \\"Air Mail Radio\\" stations, KDEF, which broadcast daily live stock and grain reports.\\"The Radio Crop and Market News Service\\", Radio News, September 1922, pages 470-472.
