The Harrison H4 marine chronometer Early life He was born in Barrow-upon- Humber but moved to London to assist his father in developing the chronometer. Development of marine watches In 1761 he sailed to Jamaica on HMS Deptford in charge of his aged father's latest development, the \\"sea watch\\", now known as the H4 marine watch, which was to undergo critical performance trials during the transatlantic crossing. Parliament had offered a large prize (20,000 pounds) for a practical working solution to the problem of determining longitude at sea and set up the Board of Longitude to evaluate submissions. In spite of the success of the H4 trials, where the timepiece was shown to be very accurate and reliable and had enabled the longitude to be accurately determined, the Board of Longitude insisted on a second transatlantic crossing to confirm the results. He undertook a second voyage in 1764, sailing to Barbados on HMS Tartar. However, the Board of Longitude were still not convinced that the conditions for the prize had been met. He then worked with his father, who was now in his late 70s, to produce the H5 chronometer which in 1772 they demonstrated to King George III with great success, gaining the king's support in their fight for the prize offered by Parliament. They were eventually awarded a sum of money, but not the full amount originally offered.

Evidence for intermittent human habitation at the site stretches from the Mesolithic through the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Romano-British period, but it is best known for the small village that existed on the site between the mid-5th century and the early 7th century CE, during the early Anglo-Saxon period. During this time, around 70 sunken-featured buildings were constructed on the site, along with 8 halls and a number of other features. Subsequently abandoned, the area became farmland in the Late Medieval period. Antiquarian interest in the site began in 1849, when a nearby Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered. Subsequent excavations of Romano-British pottery kilns took place in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, before the Anglo-Saxon settlement was revealed. The site was excavated between 1956 and 1972 by an archaeological team from the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works (MOPBW), led first by Vera Evison and then by Stanley West. Following the culmination of excavation, it was decided to reconstruct the village on the site, an experimental archaeological project which has been ongoing since 1974. In 1999, the site was opened to the public with a new visitor's centre, museum and cafe. Location Panorama of the reconstructed village, on the sloping hill, with the 19th century pines in the background. West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village is located on the north bank of the River Lark, adjacent to the village of West Stow in the western part of Suffolk. Situated on a small hill in height, it would have been noticeably prominent in the surrounding landscape; this hill formed a \\"core\\" for a sand dune that developed around from wind-carried sand during the early 14th century and which sharply drops on the leeward side while gradually sloping on the windward side. The steep southern slope is accentuated by a ditch at its base, which marks the edge of the river's flood plain. The surrounding landscape as it appears today is radically different from the landscape that would have surrounded the area in the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.West 1985. p. 10. The land to the north and east of the West Stow Anglo-Saxon village has been heavily modified during the construction of the Bury sewage farms, with the north-east corner of the site having been partly destroyed by a gravel pit in the 1950s. By the mid-1980s, the rubbish dumps that surrounded the site had been converted into a Country Park, with the landscape being regenerated with sedge, grass, birch and oak. The site of the settlement is also bisected by a row of pine trees that had been planted in the 19th century. The solid geology of the Lark Valley is chalk, with patches of boulder clay that forms a high plateau capped with sands and gravels in West Stow and Icklingham.West 1985. p. 3. The site is seven miles west from the town of Bury St. Edmunds.West 2001. p. i. Prehistoric settlement The site at West Stow has shown evidence of human habitation throughout British prehistory. Indeed, the wider Lark Valley contains the greatest known concentration of prehistoric settlements in the region of East Anglia. =Mesolithic= Excavation at West Stow has discovered evidence for hunter-gatherers living in the area during the Mesolithic, or \\"Middle Stone Age\\" period. Temporarily camping on the knoll, they left behind them five or six dense concentrations of Sauveterrian-style waste lithic flakes, blades, cores and other stone implements. Similar scatters of Mesolithic worked flints have been found across the valley area.West 1985. pp. 3-4. =Neolithic and Bronze Ages= Grooved ware and petit tranchet-style arrowheads dating from the Neolithic Age have been found in a field adjacent to the West Stow site.West 1985. p. 4. Anglo-Saxon settlement During the early Anglo-Saxon period, West Stow was the site of a small village made up of timber buildings. Archaeological excavation of the site unearthed evidence for a variety of different constructions and areas at West Stow: 69 sunken- featured buildings (SFBs), alongside 7 post-hole buildings interpreted as halls, traces of several lesser structures, a reserve area for clay, 2 large hollows or animal pens, pits, various unassociated post holes and several 7th century boundary ditches.West 2001. p. 7. The Anglo-Saxon village showed no signs of the development of property boundaries until the last phase of occupation. There was no evidence that the settlement was defended by fortifications. = Sunken-featured buildings = The majority of structures built at West Stow belonged to a category of what the excavators called \\"sunken-featured buildings\\", a term first coined by Professor Philip Rahtz. In previous decades, buildings in this style had been known as \\"pit houses\\", \\"sunken houses\\" or \\"grubenhauser\\" (), but site director Stanley West noted that Rahtz's terminology had been adopted because it was \\"less contentious\\" and provided \\"a non-functional description.\\" Seventy such sunken-featured buildings, or SFBs, were recorded at the site. = Halls = The interior of the reconstructed Hall, constructed in 2005. The other category of building uncovered at West Stow consisted of seven larger structures held up by wooden posts which left behind postholes; the excavators interpreted these as halls. Five of these buildings were located along the central spine of the hill, with the other two being positioned on the north side and south side respectively. All of the buildings were roughly positioned east to west, although the hall on the north slope was instead orientated north-west to south-east. Four of the halls are simple, rectangular areas which are defined by their single row of post holes. Another, Hall No. 2, was more complex than the others, having an internal division and double post-holes along the length. No. 7 was also different because it was built from a sleeper beam and larger post holes, while Hall No. 5 cannot be clearly defined because it lay in area that had seen multiple features rebuilt on top of it. Hall 1 was located on the eastern end of the site, and survived as the most clearly defined of the post-built structures. 26 ft (7.9m) in length and 13 ft 6in (4.1m) in breadth, there are gaps in the south and east side walls, suggesting the existence of two doorways. No hearth was found, although a patch of burnt sand, 2 ft (0.6m) in diameter, was found in the centre of the hall. No objects were found within the building, although four were uncovered from the post-holes: a Roman bronze coin from the era of Emperor Valens, a flat iron strip, a flat palette and a fragment of a pottery spindle-whorl. Hall 2, which was probably the largest of the structures, was located on the crest of the hill, surrounded by SFBs. 32 ft (9.75m) in length and 14 ft (4.27m) in width, there was a partition down the eastern side of the building, creating a chamber 8 ft (2.44m) wide. East of the hall's centre was a patch of burnt sand, marking the position of a hearth. The position of the doorway is not entirely clear, although excavators believed that it was most likely on the south side, close to the partitioning wall. Items discovered in Hall 2 included a Roman bronze coin from the era of the Emperor Victorinus, bronze and iron strips, a bone pin, fragments of both glass and a loomweight, as well as a variety of iron objects, including a knife, nail, plate and key.West 1985. p. 11. The reconstruction of the Hall, constructed in 2005. The incomplete Hall 3, on the same axis as Halls 1 and 2, was akin in shape and size to the former, but much of its south side had been obliterated by the subsequent construction of other buildings on that site. Fifteen items were found in the interior of the Hall, including three bronze Roman objects; a coin from the era of Emperor Constantine I, a ligula and a dolphin brooch, as well as fragments of glass, a spindlewhorl, and a series of iron objects. Also on this axis was Hall 4, which was also heavily obscured by later building, but it appeared to cover an area at least 22 ft (6.7m) long and 16 ft (4.9m) wide. Only three finds were discovered from within it; a Roman bronze coin from the era of Emperor Crispus, a Roman glass fragment and a triangular bone comb. Hall 5 was located on the south-eastern corner of the settlement, on the lowest slope of the hill. Like with several other of the halls, its plan has been obscured by subsequent buildings constructed on the site, although a large number of postholes and three hearths were uncovered; this has led excavators to believe that there had been two halls on that site, one known as 5A and the other as 5B. Finds from the buildings included a number of items made out of bronze, iron and bone.West 1985. pp. 11-12. Hall 6 was at the far western end of the hill, along as the same east-to-west axis as Halls 1, 2, 3 and 4. At least 25 ft (7.6m) long and 12 ft (3.7m) wide, the structure was apparently relatively weak in design, and within it was discovered a Roman bronze spoon, and two iron objects, one of which was possibly a small chisel.West 1985. p. 12. Hall 7 contained a dark layer of material at the occupation layer, with finds including a variety of stones, bones and sherds, along with much burnt daub, unburnt clay mixed with chalk and a broken Anglo-Saxon pot. It has been interpreted as being 37 ft 6in in length and 25 ft 9in in diameter, making it the largest of the halls at West Stow. It was subject to various possible interpretations, although represented the most sophisticated building at West Stow, involving a more advanced technique than that shown for many of the other constructions. Artefacts found at the site included a number of Roman bronze coins, and a variety of bronze, iron, glass and bone artefacts.West 1985. pp. 12-13. = Other features = A number of post-built structures were uncovered at the West Stow Anglo-Saxon settlement which were too small to be interpreted as Halls. These postholes tended to be clustered together, suggesting the possibility that they may have been used to repair small structures. No evidence of fencing was found on any of these structures, which were labelled Buildings 8 through to 14 by the excavators.West 1985. p. 14. At the site, four large areas of grey, disturbed soil were uncovered, three of which were in the eastern side of the settlement. Stratigraphically dated to the Anglo-Saxon period, they all contained a number of small potsherds, with Hollows 1 and 4 also containing a number of bronze and iron objects. The purpose of these Hollows is unknown, although chief excavator Stanley West speculated that they may have represented animal pens which were once surrounded by a form of hurdling or light fencing, traces of which have not survived.West 1985. pp. 53-54. 79 pits at the site were also dated to the Anglo-Saxon period, with a further 20 possibles also being identified. This latter group included 12 pits forming a separate group, each of which was rectangular in shape, vertically sided, flat bottomed, and containing a buff sand filling. Their purposes remain unknown.West 1985. pp. 55-57. In the final phase of settlement at the site, it is evident that several ditches were dug, often containing fragments of Ipswich ware and other artefacts. Those ditches dug on the village's western sector appeared to have been used to define certain areas of the settlement, while those on the eastern side serve no apparent functional purpose.West 1985. pp. 54-55. = Artefacts = = Environmental evidence = Modern history =Excavation: 1849-1976= The first excavations to take place in the vicinity of the West Stow village were undertaken in 1849, when an Anglo- Saxon cemetery was accidentally discovered on the nearby heath, and \\"skeletons and numerous urns\\" were found.Tymms 1853. pp. 315-328. Finds discovered at the cemetery would be collected by a number of locals until 1852. These included John Gwilt of Icklingham, Reverend S. Banks of Dullingham and the Reverend E.R. Benyon of Culford, who at the time was the proprietor of the heath. None of them ever seem to have publicly suggested that there may have been an Anglo-Saxon settlement nearby.West 1985. p. 9. In 1879, and then again in the 1890s, a local amateur archaeologist named Henry Prigg of Icklingham identified and excavated several Romano-British pottery kilns on the heat, although no accurate records from this excavation have survived. In 1940, the archaeologist Basil Brown (1888-1977), best known for having excavated the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo in the 1930s, discovered two further Romano-British pottery kilns at the site. He proceeded to excavate them in 1947, and they were sampled for archaeo-magnetic purposes by Dr John Belsh√© of the Department of Geodosy and Geophysics at the University of Cambridge. Stone relief depiction of Stanley West holding an archaeological trowel at West Stow. The man responsible for initiating the archaeological investigation of the Anglo-Saxon village was Stanley West, who had first become interested in Anglo-Saxon England when working as an assistant at the Ipswich Museum. In 1947, he joined the West Stow excavation being run by Brown that unearthed two Romano-British pottery kilns. During this investigation, it became clear to the excavators that there had also been a later Anglo-Saxon settlement on the site, evidenced by the finding of early Anglo-Saxon potsherds in rabbit-burrow scrapes over the area and then the discovery of the section of a hut in the site's north-eastern corner. Proceeding to publish his findings on the kilns in 1952, West went on to excavate Anglo-Saxon areas of Ipswich for the MOPBW alongside studying archaeology in an academic capacity at the University of Cambridge. In April 1958, he attended a conference on early Anglo-Saxon pottery in Norwich that was organised by the Council for British Archaeology. Here, he met Professor Vera Evison of Birkbeck College, London, and posed the question to her as to why archaeologists had so far focused on the excavation of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries rather than settlements; she replied that the latter were far harder to detect than the former. In response, West informed her about the Anglo-Saxon potsherds that had emerged at West Stow, and intrigued, she soon began excavating at the site for the Ministry of Public Building and Works (MOPBW).West 2001. p. 1. Meanwhile, inspired by Mary Leakey's discoveries in Olduvai Gorge, West traveled to Eastern Africa to excavate at the Tanganyikan city of Dar Es Salaam, only returning to England five years later, in 1965. Here, Evison and John Hurst, Inspector of the MOPBW asked him to take charge of the West Stow excavation, which he agreed to. Over the next 7 years he opened up an area of approximately ¬æ of an acre each season. Funded by the MOPBW, West hoped to excavate as much of the site as possible, but ultimately, the excavation remained restrained to the settlement site, not exploring the surrounding field systems, an idea proposed by Dr. Van Es, Head of the Dutch Archaeological Service. The excavation was undertaken by a team of site supervisors and six builders' labourers, aided by roughly 30 volunteers drawn from both universities and the local area.West 2001. p. 3. The top stratigraphic layer on the site, a sediment of blown sand known as Layer 1, was removed by backhoe, exposing the old ground surface (Layer 2) beneath it. Evidence of late medieval ridge-and-furrow ploughing was found in this layer, and dated through the discovery of 13th century pottery. Layer 2 consisted largely of a very dark soil that was removed primarily by backhoe. Below this was revealed the layers in which the Anglo-Saxon village had been constructed.West 2001. p. 2. Towards the end of the final season, the excavators at West Stow made use of the pioneering system of retrieving seeds and plant remains by flotation, which had just been developed by archaeologists at the University of Cambridge.West 2001. pp. 2-3. =Reconstruction: 1977-present= The St Edmundsbury District Council planned to turn the area into a rubbish dump servicing the city of Bury St. Edmunds following the culmination of excavation, a decision that was reviewed annually. Eventually they decided against this decision, forming the West Stow Saxon Village Trust, an experimental archaeological group, in order to reconstruct some of the Anglo-Saxon buildings in the hope of learning more about Anglo-Saxon building techniques and architecture. The work was undertaken by a group of undergraduate students from Cambridge University who called themselves the West Stow Environmental Archaeology Group. These experimental reconstructions ensured that they only made use of woodworking techniques and technologies that would have been available in Anglo-Saxon England. One of the halls excavated at West Stow also provided the basis for a reconstruction erected at the Bishops Wood Environmental Centre near Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire; known as \\"Saxon Hall\\", it took four years to build, and was used to teach local schoolchildren about life in the Early Medieval. It burned down in 2008 when an ember from a cooking fire set the building alight; John Rhymer, Head of Bishops Wood Centre, told press that he and his team were \\"devastated\\". However, the Hall was rebuilt over the following two years at a cost of ¬£34,000. At its official reopening on 21 January 2011, the Anglo-Saxonist Stephen Pollington gave a speech in Old English while a historical reenactor, Paul Mortimer, appeared in character as Raedwald, King of East Anglia. Other attendees included Terry Herbert, who had discovered the Staffordshire Hoard in 2009, members of the Kidderminster Art Society and children on a school trip from Northleigh Manor School in Oxfordshire.BBC News 2010.Worcestershire County Council 2010.Meierhans 2011.

Mansell was a right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Redhill, Surrey. Starting his career when Jim Parks, Jr. was still Sussex's first choice wicket-keeper, Mansell made his first-class debut for the county against Cambridge University in 1969 at the County Ground, Hove. In 1970, he made three first-class appearances, against Gloucestershire and Middlesex in the County Championship, as well as against the touring Jamaicans. He made two further first-class appearances in the 1971 County Championship, both against Hampshire, as well as playing against Cambridge University. His second appearance against Hampshire at the United Services Recreation Ground, Portsmouth, saw him record his maiden half century, with a score of 51. He didn't feature in first-class cricket in the 1972 season, but did make his List A debut against Worcestershire in the first round of the 1972 Gillette Cup. He featured more in the 1973 season, with Jim Parks, Jr. having left Sussex at the end of the previous season. He made eleven first-class appearances, ten of which came in that season's County Championship, with Mansell scoring 98 runs at an average of 8.16, with a high score of 20 not out, while behind the stumps he took 17 catches and made a single stumping. In List A cricket, he made five appearances, with three coming in the Benson & Hedges Cup and two in the John Player League.

Most of its properties are located in Toronto (either in the city's Entertainment District, Fashion District or in its ritzy Yorkville neighbourhood), with a few others in Montreal, Niagara Falls, the Miami area, and Las Vegas. Founded and run by the Lebanese-born entrepreneur Charles Khabouth, INK currently owns and operates Toronto's Product nightclub, Dragonfly nightclub (on Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort grounds), Cube nightclub and La Soci√©t√© restaurant. Furthermore, Ink, in partnership with Nick Di Donato's Liberty Entertainment Group, is the parent company of Tattoo Queen West rock club and Spice Route bistro bar. Their partnership has since grown to include the Coral Gables Country Club located in south Miami, Florida. Ink has also teamed up with Lifetime Developments with the launch of Bisha Hotel & Residences, the newest private label hotel and residence brand to originate in Toronto since The Four Seasons in the 1960s. Venues =Nightclubs= REBEL Nightclub (formerly known as Sound Academy) As of October 1, 2016, the Sound Academy changed its name to REBEL and reopened, completely renovated. Ink Entertainment collaborated with Studio Munge to design the 45,000 square foot nightclub, with a 65-foot stage. The nightclub will be hosting multiple global artists such as DJ Snake, DVBBS, Tory Lanez, and Passenger (singer), among many other. Cube Cube, previously known as Ultra Supper Club from 2003 until 2012, is a nightclub located in downtown Toronto on Queen West near Spadina that can hold up to 650 people between its indoor lounge and rooftop patio. Catering to affluent 25-plus young professionals, Cube's black and gold interior is inspired by 1960s and 1970s design and features nostalgic retro detailing to reflect the cubist art and fashion of the time such as the 65-foot-long bar and handblown brass railings and sculptures. Ultra Supper Club opened in December 2003 following an investment of over C$3 million by the INK Entertainment owner Charles Khabouth into year-long renovation of the space that previously housed the iconic BamBoo tropical-themed nightclub (co-owned by Richard O'Brien and Patti Habib) from July 1983 until its closing bash on 31 October 2002. Before BamBoo, during the 1970s, the building housed a laundromat and later a Wicker World shop. Khabouth reportedly got alerted that the building was for lease by the same real estate agent who almost 10 years earlier helped him turn RPM and the Warehouse into the Guvernment and Kool Haus. From the start Khabouth envisioned Ultra as an upscale restaurant and club that attracts Toronto's moneyed crowd (real estate barons, Bay Street moguls and leveraged-buyout specialists), much like his successful Stilife club at the corner of Richmond and Duncan Street did back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In pursuit of creating an exclusive spot, he spared little expense, including putting in fortress-like exterior doors from India that cost C$15,000 and another C$15,000 to install them because the entire building had to be reinforced. Run as Khabouth's partnership with Brenda Lowes and inspired by supper clubs in New York City and Montreal, Ultra was among the first Toronto venues to push that concept in addition to being an early adopter of the bottle service model. The new club was an instant hit with its rooftop patio crowded every summer. Sleeker and much more upscale than BamBoo's ramshackle vibe, Ultra put more emphasis on food than a regular nightclub. Instead of live acts, its bookings mostly focused on DJs with the tables and chairs removed around 11pm to make room for dancing. Ultra's glamorous reputation further benefited from the media coverage of the steady stream of international celebrities dropping by such as David Beckham in August 2007, Paris Hilton with then-boyfriend Benji Madden in September 2008, Lindsay Lohan who got paid to show up accompanying then-girlfriend DJ Samantha Ronson in 2009 on the day of their engagement, Beyonc√©, etc. In February 2009, Ultra Supper Club underwent a bit of a makeover, dropping the 'Supper Club' from its name and adopting a new Asian fusion fare and cheaper menu offerings ‚Äî all of which was seen to be initiated in response to the diminishing number of corporate events at the venue due to the global recession. By early 2012, despite the club/restaurant being profitable, Khabouth had decided that Ultra ran its course, investing $1.8 million into the venue makeover and re-opening as Cube on 28 February 2012. With the restaurant aspect mostly dropped, Cube functions primarily as a nightclub ‚Äî hosting glamorous, celebrity-packed TIFF parties and booking more high-profile big room house DJs for gigs such as Dubfire, Hardwell, and Victor Calderone. In August 2013, following that year's OVO Fest the club hosted an impromptu after-party for the festival performers including Drake, Lil Wayne, P. Diddy, Kanye West, Big Sean, French Montana, Mase, and TLC. Cube also continues with the practice of promoting parties around the presence of prominent pro athletes such as Chris Weidman who hosted an event at Cube in September 2013, one day ahead of UFC 165 in Toronto's Air Canada Centre.Chris Weidman @ Cube, Friday 20 September 2013 Dragonfly Nightclub Dragonfly Nightclub is built into the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort in Niagara Falls, Ontario with a capacity of up to 800. Spread over 12,000 square foot space, it features Asian themed decor invoking an ancient forbidden city. Uniun Uniun opened on Adelaide Street West in November 2012, in the same space that previously housed the Devil's Martini nightclub, a popular destination for bachelorette parties that Khabouth bought several months earlier in July 2012, immediately initiating its complete makeover. The club was in the news in late August 2013 after Justin Bieber stopped by with bodyguards and got involved in a melee after which he got hustled out by his security detail into a waiting SUV. Toybox Toybox opened on Adelaide Street West in October 2018, space previously that was Uniun, INK had rebranded this venue to appeal to college students in the hop hop scene, as the EDM scene at Uniun had faded. Toybox features a small teddy bear mascot that runs around the venue to entertain the crowd, and has been face lifted from Uniun to feature a black and red heavy themed venue.https://toptorontoclubs.com/clubs/toybox/ =Restaurants= Spice Route Spice Route is an Asian themed bistro-bar located on King Street West, Toronto, Ontario that opened during spring 2008. It is run as a collaboration between Ink's Khabouth and Liberty's Nick Di Donato (owner of C Lounge and many other venues), two veteran moguls of the Toronto entertainment scene who after directly competing with one another for the city's upscale clientele throughout the 2000s via their respective properties Ultra Supper Club and C Lounge now joined forces in a venture also targeting ritzy young professionals.Spice Route Spice Route can hold up to 500 guests over multiple rooms and an outdoor patio. La Soci√©t√© La Soci√©t√© is a 1920s-inspired Parisian-style eatery located on Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario that opened in June 2011. The restaurant includes two European-style terraces, and an outdoor patio. Located in the space previously occupied by the long-running Dynasty Chinese Cuisine dim sum restaurant, the C$4 million renovation that included installation of a 20 by 30 foot stained-glass ceiling (courtesy of Toronto's Solarium Design Group) took five months before La Soci√©t√© opened. It also included putting in a mosaic tile floor, which by itself cost almost C$400,000 and entailed flying in 27 workers. La Soci√©t√© draws inspiration from various brasseries and bistros, including Keith McNally's Balthazar restaurant in New York City's SoHo as well as H√¥tel Costes in Paris on Place Vend√¥me in the city's 1st arrondissement, La Fontaine de Mars in 7th arrondissement, and Brasserie Bofinger in 4th arrondissement. Due to its location, opulence, and flair, La Soci√©t√© also invoked comparisons to the famous Toronto restaurant Bemelmans, a glamorous eatery owned and operated by Tom Kristenbrun that ran from 1977 until 1994 just up the street at 83 Bloor Street West. La Soci√©t√© opening party on Wednesday, 15 June 2011 brought out the Toronto glitterati from the city's business and media scenes, including Moses Znaimer, Roots Canada founder Michael Budman, architect and designer Dee Dee Taylor Eustace of Taylor Hannah Architect Inc., Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong of Greta Constantine, Blake McGrath, Polly Shannon, Kevin Brauch, Jake Gold, Jian Ghomeshi, Seamus O'Regan, Melissa Grelo, and gossip columnists Shinan Govani, Bernadette Morra, and Suzanne Boyd. Within months of opening, La Soci√©t√© hosted various 2011 Toronto International Film Festival parties, including the closing one on 17 September 2011 that featured NKPR Inc's Natasha Koifman, Bill Nighy, Robert Lantos, Suzanne Rogers, Glenn Baxter, Yannick Bisson, George Stroumboulopoulos, Jian Ghomeshi, Ben Mulroney & Jessica Brownstein, Colin & Justin, Drew & Jonathan Scott, designer Kirk Pickersgill, Suzanne Boyd, and Shinan Govani. Weslodge Saloon Classified as modern American-style gastropub with a saloon twist, Weslodge opened in mid-July 2012 on King Street West in Toronto's Fashion District as a partnership between INK Entertainment's Charles Khabouth and Icon Legacy Hospitality's Hanif Harji. During the Weslodge preparation stage, Khabouth, who was initially set to open it by himself, got introduced to Harji who was opening Patria next door and the two restaurateurs soon decided to go into business together on both venues. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Victory Condos building at 478 King Street West that was completed in 2011 and is co-owned by Toronto real estate developers Lifetime Developments (run by Mel Pearl and Sam Herzog) and BLVD Developments.Victory Condos Designed by the Toronto-based Munge Leung interior design firm, Khabouth's and Harji's plan for Weslodge was attracting the Downtown Toronto urban crowd that doesn't spend much time in their condos, but rather likes to go out right after coming home from work. With its interior featuring imitations of taxidermy hunting trophies mounted on walls, in keeping with the Wild West and hunting themes, the restaurant's bartenders and servers wear gun holsters around their shoulders. Weslodge's kitchen is run by executive chef Stuart Cameron while its first chef du cuisine was Kanida Chey who joined from Claudio Aprile's Origin. The restaurant was in the news in June 2015 due to its 24-year-old former pastry chef Kate Burnham who had been employed at the venue from July 2012 until January 2014, alleging to have been sexually harassed while working at Weslodge by three former bosses ‚Äî day sous chef Dan Lidbury, chef du cuisine Kanida Chey, and night sous chef Colin Mercer. She filed an application with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, seeking C$225,000 in damages as well as formal apologies from each of her alleged harassers. After first appearing in the Toronto Star on Saturday, 13 June 2015, the story got a lot of attention, including from established Toronto restaurateur Jen Agg, owner of the Black Hoof, who in addition to supporting Burnham announced a conference named 'Kitchen Bitches: Smashing the Patriarchy One Plate at a Time'. All the media attention prompted INK Entertainment into releasing an official statement, posted on the company's Facebook page.INK Entertainment tweet on Tuesday, 16 June 2015 @ 5:17pm EST The story received more national coverage in Canada via The Current radio programme hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti on CBC Radio One, sparking a debate on the poor workplace treatment of women in restaurant kitchens. Jen Agg's Kitchen Bitches conference was later held in Toronto in September 2015.Kitchen Bitches Furthermore, the same month, Burnham's legal case against Weslodge got resolved through mediation as she agreed to a confidential settlement. Weslodge and Patria are located in adjacent groundfloor units of the Victory Condos building on King Street West. Also in September 2015, it was announced that the Weslodge Saloon brand would be expanding to the Gulf countries in early 2016 as part of a deal between Daman Investments PSC, a Dubai-based financial services company, and a consortium of partners including Harji's ICON Legacy Hospitality. Patria Patria is another Khabouth-Harji King West restaurant collaboration, this one serving Spanish food. It opened in October 2012. Originally, only Harji was behind Patria, but soon after meeting Khabouth who was getting ready to open Weslodge next door, the two decided to join forces and run both venues in partnership with one another. Reportedly, they invested C$2.5 million into getting Patria off the ground, enlisting the Toronto-based Commute Home design company to do the restaurant's interior and getting chefs Stuart Cameron and Claudia Gibson to run the kitchen. Even before officially opening, the restaurant hosted 2012 TIFF events such as the Seven Psychopaths premiere party in September 2012 with Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Colin Farrell on hand. Much like other Khabouth's restaurants in Toronto, Patria continually attracts international movie stars and Hollywood celebrities via TIFF parties every September thereby ensuring press coverage and publicity for the restaurant. Buonanotte Toronto The Toronto location of the popular Montreal restaurant Buonanotte opened in January 2013 courtesy of Khabouth's INK Entertainment that licensed the name and recipes from the original restaurant's owner Massimo \\"Max\\" Lecas who remains in charge of the new venue's management. It opened at 19 Mercer Street, the same location where Khabouth previously ran a Japanese cuisine restaurant named Ame in partnership with Michael and Guy Rubino. The original Buonanotte restaurant in Montreal has been in continual operation since 1991. Byblos Byblos is a restaurant serving Eastern Mediterranean and Moroccan food, located on Duncan Street near King Street West inside the Storys building in Toronto's Entertainment District. Opened in March 2014, it is the third restaurant that Khabouth established in Toronto in partnership with Hanif Harji. Originally envisioned as a fish and seafood eatery, its opening took place during a time when Toronto experienced a bit of a spike in restaurants serving Mediterranean and Middle Eastern (Middleterranean) fare, a trend that Khabouth and Harji took note of and decided to join. Most upscale among the string of such spots in Toronto that opened or expanded during the 2013-2014 period (Anthony Rose's Fat Pasha, Dr. Laffa, Me Va Me, District Oven, S. Lefkowitz, etc.), Byblos focuses on dishes from Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Lebanon as well as Morocco. Byblos' executive chef is Stuart Cameron who also oversees other Khabouth- Harji eateries such as Weslodge and Patria while its chef de cuisine is Jennifer Nickle who came over from Patria where she was a sous chef. Byblos received near universal critical acclaim, getting enthusiastic reviews and accolades for its food blend and becoming perhaps the best-reviewed Khabouth restaurant ever. As Byblos got established on Toronto's restaurant scene and following the successful launch of its second location in Miami Beach, it was announced in September 2015 that the Byblos brand would be expanding to the Gulf countries in early 2016 as part of a deal between Daman Investments PSC, a Dubai-based financial services company, and a consortium of partners including Harji's ICON Legacy Hospitality. America Restaurant First opening its doors in early September 2014 for that year's TIFF, high-end America Restaurant at the 31st floor of Toronto's Trump International Hotel and Tower didn't officially launch until almost October 2014. It thus replaced the glitzy Stock approximately nine months since its management had been taken over by Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants (O&B;) in partnership with Khabouth. At the time of the ownership change, Stock, which opened during spring 2012 simultaneous with the Toronto Trump Tower's launch, had been in operation for some two and a half years. After their limited collaboration on snacks at the Cabana Pool Bar, America Restaurant thus marked a closer partnership between INK and O&B; that began in December 2013 with an announcement of the two companies taking over all food operations at Trump International Hotel & Tower from Alex Shnaider's Talon International that developed the tower and then later also managed its two dining and drinking venues ‚Äî Stock restaurant and Suits Lobby Lounge. The new owners hired the Toronto firm II by IV Design, the same company that designed Stock, to now remodel the space. The redesign included doing away with Stock's black leather furniture, which Khabouth described as very \\"manly\\", and replacing it with \\"a lot of velvet, a lot of velures, burgundies, blues and golds in order to make it a little more feminine friendly\\". Hundreds of pieces of furniture were custom built off-site at a shop in Woodbridge, just outside Toronto, over the course of about four months. The actual remodeling work took place in late August and early September 2014 over just five days as the new owners rushed to be ready in time for Toronto International Film Festival. While Stock's physical bar remained relatively unchanged, the lounge area was completely revamped with new lighting, furniture and a DJ booth. The spot relaunched as America Restaurant, a venue that's an eatery during daytime, but on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays functions as a supper club, turning into a nightclub with dancing and DJs past 11pm. When it came to the name, O&B; and INK wanted \\"something strong and unapologetic\\" while for Khabouth, Donald Trump himself, \\"the epitome of everything American\\", was a source of inspiration. Bill Osborne, formerly of Bar Boulud in London and Canoe in Toronto, got hired to run America's kitchen, working under O&B; executive chef Anthony Walsh. In September 2014, before it was even open to the general public, America hosted The Imitation Game party attended by Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley as the movie played at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley at America Restaurant In late November 2014 America was subject of an extremely negative review by The Globe and Mail restaurant critic Chris Nuttall-Smith whose elaborate takedown went viral,Globe Review of America in the Trump Tower, Chowhound, 28 November 2014 garnering big reader reaction as well as attention from various other media outlets. In his zero-star assessment of America, Nutall-Smith referred to it as \\"tacky, new-money restaurant\\", eviscerating its bouncers, wait staff, bathroom attendant, hostesses, and even patrons; though praising its food. The scathing review reportedly led to the restaurant's entire front of house staff getting fired. America received a four-star rating from the 2015 Forbes Travel Guide, placed in the same category as established Toronto dining spots Caf√© Boulud Toronto, Canoe, One Restaurant, Scaramouche, Splendido, and TOCA. The restaurant was in the news in late March 2015 after a Toronto resident (Darshan Dorka) claimed he got turned away at America along with a party of friends due to wearing turbans. NAO Standing for New and Old, NAO is an Asian steakhouse on Avenue Road established by Khabouth and Harji that opened in November 2014. Byblos Miami After getting announced in January 2015, Byblos Miami, an offshoot of Toronto's Byblos, opened in Miami Beach during late summer 2015. Another partnership between Khabouth and Harji, the Miami restaurant reportedly came on the heels of extensive research as the duo of Toronto restaurateurs aimed at minimizing surprises and risks of launching in the Miami market that they don't know very well. Figo Opened in November 2015, Figo is the seventh Khabouth-Harji restaurant collaboration, their sixth in Toronto. Located on the south-west corner of Adelaide West & John in the recently built Pinnacle on Adelaide condo building that's owned by Pinnacle International, the eatery serves Italian cuisine. The partners hired Anna Chen (formerly of Lee and Scaramouche) to run Figo's kitchen as its executive chef. =Other= Storys building In October 2011 Khabouth and Harji announced their purchase of the four-story Storys building at the corner of Duncan & Pearl in the heart of the Entertainment District, around the corner from Royal Alexandra Theater and TIFF Lightbox. Cabana Pool Bar After his 2012 takeover of the Sound Academy, Khabouth opened Cabana Pool Bar on 15 June 2013 on its patio. Spending C$5 million, he hired Ink's go-to interior designers Munge Leung to remake the outdoor space by installing 12 poolside white-tent cabanas and several dozen tables and couches all in an effort of appealing to the \\"25-plus crowd that has traveled to the south of France, been to Miami, been to Vegas\\". With a daytime concept that's an extension of the bottle-service booths in Khabouth's nightclubs ‚Äî the cost of renting a table, a couch, or a cabana for an entire day is from C$1,000 to C$2,500, an amount for which the patrons also get three bottles of liquor to start, a platter of snacks, and wristbands affording access to 10-20 people ‚Äî Cabana Pool Bar became a big success right away, attracting more than 4,000 people a day on summer weekends if the weather is nice. Open during summer only from early to mid June until late September, Cabana shuts down by 11pm on weekends due to the residents of the neighbouring Toronto Island complaining about the noise from the patio. The venue is closed to the general public during summer weekdays though it is available for corporate bookings and functions.Cabana - Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants Light food offerings and snacks at the venue are handled by Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants, a Toronto- based hospitality company. Celebrity presence, a staple of Khabouth's nightclubs and restaurants, played a large part in Cabana Pool Bar's initial promotion as well ‚Äî Justin Bieber, Drake, Milos Raonic, deadmau5, P. K. Subban, Phil Kessel, and Nazem Kadri were all on hand during its first summer in operation. Over the coming summers, Will Smith, in town filming Suicide Squad, Dan Bilzerian, LeBron James, etc. made highly publicized appearances. =Bisha Hotel & Residences= Bisha Hotel & Residences at 80 Blue Jays Way in Toronto's Entertainment District is a hotel and condominium project, currently under construction, executed as a joint venture between INK Entertainment hospitality company and Lifetime Developments real estate development company. It is a new private label hotel and residence brand named after INK founder, Charles Khabouth's childhood nickname, Bisha. It was designed by award-winning Wallman Architects and Munge Leung Design Associates and will stand 41 stories tall when complete. The Bisha Presentation Centre has hosted many events including features by Sir Richard Branson and John Legend. Events =Veld Music Festival= Veld Music Festival takes place over a two-day weekend at Downsview Park in Toronto, Ontario. Organized annually by INK Entertainment. The inaugural event took place on 4 and 5 August 2012, featuring some of the best stars and labels in electronic dance music. The inaugural headliners included deadmau5 and Avicii; the 2013 festival was headlined by deadmau5 and Above & Beyond. In 2014, the headliners were Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren, and Iggy Azalea. Veld has featured performances by Oliver Heldens, Nero, Ingrosso, What So Not, DVBBS, Zedd, and Knife Party. On 2 August 2015, the 2015 Veld festival of was cancelled due to a severe thunder storm warning.http://globalnews.ca/news/2144447/severe-thunderstorm-watch-issued- for-toronto-veld-music-festival-evacuated/ Controversy The 2014 festival had two drug-related deaths ‚Äî 20-year-old Annie Le of Toronto and 22-year-old Willard Amurao from the Greater Toronto Area, both of whom died after ingesting recreational drugs they had bought at the two-day event ‚Äî as well as additional thirteen drug-related illnesses. Questions were raised about the circumstances of Amurao's death, prompting a Special Investigations Unit (Ontario's police watchdog) investigation due to him apparently being handcuffed by a Toronto police officer before receiving medical help. The police officer reportedly approached him after seeing him being carried by two men at which point the 22-year-old reportedly became violent and needed to be handcuffed. A month later, the Special Investigations Unit closed its investigation, concluding that Toronto police had \\"nothing to do\\" with Amurao's death, further stating the man was helped to an emergency medical area where he began to convulse and flail \\"violently,\\" and his movements prevented paramedics from treating him at which point a Toronto police officer handcuffed the man's hands to a stretcher so he could be treated while his one hand was later freed so that medication could be given to him. The SIU report also states the man was subsequently rushed to hospital and went into cardiac arrest en route at which point his remaining handcuffs were removed and the ambulance stopped, but he could not be revived by paramedics or hospital staff. In reaction to the deaths, Toronto city councilor Giorgio Mammoliti released a statement saying festival organizers INK Entertainment, and INK chief executive Charles Khabouth were partially responsible for the deaths, \\"due to their negligence and poor security measures\\". Mammoliti's statement additionally blamed fellow councilors Gord Perks and Mike Layton for the deaths. Through its lawyer James Zibarras, INK Entertainment immediately demanded full retraction from Mammoliti, threatening legal action if one is not issued within 48 hours. On late Friday afternoon, 8 August 2014, almost a full day after the deadline set by INK's lawyer, Mammoliti formally retracted his earlier statement that blamed Khabouth and INK; the company didn't pursue legal action. With its investigation focusing on party drugs from the very beginning, the Toronto police homicide squad investigation whose findings were announced almost a year later in late July 2015 concluded that the two drug- related deaths were accidental. The police also announced plans of installing so-called \\"amnesty boxes\\" at the 2015 Veld where attendees can deposit drugs without any legal consequences. The 2015 edition of Veld was subsequently cancelled due to a severe thunder storm warning. Former assets =Stilife= Stilife was an upscale Toronto nightclub that ran from 1987 until 1995 in a 1920s six-storey brick building at the southwest corner of Richmond and Duncan Streets. Opening in October 1987 in the building's basement with a dirt floor, it was run in very hands-on fashion by young entrepreneur Charles Khabouth who leased the 6,000 square foot spaceKhabouth at an extremely cheap rate of C$4 per square foot. Despite being located in a then-deserted part of Toronto's former Garment District, Stilife quickly managed to develop an image of exclusivity, becoming a favourite hangout for Toronto's posh crowd. The club was populated by attractive, well-heeled patrons that had to pass a strict door policy designed to attract glamorous, high-income clientele. Soon after opening Stilife, Khabouth sold Club Z, a Yonge and Wellesley area club that was his first entrepreneurial effort in the hospitality industry, in order to fully concentrate on his ambitious new venue. In complete contrast to Club Z that was open to anyone who wanted to dance, Khabouth went out of his way to make every single aspect of Stilife exclusive. The goal was attracting a more mature, sophisticated, and free- spending urban crowd rather than settling for suburban youth that many downtown Toronto clubs catered to at the time. Inspired by the look of the recently opened Diamond club at Sherbourne Street whose interior differed significantly from the standard brass-and-mirrors decor of the numerous clubs in the city, Khabouth devoted particular attention to his new venue's interior design. He hired Toronto-based Yabu Pushelberg design studio (consisting of George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg who would go on to achieve international renown, but were still largely unknown outside of the city) to come up with ideas for the club's interior. They traveled to New York City for inspiration, ending up with dark, sculptured aesthetic and edgy, industrial design, which featured a heavy use of polished steel, concrete, and mosaic tile. The chain walls created by long chains hanging off the club's ceiling were a particularly big draw. Furthermore, Stilife's core interior elements referenced Art Deco, Salvador Dal√≠, and Blade Runner. In addition to attracting the rich of Toronto, Stilife soon gained a reputation as a celebrity hangout with notable guests such as Madonna (dropped by in late May 1990 during her Blond Ambition World Tour), George Michael, and Prince further fueling its success and enhancing its status. In terms of the music played, Stilife covered a wide range of sounds and themed nights. Many Toronto DJs worked the venue, but two left their mark especially ‚Äî Richard Vermeulen who was the resident on Tuesdays for most of the club's run and JC Sunshine whose residency was Fridays. Vermeulen particularly proved adept at combining genres, spinning an eclectic mix that covered the range from Ted Nugent's \\"Stranglehold\\" over to James Brown, disco, funk, and hard rock, until Bomb the Bass' \\"Beat Dis\\", Eric B. & Rakim's \\"Paid in Full\\", and Baby Ford's \\"Oochy Coochy\\". DJ Mark Oliver joined Stilife in 1990 after the closure of Tazmanian Ballroom and became resident on Mondays that were popular with voguing gay men; for Oliver this marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Khabouth and Ink that would later continue in his other clubs. By early 1990s numerous new nightclubs opened along Richmond Street West and Adelaide Street West as well as in adjoining streets within the area bound by Front St., Queen Street West, Bathurst St., and Simcoe St. all of which was a consequence of low rent in the said area and Khabouth's success with Stilife there. Among them were: Go-Go (a three-level superclub opened by the Ballinger brothers in 1990 across the street from Stilife at the north-west corner of Richmond & Duncan), 23 Hop (a minimalist all-ages club opened by Wesley Thuro during summer 1990 in a warehouse down the street from Stilife at 318 Richmond that would soon become a catalyst for the Toronto rave scene), Venus, Klub Max (a huge venue started in 1990 by Nick DiDonato and Angelo Belluz in a heritage building on Peter St. just south of King Street West that previously housed DiDonato's P.M. Toronto sports bar and restaurant), LimeLight (in 1993 by businessman Zisi Konstantinou at 250 Adelaide Street West near the corner with Duncan Street), My Apartment (a club in an old shoe factory building at 81 Peter Street playing Top 40 music), and Club 606. At the same time, Khabouth for his part attempted, and mostly failed, to expand into fine dining with his involvement in several restaurants ‚Äî Boa Cafe, Oceans, Acrobat, and Bellair Cafe ‚Äî quickly ending, either via him pulling out of the venture or the venues folding. Most of those restaurants were in the Yorkville upscale neighbourhood where in 1992 he also opened Skorpio nightclub that closed by 1994. In late 1995 after eight years of successful operation, Khabouth sold Stilife, describing the decision as being motivated by his desire to expand and the inability to do so at the Richmond and Duncan location due to space, capacity, and ceiling height constraints. Right away in 1995, Fluid nightclub opened at the location vacated by Stilife. The new club was also successful, continuing until 2009 including a slight mid-2000s makeover and re-branding as Fluid Lounge. In February 2010 Pop Nightclub opened in the same location, but folded quickly. Over the coming decades Khabouth has occasionally organized one-off Stilife retro parties in Toronto under the 'A Return To Stilife' moniker. =Oceans= In late 1989, emboldened by the rapid success of his Stilife nightclub, 27-year-old Charles Khabouth opened Oceans restaurant in the same building as a companion piece, attempting to transfer some of the nightclub's sexy upscale vibe into the dining setting. He recruited celebrity chef Greg Couillard and the restaurant even got featured on the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous TV show. However, things quickly started to unravel and by July 1990 Couillard quit, taking most of the kitchen staff with him. His replacement was Susur Lee, another high-profile chef, but he only lasted a few weeks. The restaurant got merged into Stilife by year's end. The high-profile failure of Oceans got Khabouth a bit of a tarnished reputation on the Toronto entertainment scene that followed him in various forms throughout subsequent decades as far as his involvement with dining is concerned ‚Äî the charge that food is secondary in his restaurants. Joanne Kates, The Globe and Mail food critic at the time, claimed \\"Khabouth never intended the food to be important at Oceans\\", further stating that the restaurant imploded \\"once he realized he couldn't run it as a club and efficiently make money\\". Khabouth identified the inability of celebrity chefs to subordinate as the main reason for Oceans failure: \\"I had a hard time working with some of these chefs. With celebrity chefs, it's like you work for them\\". =Boa Caf√©= Opened in Yorkville in October 1989 as a collaboration between Khabouth (at the time owner of successful upscale nightclub Stilife) and fellow young Lebanese-Canadian Rony Hitti, Boa Caf√© was a venue that brought fine dining and club culture together. Hitti, who studied finance and politics at York University while DJing at various Toronto clubs during the 1980s befriended Khabouth at Stilife. Traveling to Montreal together, the two went to a place called Lola's Paradise and thought Toronto could use a similar venue ‚Äî a late-night dining spot catering to the Stilife crowd that had very few eating options after the 1 a.m. last call. They found a spot at 25 Bellair Street that previously housed a daytime coffee shop and after extensive renovations opened Boa Caf√© to much fanfare in October 1989 as 50/50 partners. Chic and trendy, Boa served food and drinks from noon until late night five days a week. Though the venue received plenty of positive notices in local press, it faced financial problems in its first year. These issues coincided with the problems Khabouth was experiencing with Stilife due to the Oceans restaurant that he opened as an adjoining piece in the same building. The relationship between Hitti and Khabouth soured and by 1991 the two decided to go their separate ways. Hitti took over the venue, reorganized it by making it more focused on food than drinking. It continued running with much success until 1998. =Acrobat= Despite his continued success with Stilife nightclub in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Khabouth experienced trouble expanding into the dining aspect of the hospitality industry with his involvement in two high-profile restaurants - Boa Caf√© and Oceans - quickly turning sour. Almost immediately, Khabouth jumped into another high-profile project, again in Yorkville, but this time in partnership with established Toronto restaurateur Franco Prevedello. Following numerous delays and C$1.4 million in renovations, they opened Acrobat in June 1992 at 1221 Bay Street, catering to upscale Yorkville clientele with a restaurant-nightclub hybrid. However, their relationship quickly soured and Khabouth got out of the venture the same year, selling his share to Prevedello. Apparently, they weren't seeing eye to eye due to Khabouth wanting to make Acrobat a supper club where people dined and danced while Prevedello was only interested in the dining part. The restaurant continued under Prevedello until 1994. =Bellair Caf√©= The famous Bellair Caf√© in Yorkville at 100 Cumberland St. had been closed for four years when Khabouth decided to revive it in 1995. It first opened in 1981 under the ownership of famous Toronto restaurateur and nightclub owner Tom Kristenbrun who had by this time already been involved with the El Mocambo live music venue and the upscale Bemelmans restaurant.Tom Kristenbrun on ChefDB Like Bemelmans, Kristenbrun's other fine dining Yorkville menu, nearby Bellair Caf√© also became a place to see and be seen, attracting local stars like Bryan Adams as well as visiting celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, and Robert Altman, especially during The Festival of Festivals (later renamed the Toronto International Film Festival). The celebrity practice of starting the evening off with a cocktail party at Bellair Caf√© before going to their movie's gala opening and afterwards winding up at The Copa nightclub for dancing became well established at the festival. In 1991, Kristenbrun, who in the meantime opened and established additional lucrative fine dining properties such as Rhodes near Yonge & St. Clair and Bistro 990 on Bay & Wellesley, got out of the Bellair Caf√© venture and the venue closed. In 1995, Khabouth (who had already established himself as the owner of influential Stilife nightclub and was in the process of taking over the RPM nightclub, but nevertheless also had a recent string of failed fine dining ventures) decided to try again by resuscitating the famous Bellair Caf√© at the same spot. Staying with the same upscale concept, Bellair under Khabouth continued to attract celebrities as well as movie industry movers and shakers such as Harvey Weinstein. It closed less than two years later in 1997, this time for good. Right away, a new restaurant, Sassafraz, opened at Bellair's spot and also went on to become very popular. =The Guvernment / Kool Haus complex= The Guvernment in July 2007. The Guvernment was the name of a nightclub complex in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1996, it was incarnated from the former RPM nightclub, which closed its doors after ten years at the same location. Kool Haus was often used as a venue for concerts and live performances. In 2008, The Guvernment was voted #8 nightclub in the world in DJMag's Top 100 Clubs. Additional concept rooms included Haven, The Gallery, Surface, Chroma and the rooftop patio, Skybar. The complex was located directly across from Lake Ontario, in downtown Toronto. The Guvernment / KoolHaus complex was Canada‚Äôs largest and longest running entertainment complex, with a capacity of over 5000. This complex hosted Ti√´sto, Coldplay, Deadmau5, Avicii, Afrojack, Bob Dylan, Lady Gaga, David Guetta, Common, N.E.R.D, The Black Eyed Peas, Armin Van Buuren, and many more over the years. Popular events held in this complex included Decadence and Labour of Love. The Guvernment and Koolhaus Entertainment Complex closed its doors on January 31, 2015 and is expected to be replaced by a mixed-use project. =Ame= Japanese cuisine restaurant Ame opened in September 2009 on 19 Mercer Street in the Toronto Entertainment District as a collaboration between Khabouth and the Rubino brothers (Michael and Guy) at the spot where the Rubinos had previously for almost ten years co-owned and operated Rain, a club-like pan-Asian restaurant. Rain closed down in January 2009 for modest renovations as the Rubinos planned on adding a sushi and sashimi bar and quickly re-opening. However, in the meantime, they went into business with Ink's Charles Khabouth who convinced them to completely change up the concept. The venue thus re-opened with a new name (Ame), new concept (high end Japanese food), new completely renovated space, and Khabouth as the new business partner. In October 2010, Ame held a lavish one-year anniversary party. In June 2011 a re-zoning application was submitted to the City of Toronto from a real estate developer wishing to build a residential condominium building on the plot currently occupied by two old buildings, specifically units from 15 to 35 Mercer Street15-35 Mercer Street - Zoning Amendment Application - Preliminary Report including Ame at the time. The application was eventually rejected. Ame closed in August 2011 with Michael Rubino attributing its failure to a \\"difference in vision\\" between him and Khabouth. After renovations that lasted through the second part of 2012, Khabouth opened Buonanotte at the same location in January 2013 as a licensed offshoot of the eponymous Montreal restaurant. =Briscola Trattoria= Briscola opened in February 2011 at 501 College St. near Palmerston Boulevard in Little Italy as a collaboration between Khabouth and Syrian-born Toufik Sarwa at the same spot where Sarwa's short-lived Cinq 01 previously operated. However, Briscola also turned out to have very short lifespan, closing in 2012. By June 2012 Mexican restaurant La Carnita co-owned by Andrew Richmond and Amin Todai opened in its spot. =The Cocktail Parlor at Storys= After getting introduced to one another in 2011, Ink's Charles Khabouth and Icon Legacy's Hanif Harji forged a business collaboration that began with their October 2011 purchase of the Storys building and continued by opening two restaurants on King West in 2012 ‚Äî Weslodge Saloon and Patria. By summer 2013 they were ready to launch yet another joint venue ‚Äî The Cocktail Parlor at Storys, a cocktail lounge on the second floor of the building they acquired almost two years prior. Inspired by a bar called The Aviary in Chicago, The Cocktail Parlour featured an extensive 60-cocktail menu along with snacks overseen by executive chef Stuart Cameron who simultaneously performed the same duties at Weslodge and Patria, the other two Khabouth-Harji venues at the time along with decor that referenced the prohibition era as well as 1920s and 1930s in general. With its opening timed for the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, The Cocktail Parlor hosted numerous celebrity parties in its first month of operation. With the March 2014 launch of Byblos restaurant on the Storys building ground floor, The Cocktail Parlor soon closed permanently. =Product= Product, previously known as This is London until late 2012, was a multilevel nightclub featuring numerous bars, various private lounges, and a ladies spa all with a capacity of 1,200 people. It was set in a renovated 1936 warehouse at 364 Richmond Street West near the corner of Richmond West & Peter in Toronto's Entertainment District. The 364 Richmond West building first got converted into a nightclub in 2000. After four years of operation, the venue got acquired by INK Entertainment in 2004. Having gone through several names already, the nightlife venue eventually became known as This is London. INK's idea for the offering of This is London was combining electronic music with Toronto's mid-to-late 2000s upscale scene. To that end, a steady stream of celebrities including Paris Hilton, Jon Jones, Michael Sorrentino, Usher, Kardinal Offishall, etc. came through the club's doors. On the musical side, Fridays at the club, billed as Soho Fridays, proved popular ‚Äî featuring numerous house music acts such as Deniz Koyu, Kaskade, Moby, DJ AM, Chus & Ceballos, Morgan Page, Mark Knight, Fedde le Grand, Steve Aoki, Carl Cox, Benny Benassi, etc. By late 2012, This is London re-branded to Product. From mid 2014, Barcode, night spot with capacity of 450 people, opened on the upper level of Product nightclub. Product closed in late May 2015 with the remaining parties moved to the Polson Pier complex, specifically the Solarium venue that was for these occasions billed as Barcode by the Lake. The reason for Product's closing had to do with the overall trend of residential condos and office buildings being built in the area; after the 364 Richmond West building found itself next to a commercial and office space, the building's landlord offered to buy the nightclub out of its remaining lease. =Citt√†= In December 2014, Citt√† opened in the CityPlace neighbourhood as a three-way partnership between INK's Khabouth, ICON's Harji, and Adam Brown, the owner of Fox & Fiddle pub franchise in Toronto. Located on the ground floor of a Concord Pacific condo tower at 92 Fort York Blvd and serving casual Italian cuisine, the owners' initial idea was to treat the 80-seat venue with a 100-person patio as a base to be grown over time into a franchise with a possible second location at Adelaide West & John already under construction. They hired Ben Heaton who previously worked at Claudio Aprile's Colborne Lane and Mark McEwan's ONE to be Citt√†'s first executive chef. The partners also brought on David Mattachioni, a 14-year veteran of the Terroni company, to train the staff and run Citt√†'s pizza oven as well as head baker Carlo Lazzarino also of Terroni. Early reviews focused on Citt√†'s decor being more modest than other \\"luxe, spare-no-expense design\\" Khabouth-Harji eateries and its food not being top-notch when compared with \\"Old World cooking throughout the city\\". The restaurant tried to generate some buzz by hosting promotions such as a September 2015 pop-up from prominent Brooklyn hipster pizzeria Roberta's, however, Citt√† continually struggled for patrons compared to other CityPlace neighbourhood eateries like Hunter's Landing. With the same trio of Khabouth, Harji, and Brown opening Figo in November 2015 at Adelaide West & John, site once touted as Citt√†'s potential second location, Citt√†'s days looked to be numbered. The restaurant closed in late December 2015 with further news about its owners hiring chef Guillermo Herbertson of Barsa Taberna to develop a new Mexican-inspired restaurant concept for an April 2016 opening at the same location focusing largely on inexpensive snack and finger foods. =Tattoo= Tattoo, previously known as Tattoo Queen West and Tattoo Rock Parlour, was a nightclub and live performance venue. It opened in December 2007 as Tattoo Rock Parlour via INK's partnership with Nick Di Donato's Liberty Entertainment Group and King Street tattoo shop Black Line Studios. Its co-owners Khabouth and Di Donato reportedly spent C$2.5 million on renovating the space before the launch. Initially advertised as Canada's only tattoo parlor and bar, Tattoo included a two-level event space that could hold over 400 people. Compared to other Queen West rock clubs such as Velvet Underground and the longstanding Bovine Sex Club, Tattoo was going more for designer d√©cor. Its location at 567 Queen Street West was previously, from 1993 until 2004, occupied by the Di Donato-owned Left Bank nightclub (with Crystal Room lounge bar inside it). Initially, Tattoo offered a food menu with items ranging from mac-and-cheese to steak. Shifting between live bands and DJ nights, Tattoo has hosted live performances from the likes of Dragonette (performed the 2008 New Year's concert on 31 December 2007), The Killers, Nickelback, Broken Social Scene (performed on 24 September 2008 as part of the inaugural Verge Music Awards), and M.I.A. (performed on 3 May 2014 as part of Canadian Music Week). Additionally, it welcomed various celebrities via either event after parties or paid appearances such as Avril Lavigne, Gene Simmons (hosted a party on 14 September 2010 during TIFF), Drew Barrymore (attended Whip It after-party on 13 September 2009), and Slash (stopped by with bodyguards and partied on 10 September 2010 as part of a paid appearance following a live concert at Kool Haus, another one of Khabouth's venues).INK Twitter INK sold the venue during spring 2016.

(1979). Mazes, maps, and memory. American Psychologist, 34, 583-596). It is shaped like the letter T (or Y), providing the subject, typically a rodent, with a straightforward choice. T-mazes are used to study how the rodents function with memory and spatial learning through applying various stimuli. Starting in the early 20th century, rodents were used in experiments such as the T-Maze. These concepts of T-mazes are used to assess rodent behavior. The different tasks, such as left-right discrimination and forced alternation, are mainly used with rodents to test reference and working memory.  Apparatus  The T-maze is one of a group of various mazes of differing sizes and many shapes. It is one of the most simple, consisting of just two turns - right or left. The maze is only able to be altered by blocking one of the two paths. The basis behind the T-maze is to place the rat at the base of the maze. By placing a reward at one arm or both arms of the maze, the rat must make the choice of which path to take. The decision made by the rat can be a cause of a natural preference within the rat. A study of alternation can be performed by repeating the experiment multiple times with no reward in either arm of the maze. Another experiment that can be performed is the alternation of rewards each time the experiment is performed, proving the rat will choose the arm that was not visited each time the experiment starts. Rewards within the rats can be types of food, another rat within a cage, an odor, or a type of shelter. By performing this type of experiment, the rat's preferences can be determined. Examples of this could be a rat's food preferences, its familiarity with specific smells and scents, the attraction of the male and female within the maze, and whether a young rat prefers an adult female or an adult male. These simple experiments can determine the rat's psyche on multiple subjects, and ultimately divulge further into the rat's psychological characteristics. It is also important to consider the rodent's behavior. The use of spatial and non-spatial cues is very influential to research findings on memory, spatial learning and the long-term potential (LTP). These cues include the orientation of the maze, extra-maze cues and room configuration cues. Strategies may be affected by the rodent's ability to find cues in the room, the presence or absence of polarizing cues in the room, and the stability of the maze in the room. When analyzing and interpreting experimental data, researchers have to consider the orientation and configuration of the apparatus and cues in the room. = Other mazes =  Multiple T-maze  This type of apparatus includes multiple T-mazes connected which result in a very complex maze. It is constructed of a high number of T-junctions. Each intersection remains the same length and scale, which gives every point within the maze a direct right or wrong answer. By not changing the size of the maze, it allows for the rat to focus on the decision and not be confused if the size of the maze was altered within the junctions. Multiple T-mazes are constructed to question response vs. place techniques and of cognitive direction and mapping. An example of an experiment within a multiple T-maze was performed by allowing the rat to explore the multiple T-maze without a reward. After letting the rat roam, researchers restarted the maze again with a reward placed at the end of the maze. The rats with prior exposure to the maze were able to easily navigate through the maze to reach the reward. This experiment proved that rats have the ability to generate a cognitive map when exposed to their surroundings and can process this information when needed to complete a task.  Y-maze  Researchers have also created the Y-Maze which functions very similar to the T-maze. The Y-Maze is altered to have a more gradual change into the arms. The arms are also all equal in length and distance apart from one another. The Y-maze has proven to be easier for rats to understand the layout of the space and recognize rewards, similar pattern, and adapt to new experiments at a quicker pace.  Radial arm maze  This type of maze is constructed with a center platform with arms radiating from the center. The original maze had 8 spokes, but they have been constructed with as few as 3 and as many as 48 spokes. This type of maze is used to perform short-term memory experimentations on rats. Rats are examined on whether or not they have the ability to remember the arms they have already explored. This is determined by placing food pellets at each of the arms and the rat must only travel down each arm once and retrieve the pellet accordingly.  Purpose  The concepts of T-mazes are used to assess rodent behavior. The different tasks such as left-right discrimination and forced alternation are mainly used with rodents to test reference and working memory. Maze research is used to show how the rodent‚Äôs behavior evolves with alternate strategies to do different tasks.  Spatial learning  The spatial memory of the rat is responsible for recording information about the rat‚Äôs environment as well as its spatial orientation. It is this spatial memory that allows the rat to navigate its way through the various types of mazes and challenges presented to it by the experimenters. This also allows the rat to navigate the same maze multiple times while remembering the correct and incorrect pathways (unless the scientists change the paths in between tests). In the T-maze this is relegated to a single left or right turn, but in more complex mazes it becomes a series of turns for the rat to remember in order to reach its goal and reward. A poorly working spatial memory can result in a rat getting repeatedly lost in the maze regardless of how successful previous attempts were or how unchanged the maze is.  Hippocampus  The hippocampus is located in the medial temporal lobe area of the brain and is responsible for governing spatial memory. In animals, this allows them to have a spatial map of their environment and it uses reference and working memory to accomplish this. It also has important functions that govern long and short- term memory as well as spatial navigation, both of which are required in order for the rat to correctly navigate the maze.

Strindheim is the only other team from Trondheim that Rosenborg has played against in the top league. The two groundshared Lerkendal Stadium in Strindheim's top-league 1984 and 1995 seasons. SK Haugar, which only played in the same division as Rosenborg in 1981, is the only team which has beaten Rosenborg more times than Rosenborg has beaten it. Haugar and Vard are the only teams against which Rosenborg holds a negative goal difference. Along with Nessegutten, Haugar is the only team Rosenborg has never beaten. Conversely, Rosenborg has won every league match against Djerv 1919, Os, Pors and Stj√∏rdals-Blink; Rosenborg holds a clean sheet against the latter three.

Guardians In 2005, Neely painted his first \\"Guardian\\" painting, a small angel image on found wood, for his mother. The painting was created in memory of his brother Erik Hudson Neely who died in 2000 from an epileptic seizure. His mother, Clare L. Neely wanted the piece to hang between the doorframe and the light switch in Erik's childhood bedroom. Neely gave his mother a few more of these angel paintings on found wood for her to give to friends. Neely began selling them after a request for 50 from a Spartanburg business owner who wanted to give them as a Christmas gift to his employees. Neely's Guardians have been sold nationally and internationally, but primarily in the Southern United States. Troubled by the feeling that they had become knickknacks, Neely stopped selling the Guardian angels for 6 months in 2008, and instead went back to giving them away, sometimes hiding them in various locations in the city of Spartanburg for people to find. Since he resumed selling these works in 2009, Neely has often received criticism from artists and art professionals that he should not paint as many of his Guardians or sell them so cheaply. In response Neely is quoted in saying, \\"I think any artist would be honored to have a work that can connect with people so powerfully.\\" Neely has now painted more than 10,000 guardian angels on found wood. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm working on a Guardian, I try to think to myself about what this could mean to the person who receives it,‚Äù Neely said. ‚ÄúWhen I catch myself in a moment of slipping out of that kind of awareness, I‚Äôll just stop. The numbers (of angels he makes) aren‚Äôt important; it‚Äôs that I focus on the one.‚Äù  Education  Neely earned his Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Interdisciplinary Art from Goddard College in 2009. Neely holds the B.A. degree from Wofford College (2002) with a major in religion, graduating summa cum laude, first in his class, Phi Beta Kappa, Presidential International Scholar, and recipient of the Walter E. Hudgins Award for Intellectual Courage, Creativity, and Vision. Career Neely is the owner and creative director of the Wet Paint Syndrome Studio. He worked with the Success Initiative program at Wofford College from 2005 until 2010. He served as the Assistant Director of the program before being appointed as the Executive Director in 2007. At Wofford College, Neely has also served as the Director of Residence Life and the Director of Project Development in the Office of Student Affairs.

Among his fields of study were the isolation and purification of cellular organelles, protein crystallization, enzymes (specifically catalase), DNA binding proteins, and the chemical basis of protein synthesis. He also invented the Dounce homogenizer, which was named after him.  Biography  Alexander Dounce was born on December 7, 1909, in New York. He began his undergraduate studies at Hamilton College but later moved to Cornell University, where he also did his doctoral studies in the lab of James B. Sumner, a pioneer in protein crystallization. Dounce received his PhD in organic chemistry in 1935, the title of his thesis being \\"Study of dihydrofurans and the dehydration rearrangement of 2,3-ethylenic 1,4-diols\\". According to Marshall W. Nirenberg, another biochemist who knew Dounce personally, \\"during his [Dounce's] final doctoral exam when his doctoral committee got together to ask him questions after he had finished his thesis research, his mentor, Sumner, asked him the question, 'How do proteins synthesize other proteins?' He [Dounce] said that question remained in his mind ever since then.\\" After his graduation, Dounce stayed in Sumners lab and did work on enzymes, particularly on enzyme isolation and purification. Together with Sumner, he achieved the first crystallization of the enzyme catalase in 1937. In 1941, Dounce moved to the Department of Biochemistry at University of Rochester Medical School, where he worked on the mechanism of uranium poisoning for the Manhattan Project. After the end of World War II, he focussed on studying cell nuclei and particularly the isolation of intact nuclei from tissue, which was a new field of research at the time. In 1952, Alexander Dounce and Ernest Kay, who was Dounce's first PhD student, published a new method for DNA isolation and purification from nuclei employing sodium dodecyl sulfate that became widely used. Also in 1952, Dounce wrote a review article in which he, as one of the first scientists to do so, proposed that DNA might serve as a template for the synthesis of RNA, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of proteins. This order of synthesis, which has later been termed the \\"central dogma of molecular biology\\" by Francis Crick, is textbook knowledge today. However, it was not until 1958, when Crick coined the term central dogma and described the concept in more detail, (early draft of original article) that it gained widespread acceptance. In the same review article, Dounce was also one of the first scientists to propose a genetic code in which nucleotide triplets code for each of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. He correctly assumed that genes consist of nucleic acid sequences which determine the amino acid sequences of proteins, and that a protein's sequence determines its function. Based on these assumptions, Dounce speculated that, during protein synthesis, each amino acid would pair with an individual nucleotide; the two other nucleotides surrounding it would determine the specificity of the binding. While the actual mechanism turned out to be different, Dounce's hypothesis that nucleotide triplets code for amino acids was correct, and his speculations \\"helped lead to the deciphering of the code.\\" In the words of Nirenberg, \\"In the review he was far ahead of everybody else [...]. He predicted that the code would be a triplet code, and that, as I recall, RNA was the template for protein synthesis. But he buried this article in the proceedings of an Oak Ridge symposium that nobody read. [...] By and large, the ideas were good, although he was wrong on minutiae. I was amazed when I finally read it.\\" When James D. Watson and George Gamow founded the RNA Tie Club in 1954, Dounce became one of its members; his designation was GLN (glutamine). The Dounce homogenizers, devices used for mechanical lysis of tissue or cells, were invented by and named after Alexander Dounce. Dounce's work on the isolation of cellular organelles, particularly nuclei and mitochondria, led to the development of the Dounce homogenizers in 1954. A Dounce homogenizer or \\"Douncer\\" is a glass mortar and pestle with a very small clearance between the mortar and the pestle ‚Äì in Dounce's original design as little as 0.0005 inches or about 13 micrometers. This allows for tissue and cells to be lysed by shear stress while leaving the smaller organelles intact. Dounce homogenizers are still commonly used today to isolate cellular organelles. When Dounce's former mentor, James B. Sumner, died in 1955, Dounce wrote Sumner's obituary in Nature. For the remainder of his career, Dounce continued his research on nuclei and their contents, catalase, and protein crystallization. Dounce died on April 24, 1997, in Rochester, New York. He was survived by his wife, Anna Elizabeth Dounce, who was the daughter of botanist Donald Reddick, and by their three children Helen, Eric, and George.

History The club was founded on 1 November 1915 and established its headquarters in Banfield, Buenos Aires, while building its stadium in Lomas de Zamora. The football team affiliated to Argentine Football Association and made its debut in Primera Divisi√≥n in 1923.

Argentino only spent one season in the second division, returning to Primera at the end of 1927 season. The team finished 2nd after champion El Porvenir therefore both teams promoted to the highest division of Argentine football. Argentino played from 1928 to 1931 in the Asociaci√≥n Amateurs (then merged with official AFA) with poor campaigns in those seasons. With the creation of the first professional football league in Argentina, dissident Liga Argentina de Football in 1931, Argentino de Banfield remained playing in the official AFA until 1931. Nevertheless it did not last so long because on March 15, 1932, Club Argentino de Banfield merged with C.A. Temperley to form \\"Argentino de Temperley\\", although both clubs Argentino and Temperley continued their social and other sports activities separately. Under the new name, the football squad played the 1933 and 1934 championships in the official amateur league (AFA). When both associations, LAF and AFA merged at the end of the season, all its teams (including Argentino de Temperley) were relegated to the second division.

Williams (born January 8, 1953) is an American politician who served as the Mayor of Wilmington, Delaware from 2013 to 2017. He previously served in the Delaware House of Representatives from 1995 to 2013 in a district based in northern Wilmington. He won the mayoral election for the city of Wilmington on November 6, 2012. Williams ran for a second term as mayor in 2016, but lost in the primary to Mike Purzycki, who succeeded him as mayor. Early life and career Born in Wilmington, Williams attended P.S. duPont High School, graduated in criminal justice from Delaware Technical Community College, and was a student at Wilmington Police Academy. He then worked homicide at the city's police department. Political career In the 1994 state elections, Orlando George, Jr. was re-elected in the 1st district, but he resigned his post the following year to become president of Delaware Technical Community College. A special election was held on August 12 to fill the vacancy, in which Williams defeated Republican Karen Miller 1757 to 897, later securing a much larger majority when he won re-election for his first full term that November. Thereafter, Williams was unopposed in every general election until 2008, when he crushed Republican James McClain Jr. 91% to 9%, and was unopposed again in 2010. By the end of the 2012 legislative season, Williams was chair of the joint finance committee, and the appropriations committee, whilst also serving as a member on the judiciary, corrections, public safety, and homeland security committees. =2012 mayoral election= As the end of his legislative term approached, Williams announced he would run in the Democratic primary for the 2012 Wilmington mayoral election to replace term- limited mayor James M. Baker, forgoing a further attempt for re-election to the state house. Williams ran on a platform centered around tackling crime and emphasizing his law enforcement experience. He was endorsed by the Delaware State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, and Wilmington Fire Fighters Association Local 1590, but failed to secure the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1, his home Lodge. His campaign ran into some controversy after it emerged he owed $3,184.77 in taxes and bills to the city, following on from a similar incident in March. He later caught up with these debts, blaming them on financial pressure wrought by paying for his mother's medical bills. Williams defeated five other candidates in the September 11 primary, and went on to win the general election unopposed. =2016 mayoral election= Williams ran for a second term as mayor in 2016. In the September 13 primary, he lost the Democratic nomination to Mike Purzycki, the former executive director of the Riverfront Development Corporation, and placed fourth in the field of eight candidates behind Purzycki, Eugene Young, and Kevin Kelley. Purzycki went on to win the general election on November 8, 2016, and Williams left office on January 3, 2017 when Purzycki was sworn in as mayor.

Wells set in an Italian villa early in 1926. It was chosen as an alternate selection of the recently founded Book of the Month Club and was translated into a number of languages, including Danish, Norwegian, Polish, and Czech. In England, 30,000 copies sold within two months, and by the summer of 1929 50,000 had been sold.David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 291. Plot summary Meanwhile is divided into two books: \\"The Utopographer in the Garden\\" and \\"Advent\\". In the first book, Cynthia and Philip Rylands, a wealthy British couple, are entertaining guests at Casa Terragena, an Italian villa with a famous garden on the Italian Riviera. Among the party are a prominent author, \\"the great Mr. Sempack,\\" an American aesthete, Mr. Plantagenet-Buchan, the beautiful, vivacious Lady Catherine, Col. and Mrs. Bullace, Lady Grieswold, and a number of others. At dinner, Sempack, a brilliant talker with ideas similar to Wells's, expounds the idea that a \\"Great Age\\" is certain to come, and that contemporaries are obliged in the present to live, as it were, \\"meanwhile\\": \\"Since nothing was in order, nothing was completely right. We lived provisionally. There was no just measure of economic worth; we had to live unjustly .... We were justified in taking life as we found it; in return if we had ease and freedom we ought to do all that we could to increase knowledge and bring the great days of a common world-order nearer, a universal justice, the real civilisation, the consummating life, the days that would justify the Martyrdom of Man.\\"H. G. Wells, Meanwhile, Book I, ¬ß5 (\\"The Idea of Meanwhile\\"). A crisis is precipitated when Cynthia Rylands, who is pregnant with her first child, surprised her husband engaged in a dalliance \\"in the little bathing chalet\\" with one of their guests, a Miss Clarges.H. G. Wells, Meanwhile, Book I, ¬ß9 (\\"Apparition of Mrs. Rylands\\"). She is distraught and confides in Sempack, who offers her wise advice in a long letter: she should not forgive her husband, but rather \\"realize that there is nothing to forgive.\\"H. G. Wells, Meanwhile, Book I, ¬ß11 (\\"Two Letters\\"). Mrs. Rylands accepts Sempack's notion that her husband's real problem is not infidelity but idleness, and the first book ends with him departing at her urging for a visit to England, where his family's vast coal holdings are at risk in the crisis that culminated in the 1926 general strike. The novel's second \\"book\\" is dominated by Philip Rylands's letters describing the British political situation (\\"many of the leading participants in the strike appear in the novel without disguise\\"David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 290.) and his recruitment to the Open Conspiracy, Wells's plan for establishing a World Republic. But it is also punctuated with a number of subplots, some comic, some dramatic. Lady Catherine undertakes the seduction of an unwilling Mr. Sempack, but before this affair can be consummated, she flees to join a British fascist committed to fighting the class war back at home. Mrs. McManus, a nurse from Ulster who comes to assist Mrs. Rylands in the last stages of her pregnancy, is a memorable comic character.H. G. Wells, Meanwhile, Book II, ¬ß13 (\\"Opinions of Mrs. McManus\\"). And Mrs. Rylands, with the help of Mrs. McManus, comes heroically to the aid of Signor Vinciguerra, a liberal Italian leader being hunted by Italian fascists in her garden; she succeeds in helping him escape to France. Meanwhile concludes with the return of a now devoted, engag√© Philip to Cynthia after she has given birth to their son. Criticism Bertrand Russell read Meanwhile \\"with the most complete sympathy\\" and told Wells he agreed with it entirely. Beatrice Webb called it an \\"inspiring essay.\\" Wells's concept of the Open Conspiracy was taken seriously in its day, and he developed it in a book-length treatment published in the following year, discussing it with Lloyd George, Harold Macmillan, Harold Nicolson, and many others.David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 291‚Äì92. Meanwhile is regarded variously by later critics. Writing in the 1980s, David C. Smith considered the novel \\"badly neglected\\" and praised \\"excellent descriptions of the rich on the Riviera just before the deluge, as well as a poignant and sharp analysis of the fascist system under stress\\" and \\"a strong statement of the Open Conspiracy.\\"David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 290‚Äì91. But Wells's most recent biographer, Michael Sherborne, judged it \\"not a successful novel\\" whose \\"dull characters ... share predictable views about the state of the world and engage in token romantic entanglements.\\"Michael Sherborne, H. G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (London and Chester Springs, PA: Peter Owen, 2010), p. 277. Some biographies do not mention it at all.For example, Vincent Brome, H. G.

These motifs include a particular dog which accompanies a hero, the dog as one of the twelve totem creatures for which years are named, a dog giving first provision of grain which allowed current agriculture, and claims of having a magical dog as an original ancestor in the case of certain ethnic groups. Myth versus history Chinese mythology is those myths found in the geographic area called China, which of course has evolved and changed throughout its history. These include myths in Chinese and other languages, as transmitted by Han Chinese as well as other ethnic groups (of which fifty-six are officially recognized by the current administration of China). (Yang 2005:4) In the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version.(Yang 2005: 12-13) This is also true of some accounts related to mythological dogs in China. Historical accounts and anecdotes about dogs from ancient China and onwards exist in extant literary works, for example in the Shiji, by Sima Qian. Archaeological study provides substantial backing and supplemental knowledge in this regard. Names in cross-cultural comparison Wolfram Eberhard points out that compared to other cultures it is \\"striking \\" that Chinese literature rarely has given names for dogs. (Eberhard 2003: 82) This means that in the context of Chinese mythology, often a dog will play an important role, but that it will not be given a proper name, but rather being referred to as \\"dog\\". As Chinese grammar does not require the use of definite or indefinite articles or marking for singular or plural number, there may be ambiguity regarding whether the reference to dog means \\"Dog\\" (proper name), \\"dogs\\", \\"a dog\\", \\"the dog\\", \\"some dogs\\", or \\"the dogs\\". Zodiacal dog Dog statue is one of the 12 Chinese Zodiacal creatures portrayed in the Kowloon Walled City Park in Kowloon City, Hong Kong. For thousands of years, a twelve-year cycle named after various real or mythological animals has been used in Southeast Asia. This twelve-year cycle, sometimes referred to as the \\"Chinese zodiac,\\" associates each year in turn with a certain creature, in a fixed order of twelve animals, after which it returns to the first in the order, the Rat. The eleventh in the cycle is the Dog. One account is that the order of the beings-of-the-year is due to their order in a racing contest involving swimming across a river, in the so-called Great Race. The reason for the Dog finishing the race second from last despite generally being a talented swimmer is explained as being due to its playful nature: the Dog played and frolicked along the way, thus delaying completing the course and reaching the finishing line. As of 2012, the next Year of the Dog in the Chinese calendar is February 16, 2018 to February 4, 2019 (Year of the Yang Earth Dog). The personalities of people born in Dog years are popularly supposed to share certain attributes associated with Dogs, such as loyalty or exuberance; however, this would be modified according to other considerations of Chinese astrology, such as the influences of the month, day and hour of birth, according to the traditional system of Earthly Branches, in which the zodiacal animals are also associated with the months and times of the day (and night), in twelve two-hour increments. The Hour of the Dog is 7 to 9 p.m. and the Dog is associated with the ninth lunar month. Panhu There are various myths and legends in which various ethnic groups claimed or were claimed to have had a divine dog as a forebear, one of these is the story of Panhu. The legendary Chinese sovereign Di Ku has been said to have a dog named Panhu. Panhu helped him win a war by killing the enemy general and bringing him his head and ended up with marriage to the emperor's daughter as a reward. The dog carried his bride to the mountainous region of the south, where they produced numerous progeny. Because of their self-identification as descendants from these original ancestors, Panhu has been worshiped by the Yao people and the She people, often as King Pan, and the eating of dog meat tabooed (Yang et al 2005, 52-53). This ancestral myth is also has been found among the Miao people and Li people (Yang et al 2005, 100 and 180). An early documentary source for the Pan-hu origin myth is by the Jin dynasty (265-420) author Gan Bao, who records this origin myth for a southern (that is, south of the Yangzi River) ethnic group which he refers to as \\"Man\\" (Ë†ª) (Mair October, 1998: 3-5 and note 3, 31-32). =Variations= There are various variations of the Panhu mythology. According to one version, the Emperor had promised his daughter in marriage as a reward to the one who brought back the enemy general's head, but due to the perceived difficulties of a dog marriage with a human bride (especially an imperial princess), the dog proposed to magically turn into a human being, by means of a process in which he would be sequestered beneath a bell for 280 days. However, the curious emperor, unable to restrain himself, lifted up the rim of the bell on the 279th day: the spell was thus broken before the transformation was completed, and, although the rest of the body had been transformed to human, the head had not (Christie 1968: 121-122). =Culturally-relative interpretations= Victor Mair (October, 1998) brings up the point that the idea of being descended from dogs may have a pejorative connotation or connotations. Whether this would be the case or not would be relative to assumed cultural evaluations of dogs versus humans. Erlang's dog Dog, Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), earthenware with polychrome One of the stock heroic supernatural beings with mighty martial prowess in Chinese culture is Erlang, a character in Journey to the West. Erlang has been said to have a dog. In the epic novel, Journey to the West Erlang's dog helps him in his fight against the evolved-monkey hero, Sun Wukong, critically biting him on the leg. Later on in the story (Chapter 63), Sun Wukong with Erlang (now both on the same side) and their companions-in-fight battle against a Nine- headed Insect monster, when, again, Erlang's small hound comes to the rescue and defeats by biting off the monster's retractable head, which popped in and out of its torso: the monster then flees, dripping blood, off into the unknown. The author of the Journey to the West comments that this is the origin of the \\"nine-headed blood-dripping bird\\", and that this trait was passed on to its descendant. Anthony C. Yu, editor and translator of Journey to the West associates this bird with the ts'ang k√™ng of Chinese mythology (1980: Volume III, 441, note 5 on chapter 63). Tiangou The Tiangou (\\"Heavenly Dog\\") has been said to resemble a black dog or meteor, which is thought to eat the sun or moon during an eclipse, unless frightened away. Obtaining grain According to the myths of various ethnic groups, a dog provided humans with the first grain seeds enabling the seasonal cycle of planting, harvesting, and replanting staple agricultural products by saving some of the seed grains to replant, thus explaining the origin of domesticated cereal crops. This myth is common to the Buyi, Gelao, Hani, Miao, Shui, Tibetan, Tujia, and Zhuang peoples. (Yang 2005: 53) A version of this myth collected from ethnic Tibetan people in Sichuan tells that in ancient times grain was tall and bountiful, but that rather than being duly grateful for the plenty that people even used it for personal hygiene after defecation, which so angered the God of Heaven that he came down to earth to repossess it all. However, a dog grasped his pant leg, piteously crying, and so moving God of Heaven to leave a few seeds from each type of grain with the dog, thus providing the seed stock of today's crops. Thus it is said that because humans owe their possession of grain seed stocks to a dog, people should share some of their food with dogs.(Yang 2005: 53-54) Another myth, of the Miao people, recounts the time of the distantly remote era when dogs had nine tails, until a dog went to steal grains from heaven, and lost eight of its tails to the weapons of the heavenly guards while making its escape, but bringing back grain seeds stuck onto its surviving tail. According to this, when Miao people hold their harvest celebration festival, the dogs are the first to be fed.(Yang 2005: 54) The Zhuang and Gelao peoples have a similar myth explaining why it is that the ripe heads of grain stalks are curly, bushy, and bent ‚Äì just so as is the tail of a dog.(Yang 2005: 54) Ritual =Paper dogs= In northern China, dog images made by cutting paper were thrown in the water as part of the ritual of the Double Fifth (Duanwu Festival) holiday, celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, as an apotropaic magic act meant to drive away evil spirits. Paper dogs were also provided for protecting the dead (Eberhard, 2003: 80). \\"Foo Dogs\\" Chinese stone statue of \\"lions\\", showing pronounced dog-like features Numerous statuary of Chinese guardian lions exist, which are often called \\"Fu Dogs\\" \\"Foo Dogs\\", \\"Fu Lions\\", \\"Fo Lions\\", and \\"Lion Dogs\\". Modern lions are not native in the area of China, except perhaps the extreme west; however, their existence was well known, and associated symbolism and ideas about lions were familiar; however, in China, artistic representations of lions tended to be dog-like. Indeed, \\"[t]he 'lion' which we see depicted in Chinese paintings and in sculpture bears little resemblance to the real animal, which, however, plays a big part in Chinese folklore.\\"(Eberhard, 2003: 164) The reasons for referencing \\"guardian lions\\" as \\"dogs\\" in Western cultures may be obscure, however the phenomenon is well known. Real and legendary dogs Later Han dynasty, a standing statue of a dog from Sichuan. Despite any fantastic myths from China about dogs, real dogs have been familiar throughout China since prehistorical times (unlike certain exotic animals, such as lions or other creatures, whose real attributes may often only have been known indirectly). Dogs also feature in various historical and legendary accounts or stories, found in the extensive literary records of China, although in some cases the lines between myth and ancient history are uncertain. However, in many myths, legends, or other accounts of dogs in Chinese literature, the dog or dogs are presented in ways that in have no appearance of the fanciful or fantastic (as opposed to the way other creatures may typically be handled in mythology, such as in the case of turtles, snakes, dragons, or often even horses). Other canids in Chinese mythology Other members of the canidae family also figure in Chinese mythology, including wolves and foxes. The portrayal of these is usually quite different than in the case of dogs. Tales and literature on foxes is especially extensive, with foxes often having magical qualities, such as being able to shift back and forth to human shape, live for incredible life spans, and to grow supernumerary tails (nine being common).

Dirty World Entertainment Recordings LLC Richie has been the defendant in several lawsuits relating to material posted on TheDirty.com. Like operators of other blogs and websites which allow third party users to submit content, Richie has argued that he is protected from liability by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. At least one federal court in Missouri agreed with this argument, holding that a lawsuit against Richie was barred by the CDA. The case, S.C. v. Dirty World LLC, involved a post entitled \\"Dirty Church Girl\\" which was submitted to TheDirty.com by a third-party user. The young woman named in the post sued Richie for defamation and other claims, but in March 2012 the court held that Richie was entitled to immunity under the Communications Decency Act.Order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Western Division In another, heavily publicized case, Sarah Jones v. Dirty World Entertainment Recordings, LLC, a federal court in Kentucky initially reached the opposite conclusion, finding that Richie was not entitled to CDA immunity in a case arising from several posts about Kentucky high school teacher and part-time cheerleader Sarah Jones. The jury awarded Jones $338,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. However, Richie filed a successful appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which in June 2014 ordered the judgment vacated and dismissed.Opinion from United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Media appearances In January 2009, Richie was named one of Arizona's \\"10 most fascinating people\\" and interviewed by The Arizona Republic, behind other notable Arizonans such as political pundit Meghan McCain and author Stephenie Meyer.

McGraw questioned Richie about the morality of a website which allows users to openly bash each other with hurtful and profane comments, to which Richie responded that there is a marketplace for such a website. McGraw replied, \\"Well, there's a marketplace for heroin too, but that doesn't justify being a heroin addict.\\" In November 2011, Richie was interviewed by talk show host Anderson Cooper in an episode during which he was confronted by Sarah Jones, the former Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader and high school teacher who, at the time, was suing Richie for defamation.

NTWH had programs for acting, singing, voice, writing, and theatre production, and thousands of theatre students and performers with disabilities participated in the company's programs in New York City as well as a campus in Belfast, Maine. History Father Rick Curry's interest in performing became a major activity during his years in university. He gained experience in theatre and television commercial work. His university graduate studies were in theatre arts, which led to a PhD in the field from New York University. Curry, born without a right hand and forearm, had his first experience with open discrimination against his disability allegedly when he tried to audition for a role in a mouthwash commercial, and the receptionist burst out laughing, assuming he had been sent in as a joke. Months later, he founded NTWH in 1977 in Lower Manhattan. The company's goals included training students in communication skills that would help them in professional theatre, and to \\"enhance their opportunities in the workplace\\". Theatre schools commonly overlooked or excluded students who have a disability; so NTWH helped address this problem, offering courses in academic subjects and also practical theatre skills. NTWH aimed to \\"create a theatrical arena in which disabled and able-bodied actors and playwrights collaborate, train, and perform together\\". Community events were also held to stage dramatic works dealing with \\"themes of disability\\". Curry brought a new focus to projects involving disabled veterans. The Writers' Program for Wounded Warriors provided a forum for veterans to write dramatic monologues about their war experiences. Curry was a member of the Roman Catholic Jesuit order for more than 50 years, first as a Jesuit Brother, and more recently, as a priest and Chaplain at Georgetown University. Curry maintained that his theatre values reflected his Jesuit training: =Maine projects= NTWH expanded its scope in 1996, launching a campus in Belfast, Maine, as a seasonal adjunct, and purchasing a local school from the city. A variety of projects were run through NTWH's Belfast campus, such as a theatre workshop, a fine arts gallery, a baking school, and a bakery in Belfast, all managed by people with disabilities. The Maine facility was also residential and fully accessible. NTWH's Belfast projects additionally included Summer theatre camps for children, both with and without disabilities. =Decline= Beginning in 2004, NTWH began having several financial problems which caused it to go into arrears on mortgage payments both with its New York studio and Belfast campus. This nearly culminated in a foreclosure auction in 2005, though NTWH was able to temporarily satisfy its debts by selling auxiliary buildings in Belfast. Later years, however, were more difficult for NTWH, and in 2010 the City of Belfast temporarily seized the Maine campus for non-payment of a sewer bill. Belfast City Manager Joe Slocum toured the building in January 2011 and found it abandoned and neglected. In January 2017, a local Belfast resident purchased the building with plans to renovate it for multi-functional use. NTWH's New York ensemble gave a final performance on August 25, 2008, in Sag Harbour, New York, before suspending its operations. NTWH's final production was titled In Honour of Service, a performance of monologues written by participants in the NTWH Writer's Program for Wounded Warriors. Some of the former members of NTWH Cabaret, a project of the larger NTWH, continue performing in New York City as of 2011, and they have reformed in a new performing organization called Encompassing Voices. Rick Curry died on December 19, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA after a long, undisclosed illness.

He began working with horses at the age of 17 and rode over 200 winners in his short career as a jockey. Yeomans became a paraplegic at the age of 21 due to a horse racing accident and took up swimming as part of his rehabilitation, winning three medals at the 1962 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Perth. In 1967, he became the first licensed paraplegic horse trainer in Australia, and worked in that profession until 1997. He died in 2004 at the age of 66. Biography Yeomans was born in the Melbourne suburb of Box Hill on 8 June 1938. His parents were Dorothy and Lennox and he was one of ten children. His mother died suddenly at the age of 39 in 1947. He left school at the age of 15 to become a carpenter. In 1955, a visit to horse trainer Alf Sands' Mordialloc stables led him to become interested in horse racing. At the age of 17, he gave up the carpentry apprenticeship to become a jockey. He had an ideal build for a jockey, weighing and being tall with strong arms, legs and shoulders. He groomed and exercised horses before he was eligible to become an apprentice jockey at the age of 18. His first race ride was in Werribee on 24 August 1956 and he rode his first race winner on 21 November of that year at Kilmore on Dunalister. During his short career, he rode over 200 winners including 74 Melbourne metropolitan winners. Notable wins by Yeomans included the 1957 Australian Cup on Dream Son, the 1958 Caulfield Cup on lightweight Sir Blink, and the 1959 Moonee Valley Cup on Sanyo. On 27 January 1960, when he was aged 21, his horse Silver Whit was involved in a three-horse fall at Pakenham. He was rushed by ambulance to St Vincent's Hospital by police escort and then transferred to the Austin Hospital. Jockey Ricky Kingston, who was slightly injured in the fall, gave Yeomans oxygen in the ambulance on the way to the hospital as there was no doctor at the racetrack. He suffered ten broken ribs, a broken collarbone, a punctured lung and a broken spine. He lost the use of both legs and was classified as a paraplegic when leaving hospital 9 months after the fall. He was then confined to a wheelchair or moving with crutches. After leaving hospital, he worked as a clerk. As part of his rehabilitation, he took up swimming again through the efforts of retired football star Stan Hatwell. He had powerful arms due to his horse riding career and this helped him to swim breaststroke and freestyle efficiently and quickly. He represented Australia at the 1962 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Perth. He won two gold medals in the Men's Crawl 50 m Class C and Men's Breaststroke 50 m events and a silver medal in the Backstroke 50 m Class C event. He represented Victoria in archery, basketball and tennis in interstate paraplegic competitions. In April 1964, he married Mary Cameron, a nurse and they had three children ‚Äì Lane, Grant and Scott. Lane and Grant became jockeys and all three sons later became horse trainers. In 1967, aged 28, he became a licensed horse trainer. At the time, he was the only paraplegic horse trainer in Australia. He commenced training at Epsom Racecourse in the Melbourne suburb of Mordialloc. On 19 June 1971 at the Sandown Racecourse, he trained Pagolio to win his first Melbourne metropolitan race. He left Melbourne to train in Townsville and then moved to the Gold Coast in 1972. He trained there until ill health in 1997 forced him to retire from active training. The best horse he trained was Zephr Cross who won the 1986 Ascot Vale Stakes beating Bounding Away, the Golden Slipper winner. He was regarded as the \\"Douglas Bader\\" of the horse racing game. He died at the age of 66 on 16 June 2004 on the Gold Coast.

It owed its existence to the intense rivalry between the two stations' owners. It opened, along with the Ingleton Branch Line, in 1861, and closed in 1917, by which time the two railway companies had become more cooperative.

Thus the L&NWR; built Ingleton (L&NW;) station at the other end of Ingleton Viaduct. The Ingleton Branch, and the L&NW; station, opened on 16 September 1861. The MR reopened the original Ingleton station two weeks later but refused to let L&NW; trains use it.Western (1990), p.27 Passengers had to walk nearly a mile (1¬Ω km) between the two Ingleton stations, descending into the valley below and climbing up the other side, where they often had a long wait as the companies did not cooperate over timetabling either.Western (1990), p.29 By 1862, the MR agreed to allow L&NW; trains to terminate at the Midland station, but both Ingleton stations remained open and connections were not timetabled.Western (1990), p.37 On the positive side, the presence of two stations allowed people to pay a penny fare to cross the viaduct between the two stations simply to enjoy the view.Western (1990), p.45 On 13 March 1893, a mineral line was opened from the L&NW; station to Meal Bank Quarry. It passed over a high embankment and bridge across the entrance to the Ingleton Waterfalls Trail. The embankment survives to this day. The quarry and its line closed in 1909.Western (1990), p.46 The L&NW; station closed on 1 January 1917. The other station survived until the line's closure in 1954. The L&NW; station was demolished and the site is now used by a fuel supplier.

He also worked as an ornamental artist. Life Chandler was born on the family farm, Chandler Hill, located on the boundary between Thompson and Woodstock, Connecticut. He was the son of William Chandler, a farmer, and Jemima Bradbury Chandler of Woodstock. After his father's death in 1754, Chandler pursued a career as a portrait and ornamental painter. A source claims that the artist studied the art of portrait painting in Boston, although there is only circumstantial evidence of this claim and no documentary proof. The Battle of Bunker Hill, Boston, 1776-1777 In 1772, Chandler married Mary Gleason. He does not appear to have participated in the Revolutionary War. Members of his family did as is demonstrated by the portrait of his brother Samuel in captain's uniform. Over time he pursued a variety of visual arts, including gilding, carving and illustrating, as well as portraiture, landscape and house painting. This variety of skills points to a possible training as an artisan-painter. Despite a modest family inheritance, Chandler soon began to experience financial difficulties that would continue throughout his life.Joan M. Marter, The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Oxford University Press, 2011, pp. 437-438 In 1785 Chandler moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he remained for five years. He likely made this move to look for new patrons as he was constantly experiencing financial difficulties. Here he also worked as a house painter. During this period his son Charles as well as his wife died, and his remaining children were sent to live with relatives, possibly his sister, since he painted Mrs. Crafts, n√©e Mahitible Chandler in 1781. His sister had moved with her husband Ebenezer Crafts to Craftsbury, Vermont. Portrait of Captain Samuel Chandler Chandler returned to Chandler Hill where he died on 29 July 1790. Chandler was so destitute that his estate was left to the selectmen of Thompson to pay for his medical and funeral expenses.Chandler, Winthrop at the National Gallery of Art, accessed on 18 February 2016 Work Portrait of Levi Willard Chandler was mainly a portrait painter. \\"In contrast to the many itinerant artists of the time, Chandler did not travel in search of commissions, and most of his sitters were family members or neighbors\\" of whom he made about 50 portraits. His first known portraits date from 1770. A set of ornamental landscapes is also attributed to Chandler. These are often based on English prints and local elements such as the New England landscape and buildings. Chandler's style is characterized by a flat, linear manner of painting and a realistic representation of his sitters. He can best be regarded as a very gifted folk painter.

It is located in the Delta State of Nigeria which occupies a large space of about 375 square kilometres. This kingdom is surrounded by other Urhobo communities in the locality. The traditional seat of government in this kingdom is at Isiokolo. History Oral tradition speaks of migrations from the ancient Benin Kingdom by the Urhobos that gave rise to this area. The founders of Agbon migrated through Kwale, probably from Erhowa, settled at Ehwen and Erhivwi or Irri in present Isoko division of Delta State. From there they moved down to Utokori, close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found Otorho r' Agbon now known as Isiokolo. Isiokolo is now the recognised ancestral place of leadership by the members of this kingdom. The Current King Is His Royal Majesty Micheal G Omeru (Ogurime-rime) Ukori 1 Natural resources This kingdom produces a variety of food crops, mostly yam, plantain and cassava. Cash crops as palm produce and rubber plantations also flourish here. Agbon holds a large reservoir of crude oil which is a major source of income to Nigeria; the Erhorike oil wells are considered to be among the shallowest in the world and are found here. Population The kingdom is highly populated as it has an extensive range of towns and villages under its territorial domain. It has been ranked the second most populous cultural unit in Urhobo land, coming only after Okpe. The population of this kingdom alone amounts for more than 40% of the Delta state population. Language The people of Agbon speak Urhobo as their mother tongue with little or no dialectical forms. The Nigerian pidgin is also widespread in this kingdom as well as English, the lingua franca of Nigeria. Composition This kingdom is made up of a wide array of sub-kingdoms and villages or towns. These sub-kingdoms are the consequences of migrations from one terrain to another. =Sub-kingdoms= * Okpara (first son) * Kokori (second son) * Eku (third son) * Orhoakpor (fourth son) * Igun * Ovu (descendant of Okpara) =Towns and villages= * Isiokolo * Ekrebuo * Kokori * Erhomeghwu * Okuidjerhe * Samagidi * Egbogho * Urhwokpe * Ekraka * Erhonaka * Erhorike * Okpara Inland * Okurutuyo * Okuekpagha * Unumane * Okoradaode * Okurufor * Okururhujevwe * Umiaghwa * Okurihohi * Okwibada * Erhokori * Orhuakpor * Ekrudu * Okwukpokpo * Okureghwro * Eku * Igun * Otumara * Okpara W/S * Okorogba * Okurekpo * Okuredafe * Oviorie * Ovu Inland * Okuemeka * Okurekpagha * Okuogbamu * Ovwere * Urhodo * Okumodje * Obadjere * Ekpan * Igwevwore * Okwokpokpo * Ekusioro * Okurobi * Okuronika * Okuighele * Ekirugbo. * okuomoise Notes References * *Agbon Kingdom at Asemeyese.com Further reading  Geography of Nigeria Ethnic groups in Nigeria Indigenous peoples of West Africa ","title":"Agbon Kingdom"},{"id":"36476933","text":"Kharasf () is a village in Rob-e Shamat Rural District, Sheshtomad District, Sabzevar County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

The film marks the last contribution Wolheim made to the film industry prior to his death from cancer one month shy of his fifty-first birthday. In addition to directing, Wolheim also starred in the picture, alongside Mary Astor and Ian Keith. The screenplay was written by Hugh Herbert (who also did double duty in the cast), from a story by Keene Thompson and Agnes Brand Leahy. The film was released in April 1931, two months after Wolheim's death, and is preserved at the Library of Congress. Plot Smiley Marsden is a bank-robber on the run from the police, with his moll, Frisco Kitty. Cornered, they arrive at the San Francisco docks, where they convince the captain of a small cargo ship, Sam McVeigh, to take them aboard on his run to Mexico, mostly because he is enchanted with Kitty. Marsden is posing as a minister. As the ship sets sail, every sailor aboard lusts after Kitty, none more so than the captain. One night, when inebriated, he corners Kitty in his cabin and begins to force himself on her. She stops him by basically telling him that he is better than that, which makes him do some deep soul-searching. During the rest of the voyage, Kitty manages to fend off the rest of the crew, with the help of the disarmed captain. By the time they dock in Mexico, McVeigh has fallen in love with Kitty, who he still believes to be the wife of \\"Minister\\" Marsden. Aware that the authorities might become suspicious of him if McVeigh's ship departs immediately, Marsden delays their departure, first through the use of Kitty's flirtation with McVeigh, and later through outright sabotage. When Kitty finally protests, he beats her. After the crew accuses McVeigh of the sabotage and tell him they plan to rape Kitty at the first opportunity, he goes to Marsden‚Äôs hotel room to enlist his help in protecting her. Marsden, who has been drinking, reveals his true colors and exposes the truth about Kitty. McVeigh knocks him out but is prevented from doing anything more by the appearance of a man holding a gun. This unnamed character, previously seen as an American tourist, identifies himself as a detective who has been pursuing Marsden. He takes his prisoner away. McVeigh follows but climbs back in the window to see Kitty. She tells about her childhood poverty, her abuse at the hands of men, and how she meant what she said about the sea and the sky. However, she cannot run away; she has to face the consequences. McVeigh leaves, and three shots ring out. A distraught Kitty runs into the street, where she finds the detective, gun drawn. Marsden tried to escape, and he shot him. Kitty is prepared to go with him, but he says he has nothing on her, it was Marsden he wanted. She is perfectly free. She and McVeigh end up together. Cast *Louis Wolheim - Captain Sam McVeigh *Mary Astor - Frisco Kitty *Ian Keith - Smiley Marsden *Hugh Herbert - Charlie - The Mate *Russ Powell - Inspector Colby *Alan Roscoe - Crewman Dave *Bert Starkey - Ship's Cook (Cast list as per AFI database) Reception Unfortunately (being Wolheim's final film), the picture only received lukewarm reviews at best. Photoplay said that the film proved \\"... the difficulty of both acting in and directing a picture.\\" Motion Picture Magazine described the film, \\"The first directorial effort of Louis Wolheim does not get off to a very auspicious start, but once the rat of melodrama is forced out into the open, a lively time is had by all.\\" The Motion Picture Herald, on the other hand, was more positive, stating the film had a \\"... meaningless title tacked onto a cracking good sea story\\", classing it as a \\"... very satisfactory entertainment for the smaller communities.\\" Notes The title of the film during production was Sheep's Clothing. Many of the harbor sequences were shot on Catalina Island, where LeBaron rented six speedboats to patrol the coastal waters and dampen the sound from sightseers and other onlookers. After completion of the film, Wolheim expressed his dissatisfaction with the role of directing, stating that from that point forward he only intended to act. After completion of this film, Wolheim began to actively pursue a role in Howard Hughes' film, The Front Page. As part of his campaign, he lost over thirty pounds in three weeks. After being rewarded with the role, he unfortunately died suddenly. Accounts of the time stated it was due to his drastic weight loss, although later sources indicated it was due to stomach cancer. He would be replaced by Adolphe Menjou.

The allergic salute (sometimes called the nasal salute) is the characteristic and sometimes habitual gesture of wiping and/or rubbing the nose in an upwards or transverse manner with the fingers, palm, or back of the hand. It is termed a salute because the upward movement of the hand acts as an unintentional gesture. The habit of using the hand to wipe the nose is observed more often in children but is common in adults as well. Saluting most commonly temporarily relieves nasal itching as well as removing small amounts of nasal mucus. In people who are experiencing seizures, nose wiping has been observed as a semivoluntary action. Process The upwards wiping of the nose and nostrils allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the air passages through the nose become temporarily propped open. This is especially beneficial if the air passages are swollen and the nostrils are itchy due to irritations such as allergic rhinitis. The mucus that is wiped onto the hand will most likely carry bacteria and other germs which could then in turn be passed along to other people. Habitual as well as fast or rough saluting may also result in a crease (known as a transverse nasal crease or groove) running across the nose, and can lead to permanent physical deformity observable in childhood and adulthood.

This doctrine is not a part of the nuclear doctrine, which is designed for the use of the atomic weapons in a full-scale declared war if the conditions of the doctrine are surpassed. Instead, the policy of the Minimum Credible Deterrence falls under minimal deterrence as an inverse to the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which is widely regarded as designed to dissuade India from taking any military actions against Pakistan, as it did in 1971, when Pakistan started the war. (see: Indo-Pakistani war of 1971) Pakistan refuses to adopt \\"No first use\\" policy, while the other regional powers India and China adopted \\"No first use\\" policy. Pakistan's foreign minister Shamshad Ahmad had warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use \\"any weapon in its arsenal\\" to defend itself. Developmental history The comprehensive nuclear weapons policy was addressed by populist prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a vision for the country to \\"walk tall\\" in global politics.See: Nuclear policy, doctrine and planning, Rationales for nuclear weapons at the International Institute for Strategic Studies published page. Maintaining equality on every level of scientific development with India was a primary motivation for his government. Domestically, the popular support helped Bhutto to consolidate the political and economical aspects of atomic bomb projects and the control of the Pakistan military in civilian hands. This led the creation of formation of defence mechanism systematic programmes, known as National Command Authority (NCA), Joint Special Forces (JSF) under the control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee which is led by its designated Chairman. Externally, the nuclear status was a way to boost Pakistan's prestige, importance and influence on among the friendly and Muslim nations, including rich Gulf monarchies. On 20 May 1999, in his address at the National Defence University (NDU), Prime minister Nawaz Sharif used the term \\"minimum credible deterrence\\" while speaking about Pakistan's nuclear stance. There, the Prime minister (even the government at present now), made cleared Pakistan's nuclear declaratory statements that India is regarded as its sole nuclear adversary and thus the focus of its nuclear deterrent. The MCD theory is based on the principles of the deterrence theory and offers the idea of the achieving the second strike capability. The MCD theory is effectively, an ideal form of Nash equilibrium (named after mathematician John Forbes Nash), in which both India and Pakistan, once armed, has no rational incentive to either initiate a conflict, or to disarm. Promulgation and enforcement The policy framework was announced by Prime minister of Pakistan (at that time) Nawaz Sharif after ordering to perform country's first atomic tests (see the operations: Chagai-I and Chagai-II) in 1998 as part of tit-for-tat policy. In end of 1998, the doctrine and organisation began to be redesigned, and a proceeded to a full- scope scientific, economical and defence review, involving key country's institutions, to develop and test ideas and concepts. The studies and policy were studied at the National Defence University (NDU), National University of Sciences and Technology, Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS) and various others. Since the public atomic tests in 1998, Pakistan Government has adopted considerable recommendations and suggestions to think through its nuclear doctrine, and to integrate the nuclear power dimension into its defence strategy. The definition of potential thresholds has been refined, at least in public statements by Pakistani officials. According to one reliable source, the country adopted a three-point nuclear policy in early 2001 as part of the minimum credible deterrence. The most authoritative of these statements are provided by the officials of the Atomic Command Authority, in the form of four thresholds which were first mentioned by Khalid Kidwai in late 2001. Policy statements The theory of \\"Minimum Credible Deterrence (MCD)\\" has been frequently being interpreted by the various government-in-time of effect of Pakistan. Although the MCD theory was officially adopted in 1998 as part of Pakistan's defence theory, on the other hand, the theory has had been interpreted by the government since in 1972. On military perspective, for instance, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), has retrospectively contended that \\"MCD is not view to enter into a \\"nuclear race\\", but to follow a policy of \\"peaceful co-existence\\" in the region, it cannot remain oblivious to the developments in South Asia.\\" The Pakistan Government officials have repeatedly emphasized that the MCD is a defence theory, a doctrine that is based on maintaining a balance to safeguard its sovereignty and ensure peace in the region. In 1974, Bhutto launched a more aggressive and serious diplomatic offensive on the United States and the Western world over the nuclear issues. Writing to the world and Western leaders, Bhutto made it clear and maintained: Rationale and Persuasion The senior officials, economists, game theorists, and strategists affiliated with Pakistan's government has persuaded multiple times for maintaining the Minimum Credible Deterrence. The government officials points out that \\"Indo-US nuclear deal as well as cooperation in conventional field is likely to grow in India's favour, thus accelerating arms race in the region\\". Therefore, maintaining \\"minimum credible nuclear deterrence\\" would require Pakistan to review its nuclear policy. The government officials maintained that while Pakistan will continue to act with responsibility avoiding an arms race, it will not remain oblivious to the imperative of maintaining \\"minimum credible nuclear deterrence\\". The unnamed official at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) stated that \\"the nuclear weapons programme has been exclusively driven by security considerations to ensure the survival and very existence of the state\\". In 2012, Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani stated the comprehensive policy and quoted: In 2010, a high ranking science minister of government of Pakistan publicly announced at the international conference on science after delegating foreign ambassadors and scientists from all over the world: \\"Our nuclear capability is purely for defensive purposes, first believing in peaceful co- existence and reconciliation and will always strive for peace and prosperity in our region\\".

In his studio Stamm developed and researched focused series of paintings, works on papers and studies titled; Woosters, Dodgers, Zephyr, Concorde, Chance, Cancel, among others. Stamm's practice extended beyond his studio, to areas including mail art, artists books, photography, site-specific installations and pre-graffiti street works documentation that Stamm titled Designators. Many of Stamm's inspirations derive from observing everyday objects, experiences and events, such as finding an abstract shape on the street or lines on a baseball field. Stamm's works are fully abstract, and it is unnecessary for the viewer to know the origins of what he or she is looking at in order to experience them the way the artist intended. Black is a consistent component of Stamm's work, as it was a color associated with rebellion, rigor and reduction. Stamm created a rich oeuvre in his short lifetime which became influential for artists coming of age in New York over the past thirty years. Early life and career Ted Stamm was born in Brooklyn in 1944. At age eleven, his family moved to Freeport, Long Island, where he spent the remainder of his youth. He enrolled in Hofstra University in the mid-1960s, where he began by studying graphic design. He quickly moved into painting studying with artists Perle Fine and John Hopkins. He also studied printmaking with artist Richard Pugliese, who later introduced him to the Soho art world. Stamm moved to Soho permanently upon graduating from Hofstra University in 1968. Stamm lived and had a studio on the top floor of 101 Wooster Street in New York from 1972 until his death in 1984. Work Between 1968 ‚Äì 1972, Ted Stamm produced lyrical abstract paintings consisting of poured red, blue and pink paint on canvas. In the summer of 1972, he began to cover up these earlier works with grid-like patterns of black marks; referring to these as ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù paintings.Press Release from Lisson Gallery, 2017 http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/ted-stamm Inspired by the late work of Ad Reinhardt, Stamm consistently used the color black in his paintings from this moment forward; associating black with rebellion, rigor and reduction. One of the most consistent characteristics of Ted Stamm's mature work is his use of black. Experimenting constantly mixing pigments to achieve the ultimate Stamm black color. In 1973, Stamm started a new, conceptually based group of work titled ‚ÄúChance‚Äù paintings. He developed a participatory system where the spinning of a roulette wheel determined the format and layers of paint for each work. Often, friends would spin a roulette wheel, the resulting painting is named for them. In 1974, Ted Stamm started working with shaped stretchers, introduced the element of line into his paintings and created a new iconic group of work that he continued to develop throughout his life.Abstraction with a Relaxed Air by David L. Shirey, New York Times, March 1981, http://tedstamm.com/press/Ted_Stamm_Press_1981_NYTimes.pdf The work consists of a rectangle with a shorter triangle attached to the left. They were titled ‚ÄúWoosters‚Äù because the shape derived from a form that Stamm had seen on Wooster Street. In 1975, Ted Stamm, simultaneously with the ‚ÄúWoosters‚Äù, began the ‚ÄúDodgers‚Äù group of work titled after the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team. The curved forms and right angles used in the work derives from the shape of a baseball field diamond. Stamm became increasingly engaged with the concept of speed and morphed the ‚ÄúDodgers‚Äù form into a new group titled ‚ÄúC-Dodgers‚Äù. The ‚ÄúC‚Äù in the title refers to the supersonic aircraft The Concorde, Stamm would often travel to see it arrive and depart at John F. Kennedy International Airport, JFK in New York. In 1979, Ted Stamm began the ‚ÄúZephyrs‚Äù group inspired by the futuristic, stainless steel aerodynamic Zephyr train that set a speed record for travel between Denver and Chicago in 1934. Stamm's later paintings ‚ÄúZCTs‚Äù and ‚ÄúCDDs‚Äù from early 1980s hybridized various elements from his earlier ‚ÄúWooster‚Äù and ‚ÄúDodger‚Äù works. During his life, Ted Stamm was also engaged in creating highly experimental conceptual and collaborative projects. In the early 1970s SoHo was still filled with active warehouses and manufacturing near Ted Stamm's studio. He found a large group of tags on the street these were used as the foundation for a series of ‚ÄúTag‚Äù drawings created in 1972 and 1973. The tags were attached to the paper and similarly to the ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù paintings, partly covered with graphite. Later, Stamm included tags as an element in collaborative projects and experimental works on paper combined with paint, spray paint, marker and stamps. The ‚ÄúTag‚Äù collaborations included the participation of visitors to his studio who were asked to make a mark of their choosing onto a found garment tag that was glued down onto a page in a sketchbook. Stamm would respond to this mark in a second sketchbook of the same design. Both pages were then stamped with the date and other collateral information to create a record of their exchange. Starting in the mid-1970s, Ted Stamm also made proto-graffiti street tagging interventions, which he termed ‚ÄúDesignators‚Äù. Using a small stencil of his ‚ÄúDodger‚Äù shape, Stamm painted the shape in black on buildings and other locations in New York City that had personal significance. On subsequent visits, Stamm would alter and add marks to the original tags. All along recording each visit by photographing and dating the development of the tag interventions. In one of his few written statements about his work, Stamm asserts ‚Äúmy work deals with an idealism which announces and supports the advancement of the Art & Language, specifically painting‚Äù. More than 30 years after his death, it is clear that Stamm's persona and character, his optimism about painting's enduring possibilities and future advancement and his expanded practice both in and out of the studio were of great significance to his artist contemporaries. His work also anticipated the conceptual strategies and material inquiries of subsequent generations of artists who came of age in NYC during the past three decades. Exhibitions Throughout his life, Ted Stamm continued showing his work nationally and internationally. Stamm had his first one-man show at Artists Space, New York in 1975 at the age of 31. Later that year he had his first show in Europe at Galerie December in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. In 1977, Stamm was included by curator Manfred Schneckenburger in Documenta 6 in Kassel, Germany and by curator Ren√© Block in the exhibition SoHo and Downtown Manhattan held at the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin. In the same year Stamm was included in the seminal Painting Show at MoMA PS1 in New York. In 1981 Stamm had a solo exhibition at the Clocktower Gallery presenting work from 1972 to 1980 organized by Per Haubro Jensen.Painting Speed by Tiffany Bell, Art in America, November 1986 http://tedstamm.com/press/Ted_Stamm_Press_1986_AIA.pdf The Clocktower Gallery in Tribeca was part of MoMA P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center under the umbrella of Institute for Art and Urban Resources. In 1986 the Hillwood Gallery at C.W. Post College mounted a retrospective exhibition of Stamm's work. The work has been included in numerous group shows at museums such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York, NY), Brooklyn Museum (Brooklyn, NY), Denver Art Museum (Denver, CO), Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (Humleb√¶k, Denmark), Museum of Contemporary Art, MoCA (Los Angeles, CA), Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo, NY), Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (Ridgefield, CT), Rose Art Museum (Waltham, MA), Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati, OH), Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderdale, FL), Oklahoma City Museum of Art (Oklahoma City, OK), Santa Barbara Museum of Art (Santa Barbara, CA), Grand Rapids Art Museum (Grand Rapids, MI), Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts (Montgomery, AL), Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, MO) and Academy of Arts, Berlin (Berlin, Germany). Collections Ted Stamm's work is included in numerous public collections: Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (Ridgefield, CT), Brooklyn Museum(Brooklyn, NY), Carnegie Museum of Art (Pittsburgh, PA), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris, France), The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York, NY), Hall Art Collection (Derneburg, Germany; Reading, Vermont), Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art MoCA (Los Angeles, CA), Museum of Modern Art MoMA (New York, NY), Phoenix Art Museum (Phoenix, AZ) and Art Gallery of Western Australia (Perth, Australia).

While the company has since gone out of business, the factory built by the company in 1907 continues to bear the company's name and is a landmark in Manistee's historic downtown area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History The Manistee Iron Works was founded in the 1870s as a foundry and machine shop. In the late 1880s, the facility began manufacturing heavy machinery, including pumps and evaporation pans, for the area's burgeoning salt industry. A prior structure was destroyed by fire in July 1901. At the time of the fire, The Ludington Chronicle reported that the iron works was \\"one of Manistee's best industries and was doing a very large business.\\" In 1904, the Manistee Iron Works was contracted to manufacture \\"a complete salt-making plant\\" for an English company. The order, running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, was reported at the time to be \\"perhaps the largest order placed by a single English concern for goods of American manufacture.\\" In 1907, the plant that remains today was built at the northeast corner of Jones and River Streets. The rectangular -story brick foundry building remains a Manistee landmark. It is 120 feet wide and 270 feet long with a gabled roof. During the 1930s, workers at the facility participated in the Manistee Iron Works Band, which performed in area parades and events. In June 1947, a fire substantially damaged the main foundry structure. A second fire in January 1948 destroyed the parts foundry at the site. The plant ceased operations in 1981. The State of Michigan designated the property as a brownfield redevelopment project in April 2003. The designation was intended to assist in providing funding to clean up heavy metal and other contamination at the site and to promote redevelopment efforts. The property was also included in Manistee's tax-free Renaissance Zone. In 2010, the machine shop at the Manistee Iron Works was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the late 2000s, the facility was occupied by 10 West Studios, a motion picture production company. In 2009, 10 West produced the film \\"What If...?\\" at various Manistee locations, including the iron works. Description The Manistee Iron Works Machine Shop is a rectangular building measuring 260 feet by 120 feet. It has a gable roof with a tall, broad, gabled rooftop monitor at the peak, so that the entire structure is seventy feet high. The building has a steel frame divided into three sections, with a broad central section flanked by two lower, narrower sections on either side. The front and rear facades are constructed of dark red brick, and the south corner originally housed a two-story office area, with an entry on the southeast side.

For the last twelve years Upton has lost the annual football match against rival Parsons College. The trustees of Upton insist that Sheffield must resign if Upton fails to win the upcoming football match. Sheffield's daughter Nan (Joan Bennett) overhears the threat of the trustees and tells her friend Yates (Joe E. Brown), a star football player. Together they come up with a scheme to get some of the best football players around to sign up to play for Upton. Nan completely changes her appearance to vamp the various men into thinking she will be interested in them if they attend Upton in the following season and play for the football team. One by one they all fall for the scheme and sign up for Upton. Sheffield, however, refuses to admit Tommy Nelson (James Hall) into the college because of his poor performance in academics. Because of the coach's insistence on needing him to win the game, Nan helps Tommy sign up under a fictitious name and credentials.

(Yang 2005:12-13) This is also true in many of the accounts related to Panhu. Religion Many of the myths regarding agriculture in China are related to popular religion and ritual.

He was appointed consul in AD 369, alongside Valentinianus Galates. Early career and Julian's Persian campaign Born into a Sarmatian family,Martindale & Jones, pg. 957 Victor served at the court of the emperor Constantius II as a palace official.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XXV, 5:2 Under Julian the Apostate, Victor was appointed Comes rei militaris, a position he held from AD 362 ‚Äì 363. In anticipation of the campaign against the Sassanid Empire, Julian had Victor march the Roman army from Constantinople to Antioch. When Julian arrived to take command of the expedition, Victor was placed in charge of the rearguard. On the road to Ctesiphon, he scouted ahead to ensure there were no traps laid by the Persians, and at the Battle of Ctesiphon, he led the vanguard across the river, scattering a force of Persians led by the son of king Shapur II. Victor and his fellow generals then tried to convince Julian not to cross the canal, but Julian ordered him to cross and to engage the enemy, whereupon Victor was forced to pull back after meeting stiff resistance. A second engagement forced the Persians back to the walls of Ctesiphon, during which Victor was wounded in the shoulder. He prevented his soldiers from entering the city in pursuit of the retreating Persians.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XXIV, 4:13 ‚Äì 6:13 After Julian‚Äôs death following the Battle of Samarra, Victor and a number of other court officials who had served under Constantius began looking among their number for a replacement, but were opposed by Julian‚Äôs Gallic officers. Eventually Victor and the rest agreed to the elevation of Salutius, who refused to accept the imperial nomination, and they were forced to accept the elevation of Jovian. Jovian promoted Victor to the rank of Magister equitum in AD 363, a post he held until AD 379.Martindale & Jones, pg. 958 Career under Valens With the death of Jovian, Valentinian I was elected as the new emperor, and eventually Victor was assigned to the eastern court of Valentinian‚Äôs co-emperor Valens. In AD 366/7, Valens sent him to question the Goths who had supported the rebellion of the usurper Procopius, while at the same time assess the accuracy of reports of their restlessness and their war readiness.N. J. E. Austin, N. B. Rankov, Exploratio: Military and Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople (1998), pg. 18 In AD 369, he was sent together with Flavius Arinthaeus to negotiate a peace with the Goths to end Valens‚Äô first Gothic War. That same year, Valens rewarded Victor for his services by appointing him consul posterior alongside Valens‚Äô three-year-old son, Valentinianus Galates. In AD 377, Victor was dispatched to Persia by Valens to negotiate with the Sassanids over the disputed territory of Armenia. These discussions were abruptly called off when Victor was recalled as a result of the outbreak of the new Gothic War, and the Gothic incursions into Thrace. Joining Valens, he advised the emperor to wait for reinforcements from his imperial colleague, Gratian, before proceeding to the Battle of Adrianople, but his advice was ignored.Lenski, Noel Emmanuel, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D. (2002), pg. 363 During the battle, he attempted unsuccessfully to rescue Valens, who died on the battlefield. Victor, however, did manage to withdraw his troops intact, and after the battle he crossed from Macedonia to Pannonia, to bring news of the defeat to the emperor Gratian. By AD 380/1 Victor had retired from public life and was residing at Constantinople, where he owned a property in the suburb of Psamathea, and he was still alive in AD 382/3.Martindale & Jones, pg. 959 Victor was a staunch supporter of Catholicism, and reputedly confronted the Arian emperor Valens prior to his campaign at Adrianople, declaring that the emperor was incurring God‚Äôs wrath by his persecution of Catholics.Martindale & Jones, pgs. 958-959 He probably interceded on behalf of Basil of Caesarea, whom Valens had prepared orders to banish, but in the end never issued them. Victor was also instrumental in limiting Valens‚Äô push to bring the province of Cappadocia into the Arian fold.Irfan Shah√Æd, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century (1984), pgs. 166-167 Victor was married to Chasidat, the daughter of Queen Mavia of the Tanukh.

Classically trained in piano, he began playing guitar after seeing Elvis Presley on television. In 1959, he co-founded the Kingsmen and with them recorded \\"Louie Louie\\" in 1963; Ely's famously incoherent vocals were partly the result of his braces and the rudimentary recording method. Before the record became a hit Ely was forced out of the group and began playing with his new band, the Courtmen. Ely died in Terrebonne, Oregon, on April 28, 2015 at age 71. Early life Jack Ely was born on September 11, 1943, in Portland, Oregon.Stewart 2010, p. 2 Both of his parents were music majors at the University of Oregon, and his father, Ken Ely, was a singer.Stewart 2010, p. 3Marsh 1993, p. 85 His father died when he was four years old and his mother subsequently remarried. Ely began playing piano while still a young child, and was performing recitals all over the Portland area before his seventh birthday. When he was eleven, a piano teacher provided what he termed \\"jazz improvisation lessons.\\" The teacher would show Ely a section of a classical composition, and the boy would have to make up 15 similar pieces. He would be required to share each in class and then make up one on the spot. On January 28, 1956, Ely watched Elvis Presley on television for the first time, and he decided that he wanted to play guitar.Stewart 2010, p. 5 At his first guitar lesson, he was required to play \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\", an experience that Ely found so demeaning that he quit after that lesson and began picking out his favorite guitar riffs by ear.Stewart 2010, p. 6 Ely played guitar and sang for the Young Oregonians, a travelling vaudeville show for entertainers under the age of 18. \\"We didn't get paid in money, we got paid in experience,\\" Ely recalled.Marsh 1993, p. 84 The Kingsmen Ely was enrolled at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He did not play in the school band, but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit.Marsh 1993, p. 85 The two teenagers grew up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band. They called themselves The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group.Marsh 1993, p. 86 The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermarket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist.Marsh 1993, p. 87 Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.Marsh 1993, p. 82 Wand 143: Second pressing with \\"Lead vocal by Jack Ely\\" text In 1962, while playing a gig at the Pypo Club in Seaside, Oregon, the band noticed Rockin' Robin Roberts's version of \\"Louie Louie\\" being played on the jukebox for hours on end. The entire club would get up and dance.Blecha 2009, p. 134 Ely convinced the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response.Blecha 2009, p. 135 Unknown to him, he changed the beat from 1-2-3-4, 1‚Äì2, 1-2-3-4, 1‚Äì2 to 1-2-3, 1‚Äì2, 1-2-3, 1‚Äì2 because he based it on the intro only.Marsh 1993, p. 83 Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes.Blecha 2009, p. 136 Dubbed \\"The Chase\\", the Kingsmen became the club's house band and Ken Chase became the band's manager. Ely was begging Chase to let the band record their own version of \\"Louie Louie\\", and on April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day.Blecha 2009, p. 137 The band had just played a 90-minute \\"Louie Louie\\" marathon.Marsh 1993, p. 88 Despite the band's annoyance at having so little time to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00 am. In order to sound like a live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. \\"It was more yelling than singing,\\" Ely said, \\"'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments.\\" In addition, he was wearing braces at the time of the performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was \\"Haunted Castle\\", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.Blecha 2009, p. 138 On August 16, during a band practice, Easton told Ely that he wanted to abandon the drums and become the frontman and singer.Marsh 1993, p. 100 Ely would have to become the drummer, and since The Kingsmen was registered in Easton's name only, he technically led the band. Ely was not happy with this turn of events, and he and Nordby left the band at once. At the time, the song had sold roughly 600 copies and it was thought that the Kingsmen would disband.Blecha 2009, p. 144 When he found out \\"Louie Louie\\" was climbing up the Billboard charts, Ely attempted to rejoin the group, but was blocked by Easton who was intent on adding replacements.Blecha 2009, p. 147 Undeterred, Ely went on to form his own \\"Kingsmen\\" group and also recorded \\"Love That Louie\\" in 1964 for RCA Records as Jack E. Lee and the Squires. A legal battle ensued, resulting in Ely ceasing to call his group the Kingsmen and Wand Records being required to credit Ely as lead vocalist on all future \\"Louie Louie\\" pressings.Blecha 2009, p. 156 Ely received $6000 in royalties, and Easton had to stop lip-synching the song in live performances.Marsh 1993, p. 112 Later life and career After a brief stint with Don and the Goodtimes, Ely began touring with his renamed group, the Courtmen.Group renamed following Kingsmen lawsuit settlement. Courtmen name suggested by Bobby Darin. Various \\"Ely Kingsmen\\" and Courtmen line-ups included Jack Ely, Charlie Coe, Mike Holiday, Rick Holley, Gordon Hirsch, Bob Jetter, Steve West, Ray Salaz, Daryl \\"Robin\\" Partlow, Curt Gonion, Wally Todd, Billy Truitt, Mike \\"Monk\\" McGrath, Tim Bosworth, William \\"Willie Dee\\" Daffern, and Clif Evens. In 1966, they released \\"Louie Louie '66\\" and \\"Ride Ride Baby\\" with Bang Records; neither charted. With the Vietnam War on the horizon, Ely was conscripted into the army, and found his career had waned upon his return to the United States in 1968.Marsh 1993, p. 113 Ely spiraled down into drug and alcohol addiction, but then spoke out against it with the Rockers Against Drugs. Ely lived at his farm in Terrebonne, Oregon, where he trained horses. He was a strong supporter of the Performance Rights Act, which would give royalties to recording artists and record labels. Since Ely was not the original author, he never received any money from the radio play of \\"Louie Louie.\\" In an interview, he said, \\"It's not just about me. There are a lot of one-hit wonders out there just like me who deserve compensation when their recorded performances are played and stations get ad revenue from it.\\" In 2012, Ely released a Christian rock album, Love Is All Around You Now. Death Ely died at his Oregon residence on April 28, 2015 at the age of 71, having long suffered from an unknown illness. \\"Because of his religious beliefs, we're not even sure what it [the illness] was,\\" his son Sean Ely said. He was a Christian Scientist and Sean Ely believed his father suffered from skin cancer. At the time of his death he was survived by his wife of 16 years, Wendy Maxson Ely, three children, Sean, Sierra and Rob, and two daughters by marriage, Crystal and Sheri. He was also survived by two sisters, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

It appears on the baptistry of the Siena Cathedral in Italy. It is one of Donatello's earliest relief sculptures, and his first bronze relief.Paoletti, The Siena Baptistry Font, 44. The sculpture is noted for Donatello's use of perspective.Munman, \\"Optical Corrections,\\" 36. The piece is 60 by 60 centimeters. The sculpture depicts the beheading of John the Baptist after Salome asks Herod Antipas for his head on a platter. The scene depicts an executioner presenting the severed head, and Herod reacting in shock. Commission In 1416, Lorenzo Ghiberti was invited by the officials of the Opera del Duomo of Siena to work as an advisor and designer for the commission of a new baptismal font. According to the original plans, the six relief sculptures, which were to adorn the sides of the hexagonal font, were to be completed by Ghiberti and two local Sienese artists. Donatello's commission for the Feast of Herod relief was added to replace one of the reliefs of Jacopo della Quercia, one of the Sienese artists involved in the project, who was not completing his work at the speed the Opera del Duomo desired.Poeschke, Donatello and His World, 387. The transfer of this commission, and the commencement of Donatello's work on the project, took place in 1423, when an initial advance payment for the relief was made to Donatello.Paoletti, The Siena Baptistry Font, 39. The final payment to Donatello was made in 1427 when the finished relief was collected from Donatello's workshop in Florence and transported to Siena. The original commission specified that the scene to be depicted was the moment \\"just as the head of St. John was brought to the table of the king\\", which Donatello expanded into the scene now known as the Feast of Herod.Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, 65. Description The scene depicted in Donatello's Feast of Herod combines a few different elements commonly included in the Baptist cycle (the important events in the life of St. John the Baptist). In earlier depictions, such as Andrea Pisano's reliefs on the South Doors of the Florence Baptistery (1330‚Äì1336), Salome's dance, the beheading of St. John, and the presentation of the head to King Herod, were separated into different scenes. Donatello brings these elements together, using continuous narrative (a type of narrative art that illustrates multiple scenes of a narrative within a single frame) to illustrate the scene and portray John‚Äôs martyrdom without explicitly showing the beheadingPope-Hennessy, Essays on Italian Sculpture, 33. Another way that Donatello's work differs from previous representations of the scene is the emotional expressiveness of the figures, as Herod and his companions react to the severed head as it is presented.Poeschke, Donatello and His World, 388. The addition of architectural elements allowed for the incorporation of linear perspective to the scene, which in turn brings attention to the important focal points and figures. Donatello was inspired by his contemporary Filippo Brunelleschi's exploration into a linear perspective system involving orthogonals (diagonal lines that meet at a central vanishing point) and transversals (the lines crossing these orthogonals) which work together to draw the eye to the vanishing point and create an illusion of space on a two-dimensional surface.Munman, \\"Optical Corrections, 35. Donatello manipulated this system slightly, by having the focal point lead to a \\"V\\" of open space, encouraging the eye to move across the panel to the two separate groupings, rather than focusing on any one element.Paoletti, The Siena Baptistry Font, 50. The inclusion of linear perspective would later become a standard element in Renaissance painting and sculpture, after being described by Leon Battista Alberti in his 1435 treatise Della Pictura.Ibid., 49 Another way in which Donatello described the space in which the scene takes place, was through his use of high and low relief. One technique that Donatello implemented in his Feast of Herod is the use of rilievo schiacciato, or shallow relief, which he had earlier used in his St. George predella, for the Church of Orsanmichele in Florence. Donatello utilized schiacciato carving to create atmospheric effect and to give the impression of greater depth. In order to create this depth, Donatello relied on the contrast between the low and high relief. The inclusion of low relief, in the architecture of the layered arches and in the background figures, allows for specific elements to appear farther away, while the high relief brings attention to the more highly detailed figures in the foreground, which seem to extend out into the viewer's space.Edgerton, The Mirror, the Window, and the Telescope, 120.

In 1977 it was considered to demolish the structure but instead it was decided to renovate it. The rest of the buildings at the site was demolished in 1997 but the water tower was once again spared. A society for the preservation of the water tower was founded in 2003. They raised funds for another renovation of the building and in 2009 it opened its doors to the public as an Observation tower. It is open the first Saturday every month from April through October from 11-13. Architecture The water tower is designed in the National Romantic style with inspiration from Medieval architecture. Built in a red brick, the cylindrical tower stands 32 metres high and has a diameter of 6 metres at its base. The uppermost part has timber framing. On three sides, four windows, arranged one over the other, provides natural light for the internal staircase.

Ipbuk-dong (ÏûÖÎ∂ÅÎèô/) is divided into two different legal-status neighbourhoods, namely Ipbuk-dong (same name) and Dangsu-dong (ÎãπÏàòÎèô/), which are separated by the Hwanggujicheon‚Äîa stream which flows south from Wangsong Reservoir on their northern boundary with the city of Uiwang, through Suwon, eventually to Asan Bay. Dangsu-dong has Suwon's sole boundary with Ansan, and meets Hwaseong further south. The whole neighbourhood is 96% green belt. Looking towards Wangsong Reservoir from the Yuljeon-dong boundary History Ipbuk-dong's history can be traced to the Joseon Dynasty, at which time it was administered as part of Wolgok-myeon, Gwangju-gun (Í¥ëÏ£ºÍµ∞ ÏõîÍ≥°Î©¥). By 1895, \\"Ipbuk- ri\\" had been listed as a village, and on 1 April 1914 both Dangsu-ri and Ipbuk-ri were listed as villages in Suwon-gun. However, they by now belonged to different administrative districts, the Hwanggujicheon dividing Wolgokmyeon to the west from Banwol-myeon (Î∞òÏõîÎ©¥) to the east. On 15 August 1949, Wolgok- myeon was incorporated into Banwol-myeon, but under the jurisdiction of Hwaseong-gun (ÌôîÏÑ±Íµ∞), and on 26 December 1994 they became part of Gwonseon-gu, Suwon-si, namely as Ipbuk-dong and Dangsu-ri. In 2012, the part of Wangsong Reservoir in Ipbuk-dong was transferred to Uiwang City as part of a land swap. Geography Ipbuk-dong lies to the south of Wangsong Reservoir, and is divided into Ipbuk-dong (same name) and Dangsu-dong by the Hwanggujicheon, which is crossed by eight bridges within the dong's limits (four of which, including Dangsu Bridge, form part of Seosuwon Interchange) and a further bridge immediately to the north at the western end of Wangsong Dam. The highest point in the neighbourhood is over 160m above sea level, at the northern end of Chilbosan, where Dangsu-dong meets the city of Ansan to the west. Ipbuk-dong is on the flight path from Suwon Air Base. Administration Ipbuk-dong is administered from the Community Centre at 17 Ipbuk-ro. The head of the dong office (2019) is Lee Wonbok (Hangeul: Ïù¥ÏõêÎ≥µ). Demographics There are 17435 residents in Ipbuk-dong (2019), 99 (0.6%) of whom hold foreign nationality. A small majority of the Korean population (8746) are male (8590 female). There are 6119 households, with on average 2.9 people. There was a 25% population increase between 2011 and 2014, largely due to the opening of Prugio Apartments. Education Ipbuk-dong has three public schools: =Ipbuk Elementary School= Established in 2004 in Ipbuk-dong proper, Ipbuk Elementary School caters to 616 children, with a further 64 in the kindergarten. The head of the school is Kim Gwangsu (ÍπÄÍ¥ëÏàò), and there are 57 members of staff in total. Address: 10 Yuljeon-ro, Gwonseon-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do =Dangsu Elementary School (Dangsu-dong)= Situated in Dangsu-dong, Dangsu Elementary School opened on 1 March 1969, and is therefore the oldest school in Ipbuk-dong. It is also the largest, catering to 1083 children, 27 more of whom are in the kindergarten class. The current head of the school is Lee Yonggil, and there are 66 members of staff. Address: 6 Dangjin-ro, Gwonseon-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do =Gyeonggi Daemyeong High School= Established in 2002 to the north of Road 42 in Dangsu-dong, Gyeonggi Daemyeong High School is an alternative school.

Address: 3-24 Suin-ro 598-beon-gil, Gwonseon-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do Housing Though there are many individual houses and smaller units, there are also several large apartment complexes. Ipbuk-dong itself has two major complexes, while Dangsu-dong has a number of older developments. In Ipbuk- dong, Seosuwon Xii Apartments, a 41,978.30m¬≤ development with 17 15-storey buildings comprising 921 units, was completed on Feb 26, 2009, while Lakeside Prugio, a 13 30-storey building development of 1366 units at the south-east corner of Wangsong Reservoir, opened in 2014. Other residents are housed in older accommodation, primarily Ungbi Apartments. Prugio under construction Dangsu-dong houses several older complexes, namely Samjeong Green View (Opened Feb. 1997), Injeong Prince (Nov. 1998), Halla Vivaldi (Jan. 2005; two complexes), and Seosuwon Ssangyong Sweet Dot Home (Sep. 2005). A new housing development between this built-up area and Homaesil to the south is expected to be completed in 2021. Samjeong Green View seen from Wangsong Dam Transportation Seosuwon I.C., a major interchange, is in the heart of Ipbuk-dong. Road 42, from Ansan to Suwon, meets the Gwacheon-Bongdam highway here. The Suwon-Munsan Expressway (17) opened in 2016, with the Geumgok and East Ansan-Dangsu interchanges both partially in Dangsu-dong. Regarding public transport, Ipbuk-dong is close to Sungkyunkwan University Station on the Seoul Subway network, while the Shinbundang Line is planned to pass to the south of the neighbourhood in 2019. In line with government policy to increase the number of roundabouts, one was constructed from August to November 2013 to replace the traffic signals by Ipbuk Primary School, while another was constructed on the Ipbuk-ro/Ipbuk- ro-77beongil junction in 2019.

Established by the brothers Tan Khoen Yauw and Tan Khoen Hian on September 1, 1929, its films were mostly targeted at native ethnic groups. Starting with Njai Dasima in 1929, the company released fifteen movies before ultimately being dissolved after the Japanese occupation. The Tans and the Wong brothers established Tan & Wong Bros in 1948 to continue this work. History =First iteration= Poster for Njai Dasima, Tan's first production Tan's Film Company was established by Tan Khoen Yauw and his brother Tan Khoen Hian on September 1, 1929. It was one of three studios established in the Dutch East Indies that year, together with Nansing Film Corporation and another Chinese-owned studio. Tan's established a large studio building on Defensielijn v.d. Bosch (now Bungur Besar Raya Street). It had several divisions, including costuming, filming, and decor. The Tans, who had been raised in Kwitang, Batavia (modern day Jakarta) and grown up in close interaction with native ethnic groups, targeted the studio at lower-class viewers, mostly native. This was accomplished through adapting Malay tonil (stage plays) which had been proven successful. Tan's was not the first studio with this target audience, as G. Kruger's Krugers Filmbedrijf had previously released Eulis Atjih (1927) with native audiences in mind. Tan's Film released its first film, the silent Njai Dasima, in November 1929. The work was an adaptation of the 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima (Story of Njai Dasima), written by G. Francis, which had previously been made into a tonil. It was a commercial success to the point that the Indonesian film historian, Misbach Yusa Biran, writes that a cinema could make up several days losses with a single showing of the film. Njai Dasima was followed by two further adaptations of tonils, the action film Si Ronda and the romance Melati van Agam (Jasmine of Agam), as well as the second part to the story, also entitled Njai Dasima, and sequel Nancy Bikin Pembalesan, in 1930. The two Njai Dasima continuations and Melati van Java were commercial successes. Owing to rising production costs, Tan's closed shop after the production of a talkie version of Njai Dasima in 1932. This version had Kruger as its cameraman and Bachtiar Effendi as director; another of Kruger's films, Huwen op Bevel (Forced to Marry; 1932) had been released by Tan's after Kruger ran out of funds. =Second iteration= Magazine advertisement for Poesaka Terpendam, Tan's penultimate film In 1938 Tan Khoen Hian joined with the American-born Chinese directors Othniel and Joshua Wong to establish a reincarnation of Tan's Film, entitled Tan's Film Coy. Tan served primarily as a financial backer, while the Wong brothers handled day-to-day matters. The new Tan's Film's first production, Fatima (1938), followed closely behind the highly successful Terang Boelan, released by the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat, or ANIF) in 1937, and used many of the same aspects; this included the same screenwriter, the same stars, and the same musicians. Roekiah, the female lead of Terang Boelan, was given a 150 gulden monthly fee, with another 50 gulden for her husband; this was twice as much as ANIF had paid her. Fatima was very successful, earning 200,000 gulden on a 7,000 gulden investment. In 1939 Tan's Film released Gagak Item (Black Raven); the story, still based in part on that of Terang Boelan, featured a Zorro-like character called the Black Raven. The following April they released Siti Akbari, also influenced by Terang Boelan. Both later films were successes, although not as much as Fatima. By 1940 Tan's Film was one of six film studios in the Indies; the establishment of new studios, inspired in part by the success of Fatima, continued into 1941. Under this pressure, especially that from Java Industrial Film Coy., the performance of Tan's Film's releases began to suffer. Joshua Wong began working with Oriental Film, and Rd. Mochtar ‚Äì the leading male actor for Tan's Film since Fatima ‚Äì left over a wage dispute. The screenwriter Saeroen also left the company in 1940. Production slowed drastically, to two releases a year. After the commercial successes Roekihati and Sorga Ka Toedjoe (Seventh Heven) were released in 1940, Tan's released Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse), which used a massive and expensive palace set. The following year Tan's released Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure) and produced Aladin dengan Lampu Wasiat (Aladdin and the Magic Lamp), the latter of which reused the palace set. However, the Japanese occupation of the Indies beginning in early 1942 led to Tan's Film being shut down; Aladin dengan Lampu Wasiat would only be released in 1950, after the occupation and national revolution. In 1948 the Tan and Wong brothers would join together to establish Tan & Wong Bros.

ViaSat-1 and EchoStar XVII (also known as Jupiter-1) do provide more than 100 Gbit/s of capacity, which is more than 100 times the capacity offered by a conventional FSS satellite. When it was launched in October 2011 ViaSat-1 had more capacity (140 Gbit/s) than all other commercial communications satellites over North America combined. Overview The significant increase in capacity is achieved by a high level frequency re-use and spot beam technology which enables frequency re-use across multiple narrowly focused spot beams (usually in the order of hundreds of kilometers), as in cellular networks, which both are defining technical features of high-throughput satellites. By contrast traditional satellite technology utilizes a broad single beam (usually in the order of thousands of kilometers) to cover wide regions or even entire continents. In addition to a large amount of bandwidth capacity HTS are defined by the fact that they often, but not solely, target the consumer market. In the last 10 years, the majority of high-throughput satellites operated in the Ka band, however this is not a defining criterion, and at the beginning of 2017 there was at least 10 Ku band HTS satellites projects, of which 3 were already launched and 7 were in construction. Despite the higher costs associated with spot beam technology, the overall cost per circuit is considerably lower as compared to shaped beam technology. While Ku band FSS bandwidth can cost well over $100 million per gigabit per second in space, HTS like ViaSat-1 can supply a gigabit of throughput in space for less than $3 million. While a reduced cost per bit is often cited as a substantial advantage of high-throughput satellites, the lowest cost per bit is not always the main driver behind the design of an HTS system, depending on the industry it will be serving.http://www.nsr.com/news-resources/the-bottom-line/hts- paradigm-shift/ HTS are primarily deployed to provide broadband Internet access service (point-to-point) to regions unserved or underserved by terrestrial technologies where they can deliver services comparable to terrestrial services in terms of pricing and bandwidth. While many current HTS platforms were designed to serve the consumer broadband market, some are also offering services to government and enterprise markets, as well as to terrestrial cellular network operators who face growing demand for broadband backhaul to rural cell sites. For cellular backhaul, the reduced cost per bit of many HTS platforms creates a significantly more favorable economic model for wireless operators to use satellite for cellular voice and data backhaul. Some HTS platforms are designed primarily for the enterprise, telecom or maritime sectors. HTS can furthermore support point-to-multipoint applications and even broadcast services such as DTH distribution to relatively small geographic areas served by a single spot beam. A fundamental difference between HTS satellites is the fact that certain HTS are linked to ground infrastructure through a feeder link using a regional spot beam dictating the location of possible teleports while other HTS satellites allow the use of any spot beam for the location of the teleports. In the latter case, the teleports can be set up in a wider area as their spotbeams' footprints cover entire continents and regions like it is the case for traditional satellites . Industry analysts at Northern Sky Research believe that high-throughput satellites will supply at least 1.34 TB/s of capacity by 2020 and thus will be a driving power for the global satellite backhaul market which is expected to triple in value ‚Äì jumping from the 2012 annual revenue of about US$800 million to $2.3 billion by 2021.

In the Tall Grass is a horror novella by American writers Stephen King and his son Joe Hill. It was originally published in two parts in the June/July and August 2012 issues of Esquire magazine. This is King and Hill's second collaboration since Throttle, published in 2009. On October 9, 2012, In the Tall Grass was released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang. Plot summary Cal and Becky Demuth are inseparable siblings (being called Irish twins by their parents, although they are 19 months apart). Becky finds out during her sophomore year of college that she is pregnant, leading the twins' parents to suggest she go live with her aunt and uncle until the baby is born. Since it is spring break, Cal decides to accompany her on her cross- country trip. They stop at numerous tourist locations along the way, including the biggest ball of twine. After driving for about three days, they stop at a field of tall grass after they hear a little boy named Tobin calling for help. The twins stand outside the field, listening to Tobin screaming for help, and his mother Natalie yelling at him to stop yelling, saying that \\"he will hear you\\". Cal thinks he hears Tobin just a few feet inside the field. Cal walks into it to rescue the boy, Natalie's cries having mysteriously gone silent. At first, Tobin's voice sounds so close, Cal dives for him, only to end up lying in a puddle of gritty water. Tobin's voice now sounds about twenty feet away. Becky, scared of being left alone, calls 911 as she follows Cal into the field, but the signal is cut off when she is just a few feet in. Cal and Becky get the idea to jump within the field to determine each other's position, the first attempt reveals they are only a few feet from one another, but upon a second attempt Becky sees Cal is now a significant distance from her. Cal stumbles across a golden retriever's dead body, having died of dehydration. Becky and Cal become increasingly agitated when they realize the field is somehow shifting their location from one another, one minute sounding close and the next leagues away. Becky recites limericks to comfort herself as well as give Cal and Tobin an anchor point to her location, as she is dehydrated and tired. She spies someone ahead, and a man steps out of the grass in front of her. He introduces himself as Ross, saying that he is the father of Tobin and the husband of Natalie. He begs Becky to follow him, saying that she will be safe with him. Despite her reservations, Ross convinces her to follow him anyway. He lures her to a stamped-down circle of grass, where Becky finds Natalie's bloody, dismembered body. Ross explains that he found \\"the rock\\" and that \\"the dancing men have shown him the secrets of the tall grass\\". He then attacks her, trying to kill the baby, but Becky stabs him to death with her house key. Cal, now severely dehydrated and exhausted in his attempts to look for Becky, feverishly drinks the gritty water that the long grass grows in. Now half-crazed, he attempts to burn down the field, but the grass is so wet that none of his matches burn for more than a few seconds. He then finally runs into Tobin, who is eating a dead, rotting crow. Tobin explains that the rotting dog was his, and that \\"the tall grass doesn't move dead things.\\" Tobin leads Cal into a clearing in the middle of the grass, where a large rock (with strange drawings of dancing men and words written all over it) stands in the middle of it. Tobin says that the rock will help Cal find Becky like the rock helped Tobin and Cal find each other. Cal, despite his fear of the rock and the strange, seemingly-moving drawings, gives in and touches it. Meanwhile, Becky gives birth prematurely. Cal and Tobin then appear and wrap the baby in a shirt. Becky then passes out to \\"slurping sounds.\\" When she wakes up, her baby is nowhere in sight. Cal and Tobin drag a half-conscious Becky to the rock and throw her on it. An unspecified amount of time later, an RV full of hippies pulls into a parking lot across the street to have a barbecue and smoke marijuana. They hear Tobin's calls for help, and the whole group walks into the tall grass to help.  Film adaptation  Director Vincenzo Natali wanted to do a film adaption of In The Tall Grass as early as 2015 when he announced: In May 2018, Netflix announced that it had purchased the film rights with Natali as director, who also wrote the adapted screenplay. On October 4, 2019, In the Tall Grass became available for streaming on Netflix.

Description The bridge formerly carried U.S. Route 89, but was replaced by a newer deck truss bridge in 1959. Built in 1911, it has an overall length of and a main span of . The bridge was built by the Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City for the Office of Indian Affairs and the Indian Irrigation Service. W. H. Code of the Midland Bridge Company was the designer. The suspension design was chosen to address the steep-walled canyon at the crossing, which required a single span with no temporary falsework. When built, the Cameron bridge was the longest suspension span west of the Mississippi River. Looking through the Cameron Suspension Bridge, October 2006 The bridge towers rest on the rim of the canyon, with concrete deadmen anchoring the suspension cables some way back from the towers. The deck is stiffened by a Pratt through-truss, with a wide roadway. The bridge was built to improve access to the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Indian Reservation. Named for U.S. Senator Ralph H. Cameron, it was an important link for the construction of the Navajo Bridge on US 89 across the Colorado River in 1929. The town of Cameron grew up around the crossing, which in addition to opening up the Native American lands to the north, also provided a northern gateway to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon when the Navajo Bridge opened. The bridge was damaged by an overload of sheep in 1937, when it almost collapsed. The damage was repaired and the bridge served highway traffic until 1959. It was sold to the Four Corners Pipeline Company when the new bridge opened, and carries a natural gas pipeline. It is the oldest suspension bridge in Arizona, and one of only two of that type in the state. The Cameron Suspension bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1986.

On 4 February 1999, in the best performance of his career, Evatt knocked down IBO Super Featherweight champion Junior Jones twice and won every round of the 12 rounder, and was close to stopping him before suddenly getting knocked out by Jones at 2:31 of the eleventh round. In his next bout, Evatt incurred a broken jaw in the first round of a bout for the vacant Commonwealth (British Empire) Super Featherweight title against Australian Super Featherweight champion Mick O'Malley at Ryton Sports Connexion in Coventry, England, and was unable to answer the bell for the second round.

He revolted against the British, despite opposition from the ruling Nizam (British). A street is named after him in Begum Bazar. Turrebaz Khan was a heroic figure in Deccan history, known for his valour and courage. There is a slang in Hyderabad folklore, a positive one ‚Äî ‚ÄúTurum Khan‚Äù. He was a revolutionary figure freedom fighter, who revolted against the British. He attacked the British residency, which now houses the women‚Äôs college in Koti in Hyderabad, to free his comrade who was detained on charges of treachery without a fair trial by the British. After a year in prison, he escaped, and was subsequently arrested in a forest near Toopran, in present-day Telegana. Qurban Ali Baig, the talukdar of Toopran was responsible for his arrest. Turrebaz Khan was kept in captivity, then shot, and then his body was hung in the centre of the city to prevent further rebellion.https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/The-tale-of-Turram- Khan/article14515201.ece/amp/ In the context of the Rebellion of 1857, the activities in Delhi, Meerut, Lucknow, Jhansi and Mysore, are well documented, but the activities in Hyderabad are not probably due to the fact that the Nizams were known allies of the British.

Kings Cross is a very popular destination with international backpackers visiting Australia. The fire was the fifth most deadly disaster in Australia in 1989.  Background of building  In December 1975 the Savoy Private Hotel burned down with the loss of 15 lives and 25 seriously injured after a fire set by Reginald John Little. It was next door to a building that housed the Pink Panther strip club and a brothel called the Kingsdore Motel. This building later became the Downunder Hostel. Both buildings were owned by alleged crime-boss Abe \\"the boss of the Cross\\" Saffron, who has been linked to seven other fires. As a hostel the three story building held 58 beds, with a standard of four or five individuals per room. Fire Six young tourists aged in their twenties, died in a fire that started in the lobby of the hostel. Arson was suspected. The fire quickly swept up through the stairwell, which became blocked by smoke and fire. Due to the lack of fire escapes many escaped through the windows in the rooms. All fatalities were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning or smoke inhalation in the room on the top floor. At least 60 were rescued, 16 of whom were injured. The victims were British, Canadian, New Zealand, Danish, Austrian and Swedish. Aftermath Initial reports from a police spokesperson during the investigation strongly hinted the fire was arson and not accidental, stating \\"It is possible someone dropped a cigarette or something may have been dropped in the lounge. But we can't discount some drunk has come back to the hostel and lit it up for fun.\\" Gregory Alan Brown, who had a history of mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse, confessed to setting this fire and some 500 more. He was sentenced to 18 years for manslaughter. He was convicted, despite his alleged unreliable confession and a suggestion that he was in Melbourne at the time. The court found diminished responsibility, sentencing him for manslaughter instead of murder. Alleged to have boasted to another prisoner \\"I love hearing people scream and watching them die,\\" he was released in 2009 after serving his full sentence, refusing to apply for parole. = Code Changes = The Downunder fire eventually led to new stringent safety procedures. The coroner made recommendations about the number of fire exits, sprinkler systems, labelling of fire doors, fire extinguishers and other fire- fighting equipment and staffing. The local council formed a safety department but enforcement remains sporadic as local councils are not reimbursed for legal fees in Land and Environment Court. Legislation was introduced that gave local governments and fire authorities special enforcement powers in relation to buildings posing a fire risk, with authorized inspectors becoming capable of inspecting buildings when requested or when a written complaint has been made about the building. Similar incidents Since 1981, another 52 people have died in fires in backpackers hostels and other low-end boarding facilities. Nineteen people died in 1981 in the Rembrandt Apartments, also in Kings Cross. Twelve died in a fire in Dungog, New South Wales in 1991 at the Palm Grove Hostel. In 2000 the Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel in Childers, Queensland, burned down, costing 15 lives.

Becoming academically involved in the field of linguistics, Chomsky eventually secured a job as Professor of Department of Linguistics & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the field of linguistics, he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy, the universal grammar theory, and the Chomsky‚ÄìSch√ºtzenberger theorems. Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. He was particularly known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy and contemporary capitalism, and he has been described as a prominent cultural figure.Matt Dellinger, \\"Sounds and Sites: Noam Chomsky\\", The New Yorker, Link, 3-31-03, accessed 1-26-09 Chomsky was first approached to write an op-ed column for the New York Times Syndicate on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the basis of his highly influential volume 9/11 (2001). The international attention garnered by the subsequent column, entitled 9-11: Lessons Unlearned, convinced the publishers to commission Chomsky to write roughly 1000-words a month which they would then distribute as op-ed pieces. These are widely picked up overseas, but rarely in the United States and The New York Times itself never published them to its own readers. Internationally, the op-eds have appeared in the mainstream European press including The International Herald Tribune, The Guardian, and The Independent. Regional newspapers in the US that did pick up the op-eds were The Register Guard, The Dayton Daily News, and The Knoxville Voice. The first volume of these, collecting columns from September 2002 to March 2007, was published as Interventions (2007).

Popular female Japanese professional wrestlers like Shinobu Kandori and Noriyo Tateno appear in this game. Gameplay In the \\"story\\" mode of the game, players control a young woman as she prepares for each match of women's professional wrestling. One of the federations involved in the game is the Ladies' Legend Pro-Wrestling circuit. Players essentially improve their skill parameters by training on week at a time. As they progress through their careers, players can either become \\"babyfaces\\" (good guys) or \\"heels\\" (bad guys). Text boxes allow players to read about the athlete that they are conditioning to fight. There are story elements that allow players to experience a run for the championship. Using the \\"play\\" mode of this game simply allows the wrestlers to face off against each other; with no consequences in the story. Passwords are used to convert the data of a \\"story\\" mode character into the \\"play\\" mode of the game.

He was born in Israel and obtained his Ph.D. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1990 under the supervision of Hillel Furstenberg. He was a faculty member at the Hebrew University and the University of California at Berkeley, and a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington. Peres has been accused of sexual harassment by several female scientists. Career After his Ph.D. Peres had postdoctoral positions at Stanford and Yale. In 1993 Peres joined the statistics department at UC Berkeley. He later became a professor in both the mathematics and statistics departments. He was also a professor at the Hebrew University. In 2006 Peres joined the Theory Group of Microsoft Research. By 2011 he was principal researcher at Microsoft Research and manager of the Microsoft Research Theory Group, an affiliate professor of mathematics at the University of Washington and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Recognition Peres was awarded the Rollo Davidson Prize in 1995 and the Lo√®ve Prize in 2001. The work that led to the Lo√®ve Prize was surveyed in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society: \\"A key breakthrough was the observation that certain (hard to prove) intersection properties for Brownian motion and random walks are in fact equivalent to (easier to prove) survival properties of branching processes. This led ultimately to deep work on sample path properties of Brownian motion; for instance, on the fractal dimension of the frontier of two-dimensional Brownian motion and precise study of its thick and thin points and cover times.\\" Peres was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2002. In 2011, he was a co- recipient of the David P. Robbins Prize for work on the maximum overhang problem. That year he also delivered the Paul Tur√°n Memorial Lecture. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2016, he was elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences. In July 2017, he was a plenary lecturer at the Mathematical Congress of the Americas.  Allegations of sexual harassment  Peres has been accused of sexual harassment by several female scientists, including Dana Moshkovitz, Anima Anandkumar and Lisha Li. Moshkovitz said she was harassed by Peres on an informal job interview and she reported this to the Microsoft Theory Group. She also said that Peres was promoted shortly after her report. Peres resigned from his position as an affiliate position at the University of Washington in 2012. The university said he resigned ‚Äúafter receiving notice that the university would be investigating allegations of sexual harassment.‚Äù In November 2018 three Israeli computer scientists Irit Dinur, Oded Goldreich and Ehud Friedgut wrote a letter to the community mentioning some allegations of sexual harassment against Peres and proposed a guideline of not making invitations to junior researchers that may be viewed as intimate. In response Peres wrote a letter to the community and said \\"I regret all cases in the past where I have not followed this principle. I had no intention to harass anyone but must have been tone deaf not to recognize that I was making some people very uncomfortable.

Trivers focuses primarily on humans but he includes examples from many other organisms as well. Trivers' starting point is to illustrate that self-deception is something of an evolutionary puzzle. While the evolutionary benefits to deceiving other organisms are obvious at first glance it seems highly counter intuitive to think that it could ever be in the evolutionary interest of an organism to deceive itself. In the book Trivers discusses the evolutionary reasons for animals engaging in self-deception. He provides numerous examples of this both at the individual level and at the societal level, eventually discussing examples of self-deception in the history of the United States and Israel. The essence of his analysis is that \\"the primary reason we fool ourselves is to fool others\\". Humans are exceptionally good at picking up various verbal and physical cues (e.g., speech intonation, eye movements,...) that indicate when another human is practicing deception. There are many situations such as playing \\"chicken\\" and seeing who will back down first, where it can actually benefit an organism to deceive itself, by so doing the organism can better deceive others.  Reception  Richard Dawkins greeted the book with great praise, saying: > This is a remarkable book, by a uniquely brilliant scientist.

It was built as a Carnegie library in 1909 and housed the city's public library until 1961. With It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for its local significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated for being a well- preserved example of a Carnegie library and of public Neoclassical architecture. The aging and deficient structure was threatened with demolition in the early 21st century, but received a $2.2 million restoration in 2019. The city of Bemidji now rents out the main floor as an event venue while leasing space in the basement as offices. Description The building is located on the banks of Lake Bemidji in Library Park, on a lot. It is a typical one-story, rectangular, brick-and-stone library structure, Neoclassical in style. The exterior is made of brown brick with Indiana Limestone trim. It is covered with a low hip roof and is set upon a high basement, above grade. The basement is the full size of the building. Inside, a stone staircase led to the library's main-floor circulation desk (in the building's center, under a low dome) and two reading rooms; book stacks and stock rooms offered storage and work space behind it. Varnished oak woodwork provided elegant decoration throughout the main floor. Origin The first Bemidji library was housed in the city's old courthouse. After a new Beltrami County Courthouse was constructed in 1902, the library was moved to the lower level of that building. The Bemidji Public Library Association was formed in 1904. After three years of fundraising, the Bemidji Public Library was established on February 25, 1907. In 1908, Bemidji Library Board chairman A. P. Ritchie wrote to Andrew Carnegie to inquire about the possibility of funding for a new library building. On March 23, 1908, the city council commenced proceedings to vacate Fifth Street east of Bemidji Avenue to make room for a construction site. The library's original design included porches on either side of the building, overlooking the lake. The board and the architects intended for these porches to be used in the evening, when the sun shines into the building from the west. Carnegie, however, thought they were unnecessary, and the porches were dropped from the plans, lowering the cost of the building to within the amount of Carnegie's donation of $12,500 (). Thomas Johnson of Bemidji was the construction project's lowest bidder and was awarded the contract for the sum of $11,300 on August 7, 1909. The building was to be completed by January 1, 1910. Johnson completed the work on time, and the building was occupied during the winter and dedicated the following June. Although the porches the architects designed were never built, doors were installed on the library's eastern (lakeside) fa√ßade, perhaps to allow for the future construction of reading porches. While an appropriation was never made for such an addition, it remained feasible. Later history Work crews thoroughly remodeled the building in 1940. The story of the remodeling, complete with pictures, made the pages of the Minneapolis Tribune. City improvement projects in the 1950s widened Bemidji Avenue in front of the library, increasing traffic and making it more hazardous to cross the street. The building stopped operating as a library on November 28, 1961, when the Bemidji Public Library moved into a larger building. It was recognized as a historic property and placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 1980. The Beltrami County Welfare Board occupied the space for a time. The nonprofit Bemidji Community Arts Council tenanted the building beginning in 1983. They maintained an art gallery in the former library and rented portions of it as studio space for local artists. A major restoration largely funded by donations and grants was completed in August 2019. The interior and exterior were restored, an accessible entrance added to the rear, and the windows and HVAC system modernized. Preservation advocates initially hoped to move the building back from the street, but this proved financially infeasible.

A stonemason by trade, he was involved in many organisations, was a community leader in Redcliffs and became Mayor of Sumner. The establishment of Redcliffs School is credited to him. He was a Member of the Legislative Council for 23 years, where he held the role of Chairman of Committees for the years before his death. Biography =Early life and career= Barr was born in Paisley, Scotland, in 1867, and attended a public school at Pollokshaws. His parents were John Barr and Mary Brown. His first job was in a weaving factory in Glasgow. He became interested in social reform in Scotland and advocated for unions and temperance. On 8 Feb 1888, he married Helen McPherson Niddrie (b. 6 December 1867 in Stirling). They had seven children in Scotland (their eldest died before they emigrated) and a further three in New Zealand. He was employed as a stonemason and telegraph linesman in the United States, Canada and British Columbia. In 1902, he immigrated to New Zealand and settled at Redcliffs near Sumner, where he became the leader of the small community (by 1905, Redcliffs had 70 residents). He continued to work as a stonemason and worked on ChristChurch Cathedral, the Trinity Congregational Church and later the pillars for the World War I memorial lamps along Sumner Esplanade. He was active with many organisations. He founded the Christchurch Trades and Labour Council and became its first president. He was chairman of the Christchurch Tramway Board. He was chairman of the Sumner School committee (1904‚Äì1907) at a time when the school was overcrowded (100 pupils were accommodated in two classrooms) and Redcliffs' children had to walk there, as the Education Board would not subsidise tram fares. Barr campaigned for a school at Redcliffs, which was opened on 16 September 1907. The Barr family lived in Estuary Road in Redcliffs. The road was renamed in 1948 to Beachville Road. =Political career= John Barr chiselling a stone, ca 1930 Barr was appointed to the Legislative Council on 22 January 1907, when the Liberal Government wanted to increase the representation of workers. Prime Minister Richard Seddon had made the last appointments to the Legislative Council in 1903 and Barr was part of a group of 14 who were appointed by Seddon's successor Joseph Ward to revert the reduction in size of the Legislative Council by about one quarter. Ward was careful to achieve an appropriate geographical and vocational distribution, but was attacked by the opposition for appointing men lacking in parliamentary experience. Controversy centred about John Barr, and Ward admitted that the government had been unaware that he had been in the country for less than five years, but that they had been assured that \\"he would be a suitable representative of the workers\\". At the end of Barr's seven year terms, he was reappointed on 22 January in 1914, 1921, and 1928, when he served until his death. On 8 July 1925, he was elected Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Council, a post that he held until his death. Barr became Mayor of Sumner in 1917 and held that post until 1923. During that time, his main emphasis went on the improvement of the water supply and five wells were dug on little Rat Island in the Avon Heathcote Estuary (the island no longer exists; it had eroded away by the late 1920s), and reservoirs were built in Redcliffs. =Death= Barr died in Dunedin on 7 December 1930. He is buried at Bromley Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1953.

Due to their aggressive investing nature, and the methods they use to make firms more profitable, vulture capitalists are often criticized. Distinguishing between venture and vulture capitalists A venture capitalist is an investor who provides funding for start-ups, early stage firms and companies with growth potential. These types of firms seek out venture capitalists, as they are too small or too new to have credit profiles, making them ineligible for bank loans and other forms of raising capital. Although risky, venture capitalists invest in firms as there are very lucrative returns on their investments when the company they are investing in is successful. Furthermore, venture capitalists will often invest in a range of firms rather than just one or two, in order to mitigate risks if the investments are unsuccessful. On the other hand, vulture capitalists provide a final attempt at gaining funding. Whereas venture capitalists seek firms with growth potential, vulture capitalists usually seek out firms where costs can be cut in order to increase profits. Mostly, these firms are distressed and on the brink of bankruptcy. Due to this reason, vulture capitalists are able to buy these firms at a much lower price than if they had been profitable and expanding. Once the firm is acquired, vulture capitalists can attempt to increase efficiency in order to turn the company around. This is often done by cut-downs costs wherever possible, which in part is likely to be accomplished by firing workers where possible, reducing benefits or both. thus raising the share price and the worth of the investors holdings. Lastly, the vulture capitalists sell any equity they own, making a profit. But vulture capitalists can also choose to divide and sell off the entire company in pieces, if this should increase the attractiveness of each individual piece to its purchaser and thus allow the vulture capitalist a net profit. Criticism Vulture capitalists receive a lot of criticism as they often go for firms that are in very poor shape, meaning these firms are unable to secure capital from banks or even venture capitalists as they are too risky an investment. Due to this, vulture capitalists are able to acquire the firms for prices that are often very low considering what they would have been if the company was not currently under pressure, or if other participants were bidding on it. Once vulture capitalists acquire a firm, they often fire workers to reduce costs, in order to raise profitability for their own gain. Vulture capitalists are criticized for this, especially as the newly unemployed people can be said to put pressure on the political economy and general society through their need of unemployment benefits, which comes from company payroll taxes and other taxpayers. For the same reasons, venture capitalists can be accused of being vulture capitalists, or \\"vulture\\" for short, depending on how they conduct their business. In this sense, vulture capitalist is used as a derogatory word for venture capitalists, as the vulture capitalists are considered to be preying on firms in distress for their own profit.

From 1892 to 1896, White conducted an architectural practice at Everett, Washington. While in Everett, White designed numerous public school buildings and business blocks. In November 1896, he returned to Spokane, working in partnerships with Seaton, then W. A. Alexander, and later A. E. Permaine, Oscar Huber and John W. Strack. By the turn of the century, White was in solo practice, remaining as such until 1904. White was married in April 1898 to Florence Adelaide Sargent (born April 1869). He moved for a time to California's Inland Empire due to his wife's ill health, leaving his Spokane practice under the supervision of Alfred Jones. His wife died in 1903 and in 1905 White returned to his practice in Spokane. White married Sara T. Lawrence in 1920. In 1923, he left his practice in Spokane, and relocated to Everett, Washington with his wife. He continued to reside in Everett until his death and worked as an architect there, designing structures including the Labor Temple built in 1929, the Sevenich House built in 1930, and a mortuary (at Pacific & Wetmore Avenues) completed in 1932. White was a member of the Elks, the Spokane Athletic Club, the Inland Club, and the Coeur d'Alene Boat Club. He was also active in politics as an organizer of the \\"silver wing\\" of the Republican Party of Snohomish County, Washington. He died in August 1932 at Everett, Washington. Works White designed more than 1,100 buildings in the State of Washington, including 63 schools. His largest commission was obtained in 1905 when he was hired by the Potlatch Corporation, a lumber company, to design a company town that became Potlatch, Idaho. White sought to design a model town. In ten months at Potlatch, he \\"had under contract work amounting to five hundred thousand dollars.\\" He designed over 300 buildings comprising \\"the entire town except the mill.\\" His works in Potlatch included many that have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, including \\"working men's cottages, ranging in price from five hundred to two thousand dollars, and for the officers of the company ... residences ranging in price from two to eight thousand dollars.\\" His works in Potlatch also included a hotel, a theater, churches, depots, schools, a theater/opera house, and company store. =Selected works= The Spokesman-Review Building in Spokane designed by White and Seaton White's works include (with attribution): Works in Spokane * Transient Hotel (also known as Minnesota Building), 423 W. 1st Avenue, Spokane, Washington *Waldo Paine House, Spokane, Washington *The Spokesman- Review Building in Spokane, Washington (with C.

The community is notorious for its high crime rate and gang activity. South Park was also once a settlement for African Americans during the mid-1900s and is a center of Santa Rosa's black community. History Originally an Italian and German community, South Park became a popular settlement for African Americans relocating from the South after World War II in the late 1940s, and was considered the \\"black neighborhood\\" of Santa Rosa. A chapter of NAACP was founded and a black church was established during this time in the area, known as the Community Baptist Church. In 1990, 76% percent of South Park's residents were black, and 21% of them Hispanic. Refugees from African countries also settled in the neighborhood during the 1990s. Crime The South Park neighborhood, along with West Ninth, West Third, Roseland and Apple Valley in northwest and southwest Santa Rosa, at one time had a higher-than- average rate of crime in comparison to other neighborhoods in Santa Rosa. Much of the crime that did occur were burglaries, assault, extortion, homicide, grand theft, and robbery. South Park's gangs were Mexican American, namely Nortenos and Surenos. Drive-by shootings were at one time a common form of gang-related attacks on people in South Park. Features South Park along with West Ninth Street was home to American rapper Ray Luv.

LA 1 began in Pointe-a-la-Hache, continuing north through small communities, making its way to New Orleans. The route description from New Orleans north is as follows: From the southern terminus at Common Street, LA 1 followed St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street, City Park Avenue, and Metairie Road into Jefferson Parish. Leaving New Orleans, LA 1 followed Metairie Road, Shrewsbury Road, and Jefferson Highway to Kenner. From Kenner to Geismar, LA 1 followed alongside the east bank levee of the Mississippi River which, due to various sections of levee being relocated during the 1920s and 1930s, is often a significant distance removed from the modern River Road. Also, a two-mile section between Norco and Montz was eliminated in 1935 when the parallel Airline Highway bridge across the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway was opened. Portions of LA 1 at Reserve and Gramercy are still known as Jefferson Highway to this day. From Geismar to Baton Rouge, the route followed what is known as Old Jefferson Highway to downtown Baton Rouge. The original routing through downtown Baton Rouge followed Claycut Road, South Acadian Thruway, Government Street, 19th Street, and North Street to the former Mississippi River ferry landing to Port Allen. From Port Allen to Alexandria, LA 1 used Court Street, North Jefferson Avenue, and Rosedale Road through Port Allen, then along Rosedale Road to Rosedale, Ravenswood, and then to Red Cross. LA 1 crossed the Atchafalaya River by ferry to Melville and continued on to Lebeau. It used the current route of US 71 to Bunkie, with a short section over a one-lane truss bridge that was bypassed in the mid-1930s. North of Cheneyville, it used US 71 and parts of some bypassed roads to Chambers, then Old Baton Rouge Highway to Alexandria. In Alexandria and Pineville, LA 1 used Jefferson Hwy., Lee Street, Main Street, and Murray Street through Alexandria, then LA 1 crossed the Red River on a now-demolished bridge at the foot of Murray Street into Pineville, then Main Street and Military Highway, Jefferson Highway, and US 71 (Shreveport Highway) through Pineville. North of Pineville, LA 1 used US 71 and Shreveport Highway. (Stainaker Street is a small, severed portion of the original route near the junction of US 71 and LA 3225.)

The film premiered at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival. Plot Sarah Jane McKinney has been working as a secretary at Judge Pharmaceuticals for years, and she's eager to earn better pay and more prestige. As a young girl, her alcoholic father was killed by a statue of Saint George that fell off a church. Ever since, she has looked to St. George as her guardian angel. When a junior executive position opens up at Judge, Sarah's friend Charmaine encourages Sarah to join her in applying for the job. Sarah's mother Claire helps her forge her resume, and Sarah ends up winning the job. On her first full day of work, Sarah arrives at her office to find it being packed up by Milo Beeber. He explains that the Human Resources manager who promoted Sarah got fired, and Milo transferred in from corporate headquarters. Sarah consigns herself to being Milo's secretary. Charmaine coaches Sarah to go along with Milo's inevitable sexual advances as a way to get ahead. After a working dinner, Sarah goes back to Milo's apartment. She is horrified to find out that he is engaged and tries to ward off his advances. Milo chases her up a portable ladder. When Sarah shoves him away, Milo falls backwards and is impaled on an umbrella. Sarah does not report his death and is promoted to Milo's position. Another executive at Judge, Nan Wilder confronts Sarah about Milo's death. Milo had texted Nan a picture of Sarah at his apartment. Knowing that Nan could report her to the police, Sarah decides to push her in front of an oncoming subway train. She soon receives a faxed picture showing her standing behind Nan on the subway platform. Believing that fax came from Pierre JeJeune, Sarah electrocutes him by activating the office's sprinkler system while Pierre is Xeroxing his butt in a kinky sex game. Promoted into Pierre's position, Judge sends in a consultant, Morty Wickham, to help Sarah get a handle on her new job. Morty was Pierre's protege, and when he embarrasses Sarah at a corporate event, she decides to kill him. She severs the gas line to Morty's oven, and when he tries to light a bong, his house explodes. The string of deaths at Judge are being investigated by Detective Sergeant Bill Malloy who is also boarding at Sarah and Claire's house. Sarah and Malloy have begun dating, but she worries that he might be closing in on her. She decides that she needs a fall guy and settles for Joshua Nether. She seduces Joshua and gains access to his personal information, which she uses to set up dummy accounts. Sarah embezzles money from Judge through the dummy accounts, setting everything up to look like Joshua is to blame. Malloy happens to see Sarah and Joshua leaving a restaurant after one of their dates and is heartbroken. When Malloy confronts Sarah about her betrayal, she thinks he is referring to the murders she has committed. She realizes he is referring to Joshua, and they reconcile. After she poisons Joshua, Sarah is blackmailed by someone who claims that she knows about the embezzled money. Sarah quickly plots out who could be extorting her and various ways to kill them. She even poisons a jug of bottled water belonging to Mr. Ormsby, just in case (marking it with an x). It turns out that Charmaine is blackmailing Sarah. She was jealous of Sarah's promotion, and she was secretly behind most of the events that led Sarah to commit the series of murders. During their confrontation, Charmaine ends up chasing Sarah to the top of a bell tower, where Sarah causes Charmaine to fall to her death. Thinking her troubles are behind her, Sarah gets engaged to Malloy and decides to try and do good deeds to balance out what she's done. At work, she asks L.J., her assistant, for a glass of water while she writes him a letter of recommendation. As she sips the water, L.J. explains that he had to get the water from Ormsby's office, and Sarah realizes the likelihood that it is the bottle which she'd poisoned. Asking L.J. to check if that bottle had an x marked on its cap, she nervously waits for his reply, while pondering the notion of karma and people getting what they deserve.

Europa Lighthouse was inaugurated on 1 August 1841 in a brief ceremony witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three incandescent mantle burner was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994 and converted to LED operation in 2016. Europa Point Lighthouse is operated by Trinity House. The cylindrical tower is painted white, with a wide red horizontal band in the middle. The lighthouse has a height of and is above the high-water mark. The Gibraltar Amateur Radio Society operates from the lighthouse during the third weekend of August each year. History Also known as the Trinity Lighthouse at Europa Point and the Victoria Tower, the Europa Point Lighthouse, of classic British design, first underwent construction in 1838. Sir Alexander George Woodford (1782‚Äì1870), Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar, set the first stone for the lighthouse's foundation on 26 April 1838, with the aid of the Masonic Order of Gibraltar. The inscription read: A brief ceremony commemorated the event, which was witnessed by about 10,000 people. Construction of the lighthouse was completed in 1841, and was inaugurated according to schedule on 1 August that year. The first lighting of the Europa Point Lighthouse drew an audience of more than 2,000 people. To navigate the Bay of Gibraltar prior to the opening of the lighthouse sailors were dependent on the light emitted by the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe, Roman Catholic shrine, which was originally a mosque built after the victory of King Ferdinand IV of Spain over the Moors at the 1309 siege. They expressed their gratitude by leaving supplies of oil at the chapel, which also encouraged the continued burning of the lights. Europa Point Lighthouse in 1879 At the time of the opening of the lighthouse in 1841, a fixed light was emitted by an oil lamp with one wick. The intensity of the light was increased by a large (first-order) optic by Cookson & Co., combining a main dioptric fixed lens with upper and lower tiers of catoptric mirrors. On 25 April 1843, lighting was upgraded to improve visibility from Sandy Bay, and in 1854, the lighthouse had a reported visibility of . Repairs and alterations were made to the lighthouse in 1863-64 by engineer Henry Norris, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four- wick burner, and a new, much-improved optic was provided (a first-order fixed catadioptric, also by Chance Brothers). The improvements included provision of a red arc of light over the hazardous Pearl Rock region: in order to maintain the intensity of the red light out as far as Pearl Rock (which was 6 miles away), 9-foot high vertical reflecting prisms were used to redirect light from the landward side (where it would otherwise be wasted) back through the red sector. An additional upgrade was made in 1875 when the lamp was switched out for a four-wick mineral oil burner. In 1894, the lighthouse was further altered to increase the amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner was exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and the lantern was improved; the power of the light was thereby increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. An explosive fog signal was also introduced, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle. Later, between 1954 and 1956, further extensive changes were made and the introduction of electric lighting further improved visibility. As part of the upgrade, a much more powerful, revolving lens system was introduced for the primary optic: a Stone-Chance 2nd Order Catadioptric optic. By a complex arrangement of lenses and shades, the optic displayed an isophase white light (5 seconds on, 5 seconds off) when seen from most directions, but was seen as a red occulting light (on for 5.8 seconds, off for 4.2 seconds) within the red sector, covering the Pearl Rock. In addition, at this time, a separate red sector light was added, which projected a fixed red beam across the same sector from a room below the main light. To accommodate the new equipment, the height of the tower was increased by . Also, as part of this upgrade, a set of SuperTyfon foghorns was installed, mounted on their own engine-house, alongside the tower; they sounded one blast every 20 seconds. The lighthouse was fully automated in February 1994. The extant optics were kept, but complemented with a three-position lampchanger. The foghorn was changed to an electric model, with a directional 500 Hz emitter stack that was installed on the gallery of the lantern room. In 2016, as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the light and its electric systems, the revolving optic was removed (along with the red arc, with its vertical prisms, and the subsidiary sector light). It was replaced with a pair of all-round white single-tier LED lanterns displaying an isophase characteristic (one providing the main light, the other serving as a standby). At the same time the fog signal was discontinued. The decommissioned 1950s optic was then presented to the newly-established University of Gibraltar, where it has been placed on display. Description Europa Point Lighthouse The lighthouse, which remains active, is strategically located at the southeastern tip of the Rock of Gibraltar at Europa Point, between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, rising to above the high-water mark. The Mediterranean is to the east, the Bay of Gibraltar to the northwest, and the Strait of Gibraltar to the southwest. The lighthouse has a masonry tower with lantern and gallery; the tower is painted white, with a single wide red horizontal band in the middle. It is locally known as \\"La Farola\\" (literally 'lamppost' in Spanish) in Llanito, Gibraltar's spoken vernacular. Administration Europa Point Lighthouse and Rock of Gibraltar, as viewed from Strait of Gibraltar The lighthouse is the only such building outside of the British Isles which is operated by Trinity House, a lighthouse agency based in England. Accordingly, it is also referred to as the Trinity Lighthouse. Trinity House was made responsible for building and operating the Europa Point Lighthouse by the Gibraltar Lighthouse, etc. Act 1838.Gibraltar Lighthouse, etc. Act 1838 (1 & 2 Vict.) c. 66 In addition, section 634 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 resulted in Trinity House becoming the general lighthouse authority for Gibraltar. The site of the lighthouse is managed by the Government of Gibraltar, and monitoring of the lighthouse is through a reporting station connected by telephone to the Gibraltar Port Office. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Admiralty Digital Lists of Lights (ADLL) number for the Europa Point Lighthouse is D2438. The United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) number is 4220. Soon after World War II, amateur radio, also called ham radio, made its appearance in Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Amateur Radio Society, with its headquarters on Coaling Island, operates from the lighthouse once annually, during the third weekend of August. The annual International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend has as its goal in Gibraltar of putting the Europa Point Lighthouse on the air, using the call sign, ZB2LGT. The Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) number for the lighthouse is GIB-001.

Consisting of 12 men who, after the 1630s were appointed by the British Sovereign, the Governor's Council also served as an advisory body to the Virginia Royal Governor and as the highest judicial body in the colony. Organization The Council consisted of no more than 12 men who served lifetime appointments to advise the governor and were, together with the governor, the highest court in the colony. Thus this body served as a legislative, executive and a judicial body. Modeled after the British House of Lords, the Governor's Council went through a definite evolution, as the Virginia colony grew. During much of the colonial period, the governor was absentee and the lieutenant governor was the beneficiary of the council's advice. When both were absent, the longest serving member of the council, entitled the President of the council, would serve as acting governor. During the Commonwealth of Oliver Cromwell between 1652 and 1660, the House of Burgesses elected the members of the council. After the restoration of the monarchy, the Crown again appointed the council, typically from among the landed and wealthy Virginia planters. History =Virginia Company (1607‚Äì1624)= Virginia was founded under a charter granted by King James I to the Virginia Company in 1606. In 1607, the company's governing board in London appointed a small group of seven men to manage the day-to-day affairs of the colony on their behalf, after the first settlers landed on the Virginia Peninsula. On April 26, 1607, the Council elected Captain Edward Maria Wingfield as its President, and he would later choose the site for the founding of the Jamestown settlement. There was a lack of strong leadership among the council, which became apparent as soon as they landed at Jamestown in 1607. Internal dissension, allegations of lying and the unexpected deaths of some councilors reduced the Governor's Council to a small group and finally only one person by the winter of 1608‚Äì1609. At that point, the Virginia Company essentially declared martial law and suspended the minimal semblance of collaborative government. The era of near-dictatorial power by the governor ended in 1618 following the king's issuance of the third royal charter. As a result, a representative and consultative government was created. It was composed of the following establishments: a governor appointed by the Virginia Company of London, and a council of state, whose members were also chosen by the Virginia Company. The Governor's Council was charged with assisting the new governor in the execution of his duties, the first of which was, \\"the Advancement of the Honour and Service of God, and the Enlargement of his Kingdom amongst the Heathen People.\\" Ordinances for Virginia; July 24-August 3, 1621 The other branch of government was a General Assembly that included the Council and a House of Burgesses that included two \\"burgesses\\" from every town, hundred, and particular plantation \\"chosen by the [free] inhabitants thereof\\". This new political structure necessarily reduced the power of the governor, a previously unilaterally powerful office which had been appointed for life. Under the new charter, sometimes called the Great Charter, Council decisions were made by majority vote, and the governor was only able to cast the deciding vote in the case of a tie. The General Assembly, which included both a popularly elected (albeit not universally enfranchised) and an Executive-Legislative hybrid based somewhat on the British system, was to be the voice of the colonists in Virginia, providing a check on the power of the governor. Members of Virginia's first legislative assembly, which was a unicameral session including burgesses, the council and the governor, gathered at the rough-hewn Anglican Jamestown Church on July 30, 1619. This was the first representative government in the European colonies in North America. Before they adjourned, the assembly had adopted new laws for the colonists as well as programs designed to encourage settlement and improve economic growth in Virginia. =Royal colony (1624‚Äì1776)= In 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a crown colony. The Council continued to be appointed and serve as advisors to the now royally-appointed governor and serve as the highest court of the colony. Until 1643, the council and burgesses continued to sit as a unicameral legislature. In the period when Britain was not a monarchy, due to the overthrow of King Charles II, from 1652 until 1660, when the monarchy was restored, the members of the council, instead of being appointed by the head of state in London, were elected by the burgesses in Virginia. After 1643, the General Assembly became bicameral and the Council was the upper house. The council continued to exercise legislative, administrative and judicial functions. Although the monarch appointed the members of the council, resident royal governors or lieutenant governors (who acted as governor in the absence of the royal governor) often made recommendations to the king when a vacancy occurred. The appointees were almost always among the most prominent planters and merchants in the colony. \\"The members of the Council were almost all wealthy and both socially and politically prominent. Independent wealth was required both for the social standing necessary for membership and also to permit the members to be absent from their families and plantations for long periods of time,\\" according to the Encyclopedia Virginia. During the years from 1643‚Äì1676, the Council met at the upper house of the General Assembly annually. From 1676‚Äì1776, the Governor's Council met about 8 times a decade as a legislative body, but starting in the middle of the 1600s the Council met quarterly for judicial sessions. Additionally, they convened as advisors to the governor at least annually, often for weeks at a time. In order to compensate the councilors for their time, starting in the 1640s the assembly granted them dispensation from taxes. Encyclopedia Virginia states that \\"Membership on the governor's Council was the highest civil office to which natives or residents of the colony could normally aspire, and membership on the Council enabled wealthy and influential men to increase the wealth and influence of themselves and their families.\\" The extant written records of the council begin in 1680 and are housed at the Library of Virginia.

In 2003, he was sentenced to a 5 years imprisonment for political dissent against the government of Vietnam.  Background  Son graduated from medical school as a physician, but then earned an MBA. He later worked as a business manager for a pharmaceutical company in Hanoi. In 2001, he became an open advocate for democracy, posting pro-democracy articles and essays to Internet forums.  Arrest and imprisonment  In early 2002, he downloaded an essay from the US State Department's website titled \\"What is Democracy?\\" He then translated the essay into Vietnamese and forwarded it to friends. He also translated an essay of his own, titled \\"Encouraging Signs of Democracy\\" and originally written in French, and forwarded it to both friends and Communist Party officials. On March 25, police searched Son's house and interrogated him; he was arrested without a warrant two days later. In June 2003, he was sentenced to thirteen years in prison for espionage following a half-day trial. The prosecution accused Son of contact with \\"political opportunists\\" and \\"reactionary forces overseas\\". According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), his wife was the only witness called, and she was only allowed to answer two yes-or-no questions. In August, Son's sentence was reduced to five years' imprisonment. Foreign journalists and human rights observers were not allowed to attend either the original trial or the appeal.  International response  Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the imprisonment of Son and fellow online activists Nguyen Khac Toan and Nguyen Vu Binh stating that the men's \\"only crime was to express themselves freely on the Internet\\". On 7 April 2006, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for Son's release as a condition of Vietnam joining the World Trade Organization. The European Union also objected on Son's behalf. Amnesty International designated Son a prisoner of conscience and described Son's espionage conviction as \\"a travesty of justice\\". HRW called for his immediate release and awarded him one of its Hellman/Hammett grants, which support persecuted writers in need of financial assistance. More than 4000 Australians signed a petition calling for Son's release. In 2005, RSF reported that Son was showing symptoms of untreated tuberculosis in prison. The Committee to Protect Journalists also expressed concerns for Son's well-being, stating, \\"The harsh conditions of Pham Hong Son's imprisonment add to the cruel tally of human costs in Vietnam's continued repression of the media ... Authorities should release him immediately and without condition and give him access to urgently needed medical attention as soon as possible.\\" In 2003, Pham Hong Son, together with Nguyen Vu Binh, Le Chi Quang and Nguyen Khac Toan, were presented with Vietnam Human Rights Award by Vietnam Human Rights Network.  Later activism  Son was released from prison on 30 August 2006 as part of a general amnesty and placed under house arrest. The amnesty came three months in advance of Vietnam's hosting an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hanoi, and Son stated to reporters that his release had been timed to improve the nation's image before the meeting. He pledged to continue working for democratic reform. On 5 April 2011, he was rearrested along with Le Quoc Quan when attempting to observe the trial of democracy activist Cu Huy Ha Vu. The pair were held for \\"causing public disorder\\". Son's wife Vu Thu Ha stated that Son had been assaulted by police with batons prior to his arrest. Both were released without charge 13 April.

Due to periods of uncertain economy and high inflation, the currency has been re-valued several times.  800‚Äì1600 Native, Javanese and Chinese money  The first coin-like products found in Indonesia date from the 9th century Buddhist Sailendran dynasty and were produced in Indonesia until the 12th century: gold and silver massa (emas is the modern Indonesian word for \\"gold\\"), tahil and kupang, often described with the letter ma for massa or the image of sandalwood flower. Also used in this period were Mutisalah of Lesser Sunda Islands, strings of beads of Indo-Pacific origins, produced by the Sumatran Srivijaya empire, which spread to Borneo, Java and to the eastern Indonesian islands ( Maluku islands ) in the 13th century. In the eastern islands those beads are saved as heirlooms until the present, using Chinese-made beads after the defeat of Srivijaya. The Majapahit empire, which became predominant in Java and Sumatra from the late 13th Century, received, with the arrival of Chinese traders, holed copper coins known as cash. These were later mimicked in Indonesia using tin or lead (further reading: Cash coins in Indonesia). 1600‚Äì1942 Dutch colonial money When Europeans began arriving in Indonesia they brought with them gold coins from Portugal and Venice and silver Spanish dollars from Mexico, Peru and Bolivia, the latter becoming the predominant trade coin in the archipelago for several hundred years. The Dutch East India Company was granted a trade monopoly over the Indies in 1600 and under the leadership of Jan Pieterszoon Coen gained effective government over the territory around Batavia on Java, their capital, with an area of influence that increased over time, and which was eventually expanded by Dutch conquest into the 20th century to include nearly all of what is now Indonesia. The Dutch East India Company in the 17th century imported chiefly silver coin, in the form of Dutch small silver 1, 2, and 6 stuiver coins, as well as the Spanish dollar (the most popular trade coin) and Dutch trade coinage. They helped provide smaller change by selling tin to the cash mints, but generally did not produce or import it themselves. Due to a lack of tin supply, in 1724 the Company began to produce its own copper coins, 'VOC'-branded duit coins, which were minted in six provinces of The Netherlands and imported in vast numbers over the 18th and into the 19th century. There were intermittent efforts at VOC-branded silver coinage, but mostly imported Dutch and Spanish silver, which had a higher value in the Indies, was used. Although most coin was imported, (chiefly) silver and also some gold 'rupee' coins were minted locally in the 18th and early 19th century. The first bank paper appeared with the formation of the De Bank Courant en Bank van Leening in 1752, and a number of issues were made over the next sixty years, which all tended to lose value over time due to lack of coin to back the paper. The VOC went bankrupt in 31 December 1799 and the territories were nationalised by the then government, the Batavian Republic, which issued its own duits and made an issue of silver gulden coins in 1802. Duits were minted in large numbers in Surabaya between 1814 and 1840 from silver imported from the Netherlands. In 1854, the Netherlands Indies Guilder/Gulden was decimalised, the duit replaced by the cent and a series of coins from ¬Ω cent up to ¬º gulden was issued, all minted in The Netherlands. Larger denominations ‚Äì ¬Ω, 1 and 2¬Ω gulden in silver, and 5 and 10 gulden in gold ‚Äì were of regular Dutch issue and circulated alongside the lower denominated Indies coinage. This same series of coinage continued to be issued until independence in 1945. The government put a stop to the inflationary bank paper with an issue of government paper in 1815, withdrawn on 30 June 1861. De Javasche Bank, the central bank of the Netherlands Indies, eventually to become Bank Indonesia, was established in 1828, subject to much stricter regulation than previous banks, and remained solvent. 1942‚Äì1949 Japanese invasion, and Indonesian independence ‚Äì the dawn of hyperinflation in Indonesia =The Japanese invasion= One Gulden note, Japanese occupation currency, Dutch East IndiesIn 1942, the Japanese invaded the Netherlands Indies, taking control of the whole country and Netherlands New Guinea by March 1942. On their invasion ships, they brought their own issue of the local money, the gulden. They liquidated the banks, including 'De Javasche Bank' and voided debt obligations. The notes issued by 'De Japansche Regeering' (the Japanese government) would be legal tender from March 1942 (although the existing notes remained valid), with notes printed from 1 cent to 10 gulden, by the new (as of April 1942) circulating bank Nanpo Kaihatsu Ginko. The Japanese money was supposed to have the same value as the old Dutch money, with the old money to be recalled from use, but the invaders soon printed excessive quantities of money, and it was quickly apparent that hyperinflation was in progress, and hence people hoarded the Dutch money. By the end of the War, the Japanese had caused a massive increase in the paper money supply, which was 230 million gulden pre-war, to several billion post-war. This, plus the actions of the post-war Dutch administration, caused massive inflation and damage to the stability and economy of the country. As their occupation continued, by 1944 the Japanese had determined that their long-term strategic interests were best furthered by encouraging Indonesian nationalism, and so it issued a second series of notes printed in Indonesian language, the Netherlands Indies roepiah. Existing stocks of notes remained in use by the new Indonesian government until they had printed their own money in 1946, while the notes actually continued to be printed until early 1946 in parts of Eastern Indonesia (where the Nationalists did not have control), as a temporary measure until the Dutch had re-established their pre-war administration across the scattered islands. =Dutch/Allied re-occupation= The Dutch government, which was in exile in London, had been making preparations for the end of the war, whereupon it hoped to regain control over its colony. To do so, in recognition of the fundamentally altered financial conditions under which they would be issued, it was anticipated that a governmental issue would be needed, in view of the weakened position of the private De Javasche Bank, which had previously been issuing banknotes. The notes were ordered in December 1942, printed in the US by the Security Bank Note Printing Company. The notes were dated 'March 1943' and labelled as 'Nederlandsch-Indische Gouvernementsgulden' printed in Dutch, along with the additional Indonesian text indicating the denomination of the notes and the word 'roepiah'. Denominations were 50 sen to 500 gulden. At the end of the war, the Allies 'Netherlands Indies Civil Administration' (army), began to retake control of the old East Indies. It began issuing the 1943-dated money (the 'NICA gulden'), starting from 1944 in New Guinea, and subsequently in Maluku and Borneo, both of which were recaptured before the Japanese surrender on 14 August 1945. In areas under NICA control, pre-war Dutch notes were demonetised. Despite the fact that NICA had control over the outer parts of Indonesia, its authority to dictate the value of money was limited by the economic weakness of the administration and of The Netherlands itself. As a compromise NICA re-monetized the pre-war notes of 10 gulden and below, higher- valued notes were not re-issued to reduce the inflationary effect of having the pre-war currency as well as new NICA money in circulation. After the Japanese surrender the administration was given official control of the institutions of the country by the Allies, and DJB, which had survived the war better than expected, was reincorporated on 10 October 1945. Although the military action of the Allies in Eastern Indonesia and Kalimantan (Borneo) had introduced the NICA gulden into circulation in those areas, the transition back to Dutch control did not go smoothly in the main islands of Java and Sumatra and Allied military action gained control only over a few coastal enclaves, where Japanese money was used, large quantities of which were in storage by the Japanese. The 'uang merah' ('red money' (the 10 rupiah note was red, and there may also be a reference to blood, as the money was unpopular with the Indonesian revolutionaries)) faced nationalist opposition to the principle of money issued by the Dutch, exarcebated by the fact that in spite of stated intentions to adopt a less colonial stance post-war, the notes had been printed in Dutch with a large picture of the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina. When the first NICA money appeared in Java, Sukarno issued an immediate decree, of 2 October 1945, to declare that the NICA notes were illegal. Lacking the control needed to issue money effectively, the Dutch determined that it would be inadvisable to issue NICA money in the towns of Java and Sumatra and prohibited their import. With Japanese still acting as local government in Java and Sumatra, it was necessary for NICA to preserve the value of the Japanese money as much as possible, since it was the only means for them to pay the bills incurred in maintaining order. In many cases, the Japanese were instructed to simply print more money, and the amount of Japanese currency in circulation continued to increase rapidly: the Japanese-originated inflation continued with increased pace. By February 1946, 2 billion Japanese money out of 2.5 billion captured in the state printers, had been spent, a vast sum against the entire pre-war circulation of less than 500 million gulden. Due to the dwindling supplies of money, destruction of the printing plates at the main printers for re-issue, and disquiet amongst European forces at payment in Japanese money, which was losing value constantly, it was finally decided to issue the NICA gulden in Java on 6 March 1946. Pre-war notes of 5 gulden and below only were to retain validity, and the Japanese money was to be exchanged at a rate of 33 to 1. This action enraged the Indonesians, who imposed a 5-year prison sentence on its use. One army regiment even went as far as to execute people carrying the money, hoisting their bodies in public with the money pinned onto them. Due to the difficulties associated with using the money, the supply of food and basic goods from the Republican interior was poor, and the NICA money by June 1946 had fallen to a black market value of just 10 of the Japanese money (which was still the preferred money throughout Java), despite Dutch attempts to enforce the rate. =The first Indonesian rupiah ‚Äì in Java= first issue (1945) of Republic of Indonesia banknotes. Sukarno depicted on the face and a smoking volcano on the back. Although the Republican government was firmly opposed to the use of the Dutch NICA money, seeing its exclusion as an important tool in the fight with the Dutch, the issue of its own money was slightly more considered. After their 2 October proclamation on NICA money, it declared the next day that Japanese money as well as pre-NICA Dutch money would be legal tender in the Republic, with both holding the same value, despite the greatly inflated quantity of Japanese money circulating, reflecting in part the fact that the Dutch money was no longer backed by gold reserves, the gold having been evacuated in the early part of the war. The Indonesians had been advised by the British that an issue of Indonesian money would be financial and political suicide, but their resolve was firm. Their first notes, dated 1945, were in preparation when the Indonesian printing works and all the money in it was seized by the Allies (which at this point included in the British, tasked with restoring order) in their successful assault on Jakarta in January 1946. The printing plates survived the attack and with the Dutch decision to finally introduce the NICA gulden to Java in March 1946 seen as an offensive act the Indonesians pressed ahead with the reprinting, an act spurred, as with the Dutch, by the dwindling supplies of Japanese money from the vaults of the banks in the cities they controlled (approximately 600 million Japanese roepiah). With Indonesian resources increasingly poorly matched against the Dutch, and only the small G. Kolff & Co Malang printers at their disposal to print the money, printing of the money took several months, to July 1946. The Republican government declared that the new central bank of Indonesia would be Bank Negara Indonesia, established on 5 July 1946, occupying the offices of De Javasche Bank in Yogyakarta, the stronghold of the republic. The Indonesian rupiah was first issued by proclamation of 3 October 1946. In the year or so prior, the Japanese money had been a vital conduit of Republican goods to the Dutch enclaves, but the decree brought this to an end: all Japanese money was to be deposited with Republic banks by 30 October 1946. Providing the depositors could account for how the money was obtained, they would be entitled to new 'Oeang Republik Indonesia' (ORI) at the rate of 50 Japanese rupiah to 1 rp ORI. Outstanding debts were revalued according to their date of origin, with debts arising prior to 1943 (before the Japanese-induced inflation) converted at par, debts from 1943‚Äì1945 at 20 to 1, and those arising that year at the same 50 to 1 ratio. This deflationary policy had been derived from the Dutch geldzuivering of Dutch Minister of Finance Pieter Lieftinck (later Executive Director of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)), who had trained Sumitro Djojohadikusumo (who had returned to Indonesia along with many other educated Indonesians after the War) in economics at university in The Netherlands. As in The Netherlands, each citizen was to be issued with 1 rp to kick-start the circulation of new money. Undeposited money after October was declared worthless. One rupiah of the new money was said to be worth 0.5 grams of gold, a similar rate to the pre-war Dutch currency (which contained 3 grams of fine gold in the 5 gulden and 6 in the 10 gulden coin), although this was not backed by metal reserves, merely a proclamation of purchasing power. Due to a fear that the deposited money would not be returned, there was panic buying of goods in the days following the decree, and prices of food (in Japanese money) soared by up to 30 times, with the black market exchange rate to the NICA gulden rising to 120 to 1. With the end of Japanese money in the main Republican stronghold in Java as a conduit between the Republican interior and Dutch enclaves, the Dutch were forced to act, ending the exchange of Japanese money on 30 October 1946, to avoid a flood of unexchanged Japanese money being brought for exchange with NICA gulden. Thus in Java at this point two currencies circulated, the 1943-dated Dutch NICA gulden, in Dutch- controlled areas, and the 1945-dated ORI in the Indonesian enclaves. The Indonesian resistance was highly fragmented, strongest in rural villages, and lacking the ability to supply money across its extent, the Japanese money continued to be used in Banten, West Java, as well as all of republican Sumatra. There was never an official exchange rate between NICA gulden and Indonesian rupiah, but with popular support for the rupiah strong, 1 ORI rupiah was initially valued at 5 NICA gulden. The currency, however, depreciated fast, falling to 2 gulden within 1 week, as the market gauged fair value, and by the end of 1946 to par. By March 1947, it was worth half a gulden, and by July 0.3 gulden. This inflation was caused by the Republican government, which was printing money to meet its obligations in the face of limited income of its own. By January 1947, 310 million rupiah had been printed in republican Java alone, half the entire pre-war gulden money supply. Due to the limited printing capacity of the government, it focused printing on 100 rupiah notes. Limited supply of smaller notes meant that the 100 rupiah notes were worth less than a combination of smaller notes. Rampant forgery only served to exacerbate the inflation of the Indonesian money. Despite laws put in place to stop hoarding of goods, confidence in the currency could not be maintained. In Jakarta, the Indonesian money was worth even less than elsewhere, as a consequence of the demand for NICA-denominated imported goods. Republican attempts to maintain the value of Indonesian money (which was largely backed by the supply of rice from inner Java) could only slow, rather than stop, its decline. Over the years of the Indonesian revolution, three further issues of banknotes followed, all printed in Yogyakarta, two in 1947 alone, with a fourth, much more limited in number, being issued in 1948. =Dutch money of 1947‚Äì1949= New money was issued by the Dutch from July 1947, in the form of fully Dutch/Indonesian bilingual gulden/roepiah notes from 'De Javasche Bank'. These notes were dated 1946, and consisted of 5 (violet), 10 (violet), 25 (red) gulden notes. The supply of these soon exhausted, and the administration remonetised all of the pre-War DJB and government money as well, circulating unissued paper still stored in the vaults. This caused a 50% increase in the amount of money in circulation from 1947 to 1949. The administration also issued bronze and silver coins in the original pre-war denominations, minted from 1943 to 1945 in the US, but due to inflation, the coins were worth more as scrap, and many were melted into household goods and silver artefacts. As a result, it issued treasury notes instead, from 1 December 1947, in 10 and 25 sen denominations. These notes were successful as they were in Indonesian (with Dutch and Indonesian on the reverse) and stated to have been issued by 'Indonesia' (being NICA), and continued to be utilised by the Indonesian government even after independence, until 1951, when Indonesia acquired its first coins. =Local banknotes of Republic of Indonesia, 1947‚Äì1949= As the Republican government never had effective control of Indonesia beyond Java, from 1947 it legislated on 26 August 1947 that regional outposts in Sumatra and Java could issue their own money to replace the Japanese money, with exchange for true ORI envisaged when peacetime eventually enabled it, in part to inhibit the circulation of NICA gulden. At least thirty different towns and districts in Sumatra issued their own money, with around a dozen towns in Java doing so, starting with Banten in December 1947. The notes were marked with the place of issue and were in different designs from the national money. 1949‚Äì1958: Recognition of independence, and the new 'Indonesian Rupiah' =1950‚Äì1952 Indonesian independence recognised= In November 1949, the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague, brokered peace and recognition independence for the Indonesian state, as the Republik Indonesia Serikat (United States of Indonesia), a federation of states consisting of the Republic of Indonesia (republican Java and Sumatra), along with fifteen other states. The accord provided that The Netherlands was to retain economic influence over the republic until Indonesia had paid the debt run up by NICA in fighting the war with Indonesia. It was agreed that private Dutch-owned De Javasche Bank was to be restored as the central bank of Indonesia, despite resentment among Indonesian nationalists, the Indonesian-established BNI becoming a development bank. A brief issue of notes was issued by the \\"Republic Indonesia Serikat\\", from June 1950, consisting of 5 and 10 rupiah notes, but with the merger of the separate states into the Republic of Indonesia in March and April 1950, with the formal declaration of the unitary Republic of Indonesia confirmed on 17 August 1950, this money was short-lived. The Sjafruddin cut The new \\"Republik Indonesia Serikat\\" decided to address the amount of money circulating (due to the treaty the government was required to accept the NICA gulden as legal tender as well), which had reached 3.9 billion rupiah. A bewildering variety of money was in circulation, including local and national rupiah, Japanese, pre-war, and NICA Dutch moneys. Due to the large amount of currency, the minister of finance, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, sought to reduce the money supply by one half. This reform was decreed from 19 March 1950. People were to cut all of their notes of 5 gulden and up in half, with the left half to be replaced with new banknotes, and the right half for a government bond with a 3% coupon. In addition, half of all bank deposits over 400 rupiah were also to be forcibly used to buy the government bonds. As part of the exchange, local and Republik Indonesia money was also demonetised, with all old Republik Indonesia notes no longer valid after 1 May 1950. 125 Rp of the first \\"Republik Indonesia\\" rupiah (issued in Java) was exchanged for 1 Rp of new DJB notes. Higher exchange rates were in place for local currencies, some of which had been heavily devalued by the over-printing of money by the army. The recently devalued Rupiah Baru of Aceh were exchangeable at 1.75 to 1. =1951: Nationalisation of De Javasche Bank ‚Äì transformation to Bank Indonesia= Due to the desire to remove the influence of the DJB, which was dominated by Dutch and felt to be an unwanted foreign influence on the country, and to inflamed tensions caused by the refusal of the Dutch to transfer the territory of Dutch New Guinea to the Republic, the government moved to nationalise the Dutch bank. This action, announced on 30 April 1951, involved the repeal of the old Java Bank Law of 1922, preventing non-Dutch citizens from owning shares in the bank, and negotiations with the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The purchase was agreed at 120% of the value of the bank (which was valued at 9 million Dutch gulden), with Dutch opinion holding that the bank was properly an Indonesian asset, and hence nationalisation was a valid action. The nationalisation was completed on 15 December 1951, with DJB becoming a government institution of Indonesia. In addition to this act of nationalisation, on 3 October 1951, the Republic passed an Emergency Act on valid currency, to repeal the Indische Muntwet Act of 1912, which still governed valid currency in Indonesia. The consequence of the new Act was that old Dutch coins would be void for payment, and Indonesian rupiah coins would be issued with values of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 sen under the remit of the Indonesian government. Low-denomination Dutch banknotes were to be withdrawn in due course. This Act saw the first Republik Indonesia money being issued, of 1 and 2¬Ω rupiah denominations, continuing the split between denominations of under 5 gulden and 5 and above between state and central bank initiated by the Dutch. =1953‚Äì1958: The Birth of Bank Indonesia = In order that it could discontinue the issue of the resented 'De Javasche Bank' money, the government completed the Indonesianisation of DJB, with the bank becoming Bank Indonesia on 1 July 1953 via the Principal Act on Bank Indonesia 1953. The bank had responsibility for the issue of banknotes of 5 rupiah and above (as had DJB), and the first Bank Indonesia money appeared from 1953. 1959‚Äì1965: currency devaluation and spiralling inflation The economy was ravaged by inflation, prices had tripled from 1953 to 1959, and Soekarno wanted to devalue the currency. Disagreement over this policy led to the end of Loekman Hakim as Governor of Bank Indonesia on 31 July 1959: He was replaced by Soetikno Slamet. With the unwilling ex-governor replaced, the official exchange rate was devalued on 1 August 1959 by 75% from 11.4 to 45 to the US$ (the unofficial rate was around half of that, and it had been 3.8 to the dollar in 1949). In addition, the 500 Rp and 1000 Rp notes were devalued 90% on 24 August 1959 to 50 and 100 Rp. The actual notes affected were the '1946' 500 gulden, and the '1952' culture and the 'animal' notes of 500 and 1000rp notes. Thus, as of September 1959, the largest note in circulation Indonesia was of 100 rupiah. 1965‚Äì1991: the 1000 to 1 revaluation of the rupiah Rampant inflation, which was 27% in 1961, but jumped to 174% in 1962, by 1965 was 600%, had seen the largest denomination banknote increase 100-fold, from 100 rupiah in September 1959, to 1000 rupiah in May 1960, to 5,000 in October 1963 and finally 10,000 rupiah in August 1964. As a result, during the Indonesian political turmoil of 1965, the 'new rupiah' was introduced on 13 December 1965, at a rate of 1000 of the old unit. The price index at the end of 1965 had been calculated at 363 times higher than in 1958, and prices had risen approximately seven times over the previous 12 months. In real terms (i.e. with inflation taken into account), a labourer in Jakarta was estimated to have earned 40 per cent of his earnings in 1958.Far Eastern Economic Review, 13 February 1965 (cited in ) Although the devaluation in notes was 1,000 to 1, prices were reckoned to fall by only 10 times. This devaluation had the side-effect of unifying the Indonesian Rupiah with the Riau rupiah ( the West Irian rupiah lasted until 1971 ). Denominations of the new rupiah ranged from 1 sen (worthless even at issue) up to 100 rupiah, with 500 and 1000 rupiah added soon after. By 1968 the Suharto New Order had been established, and Bank Indonesia, as of 1968 was given sole right to issue banknotes (including notes below 5 rupiah) as well as coins (which had previously been the issue of the central government), which it did in a range from 1 to 1000 rupiah. In 1970, Indonesia added 5000 and 10,000 rupiah banknotes to the range in 1970, while, with inflation finally under control, coinage was re-introduced, starting at 1 rupiah, and ranging up to 100 rupiah. September 1975 saw sub-100 rupiah notes permanently withdrawn from circulation. 1992‚Äì1999: before and after the financial crisis By 1992, the rupiah was worth less than one fifth of what it had been worth when the 10,000 rupiah note had been introduced in 1970, and so a 20,000 rupiah note was produced, then the largest note ever seen in Indonesia. The Asian financial crisis of 1997‚Äì1998 reduced the rupiah's value by over 80% in a few months and was a major factor in the overthrow of President Suharto's government. The rupiah had traded at about 2000‚Äì3000 rupiah per 1 USD, but reached a low of 16,800 rupiah per dollar in June 1998. The currency, which had been relatively stable in prior years, had its value destroyed. The government did not take any action to demonetise or revalue the banknotes, \\"Direksi 1998\\" merely redesigned the 10,000 and 20,000 rupiah notes. \\"Direksi 1999\\" saw a new Soepratman design for the 50,000 rupiah, replacing the commemorative note of Suharto, who had resigned after more than 30 years as Indonesia's president in the wake of the crisis. The banknote line-up was extended with a new denomination of 100,000 rupiah in 1999, by then worth about US$12. 500 million notes of the 100,000 rupiah polymer note were printed, to all be issued within a month of November 1999. This was part of Indonesia's millennium bug preparations, lest there should be a great demand for cash after the new year. Polymer was chosen because, according to Bank Indonesia, plastic would be harder to counterfeit and would last longer. However, the notes were not popular in banks as counting machines were unable to count them accurately and there have been issues with the money sticking to one another due to the heat of the machine, and Indonesia has reverted to the use of paper notes. 2000‚Äì2005: redesigns to all of Indonesia's denominations of banknotes \\"Direksi 2000\\" brought a new 1,000 rupiah note, with the 100 and 500 rupiah notes having been discontinued due to the dramatic devaluation of Indonesia's currency. \\"Direksi 2001\\" redesigned the 5,000 rupiah, while \\"Direksi 2004\\" brought an end to the polymer 100,000 rupiah notes, replacing with a paper design, as well the issue of a new more secure 20,000 rupiah note. The most recent changes to Indonesian money were \\"Direksi 2005\\", which re-designed the 10,000 and 50,000 rupiah note. 2016: all new Indonesia's denominations of banknotes and coins On 19 December 2016, Bank Indonesia launched the all new design of rupiah banknotes and coins. They started to place the text Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia on their banknotes, rather than Bank Indonesia on the previous design. This practice was started earlier on the 2014 100,000 banknote based on the 2004 design. Plans to redenominate the Rupiah In August 2010 Bank Indonesia proposed to redenominate the rupiah by truncating the last three zero digits (dividing by 1000). The redenomination is meant to simplify daily transactions, which often run into millions of rupiah. The plan under consideration would be completed by 2015 at the soonest, but more likely by 2020. It would reduce the exchange rate with the US dollar from about 14,600 rupiah to 14.6. The plan has raised public concern that the monetary policy may devalue the currency. Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution immediately announced that the planned redenomination of the national currency would not inflict any financial losses as the measure would only strike a few zeros from the current denominations.

He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988, elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1989, and to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002. Dr. Yamamoto currently runs a research lab focused on understanding signaling and transcriptional control by nuclear receptors and continues to teach graduate courses in molecular biology and biochemistry at UCSF.  Political career  Throughout his career, Dr. Yamamoto has also been committed to public and science policy. In the 1980s he argued against the development of biological warfare by the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1986 he co-authored a book, \\"The Rebirth of American Biological Warfare:GENE WARS Military Control Over the New Genetic Technologies\\", disclosing the history of the use of biological weapons in the United States and advising against continuing these programs. Dr. Yamamoto has served on several committees that oversee the NIH peer review process which allocates funding to research investigators. He was Chairman of the NIH Center for Scientific Review Advisory Committee from 1996-2000. From 2007-2008 he co- chaired The Advisory Committee to the Director Working Group on Peer Review and the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director from 2007-2010. He had advocated for streamlining the science grant review process and for devising strategies for focusing NIH funding on research that will have the greatest impact in the field.

It has a companion dwarf galaxy. It is the most distant known grand design spiral galaxy in the universe, with a redshift of z=2.1765 ¬± 0.0001. Although commonly referred to as the oldest known grand design spiral galaxy in the universe, it is more accurately the earliest such galaxy known to exist in the universe, with a lookback time (the difference between the age of the universe now and the age of the universe at the time light left the galaxy ) of 10.7 billion years in the concordance cosmology. This time estimate means that structure seen in BX442 developed roughly 3 billion years after the Big Bang, 10 kiloparsecs (30,000 ly) in diameter, and has a mass of . Galaxy The spiral morphology of BX442, while similar to many modern-day galaxies, makes it unusual in the young universe. According to study co-author Alice E. Shapley of UCLA: The vast majority of old galaxies look like train wrecks. Our first thought was, why is this one so different, and so beautiful? The unusual spiral morphology of BX442 was discovered using images obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope by a team of astronomers led by David R. Law of the University of Toronto. While the Hubble image suggested the galaxy's spiral structure however, it didn't conclusively prove that the galaxy rotated like modern-day spiral galaxies. The team therefore used an integral-field spectrograph called OSIRIS (OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph) at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to confirm their discovery. In combination with a laser-guide-star adaptive optics system which corrects for distortions of incoming light caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere, the astronomers were able to sample the light from different parts of the galaxy. Small Doppler shifts of the light between different samples showed that BX442 was indeed a spiral disk, rotating roughly as fast as the Milky Way Galaxy, but much thicker and forming stars more rapidly. Not only was BX442 revealed to be a genuine spiral galaxy, but part of a sub-class known as 'grand-design' spirals. Most spiral galaxies have subtler features and the arms of the spiral are not necessarily well-defined. A grand design spiral galaxy has very clearly well-formed and distinct arms that significantly stretch out around the galaxy center. Of all spiral galaxies, only about 10% of them are classified as a grand design spiral galaxy. According to lead author David R. Law: The fact that this galaxy exists is astounding. Current wisdom holds that such grand-design spiral galaxies simply didn't exist at such an early time in the history of the Universe. The presence of a dwarf galaxy in the vicinity of BX442 offers a clue as to how the premature spiral structure may have emerged in what would otherwise be a somewhat chaotic lumpy collection of stars, as is the case with most other early galaxies. A recent study of one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, known as the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG), suggest that SagDEG may have helped generate some the Milky Way's spiral structure when it passed repeatedly through the plane of our galaxy over the past few hundred million years. Similarly, many of the most well-known grand design spiral galaxies (such as the Whirlpool Galaxy) also have nearby companions. A computer simulation has shown that the dwarf companion of BX442 could have had the same effect. However, the chaotic motions of the stars in the youthful BX442 suggest that, if this is the case, the present spiral structure will not be long-lived in cosmic terms, and may have disappeared within a hundred million years or so.

According to a news article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the director of the local Humane Society said he had \\"received 25 telephone calls protesting the risk taken by Queenie when she performs on her huge water skis in the Allegheny River.\\" The article also quoted the curator of mammals at the Carnegie Museum as saying \\"An elephant is provided with a natural snorkel tube. Elephants like daily baths. They draw water up in their trunks and squirt themselves. I think water-skiing would be all right if the elephant isn't afraid of it and likes to do it.\\" Additionally, the local Republican county chairman was \\"highly suspicious of any attempt to eliminate Queenie's act\\" and quoted as saying \\"It might be a Democratic plot.\\" Later years Queenie was retired from the Circus Gatti in 2003 and sent to the Wild Adventures theme park in Valdosta, Georgia. In 2011, she was euthanized because of chronic health problems. According to an obituary in the UK's The Guardian, \\"she was believed to be one of the oldest Asian elephants in North America.\\" See also * Captive elephants * Elephant cognition * List of individual elephants * Twiggy the Water-Skiing Squirrel External links * References 2011 animal deaths Animal deaths by euthanasia Individual animals in the United States Individual elephants Waterskiing Elephants in popular culture ","title":"Queenie (waterskiing elephant)"},{"id":"36478798","text":"Tom Hennesy (August 4, 1923 ‚Äì May 23, 2011) was an American actor and stuntman.

The survivors wrote the classics in the contemporary characters of their time, and these texts were later dubbed as \\"New Text\\". New Text school attained prominence in the Western Han dynasty and became the official interpretation for Confucianism, which was adopted as the official ideology by Emperor Wu of Han. Represented by Confucians such as Dong Zhongshu, this school advocated a holistic interpretation of Confucian classics and viewed Confucius as a charismatic, visionary prophet, a sage who deserved the Mandate of Heaven but did not attain kingship due to circumstances. The school competed with Old Text Confucianism in the later Han dynasty and its dominance waned as the latter became the new orthodoxy. The school fell into obscurity during the chaotic period after the fall of the Han dynasty and remained so until late Ming dynasty in the 17th century. The school was reinvigorated by a group of scholars who were dissatisfied with the popular Neo-Confucianism at the time in the late Ming dynasty. The movement gained momentum in eighteenth century with the rise of the Changzhou School of Thought. It became a major intellectual trend in Chinese philology and political ideology. As formulated by B. Elman, it was intended to offer a solution to the crisis of confidence between the Chinese state and its gentry constituency in the transition from the Qianlong era to the Jiaqing era in the Qing dynasty.Elman, 114. Ideological features (Qing dynasty) * Downplaying the role of Mencius, as a sign of opposition to Confucianism during the Song dynasty. * Much attention paid to the Gongyang Zhuan as the text revealing the true wisdom of Confucius. The reading of Chunqiu therein had prophetic overtones, which the opponents of the school condemned as superstition. * High esteem of the work of He Xiu (‰Ωï‰ºë), the Han dynasty author of the commentary to the Gongyang Zhuan (Êò•ÁßãÂÖ¨ÁæäËß£Ë©Å). * Attacks on the Zuo Zhuan as a purported Liu Xin's fabrication intended to overturn the Gongyang Zhuan. By far the most important feature of the New Text Confucianism as political movement was advocating reform (Zhuang Cunyu, Liu Fenglu), drawing from the Gongyang legalist-style ideology of \\"weighing the circumstances\\". The reforms were seen necessary since the Heshen-related crisis of power. According to Wei Yuan È≠èÊ∫ê (1794-1857), ::\\"The ancients had what pertained to the ancients. To force the ancients upon the moderns is to misrepresent the moderns. To use the moderns as the standard for the ancients is to misrepresent the ancients. If one misrepresents the present, then there can be no way to order [the contemporary world]... If one read the [medical] works of the Yellow Emperor and Shennong, and used them to kill people, one would be labelled a mediocre doctor. If one read the works of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius and used them to harm the empire, would one not be labelled a mediocre Confucian? Not only would such [incompetence] bring no benefit to any particular age, but in addition it would cause people no longer to believe in the Way of the sages.\\"Elman, 272.

Location  Just above the castle is a weir on the River Mulde. The impounded river drove a mill with four large water wheels. In 1788 its milling rights (Mahlzwang) were transferred from an older mill to this one. As a result of its exclusive milling rights, several mill tracks led to Stein. In 1912 the construction of a stately home, Wolfsbrunn House (Schloss Wolfsbrunn), began on the opposite bank of the river. The ruins of Isenburg castle are located only two kilometres upstream. Towards Langenbach were once the villages of Ober- and Niederopritz, which used to belong to Stein Castle, but were probably destroyed during the Hussite Wars.  History  The settlement of the Ore Mountains began in the 12th/13th centuries, especially along the rivers. River crossings and religious orders (Niederlassungen) were protected by fortified sites. Along the Zwickauer Mulde river, numerous castles were built. = Construction and layout = The upper ward, seen from the north Construction of the castle was probably started around 1200 on a rock made of hornblende right on the southern banks of the Mulde. This oldest part of the site form the upper ward (Oberburg) today, consisting of a round bergfried, a palas, with its great hall, and defensive walls. Its architecture still has Romanesque influences. The fortifications probably also served as an outer ward of Hartenstein Castle which had not at that time been converted into a stately residence or schloss. The remaining elements of the building are younger. The pointed round tower in the southwest may have been erected in the 14th century; the other parts of the lower ward (Niederburg) at the end of the 15th century. The bergfried of the upper ward were enhanced in the 16th century by an additional storey (Aufbau). There used to be a ford by the castle and, later, a ferry as well as various wooden and stone bridges, some of which, in old drawings, are portrayed as covered. A bridge toll was still charged until 1924. A more modern steel arch bridge (Stahlbogenbr√ºcke) was blown up in 1945 by the SS; since 1950 there has been a concrete bridge on the site. The predecessor of the old Stein Castle is located on the steep northern banks of the Zwickauer Mulde above the station. Northwest of the castle lies the remains of another very clearly visible fortification with a round mound (diameter ca. 30 metres), inner ditch (10 to 12 metres wide, 2 metres deep), rampart (ca. 5 m to 8 metres wide) and an outer ditch. On the steep slope towards the south-southwest the ditches do not run at the same depth and width. The site was mostly referred to as a motte-and-bailey castle (Turmh√ºgelburg) and the predecessor to Stein Castle, and was sometimes referred to as Ur-Stein (\\"Ancient Stein\\"). More recent research discovered, however, that it is the remains of a medieval siegeworks. = Vassals = In 1233 the castle was mentioned in the records for the first time: like the entire County of Hartenstein it came under the suzerainty of the burgraves of Meissen. Lord Heidenreich of Gr√ºnhain (Heidenricus miles de lapide, lapide meaning \\"rock castle\\") is its first known owner and he was the member of a family of the lesser nobility. The farming villages of Langenbach and Wildbach were bound by socage service. The castellans (Burgherren) of the 14th century were notorious robber barons. One in particular, a certain Conradus de lapide, is accused in a 1320 document of numerous misdeeds. From 1406 the Sch√∂nburgs and their vassals were enfeoffed with the castle. The best known story by far revolves around Kunz von Kaufungen and the Kidnapping of the Saxon Princes in 1455: Kunz is described as a worthy and righteous knight. However, he felt unfairly treated by his lord, Elector Frederick the Gentle and wanted compensation. So he kidnapped the children of the Elector, the princes Ernest and Albert with the help of two accomplices. Prince Ernest was hidden in a nearby cave, subsequently called the Prince's Cave. Kunz was caught and then beheaded in Freiburg on 14 July 1455. In 1525 ‚Äì at the time of the Great Peasants' Revolt ‚Äì the castle was besieged by its socage farmers. The farmers took advantage of the absence of their socage lord, Ernest II of Sch√∂nburg. When he returned, however, with his troops from the Battle of Frankenhausen, the siege came to an abrupt end. The farmers were severely punished and many were executed. When the Barony of Stein became independent of the County of Hartenstein the castle became a lordly residence in 1701/1702. In 1732 a great fire destroyed the lower ward, which was partially rebuilt and subsequently renovated in 1846. = Recent history = East German postage stamps from their castle series The castle was owned by the aristocratic family of the Princes of Sch√∂nburg until their estate was confiscated in 1945 as part of the socialist land reform in East Germany. Since 1954 it has housed a castle and local history museum. In the newer part of the lower ward a convalescent home was established. In 1996, following German reunification the castle and surrounding Poppen Forest were reprivatized and the castle was renovated after prince Alfred of Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein (b. 1953) bought it back. It is, however, still partly accessible to the public and still houses a museum. = Barony of Stein = The Barony of Stein became independent of the County of Hartenstein in 1701/1702, when the castle became the seat of the barony. The barony contained the following villages: * Stein Castle and the present day village of Stein in the borough of Hartenstein * the village of Wildbach in the municipality of Bad Schlema with the castle of Isenburg, destroyed in 1320 * the present day villages of Langenbach and F√§hrbr√ºcke (founded in the 19th century) in the municipality of Langenwei√übach * the two abandoned villages of Nieder- and Ober-Opritz between Stein and Langenbach In 1740 the House of Wettin agreed a recess with the lords of Sch√∂nburg, by which the Sch√∂nburgs had to recognise the suzerainty of the Saxon royal house over the hitherto imperially immediate baronies of Waldenburg, Glauchau, Lichtenstein, Hartenstein (the lesser county) and Stein. The five recess lordship remained under Sch√∂nburg rule until 1878. Thereafter they were fully integrated into the Kingdom of Saxony. The Barony of Stein and the lesser County of Hartenstein (without the district of L√∂√ünitz) went to the Amtshauptmannschaft of Zwickau.

The show is set in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Plot The story starts with the two friends Shivani and Mansi. Mansi stays with her parents, elder brother (Kunal) and younger sister (Kavita) while Shivani stays with her parents. Shivani has an elder sister, Devyani, who is married to a businessman. Their marriage was arranged but is not a happy one as Devyani's husband does not like her penning up poems. Kunal is married to his heartthrob, Naina. Shivani runs a shop named \\"Shagun Shaadi Ka\\" with the help of dwarfs -- Karan and Arjun. The shop sells and caters everything related to weddings. Shivani and Mansi are the best of friends since childhood even after having small quarrels. However, the biggest one was when Devyani leaves her husband and comes to stay with her family in Udaipur from Kankroli. Mansi says that some arranged marriages may not be happy as the couple may have problems. Shivani says that her sister can never ever have a problem and leaves. Shivani plans to leave the city and shift elsewhere to save her from offensive sayings from neighbours and as she has no one left in the city. Shivani leaves a note for Mansi as she is unaware of this. Mansi learns that Shivani has sold her shop and has moved elsewhere and unable to find a note she thinks that she left for her. The story takes a three-year leap after which Mansi's marriage has been fixed with a kind-hearted and similar kind of man like her: Anup Sisodiya. Anup's younger brother Sahil is in love with a girl and that girl is perhaps Shivani. Mansi and Shivani remain unaware of the fact. However, Shivani tries to meet Mansi again, when she comes to meet Sahil in Udaipur but in vain. Anup and Mansi's marriage happens whereas Sahil and Shivani have a registered marriage. Shivani and Mansi become aware of the fact that they are daughters-in-law of the same house. Sahil's mother Rajlaxmi doesn't accept Sahil's marriage, so Sahil marries Shivani again, in front of his family. Shivani and Mansi solve every problem in their marriage.

Chitrali food has a regional variance in contrast to many other cuisines of Pakistan. The food of Chitral is very similar to the cuisine in neighboring Gilgit-Baltistan. Pilaf usually of beef which is preboiled until it is extremely tender is an essential dish at large gatherings and the meat is served lying on top of the rice. Salty buttered tea is popular in Chitral as is green tea and very bitter black tea called Troq Chai.(sour tea) Honey, cheese and fresh fruits also make up a staple part of the Chitrali diet as these products are part of the local mountain agricultural tradition. The influence of Punjab is seen in the popularity of lamb and chicken karahi. Uzbek dumplings or mantu are also very popular. Dried apricots (translkhwchambor}}) and mulberries () are both an important part of the local diet and are also exported to other parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Breads A loaf of tikki bread served with milk tea. Tikki A thick leavened loaf baked over coals in a special mold. Because of its hard crust it can be stored for weeks. It is popularly eaten at breakfast or in the afternoon. Khesta A bread made from a liquid batter which has been allowed to ferment and is cooked on a griddle. It has a slightly sour taste and a spongy texture. Phulka The standard South Asian Chapatti. Rishiki Thin pancakes or crepes made of a batter consisting of whole wheat flour, water and eggs. They can be either savoury or sweet. Sweet is served with honey and cottage cheese. Dry Meat Dishes Rondijhzu Barbecued or spit roasted goat or lamb seasoned with only salt. Taaw Kahak Chicken which is roasted on a griddle with additional pressure applied, usually by placing a rock or heavy pot over it. Very dry and crispy. Taaw Machhi Fish cooked in the same pressure grilling method as taaw kahak, especially brown trout, rainbow trout and schizothorax. Soups A Chitrali noodle soup. One of the most important elements in Chitrali cuisine is the importance of soups, usually eaten as the main dish accompanied by bread and fruit. The cold climate of Chitral is one of the factors contributing to the popularity of soups in Chitrali cuisine. Kalli A noodle soup made with minced beef and hand cut whole wheat noodles. It is very similar to the Central Asian laghman and is probably of Chinese origin. Leganu Made with tiny lentil-flour dumplings and unlike most Chitrali cuisine it is often quite spicy. Lajhaik Similar to the Kashmiri hareesa, it is a thick soup of whole wheat and barley grains slowly stewed together with lamb, beef or duck. Khhamalogh A soup consisting of the skulls of sheep, goats or cattle crushed and slowly simmered for many hours. Kawirogh A light soup made with dried wild capers and meat. Very popular in the summer as it is supposed to have a cooling and blood thinning affect. Indigenous Dishes Ghalmandi with cottage cheese and herbs Ghalmandi A dish of layered flat breads with a filling of cottage cheese, coriander and chives and covered in melted butter and walnut oil. Cheer Aa Shapik Similar to ghalmandi, but with a white sauce, similar to bechamel replacing the cottage cheese. Qalaibat A dish made by cooking whole wheat flour with lamb fat. Shroshrp A type of unsweetened halwa made from germinated wheat grain flour. Pushur Tikki A loaf of tikki bread baked with a mince meat filling, a type of meat pie. Other variations include Phhenak Tikki which is filled with cottage cheese and Pandir Tikki filled with matured cheese. A vegetarian version with a spinach filling is Shaakh Mujhzi.

The advantage of the use of a micro-compounder for R&D; are significant: it gives faster, yet reliable results with much smaller samples and at much less investment costs, thus speeding up the innovation process in R&D; of polymer materials, pharmaceutical, biomedical and nutritional applications. Micro-compounding is typically performed with a table top, twin screw micro-compounder or -extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml. With such small volumes it is almost impossible to have sufficient mixing in a continuous extruder. Therefore, state of the art micro-compounders have a batch mode (recirculation) and a conical shape. The L/D of a continuous twin screw extruder is mimicked in a batch micro-compounder by the recirculation mixing time, which is controlled by a manual valve. With this valve the recirculation can be interrupted to unload the formulation in either a strand, or an injection moulder, a film device or a fiber line. Typical recirculation times are 1-3 min, dependent on the ease of dispersive and distributive mixing of the formulation. Benefits With such table top laboratory equipment it is now also possible to produce films, fibers and test samples (rods, rings, tablets) from mixtures as small as 5 ml in less than 10 min. By the small footprint less lab space is needed than for a parallel twin screw extruder. Because of these benefits screening of optimum formulations in R&D; is really feasible and affordable.

It is the headquarters of the African Union and plays host to the biannual AU summits. It also serves as a conference center for African and diaspora businesses. The main building is tall and it is the tallest building in Addis Ababa. Its cost was US$200 million funded by the Chinese government. Construction The main hall of the AUCC. The wooden veneer on the walls was imported from China. The main building was designed and built by a collaboration of Tongji University, China State Construction Engineering and the China Architecture and Design Research Group, with the US$200 million budget donated by the Chinese government. The design of the site resembles two hands in embrace, symbolising Africa‚ÄìChina relations, and includes both traditional African art and modern pan-African symbology, with the height of the 99.9 meter main tower a reference to the adoption of the Sirte Declaration founding the African Union on 9 September 1999. However, the majority of materials used in the construction were Chinese, and the art on the walls was produced in China. Construction took three years with a workforce of 1,200, roughly half of whom were Ethiopian and half of whom were Chinese. The building was inaugurated on 28 January 2012. The headquarters of the AU Peace and Security Council, part of the AUCC compound, were built separately as a ‚Ç¨30 million gift from the German government, under the auspices of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, and opened in October 2016. Unlike the main AUCC building, the Peace and Security Building was constructed by Ethiopian contractors using local materials. The AUCC is built on the site of the former Alem Bekagn prison, used during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, and subsequently by Haile Selassie and Mengistu Haile Mariam to house political prisoners. The decision to construct the AU headquarters on this former prison grounds was criticized by survivors, as they were disappointed by the AU's lack of acknowledgement of the torture used on the site. Facilities The office tower of the AUCC The headquarters comprise a 20-storey office building, housing the administrative departments of the African Union Commission; a 2,505-person-capacity plenary chamber; and a sub-conference building with 32 conference rooms. Both the AUCC and the Peace and Security Building are designed to be environmentally-friendly, using passive cooling to control the buildings' climates in the heat of Addis Ababa without high energy consumption. The complex also contains the African Union Grand Hotel, funded by the Ethiopian-Saudi billionaire Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi and managed by Westin, which is primarily for hosting presidents and diplomats during AU summits. Espionage allegations In January 2018, six years after the opening of the AUCC, a report in the African edition of Le Monde, confirmed by the Financial Times, claimed that the AU's IT department had discovered in early 2017 that the site's computer systems were connecting nightly to servers in Shanghai and uploading AU files as well as recordings from microphones embedded in the walls and furniture. The building's computer system was subsequently removed and the AU refused a Chinese offer to configure the replacement system. Le Monde alleged that the AU had then covered up the hack to protect Chinese interests in the continent. The Chinese government denied that they bugged the building, with China's ambassador to the AU, Kuang Weilin, calling the article ‚Äúridiculous and preposterous‚Äù and that the allegations were intended to put pressure between Beijing and the continent. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said that he did not believe the French media report. Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of the African Union Commission, said the allegations in the Le Mondes report were false. \\"These are totally false allegations and I believe that we are completely disregarding them.\\" Incoming Chairperson of the African Union Paul Kagame said he did not know anything about it.

He and his brother Augustus arrived in Adelaide on the brig Elizabeth Buckham on 22 June 1843, and took the place of W. C. Darling in the Commissariat Department under administrator Sir Henry E. Fox Young, acting as his private secretary and holding the position of Deputy Assistant Commissary General and Auditor General, was promoted to Assistant Director in 1847, then Private Secretary to the Lieutenant Governor in May 1849, and at the same time appointed to the Legislative Council, but almost immediately relinquishing both when he was made acting Colonial Treasurer, reverting to Private Secretary in 1851. In 1850 his assistant William Edward Beddome was convicted of embezzling ¬£4,000, which could only have happened because of lax security on Maturin's part. In 1857 the Commissariat Department was abolished, and on 1 June 1857 Maturin was relieved by Mr. Deputy Commissioner Monk, and retired on half-pay. He returned to England and was appointed to the Commissariat Department, also to a seat on the London directorate of the Bank of South Australia. In November 1857 he was appointed Chief Commissioner of the newly formed Adelaide Waterworks Commission. He successfully stood for Light in the South Australian House of Assembly and in July 1858 he resigned his Commission, to be replaced by G. M. Waterhouse. Before he could take his seat however, he was appointed Land Titles Commissioner and resigned from Parliament, taking effect in September 1858. David Shannon won the ensuing by- election. He accepted a position in London as Deputy Commissary General with a seat on the London board of the Bank of South Australia and left the State in February 1859. In 1863 he was transferred to Hong Kong, then Aldershot in 1865. He was appointed head of the Control Department in Ireland then in 1871 Director of Supplies and Transports in the War Department following the retirement of Sir William Tyrone Powers KCB. (1819- ) He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath sometime around 1870. Family He married Charlotte Owen Bagot (1824 ‚Äì 22 October 1893), youngest daughter of C. H.

Augustus Maturin Augustus Scott Maturin emigrated on the voyage as his brother William. In 1847 he was appointed second clerk in the Audit Office. On 18 September 1852 he married Harriet Louisa Evans of Bath, Somerset. In 1853 his appointment as second Inspector of Police created such controversy that he resigned, to be replaced by George Hamilton of the Bullion Office, and he was made clerk in the Bullion Office, replacing George Hamilton. In June 1854 he became Bookkeeper of the Goolwa Railway, then in November 1854 he was appointed to the courts of Port Elliot, Goolwa and Encounter Bay. In January 1855 he was charged with the 1854 theft of a gold ingot valued at ¬£57 belonging to Frederick Burt while at the Bullion Office. He pleaded guilty, explaining he had diverted the ingot to cover for a discrepancy. Despite character references from a number of influential people, he was sentenced to a year's imprisonment.

His main research, teaching and consulting interests focus on migration and social integration. Heckmann contributed significantly to the institutionalisation of migration and integration research in Germany through the launch of the research committee Migration and Ethnic Minorities (1985) within the German Sociological Society and the co-founding of the European Forum for Migration Studies in 1993 as one of the first research institutes on migration and integration in Germany. Moreover, he established migration studies in the sociology department of the University of Bamberg.Interview by Prof. Heckmann (19 July 2012)  Biography  Heckmann studied sociology, history and economics in M√ºnster, Kiel, Lawrence, Kansas, United States and Erlangen- Nuremberg. His teachers included Helmut Schelsky (M√ºnster), Gerhard Wurzbacher (Kiel; Erlangen-Nuremberg) and Gary M. Maranell (Lawrence). As a Fulbright Scholarship student, he received a Master of Arts in Sociology from the State University of Kansas in Lawrence (1967). While being assistant lecturer at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, he earned a Ph. D. with an empirical study on socialization processes (1972). Heckmann was a project leader at the Research Centre for Social Sciences at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and was also a lecturer at the University of Bamberg. In 1980, he gained his habilitation at the University of Bamberg with a study on immigration in Germany. In 1982, he was appointed professor at the University of Economics and Politics in Hamburg, but returned to the University of Bamberg in 1992. Since the founding of the European Forum for Migration Studies, Heckmann has been a consultant to the German Federal Government, the European Commission, to local and municipal governments, foundation (non-profit) and civil society organizations.  Contributions to research on migration and integration  Having worked within the fields of socialization, family research and history of sociology, Heckmann began to focus on migration and integration research with his habilitation (The Federal Republic: A country of immigration?, Klett- Cotta, Stuttgart, 1981). Socio-structural analysis evidenced a status of belonging of the so-called guest workers; in addition historical and internationally comparative analysis demonstrated that Germany had been transformed into a country of immigration. Conceptual and theoretical works of Heckmann contribute to a theory of minorities, to the concept of ethnic colony, to the dimensional analysis of integration processes and to the theory of prejudice as both attitude and ideology. Much of this found in his book ‚ÄúEthnische Minderheiten, Volk und Nation. Soziologie inter-ethnischer Beziehungen (Enke 1992). Since the foundation of the European Forum for Migration Studies, Heckman has led numerous empirical research as well as practice-oriented projects.University Centre of the Westfjords (19 July 2012) The form's projects mainly concern migration theory, migration statistics, migration politics, citizenship, urbanL√ºken-Kla√üen, Doris, Heckmann, Friedrich: Intercultural policies in European Cities (19 July 2012) and educational integration, studies on discrimination as well as evaluations of implemented policies and measures.

It was a long and unfinished project, sometimes identified with Schelling's philosophical output from 1809 to 1827, the period beginning with his Freiheitsschrift. The Weltalter fragments Despite Schelling's years of work on the project, no definitive version of the Weltalter emerged. There were three drafts in a series: the later versions were not complete and are often referred to as fragments. A work System der Weltalter from 1827/8 consists of Munich lecture notes taken by Ernst von Lasaulx from Schelling, who was at that time a student also of Franz von Baader and Joseph G√∂rres.:de:s:ADB:Lasaulx, Ernst von The manuscripts, which no longer exist, are assigned to the periods 1811, 1813 and 1814/5. The 1814/5 manuscript was published posthumously; copies of the other two manuscripts, made by Manfred Schr√∂ter before the destruction of the originals by bombing in World War II, were published in 1946, with some of Schelling's project notes. Influences Schelling works in the Weltalter with and from a theological idea of creation. He is influenced by the formulations of Jakob Boehme, and in general the Bible. Taken as a Romantic theory of the anima mundi, the Weltalter writings call on, at least superficially, mysticism (both Jewish and Christian) and natural philosophy. Philosophical formulation Aside from the language used, there are a number of formulations explaining the problems Schelling was tackling in the Weltalter project. According to a 2010 paper, > When Schelling sat down to write the Ages of the World he had a large number > of seemingly contradictory philosophical commitments to reconcile. He wanted > to avoid dualism and yet acknowledge the essential and irreducible roles of > both spirit and matter. He wanted to give a law-like description of the > creation of the world and yet preserve divine freedom. He wanted to treat > God as perfect and self-sufficient and yet also account for the motive > underlying God's decision to create the world.

Trade between the two nations totaled over $1 billion in 2017. Additionally, Chinese companies have contributed significantly to the building of infrastructure in Uganda. China also owns about 20% of Uganda's debt, equivalent to about $1.6 billion. The Ugandan ambassador to China is Crispus Kiyonga. The Chinese ambassador to Uganda is . Diplomatic history Since Uganda's independence in 1962, diplomatic relationships have existed between the two nations. China was one of the first nations to recognize the newly independent nation. In 1971, Uganda was one of 76 nations that voted in favor of Resolution 2758 restoring UN membership to the Chinese government. Following Yoweri Museveni's rise to power in 1986, the two nation's have developed closer ties. The two nations have signed multiple cultural cooperation agreements, exchanging student and medical teams. Relationships between the two nations have been strengthened by a policy of non-interference in political affairs. Following the passage of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014, Western criticism of the Ugandan government and Museveni's presidency increased. Many nations withdrew economic aid and support. China's policy of political non-involvement allowed them to take on the role of supplying aid and infrastructure to Uganda. Economic relations Trade between China and Uganda has also increased under Museveni's presidency. Even within the last 10 years, the amount of trade between the two nations has more than quadrupled, from around $230 million in 2008 to over $1 billion in 2018. The majority of this trade is Chinese exports to Uganda, which account for about $850 million in trade. China's largest exports are machinery and electrical equipment. Uganda's major exports to China include many raw goods such as hides, oils, and seeds. Additionally, Uganda has emerged as a potential market for many Chinese businesses, both state-owned and private. These businesses include oil and construction, as well as smaller stores and factories for electronics, clothes, and other consumer goods. Infrastructure and debt China and Chinese companies have also contributed to many infrastructure projects in Uganda. Chinese construction companies have won contracts for many major infrastructure projects, such as the Mandela National Stadium and the country's largest hydroelectric dam at Karuma Falls. More recently, Chinese companies are in charge of the construction of an express highway connecting the major city of Entebbe to the capital, Kampala. The Ugandan government also utilizes Chinese technology for small and large- scale agribusiness projects, with over 40 Chinese agricultural scientists having taken part in planning these projects in Uganda since 2012. China also supports infrastructure within Uganda through loans. Uganda currently has $1.6 billion in loans to China. These loans largely finance major infrastructure projects. These loans typically pay for Chinese contracting work on these mega-projects. Public opinion in Uganda Opinions vary in Uganda on the role China plays in the local economy. According to a 2015 survey by Afrobarometer, 58% of Ugandans believe China has a positive influence on Uganda, compared to only 7% saying negative. The largest positives of China's influence were China's investment in infrastructure, China's business investment, and the cost of Chinese products. By far the largest source of negative opinion was the quality of Chinese products. Public opinion of Chinese influence has improved in China since 2010. Ugandan business owners have expressed opposition to Chinese influence in the country. Shopkeepers and creators of local goods have difficulty competing with the price of Chinese exports. In addition, local construction companies introduced a bill that would force the national government to prioritize local construction companies in the completion of government projects. This bill was vetoed, with MPs citing the inability of Ugandan construction companies to handle the scale of large infrastructure projects. Some Chinese business, particularly smaller private businesses, have also felt the effect of increased regulation and scrutiny from local government officials. Research on relations between the two nations and cultures found that the major sources of animosity between the two nations include China's state-capitalism model and Ugandans' experiences with Chinese shopkeepers and employers who may harbor racial bias. =Incidents= In 2014, China sentenced two Ugandans to death for drug trafficking in Guangdong province. Although the Ugandan government claimed that the incidents did not impact diplomatic relationships between the two nations, many Ugandan citizens and MPs were angered by the perceived violation of sovereignty and human rights. In 2018, many Chinese businesses in Ugandan industrial parks were vandalized and robbed, prompting President Museveni to increase security presence in these regions.

An extract from the cartoon was featured the following year in Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage; the film's opening credits thank Disney for giving permission. Plot While Cock Robin (caricatured after Bing Crosby) serenades the Mae West-esque Jenny Wren, an unseen assailant shoots an arrow into Cock Robin's heart and he falls to the ground, giving the other birds in the tree the impression he has been shot and killed. The police arrive at the scene and arrest a Harpo Marx-like cuckoo, an Edward G. Robinson-inspired sparrow (possibly an homage to the original story) and a Stepin Fetchit-based blackbird as suspects. The next day a trial is held over the identity of Cock Robin's assassin, with an owl serving as the judge and a parrot as the prosecutor, interrogating the suspects and showing Cock Robin's body as evidence. The blackbird protests his innocence, while the sparrow refuses to squawk. The cuckoo doesn't know either, but continually points to the judge and the parrot and even himself, showing he is indeed \\"cuckoo\\". Everyone is astounded that no one knows who murdered Cock Robin. At that moment, Jenny Wren arrives and demands that she see justice done for her Cock Robin. Eventually, the judge declares that all three suspects be hanged as they don't know which of them is guilty. Just then, an arrow strikes the judge's hat, and its owner, Cock Robin's supposed killer, is revealed to be Cupid. He reveals that though he did it, Robin isn't dead at all; he simply fell for Jenny Wren and is currently unconscious from landing on his head, the arrow he was shot with is in his armpit. Jenny revives Robin and they kiss, to the excitement of the jury.

Mexican Republicans were victorious and retook control of the city. The Republican forces consisted only of the Tabasquian militia from the surrounding areas ranging between 300 and 1,100 men, only half of whom were equipped with firearms the others fought with machetes. Monument in honor of the battle depicting Gregorio M√©ndez San Juan Bautista, Capital of Tabasco was seized by the Imperialist forces on June 13, 1863, by General Marin. Dating from December 2, 1863, the Republican forces started attacking the state capital from several points. Second Lieutenant Juan Morales with 30 men stood on the banks of Tinto, cut off all communication with San Juan Bautista and recruited soldiers, commander Narciso S√°enz positioned himself in San Juan Buenavista with his forty volunteers from Cunduac√°n and the national guard of C√°rdenas, Colonel Lino Merino in Pueblo Nuevo de las Raices and Colonel Pedro Fuentes in Mazaltepec. From these points, Republicans began attacking the French in the state capital. On January 1, 1864, Don Pedro Fuentes along with three dragoons broke into the Esquipulas church and rang its bells in defiance to the enemy fire, and following a brief shootout, returned unharmed to his camp. On the 3rd he reached the plazuela del √Åguila driving away some French. On the 7th Commander Narciso S√°enz prepared to march 400 infantry and 60 cavalry and a mountain cannon from Mazaltepec, and settled in Tierra Colorada on the 9th, Pedro Fuentes moved to Atasta, meanwhile Lino Merino and Juan Morales unified their forces and established headquarters in Mazaltepec. At three in the morning on the 14th the Zaragoza section (the right), waded through a forest track to arrive directly on the left flank of the main square, taking positions in the La Punta district, the companies 1st, 2nd \\"Hidalgo\\" and auxiliaries from Juchitan, marched to join the Valle section in Tierra Colorada, which would occupy the bottom of the street Loma de los Perez, which was at the French right flank. At five o'clock in the morning, after a cavalry reconnaissance, the Republican center was detached on the National Road, to take up positions against the French center, covered by the mountain artillery composed of three pieces, two from the 4th and one from the 3rd. The rear guard was defended by a line of siege artillery behind them. The reserve constituted of the Castillo section in the Campo Santo, at the bottom of the hill of the same name. The Mexican scout cavalry was discovered at the gates of the city by the French vanguard commanded by the former commander Antonio Castillo. The first series of shots wounded two of the Mexican lancers. The events quickly turned against the defenders whereas the cavalry company completely disrupted the Imperialist garrison, four soldiers and commander Castillo were left dead, nine taken prisoners, including an officer, who was condemned to death by martial laws. The Imperialists concentrated the defense of San Juan Bautista around the \\"Principal\\" and the Governor's House that were barricaded and perforated with loopholes from top to bottom. These buildings were adjacent to the Comercio Street, which prolonged the trenchline squarewise. These blocks was linked internally by tunnels whose exit led to the Comercio Street. The house north of the market, which had walls pierced with loopholes onto the Esquipulas Street was occupied by the Republican center. The first defense line was formed by buildings and trenches, with the exception of the Romano tradehouse on the Aurora street, which was equipped by light weapons. The second line were trenches, comprising four blocks immediately to the river, and besides that, the last line followed the flow of the Grijalva and J√≠caro rivulets, connecting all together by ditches and exterior walls defended by loopholes. The Republican Army fully sealed the siege on the town starting from January 18 and installed five of the smaller culverins and two 24 pounder cannon around San Juan Bautista. The besieged were entrenched in the streets, along the coast, under the covering protection of two French steam gunships La Tourmente and La Pique; the Pailebot Pizarro, the steamboats Corina, Aurora and Diana and the steam gunships Conservador and Guaraguso, from the Mexican side. Eduardo Gonz√°lez Ar√©valo's troops counted 350 Mexican riflemen, and about 250 French marines. On the first days of the siege the beleaguered Imperialists made some breakout attempts, without any significant egress. It is worth to note that during the siege more Imperialist soldiers were wounded by machete cuts than gunshots. On January 19, General Manuel Diaz de la Vega as the newly appointed Imperial Governor of the Regency and surrogate of Ar√©valo was transported to San Juan Bautista from la Frontera by Conservador and Guaraguso on the river. His convoy was attacked by a band of 30 liberals whereas some Imperialist were injured among them was their Captain Gabriel Escoffi√©. Immediately, on the 20th, the new imperial governor requested the surrender of the Republicans by offering guarantees and compensations. He was declined and subsequently a clash broke out between the Republican center and the besieged ones. Commander Francisco Ram√≠rez repelled the sneak attack and took 18-20 prisoners who were deported to Atasta. On February 5, the garrison received a reinforcement of 280 creole soldiers from Martinique, while on 12th about 50-60 retreating Imperialist soldiers from Palenque led by Pedro Pocurrul sought refuge at Vega's camp. High resolution contemporary map of San Juan Bautista (note that some streets were renamed after the reoccupation) The Republicans advanced forward house by house in close fights as the French was tearing down the buildings while retreating. The Republicans, with a 24 pounder bombard hit the Tourmente nine times until they ran out of ammunition. They collected the cannonballs of the enemy fire from the ground to recharge their own battery. When the Republicans reached the fortified houses and barricades of the defenders, the French considered to give up the city. On February 11, 1864, Tabasco forces begin an assault on \\"The Principal\\" where there were entrenched French troops. From three o'clock the Zaragoza section was ordered to advance in order to cut the enemy from the \\"casa de Paillet\\". While this was taking place, two sections of Carden√°s raided the house. Under the covering fire by the Zaragoza section the Castillo guerrillas attacked the French guardpost at the entrance. The assault lasted over an hour, but the result was the occupation of the Principal. As the \\"Casa Fuerte\\" remained the last resort of the defenders right at the river, the Republicans decided to attack with heavy artillery from the hill of the Encarnaci√≥n. Having seen the shelling the French auxiliaries and General Vegas' Mexicans thus evacuated themselves to the ships and sailed to Laguna. The fleeing garrison left big amount of supplies behind among these were two pieces of 68-pound artillery, one 12-pound and 4-pounder culverins, an 8 pounder cannon and its rotating platform, three small 2-pounder pieces, 90 firearms with bayonets, 8 lances, 77 cans of shrapnel, a barrel of grenades and five horses.

The two terms \\"human factors\\" and \\"ergonomics\\" are essentially synonymous.ISO 6385 defines \\"ergonomics\\" and the \\"study of human factors\\" similarly, as the \\"scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles and methods to design to optimize overall human performance.\\" The International Ergonomics Association defines ergonomics or human factors as follows:International Ergonomics Association. Human Factors/Ergonomics (HF/E). Website. Retrieved 7 June 2020. Human factors is employed to fulfill the goals of occupational health and safety and productivity. It is relevant in the design of such things as safe furniture and easy-to-use interfaces to machines and equipment. Proper ergonomic design is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. Human factors and ergonomics are concerned with the \\"fit\\" between the user, equipment, and environment or \\"fitting a job to a person\\". It accounts for the user's capabilities and limitations in seeking to ensure that tasks, functions, information, and the environment suit that user. To assess the fit between a person and the used technology, human factors specialists or ergonomists consider the job (activity) being done and the demands on the user; the equipment used (its size, shape, and how appropriate it is for the task), and the information used (how it is presented, accessed, and changed). Ergonomics draws on many disciplines in its study of humans and their environments, including anthropometry, biomechanics, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, industrial design, information design, kinesiology, physiology, cognitive psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and space psychology. Etymology The term ergonomics (from the Greek ·ºîœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ, meaning \\"work\\", and ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ, meaning \\"natural law\\") first entered the modern lexicon when Polish scientist Wojciech Jastrzƒôbowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy, opartej na prawdach poczerpniƒôtych z Nauki Przyrody (The Outline of Ergonomics; i.e. Science of Work, Based on the Truths Taken from the Natural Science). The French scholar Jean-Gustave Courcelle- Seneuil, apparently without knowledge of Jastrzƒôbowski's article, used the word with a slightly different meaning in 1858. The introduction of the term to the English lexicon is widely attributed to British psychologist Hywel Murrell, at the 1949 meeting at the UK's Admiralty, which led to the foundation of The Ergonomics Society. He used it to encompass the studies in which he had been engaged during and after World War II.Hywel Murrell The expression human factors is a predominantly North American term which has been adopted to emphasize the application of the same methods to non-work-related situations. A \\"human factor\\" is a physical or cognitive property of an individual or social behavior specific to humans that may influence the functioning of technological systems. The terms \\"human factors\\" and \\"ergonomics\\" are essentially synonymous.  Domains of specialization  Ergonomics comprise three main fields of research: physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics. There are many specializations within these broad categories. Specializations in the field of physical ergonomics may include visual ergonomics. Specializations within the field of cognitive ergonomics may include usability, human‚Äìcomputer interaction, and user experience engineering. Some specializations may cut across these domains: Environmental ergonomics is concerned with human interaction with the environment as characterized by climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, light. The emerging field of human factors in highway safety uses human factor principles to understand the actions and capabilities of road users ‚Äì car and truck drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. ‚Äì and use this knowledge to design roads and streets to reduce traffic collisions. Driver error is listed as a contributing factor in 44% of fatal collisions in the United States, so a topic of particular interest is how road users gather and process information about the road and its environment, and how to assist them to make the appropriate decision. New terms are being generated all the time. For instance, \\"user trial engineer\\" may refer to a human factors professional who specializes in user trials. Although the names change, human factors professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity. According to the International Ergonomics Association, within the discipline of ergonomics there exist domains of specialization. = Physical ergonomics = Physical ergonomics: the science of designing user interaction with equipment and workplaces to fit the user. Physical ergonomics is concerned with human anatomy, and some of the anthropometric, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics as they relate to physical activity. Physical ergonomic principles have been widely used in the design of both consumer and industrial products for optimizing performance and to preventing / treating work-related disorders by reducing the mechanisms behind mechanically induced acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries / disorders. Madeleine, P., Vangsgaard, S., de Zee, M., Kristiansen, M. V., Verma, R., Kersting, U. G., Villumsen, M., & Samani, A. (2014). Ergonomics in sports and at work. In Proceedings, 11th International Symposium on Human Factors in Organisational Design and Management, ODAM, & 46th Annual Nordic Ergonomics Society Conference, NES, 17-20 August 2014, Copenhagen, Denmark (pp. 57-62). International Ergonomics Association. Risk factors such as localized mechanical pressures, force and posture in a sedentary office environment lead to injuries attributed to an occupational environment. Physical ergonomics is important to those diagnosed with physiological ailments or disorders such as arthritis (both chronic and temporary) or carpal tunnel syndrome. Pressure that is insignificant or imperceptible to those unaffected by these disorders may be very painful, or render a device unusable, for those who are. Many ergonomically designed products are also used or recommended to treat or prevent such disorders, and to treat pressure-related chronic pain. One of the most prevalent types of work-related injuries is musculoskeletal disorder. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) result in persistent pain, loss of functional capacity and work disability, but their initial diagnosis is difficult because they are mainly based on complaints of pain and other symptoms. Every year, 1.8 million U.S. workers experience WRMDs and nearly 600,000 of the injuries are serious enough to cause workers to miss work. Certain jobs or work conditions cause a higher rate of worker complaints of undue strain, localized fatigue, discomfort, or pain that does not go away after overnight rest. These types of jobs are often those involving activities such as repetitive and forceful exertions; frequent, heavy, or overhead lifts; awkward work positions; or use of vibrating equipment. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has found substantial evidence that ergonomics programs can cut workers' compensation costs, increase productivity and decrease employee turnover. Mitigation solutions can include both short term and long-term solutions. Short and long-term solutions involve awareness training, positioning of the body, furniture and equipment and ergonomic exercises. Sit-stand stations and computer accessories that provide soft surfaces for resting the palm as well as split keyboards are recommended. Additionally, resources within the HR department can be allocated to provide assessments to employees to ensure the above listed criteria is met. Therefore, it is important to gather data to identify jobs or work conditions that are most problematic, using sources such as injury and illness logs, medical records, and job analyses. Ergonomically correct Keyboard Innovative workstations that are being tested include sit-stand desks, treadmill desks, pedal devices and cycle ergometers. In multiple studies these new workstations resulted in decreased waist circumference and improved psychological well being. However a significant number of additional studies have seen no marked improvement in health outcomes. = Cognitive ergonomics = Cognitive ergonomics is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. (Relevant topics include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human-system and Human-Computer Interaction design.) Epidemiological studies show a correlation between the time one spends sedentary and their cognitive function such as lowered mood and depression. = Organizational ergonomics = Organizational ergonomics is concerned with the optimization of socio-technical systems, including their organizational structures, policies, and processes. (Relevant topics include communication, crew resource management, work design, work systems, design of working times, teamwork, participatory design, community ergonomics, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual organizations, telework, and quality management.) History of the field =In ancient societies= Some have stated that human ergonomics began with Australopithecus prometheus (also known as ‚Äúlittle foot‚Äù), a primate who created handheld tools out of different types of stone, clearly distinguishing between tools based on their ability to perform designated tasks. The foundations of the science of ergonomics appear to have been laid within the context of the culture of Ancient Greece. A good deal of evidence indicates that Greek civilization in the 5th century BC used ergonomic principles in the design of their tools, jobs, and workplaces. One outstanding example of this can be found in the description Hippocrates gave of how a surgeon's workplace should be designed and how the tools he uses should be arranged. The archaeological record also shows that the early Egyptian dynasties made tools and household equipment that illustrated ergonomic principles. =In industrial societies= Bernardino Ramazzini was one of the first people to systematically study the illness that resulted from work earning himself the nickname ‚Äúfather of occupational medicine‚Äù. In the late 1600s and early 1700s Ramazzini visited many worksites where he documented the movements of laborers and spoke to them about their ailments. He then published ‚ÄúDe Morbis Artificum Diatriba‚Äù (Italian for Diseases of Workers) which detailed occupations, common illnesses, remedies. In the 19th century, Frederick Winslow Taylor pioneered the \\"scientific management\\" method, which proposed a way to find the optimum method of carrying out a given task. Taylor found that he could, for example, triple the amount of coal that workers were shoveling by incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the fastest shoveling rate was reached.Nikolayevich Myasishchev estia.com/library/1358216/the-history-of-human-factors-and- ergonomics The History of Human Factors and Ergonomics, David Meister Frank and Lillian Gilbreth expanded Taylor's methods in the early 1900s to develop the \\"time and motion study\\". They aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions. By applying this approach, the Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5, allowing bricklayers to increase their productivity from 120 to 350 bricks per hour. However, this approach was rejected by Russian researchers who focused on the well being of the worker. At the First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour (1921) Vladimir Bekhterev and Vladimir Nikolayevich Myasishchev criticised Taylorism. Bekhterev argued that \\"The ultimate ideal of the labour problem is not in it [Taylorism], but is in such organisation of the labour process that would yield a maximum of efficiency coupled with a minimum of health hazards, absence of fatigue and a guarantee of the sound health and all round personal development of the working people.\\" Myasishchev rejected Frederick Taylor's proposal to turn man into a machine. Dull monotonous work was a temporary necessity until a corresponding machine can be developed. He also went on to suggest a new discipline of \\"ergology\\" to study work as an integral part of the re-organisation of work. The concept was taken up by Myasishchev's mentor, Bekhterev, in his final report on the conference, merely changing the name to \\"ergonology\\" =In aviation= Prior to World War I, the focus of aviation psychology was on the aviator himself, but the war shifted the focus onto the aircraft, in particular, the design of controls and displays, and the effects of altitude and environmental factors on the pilot. The war saw the emergence of aeromedical research and the need for testing and measurement methods. Studies on driver behavior started gaining momentum during this period, as Henry Ford started providing millions of Americans with automobiles. Another major development during this period was the performance of aeromedical research. By the end of World War I, two aeronautical labs were established, one at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas and the other at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton, Ohio. Many tests were conducted to determine which characteristic differentiated the successful pilots from the unsuccessful ones. During the early 1930s, Edwin Link developed the first flight simulator. The trend continued and more sophisticated simulators and test equipment were developed. Another significant development was in the civilian sector, where the effects of illumination on worker productivity were examined. This led to the identification of the Hawthorne Effect, which suggested that motivational factors could significantly influence human performance. World War II marked the development of new and complex machines and weaponry, and these made new demands on operators' cognition. It was no longer possible to adopt the Tayloristic principle of matching individuals to preexisting jobs. Now the design of equipment had to take into account human limitations and take advantage of human capabilities. The decision-making, attention, situational awareness and hand-eye coordination of the machine's operator became key in the success or failure of a task. There was substantial research conducted to determine the human capabilities and limitations that had to be accomplished. A lot of this research took off where the aeromedical research between the wars had left off. An example of this is the study done by Fitts and Jones (1947), who studied the most effective configuration of control knobs to be used in aircraft cockpits. Much of this research transcended into other equipment with the aim of making the controls and displays easier for the operators to use. The entry of the terms \\"human factors\\" and \\"ergonomics\\" into the modern lexicon date from this period. It was observed that fully functional aircraft flown by the best-trained pilots, still crashed. In 1943 Alphonse Chapanis, a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, showed that this so-called \\"pilot error\\" could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits. After the war, the Army Air Force published 19 volumes summarizing what had been established from research during the war. In the decades since World War II, human factors has continued to flourish and diversify. Work by Elias Porter and others within the RAND Corporation after WWII extended the conception of human factors. \\"As the thinking progressed, a new concept developed‚Äîthat it was possible to view an organization such as an air-defense, man-machine system as a single organism and that it was possible to study the behavior of such an organism. It was the climate for a breakthrough.\\"Porter, Elias H. (1964). Manpower Development: The System Training Concept. New York: Harper and Row, p. xiii. In the initial 20 years after the World War II, most activities were done by the \\"founding fathers\\": Alphonse Chapanis, Paul Fitts, and Small. =During the Cold War= The beginning of the Cold War led to a major expansion of Defense supported research laboratories. Also, many labs established during WWII started expanding. Most of the research following the war was military-sponsored. Large sums of money were granted to universities to conduct research. The scope of the research also broadened from small equipments to entire workstations and systems. Concurrently, a lot of opportunities started opening up in the civilian industry. The focus shifted from research to participation through advice to engineers in the design of equipment. After 1965, the period saw a maturation of the discipline. The field has expanded with the development of the computer and computer applications. The Space Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme g-forces. Tolerance of the harsh environment of space and its effects on the mind and body were widely studied. =Information age= The dawn of the Information Age has resulted in the related field of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI). Likewise, the growing demand for and competition among consumer goods and electronics has resulted in more companies and industries including human factors in their product design. Using advanced technologies in human kinetics, body-mapping, movement patterns and heat zones, companies are able to manufacture purpose-specific garments, including full body suits, jerseys, shorts, shoes, and even underwear. Human factors organizations Formed in 1946 in the UK, the oldest professional body for human factors specialists and ergonomists is The Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors, formally known as the Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors and before that, The Ergonomics Society. The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) was founded in 1957. The Society's mission is to promote the discovery and exchange of knowledge concerning the characteristics of human beings that are applicable to the design of systems and devices of all kinds. The Association of Canadian Ergonomists - l'Association canadienne d'ergonomie (ACE) was founded in 1968. It was originally named the Human Factors Association of Canada (HFAC), with ACE (in French) added in 1984, and the consistent, bilingual title adopted in 1999. According to it 2017 mission statement, ACE unites and advances the knowledge and skills of ergonomics and human factors practitioners to optimise human and organisational well-being. The International Ergonomics Association (IEA) is a federation of ergonomics and human factors societies from around the world. The mission of the IEA is to elaborate and advance ergonomics science and practice, and to improve the quality of life by expanding its scope of application and contribution to society. As of September 2008, the International Ergonomics Association has 46 federated societies and 2 affiliated societies. The Human Factors Transforming Healthcare (HFTH) is an international network of HF practitioners who are embedded within hospitals and health systems. The goal of the network is to provide resources for human factors practitioners and healthcare organizations looking to successfully apply HF principles to improve patient care and provider performance. The network also serves as collaborative platform for human factors practitioners, students, faculty, industry partners, and those curious about human factors in healthcare. https://www.hfthnetwork.org/about- hfth =Related organizations= The Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) was founded by the coal industry in 1969. From the outset the IOM employed an ergonomics staff to apply ergonomics principles to the design of mining machinery and environments. To this day, the IOM continues ergonomics activities, especially in the fields of musculoskeletal disorders; heat stress and the ergonomics of personal protective equipment (PPE). Like many in occupational ergonomics, the demands and requirements of an ageing UK workforce are a growing concern and interest to IOM ergonomists. The International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is a professional organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries. The Society is a standards development organization for the engineering of powered vehicles of all kinds, including cars, trucks, boats, aircraft, and others. The Society of Automotive Engineers has established a number of standards used in the automotive industry and elsewhere. It encourages the design of vehicles in accordance with established human factors principles. It is one of the most influential organizations with respect to ergonomics work in automotive design. This society regularly holds conferences which address topics spanning all aspects of human factors and ergonomics. Practitioners Human factors practitioners come from a variety of backgrounds, though predominantly they are psychologists (from the various subfields of industrial and organizational psychology, engineering psychology, cognitive psychology, perceptual psychology, applied psychology, and experimental psychology) and physiologists. Designers (industrial, interaction, and graphic), anthropologists, technical communication scholars and computer scientists also contribute. Typically, an ergonomist will have an undergraduate degree in psychology, engineering, design or health sciences, and usually a master's degree or doctoral degree in a related discipline. Though some practitioners enter the field of human factors from other disciplines, both M.S. and PhD degrees in Human Factors Engineering are available from several universities worldwide. =Ergonomics and the sedentary workplace= Contemporary offices did not exist until the 1830s Smithsonian Education.

(2000).. Warsaw: Central Institute for Labour Protection. and the first published study of posture appearing in 1955s As the American workforce began to shift towards sedentary employment, the prevalence of [WMSD/cognitive issues/ etc..] began to rise. In 1900, 41% of the US workforce was employed in agriculture but by 2000 that had dropped to 1.9% C. Dimitri, A. Effland, and N. Conklin, (2005) The 20th Century Transformation of U.S. Agriculture and Farm Policy, Economic Information Bulletin Number This coincides with an increase in growth in desk-based employment (25% of all employment in 2000) and the surveillance of non-fatal workplace injuries by OSHA and Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1971. 0‚Äì1.5 and occurs in a sitting or reclining position. Adults older than 50 years report spending more time sedentary and for adults older than 65 years this is often 80% of their awake time. Multiple studies show a dose-response relationship between sedentary time and all-cause mortality with an increase of 3% mortality per additional sedentary hour each day. High quantities of sedentary time without breaks is correlated to higher risk of chronic disease, obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Currently, there is a large proportion of the overall workforce who is employed in low physical activity occupations. Sedentary behavior, such as spending long periods of time in seated positions poses a serious threat for injuries and additional health risks.Canadian Centre for Occupational Health. (2019, March 15). (none). Retrieved February, 2019, from https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/sitting/sitting_overview.html Unfortunately, even though some workplaces make an effort to provide a well designed environment for sedentary employees, any employee who is performing large amounts of sitting will likely suffer discomfort. There are existing conditions that would predispose both individuals and populations to an increase in prevalence of living sedentary lifestyles, including: socioeconomic determinants, education levels, occupation, living environment, age (as mentioned above) and more. A study published by the Iranian Journal of Public Health examined socioeconomic factors and sedentary lifestyle effects for individuals in a working community. The study concluded that individuals who reported living in low income environments were more inclined to living sedentary behavior compared to those who reported being of high socioeconomic status. Individuals who achieve less education are also considered to be a high risk group to partake in sedentary lifestyles, however, each community is different and has different resources available that may vary this risk. Oftentimes, larger worksites are associated with increased occupational sitting.Those who work in environments that are classified as business and office jobs are typically more exposed to sitting and sedentary behavior while in the workplace. Additionally, occupations that are full-time, have schedule flexibility, are also included in that demographic, and are more likely to sit often throughout their workday. =Ergonomics policy implementation= Obstacles surrounding better ergonomic features to sedentary employees include cost, time, effort and for both companies and employees. The evidence above helps establish the importance of ergonomics in a sedentary workplace; however missing information from this problem is enforcement and policy implementation. As a modernized workplace becomes more and more technology based more jobs are becoming primarily seated, therefore leading to a need to prevent chronic injuries and pain. This is becoming easier with the amount of research around ergonomic tools saving money companies by limiting the number of days missed from work and workers comp cases. The way to ensure that corporations prioritize these health outcomes for their employees is through policy and implementation. Nationwide there are no policies that are currently in place, however a handful of big companies and states have taken on cultural policies to insure the safety of all workers. For example, the state of Nevada risk management department has established a set of ground rules for both agencies responsibilities and employees responsibilities. The agency responsibilities include evaluating workstations, using risk management resources when necessary and keeping OSHA records. To see specific workstation ergonomic policies and responsibilities click here. Methods Until recently, methods used to evaluate human factors and ergonomics ranged from simple questionnaires to more complex and expensive usability labs. Some of the more common human factors methods are listed below: *Ethnographic analysis: Using methods derived from ethnography, this process focuses on observing the uses of technology in a practical environment. It is a qualitative and observational method that focuses on \\"real-world\\" experience and pressures, and the usage of technology or environments in the workplace. The process is best used early in the design process. *Focus Groups are another form of qualitative research in which one individual will facilitate discussion and elicit opinions about the technology or process under investigation. This can be on a one-to-one interview basis, or in a group session. Can be used to gain a large quantity of deep qualitative data, though due to the small sample size, can be subject to a higher degree of individual bias.Wickens, C.D.; Lee J.D.; Liu Y.; Gorden Becker S.E. (1997). An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering, 2nd Edition. Prentice Hall. . Can be used at any point in the design process, as it is largely dependent on the exact questions to be pursued, and the structure of the group. Can be extremely costly. *Iterative design: Also known as prototyping, the iterative design process seeks to involve users at several stages of design, to correct problems as they emerge. As prototypes emerge from the design process, these are subjected to other forms of analysis as outlined in this article, and the results are then taken and incorporated into the new design. Trends among users are analyzed, and products redesigned. This can become a costly process, and needs to be done as soon as possible in the design process before designs become too concrete. *Meta-analysis: A supplementary technique used to examine a wide body of already existing data or literature to derive trends or form hypotheses to aid design decisions. As part of a literature survey, a meta- analysis can be performed to discern a collective trend from individual variables. *Subjects-in-tandem: Two subjects are asked to work concurrently on a series of tasks while vocalizing their analytical observations. The technique is also known as \\"Co-Discovery\\" as participants tend to feed off of each other's comments to generate a richer set of observations than is often possible with the participants separately. This is observed by the researcher, and can be used to discover usability difficulties. This process is usually recorded. *Surveys and questionnaires: A commonly used technique outside of human factors as well, surveys and questionnaires have an advantage in that they can be administered to a large group of people for relatively low cost, enabling the researcher to gain a large amount of data. The validity of the data obtained is, however, always in question, as the questions must be written and interpreted correctly, and are, by definition, subjective. Those who actually respond are in effect self-selecting as well, widening the gap between the sample and the population further. *Task analysis: A process with roots in activity theory, task analysis is a way of systematically describing human interaction with a system or process to understand how to match the demands of the system or process to human capabilities. The complexity of this process is generally proportional to the complexity of the task being analyzed, and so can vary in cost and time involvement. It is a qualitative and observational process. Best used early in the design process. *Human performance modeling:A method of quantifying human behavior, cognition, and processes; a tool used by human factors researchers and practitioners for both the analysis of human function and for the development of systems designed for optimal user experience and interaction. *Think aloud protocol: Also known as \\"concurrent verbal protocol\\", this is the process of asking a user to execute a series of tasks or use technology, while continuously verbalizing their thoughts so that a researcher can gain insights as to the users' analytical process. Can be useful for finding design flaws that do not affect task performance, but may have a negative cognitive effect on the user. Also useful for utilizing experts to better understand procedural knowledge of the task in question. Less expensive than focus groups, but tends to be more specific and subjective. *User analysis: This process is based around designing for the attributes of the intended user or operator, establishing the characteristics that define them, creating a persona for the user. Obinna P. Fidelis, Olusoji A. Adalumo, Ephraim O. Nwoye (2018). Ergonomic Suitability of Library Readers‚Äô Furniture in a Nigerian University; AJERD Vol 1, Issue 3,366-370 Best done at the outset of the design process, a user analysis will attempt to predict the most common users, and the characteristics that they would be assumed to have in common. This can be problematic if the design concept does not match the actual user, or if the identified are too vague to make clear design decisions from. This process is, however, usually quite inexpensive, and commonly used. *\\"Wizard of Oz\\": This is a comparatively uncommon technique but has seen some use in mobile devices. Based upon the Wizard of Oz experiment, this technique involves an operator who remotely controls the operation of a device to imitate the response of an actual computer program. It has the advantage of producing a highly changeable set of reactions, but can be quite costly and difficult to undertake. *Methods analysis is the process of studying the tasks a worker completes using a step-by-step investigation. Each task in broken down into smaller steps until each motion the worker performs is described. Doing so enables you to see exactly where repetitive or straining tasks occur. *Time studies determine the time required for a worker to complete each task. Time studies are often used to analyze cyclical jobs. They are considered \\"event based\\" studies because time measurements are triggered by the occurrence of predetermined events. *Work sampling is a method in which the job is sampled at random intervals to determine the proportion of total time spent on a particular task. It provides insight into how often workers are performing tasks which might cause strain on their bodies. *Predetermined time systems are methods for analyzing the time spent by workers on a particular task. One of the most widely used predetermined time system is called Methods- Time-Measurement (MTM). Other common work measurement systems include MODAPTS and MOST. Industry specific applications based on PTS are Seweasy,MODAPTS and GSD as seen in paper: . *Cognitive walkthrough: This method is a usability inspection method in which the evaluators can apply user perspective to task scenarios to identify design problems. As applied to macroergonomics, evaluators are able to analyze the usability of work system designs to identify how well a work system is organized and how well the workflow is integrated.Brookhuis, K., Hedge, A., Hendrick, H., Salas, E., and Stanton, N. (2005). Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics Models. Florida: CRC Press. *Kansei method: This is a method that transforms consumer's responses to new products into design specifications. As applied to macroergonomics, this method can translate employee's responses to changes to a work system into design specifications. *High Integration of Technology, Organization, and People (HITOP): This is a manual procedure done step-by-step to apply technological change to the workplace. It allows managers to be more aware of the human and organizational aspects of their technology plans, allowing them to efficiently integrate technology in these contexts. *Top modeler: This model helps manufacturing companies identify the organizational changes needed when new technologies are being considered for their process. *Computer- integrated Manufacturing, Organization, and People System Design (CIMOP): This model allows for evaluating computer-integrated manufacturing, organization, and people system design based on knowledge of the system. *Anthropotechnology: This method considers analysis and design modification of systems for the efficient transfer of technology from one culture to another. *Systems analysis tool (SAT): This is a method to conduct systematic trade-off evaluations of work-system intervention alternatives. *Macroergonomic analysis of structure (MAS): This method analyzes the structure of work systems according to their compatibility with unique sociotechnical aspects. *Macroergonomic analysis and design (MEAD): This method assesses work-system processes by using a ten-step process. *Virtual manufacturing and response surface methodology (VMRSM): This method uses computerized tools and statistical analysis for workstation design. =Weaknesses= Problems related to measures of usability include the fact that measures of learning and retention of how to use an interface are rarely employed and some studies treat measures of how users interact with interfaces as synonymous with quality-in-use, despite an unclear relation. Although field methods can be extremely useful because they are conducted in the users' natural environment, they have some major limitations to consider. The limitations include: # Usually take more time and resources than other methods # Very high effort in planning, recruiting, and executing compared with other methods # Much longer study periods and therefore requires much goodwill among the participants # Studies are longitudinal in nature, therefore, attrition can become a problem.

Reception Motion Picture News (Nov 2, 1929): \\"A Panic. Another contribution to the entertainment of the nation. Walt Disney has been hitting an extremely high average with his various cartoon series. This one is well worth whatever praise this reporter may bestow upon it. The basis of the amusing antics is the line which ruminates about springtime, love and levity. Everything turns terpsichore: flowers, spiders, cranes, frogs. The routines they pass through are guaranteed to make any audience laugh.\\" The Film Daily (Nov 3, 1929): \\"This is called a Disney Silly Symphony, and it is a corker. The cartoon work is about the best that has ever been seen in the animated field, the expressions and general antics of the animals being unusually clever as well as true to life. A series of frogs graduating in size are swallowed by each other in turn, till only the last big frog is left. This one in turn is swallowed by a long-legged bird, who is so weighted down that he flops in a pond and is drowned. The clever conceit is a fine satire on the survival of the fittest in the animal world. The synchronized music accompanying the dancing music of the frogs adds greatly to the laughs, which come easily.\\" Variety (Feb 12, 1930): \\"Another amusing, ingeniously made cartoon comedy drawn by Walt Disney. Oke for any theatre. In Springtime Disney has sought to express that vernal feeling of animated insect, animal and flower characters in novel dance routines set to intriguing musical numbers. Timing of the dances, the accompanying taps, etc., is so perfect that the rhythm alone imparts rare entertainment value to this new one in the Silly Symphony series.

It was built by Akbarabadi Mahal, one of Shah Jahan's wives in 1650. One of the several Mughal era mosques in Old Delhi, it was demolished by the British, following their recapture of Delhi during the 1857 Uprising. It is believed to have existed in modern-day Netaji Subhash Park locality of Old Delhi. History Akbarabadi Masjid was built by one of Shah Jahan's wives, Akbarabadi Begum. Built in 1650, it took two years to complete. Akbarabadi Begum is said to have translated the Quran from Arabic to native Urdu at the site of the present Akbarabadi Masjid. It was in honor of her work that she came up with the idea of constructing the mosque at the same site. During its existence, it was one of the many mosques built by Royal Mughal females in Shahjahanabad, like the Fatehpuri Masjid, Zeenat-ul Masjid, etc. The mosque was reportedly standing a good two centuries after its creation, before it fell to the British wrath in the aftermath of the 1857 Uprising. The uprising of 1857 is one of the most important and decisive events in the history of British India. Delhi ‚Äì the capital of the Mughals (see History of Delhi) was the epicenter of the uprising, which began in the army units posted around Delhi. While initially successful, the revolt subsequently withered away, due to many reasons, including lack of leadership and coordination, spying by local Indians for the British, etc. (For details, see Indian Rebellion of 1857). Delhi was the last landmark of 1857 to be captured back by the British. To quell the dissent against British rule from spreading further and prevent it from resurfacing, the British destroyed hundreds of structures in Old Delhi. The Mughal capital bore the wrath of the British reaction. Any structure that was used as the mutiny base by the sepoys was destroyed (for more details, see Siege of Delhi).Why was Old Delhi Railway Station built in the heart of Shahjahanabad? Trisha Gupta Akbarabadi Masjid was one of the mutiny bases which was demolished by the British forces. Its existence has since been legendary and passed on generation after generation. It is not known where the mosque exactly stood, though many local Muslim residents of Netaji Subhash Park in Old Delhi consider one particular site to be the possible ground where the mosque once stood. The debris from the demolished mosque was put on sale and somehow found a noble buyer in Syed Ahmed Khan, who bought the debris and used it in the construction of the Sir Syed Mosque, Aligarh Muslim University. Possible discovery On 6 July 2012, while digging earth in Netaji Subhash Park area to construct a Metro station, the officials of the DMRC came across remains of some medieval era construction buried under the ground.Akbarabadi Masjid found? After investigation by the ASI, it has been confirmed that the remains belong to the Mughal era due to the material used the style of construction and other things like pottery excavated from the site.Relics belong to Mughal era It has however, not yet been ascertained if the remains are those of Akbarabadi Masjid or are a part of it. The ASI says that its investigations to establish the exact identity of the ruins are on. The digging by DMRC has been suspended. It was part of Delhi Metro's Phase-3 plan and minor modification to the route may have to be done to adhere to the ASI construction norms in protected heritage areas. The discovery has triggered excitement among local residents, who certainly believe the remains to belong to Akbarabadi Masjid. Following the construction of an illegal brick structure ‚Äì which endangered the integrity of the ASI excavations ‚Äì Muslim residents started offering namaaz at the site of the ruins.People offer namaaz at possible Mosque site Soon after the discovery, the local MLA Shoaib Iqbal began supervising re-construction of the mosque at the same site but it was stopped after orders from the Delhi government. This led to stone pelting and minor arson when the police tried to remove copies of the Quran and some prayer mats from the site. The local civic agency North Delhi Municipal Corporation had initially banned any activity except offering namaaz at the site.Construction at relics site banned However, on 20 July 2012 the Delhi High Court issued a ban on any construction and religious activities at the site, reasoning that it was not yet ascertained if the site belonged to some ancient mosque and that for over a century has no religious activity been carried out at the site.All activity banned at site It also ordered North Delhi Municipal Corporation to hand over the land to ASI for its investigations to begin.Hand over land to ASI: Delhi High Court On 25 July 2012 the site was handed over to ASI but the archaeology body said that it would start excavating the site only after the monsoons. Heavy police cover shall be provided to ASI during its work.Work on site only after monsoons: ASI Following request by ASI, the Delhi High Court on 30 July 2012 ordered North Delhi Municipal Corporation to demolish the illegal construction and asked for heavy policing to maintain law and order.Demolish structure over Mughal-era ruins: Delhi HC On 11 October 2012, after much delay due to monsoons, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation sought Paramilitary cover in a bid to start the demolition drive at the site.

According to the medieval geographer al-Baladhuri, all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by Mu'awiyah in the course of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. The Diyar Rabi'a was settled by the Rabi'a tribe. Diyar Rabi'a encompasses the upper reaches of the river Khabur and its tributaries, i.e. the regions of Tur Abdin and Beth Arabaye, as well as both shores of the river Tigris from the vicinity of Jazirat ibn Umar in the north to the boundary with Iraq in the area of Tikrit in the south, including the lower reaches of the Upper Zab and Lower Zab. The main city of the province was Mosul (Arabic al-Mawsil), with other important urban centres at Balad, Jazirat ibn Umar, al-Sinn, Barqa'id, Sinjar, Nasibin, Mardin and Ra's al-'Ayn. The region was plagued by the raids of the Qarmatians in the Umayyad and Abbasid periods. In the mid-10th century, it came under the control of the native Hamdanid dynasty, centred at Mosul. The Hamdanid emirate was terminated by the Buyids in 980, and the province passed under the control of the Uqaylids, who held it until the Seljuq conquest in the late 11th century.

She currently serves as senior pastor at the First Baptist Church of the City of Washington, D. C. Her ministry has provoked controversy due to disagreements concerning women in church leadership. Biography Pennington- Russell received a B.A. in Communicative Disorders from the University of Central Florida in Orlando in 1981, and an M.Div. from the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Mill Valley, California, in 1985. Her first position was at Nineteenth Avenue Baptist Church in San Francisco, where she was associate pastor and then pastor (1985-1998). She was then pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Waco, Texas (1998-2007), before being called as lead pastor of the First Baptist Church of Decatur, Georgia (2007-2015). Julie Pennington- Russell began her current pastorate at The First Baptist Church of the City of Washington, D.C. in January, 2016. She currently serves as a member of the advisory board for the religion department of Carson-Newman University and has served as a trustee for Mercer University, member of the board for the Center for Christian Music Studies at Baylor University, and member of the board of directors for the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good. Her messages have been featured on the television broadcast 30 Good Minutes, Day1 Radio and at the Festival of Homiletics. She has been married since 1988 to Tim Pennington-Russell, a website designer and musician. They have two adult children, Taylor and Lucy. Controversy Pennington-Russell's ministerial appointments have highlighted the ongoing dispute among Christians regarding women in leadership roles. While the Baptist tradition emphasizes the autonomy of individual churches, many Baptists in the U. S. are opposed to female pastors. Her first position at Nineteenth Avenue Baptist Church in San Francisco prompted repeated attempts to have the church removed from the state Baptist Convention. In 1998, her second pastorate at Calvary Baptist Church (Waco, Texas) made her the first woman to serve as senior pastor of a Southern Baptist congregation in Texas. This was widely reported in the press, and members of an unrelated Independent Fundamental Baptist church picketed the church in protest. Two years later, the Southern Baptist Convention revised its doctrinal statement, the Baptist Faith and Message, to explicitly state that women are not permitted to be pastors. Her move to First Baptist Church of Decatur in 2007 provoked further controversy and media coverage. It resulted in the church's being expelled from the Georgia Baptist Convention, the state branch of the Southern Baptist Convention. The issues leading up to the expulsion were strongly criticized by Southern Baptist pastor Wade Burleson. The church remained affiliated to the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a smaller grouping which affirms women in ministry. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote that First Baptist Church of Decatur is \\"the largest church associated with the Southern Baptist Convention or the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship to call a woman as senior minister\\" and \\"For a church of this stature to call a woman as senior minister is undeniably historic.\\" References External links * 1960 births Living people Baptist ministers from the United States Female Christian clergy ","title":"Julie Pennington-Russell"},{"id":"36480150","text":"Hypolycaena amanica is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae.

The plot centers around two of the monkeys who are in love and express their romance in the form of dance and rhythm throughout the film.  Production  The production of Monkey Melodies took place from July to August, 1930. During production the animators didn‚Äôt utilize model sheets to keep the characters designs consistent, depending on the artist, the monkeys would be drawn using distinct styles.

Its main purpose was to allow shareholders of solvent companies which were surplus to requirements, to get funds out via the cheap and simple striking off method, whilst still obtaining the tax benefits which legally were only available under a members voluntary liquidation (sometimes abbreviated to MVL). Upon striking a company off, by default, and distributed funds paid out prior to the process being completed would be taxed on the shareholder as dividends. Under a members voluntary liquidation, the same funds paid out would be taxed on the shareholder as a capital gain. Especially where entrepreneurs relief was available, capital gains tax typically lead to much lower personal tax bills than dividends would. To avoid companies having to spend several thousand pounds on a formal liquidation, by concession, HMRC would allow you to have capital gains tax treatment even under a striking off, providing advance clearance was obtained and you met certain criteria. From 1 March 2012 this is no longer the case. If the company funds are below ¬£25,000, upon strike off they will automatically be taxed on the shareholder as a capital gain (no application required). However, if the funds are above ¬£25,000, the whole amount will be taxed as dividends. This means if you wish to get rid of a solvent company with more than ¬£25,000 in the bank, it is often worthwhile to have it formally liquidated.

Peters signed as a professional for Bristol City in March 1961. Manager Fred Ford gave Peters his league debut at outside right in the final Third Division match in 1960‚Äì61 in a 3‚Äì0 win v Brentford on 29 April 1961. Jimmy Rogers was the regular outside right as City rose to 6th place in 1961‚Äì62. Peters started the season at outside left but had to share the left wing duties with Jantzen Derrick and made only 13 appearances scoring his first goal in the final game of the season on 28 April 1962 in a 2‚Äì2 draw v Crystal Palace. Peters had a mid season spell in the side the following season, firstly on the right wing in place of Alex Tait and then on the left wing in place of Derrick. Peters made 19 appearances scoring three goals as the \\"Robins\\" slipped to 14th place in the table in 1962‚Äì63. In 1963-64 Bristol City recovered to 5th place in the Third Division but Peters failed to make the first team with Derrick playing outside right and new signing Peter Hooper the regular on the left wing. Peters returned to the left wing at the start of the following season making 40 appearances scoring six goals including 2 goals in the 3‚Äì0 win v Port Vale on 27 February 1965. This was the promotion season as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division. Peters started the Second Division campaign in the outside right position with Hooper on the left wing but switched to the left wing when Derrick replaced Hooper in October. In 1965-66 Bristol City finished 5th in the Second Division and Peters made 35 appearances scoring six goals. Bristol City struggled against relegation for much of 1966‚Äì67. The emergence of Danny Bartley on the left wing at the start of the season restricted Peters and Derrick to sharing the outside right position but at Christmas Peters reclaimed the outside left position with City lying 19th and retained the no.11 shirt for the rest of the season as City finished clear of relegation in 15th place. Peters made 28 appearances and was top scorer with nine goals in 1966-67 including a run of 7 goals in the final 12 league games. Peters also netted two goals against Halifax Town in the FA Cup as City reached the 5th round before losing 0‚Äì2 at Tottenham Hotspur. The following season saw Bristol City stave off relegation after a season long struggle finishing in 19th place. Peters had several spells in the first team making 22 appearances without scoring on the left wing sharing duties with Bartley in 1967‚Äì68. Peters also played in 3 FA Cup ties as City reached the 5th round again before losing 0‚Äì2 at Leeds United. Peters joined Bournemouth for ¬£5,000 in June 1968. Peters moved on the play under ex City player Arnold Rodgers the manager of Bath City in 1970. After Peters finished playing football he spent over 25 years as a consultant for Sun Life of Canada working in both Bristol and Plymouth. In 1997 Peters was back working in Bristol and living in nearby Weston-in-Gordano. Personal life On 17 July 1965 Peters married Joyce, and together they have two daughters Sarah and Louise.

Plot The short begins with the building of the Ark. Father Noah makes the plans of the ark and gives commands to its construction. His sons, Ham, Shem and Japheth \\"build the ark from dawn to dark and make a lot of noise\\" with some help from the animals, while their wives load up food supplies to see them through the flood and Noah's wife is washing clothes. Eventually, the storm rolls in and the animals are summoned, two-by- two, to the ark, purposely leaving two skunks behind. The ark is soon buffeted around by the storm and the ark's occupants praise to the Lord. At one point, Noah gets rainwater leaking through the ceiling in his mouth and has to open a porthole to spit it out, whereupon he is chased by a stray lightning bolt, which he lets out through another porthole. 40 days later, the storm recedes and a dove, carrying an olive branch, flies back to Noah and his family to signify that land has been found.

History  The airport was built prior to World War II, apparently by the Department of Commerce as part of the network of emergency aircraft landing fields which were set up in the 1920s and 1930s. Its purpose was to facilitate landings of commercial aircraft in emergency situations. It was a simple sod open field, about 2,800 √ó 2,300 feet, and perhaps had a rotating beacon for identification from the air. During World War II, the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces from 1943 to 1945 as an auxiliary airfield with P-39 Airacobras assigned. It had a 3,400-foot unpaved runway and was used as an overflow field, likely by the training schools at Sumter and Congaree. It was listed as \\"Site 24, JX-RW\\" in the April 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields. The Army arranged for local civilians to provide temporary overnight accommodations and for mess services. The military turned the facility over to the town of Lane after the war, leaving a single hangar, lighted runway, rotating beacon and lighted taxiways. It was also used occasionally by the military, with the occasional C-130 from Pope Air Force Base using it for practice landings on an turf runway. The airport was used by general aviation for light aircraft until the early 1980s, when it was closed. Today, the former airport is an open field with agricultural crops.

The Symphony is imbued with operatic themes and is often cited as melodramatic. It was released in 1934, and its production was important to the future development of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs animation. Each Silly Symphony was a technological marvel at the time and proceeded to further advancements in the animation industry. While the plot of The Goddess of Spring follows the Greek myth of Persephone (known as ‚ÄúProserpina‚Äù in Roman Mythology) and Hades (Pluto), the imagery is more evocative of Hell and Satan (or, more specifically, a traditional stage Mephistopheles). Plot summary > There once was a time in the long, long, ago, when there was joy and > laughter everywhere, when the flowers that grew, blossomed all the year > through, and the world was eternally fair. For there lived a maiden, so > gentle was she, that all the world loved her tenderly, and life was then so > pleasant, that joy was ever present, and the world grew more lovely each > day. The flowers danced around her, they formed a wreath and crowned her, > the Goddess of Eternal Spring, the Goddess of Eternal Spring. Persephone, the Goddess of Spring, lives in a beautiful garden of eternal spring. She is greeted by dancing flowers and fairies who stand by her throne and defend her when Pluto, the God of the Underworld, comes to take her away. He plans to make her his queen in the Underworld, where she is crowned by Pluto and welcomed by a choir of devils. Meanwhile, above ground, the creatures suffer a rough winter and mourn the absence of their goddess. In the Underworld, the Goddess of Spring weeps. Pluto shows concern for her unhappiness, and offers anything to make her happy; they reach the agreement that she will spend six months above ground and six below, resulting in the four seasons. She is allowed to return to her world, thawing the snow and ending the winter. Importance of production When The Goddess of Spring was produced, it was an important stepping stone in the advancement of animation. The development of the human characters in The Goddess of Spring, specifically, would lead to the eventual animation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. While Disney's animating staff was well-versed in the animation of animals, their experience in designing humans was severely underdeveloped. The Goddess of Spring was among the first string of short films in which they used human characters. It provided much-needed experience for the upcoming major motion picture that Disney was designing. According to film historians, the animation skill level between The Goddess of Spring and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs appears to have a twenty-year gap between the two; comparatively, it was only three years. The development in that span of time was monumental and is reflected in the major motion picture. Although feature-length cartoons were initially disregarded, the animation advancements attributed to The Goddess of Spring, as they were displayed in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, brought the feature film to top the list as highest-grossing sound film at the time. There are some negative reviews about certain aspects of The Goddess of Spring - such as the goddess' \\"rubber arms\\" and the melodrama of the Silly Symphony overall. Its operatic tendencies and over-dramatization, while criticized, are also points of admiration from viewers. It is also noted that the usage of shadows, especially in the \\"underworld\\" scenes, are phenomenal additions to the sequence. List of animators The animators on staff for Disney's The Goddess of Spring were vital to the advancement of animation, as The Goddess of Spring was produced as \\"practice\\" for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Several animators who worked on the short film later worked on the major motion picture. *Cy Young *Hamilton Luske *Leonard Sebring *Clyde Geronomi *Les Clark *Dick Huemer *Art Babbitt *Ugo D'Orsi *Wolfgang Reitherman *Frenchy de Tremaudan *Louie Schmitt List of other staff *Director Wilfred Jackson *Story creator Bill Cottrell *Music coordinator Leigh Harline *Voice actor Kenny Baker (singing narrator) *Voice actor Tudor Williams (Pluto) *Voice actress Jessica Dragonette *Voice singer (Persephone) Diana Gaylen *Character designer Albert Hurter Home media Disney released several collections of Silly Symphonies short films on VHS, DVD and Laserdisc.

The member from Helicobacter pylori has a C-terminal extension of just over 100 residues that is shared, in part, by the Aquifex aeolicus homologue. Function Ubiquinone is an essential electron carrier in prokaryotes. In Escherichia coli, the Ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway involves at least nine reactions whereby 3-octaprenyl4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase (UbiD) is an enzyme on the pathway which catalyses the conversion of the substrate 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate to the product, 2-octaprenyl phenol. E. coli ubiD- mutants have defects in Q8 biosynthesis, accumulate 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoicacid (HP8B), and lack decarboxylase activity in vitro. However, E. coli ubiD- mutants retained the ability to produce about 20‚Äì25% of the normal levels of Q 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoic acid.

Layouts were done on summer of 1936 by Terrell Stapp and John Walbridge. By this time, Disney's cartoons were increasingly sumptuous due to continuing production on Snow White. One of the bugs eating the cricket's cello has red pants like Mickey Mouse. In the edited version, part of the \\"Apache Dance\\" and \\"Everybody's Truckin'\\" were cut out due to racial stereotypes. Reception Motion Picture Herald wrote on June 26, 1937, \\"Gay and tuneful is this richly imaginative visit to a bug night club. Equal to the brightly tinted tones in which the comic business has been dressed in the sparkling mood of animated fun and nonsense which the subject creates. Simply an enumeration of some of the hilarious and musical moments that occur in this odd rendezvous of frolic and frivolity, the incidents depicted will perhaps have a stronger appeal for the adult and the teen-age spectator.\\" Voice cast * Chorus voices: Clarrie Collins, Jimmie Cushman, Marie Dickerson, C.B.

They specialise in used car warranty, new car warranty, and extended warranty. They also provide GAP insurance and products for breakdown recovery.  History  Extended warranties were the norm in North America, and were growing in popularity, at the time of the launch of Warranty Direct, in the summer of 1997, due in part to changes in the Sale of Goods Act, which was issued in December 1979. With the typical manufacturer's warranty lasting only three years, a large number of cars did not hold any form of extended mechanical, and electrical repair insurance. Warranty Direct was founded by father and son, David McClure Fisher and Duncan McClure Fisher, in June 1997, its sole service was vehicle warranties, primarily for second hand cars and private sales, until 1999, when warranties fpr Household Appliance were launched. David and Duncan McClure Fisher sold the majority stake in April 2008, and was sold to the arm of BNP Paribas Assurance, in the United Kingdom, Cardif Pinnacle, who purchased the remaining shares, in July 2013.

Mohammad Ali was a forceful orator and writer, contributing articles to various newspapers including The Times, The Observer and The Manchester Guardian before he launched The Comrade. Produced on expensive paper, The Comrade quickly gained circulation and influence becoming famous even internationally, securing subscribers in several foreign countries. The paper, launched from Calcutta, shifted to Delhi, the newly announced capital of the Raj, in 1912 where the first issue of the Delhi edition appeared on 12 October. In 1913, in order to reach out to the Muslim masses, he started an Urdu daily, the Hamdard.http://www.dpcc.co.in/inc/history/presidents/maulana_mohammad_ali.php  Aims and editorial stance  Mohammad Ali was a member and senior leader of the Muslim League and The Comrade often voiced that party's political line. Ali wrote a series of articles in his paper criticising the annulment of the Partition of Bengal in 1911 and criticised papers such as The Tribune, Surendranath Banerjee's The Bengalee and others that were opposed to the League and the Aligarh school of politics.S. M. Ikram, Indian Muslims And Partition Of India, New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, 1992, p. 156. In its inaugural edition of 14 January 1911, the paper outlined ‚Äúthe frank recognition of yawning differences that divide‚Äù Hindus and Muslims. Nevertheless, The Comrade advocated Hindu-Muslim entente, and called on both communities to work together for the national cause. Ali aimed to create national and global networks of support for Muslim causes through The Comrade. It carried several articles that highlighted the plight of Muslims globally during important international events of the time such as the Balkan Wars, the occupation of Egypt by the British and Turkey‚Äôs role in the First World War. The articles and editorials were particularly scathing of a perceived British hostility to the Muslim world in general and to Turkey in particular. In his Discovery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru observed thus about Ali and his journalistic stance in The Comrade: \\"The annulment of the Partition of Bengal in 1911 had given him a shock and his faith in the bona fides of the British Government had been shaken. The Balkan Wars moved him and he wrote passionately in favour of Turkey and the Islamic tradition it represented. Progressively he grew more anti-British and the entry of Turkey in World War I completed the process\\"Jawaharlal Nehru, The Discovery of India, Penguin India, 2004. p. 382. With the start of the First World War, the British government became keen that Indians remain loyal to the Allied cause. The British Indian government was particularly concerned about Muslim public opinion and Pan- Islamic activism. They singled out Mohamed Ali and his newspapers for galvanising Muslim sentiment against the British and the Allies during the early period of the First World War.Public spaces of discourse: innovations and interventions in colonial India, Gurpreet Bhasin, Open University. http://www.mediapolis.org.uk/Papers/Gurpreet%20Bhasin.pdf  Closure and legacy  In 1914 Ali wrote, in The Comrade, an article entitled \\"The Choice of the Turks\\" in which he listed a series of wrongs that he said had been done against them by the British, but nonetheless advised the Turks to join with the Allies. This article proved to be the undoing for his paper. On 26 September 1914 The Comrade was banned by the colonial authorities, its deposit of Rs. 2,000 forfeited and all copies of the newspaper impounded under the provisions of the Press Act of 1910. After the withdrawal of the Non Cooperation Movement and the collapse of the Khilafat Movement in 1922, Ali, who along with his brother Shaukat Ali, had played an important role in them, revived The Comrade and the Hamdard in 1924, using them to preach a message of Hindu-Muslim amity. The Comrade however closed down two years later. In 1937, the Bengali journalist and freedom fighter Mujibur Rahman Khan founded an English periodical named The Comrade in honour of Maulana Mohammad Ali's eponymous original.

The painting also didn't destroy flatness of the wall, but on the contrary, underlined its constructive architectural details. Later works of Karabakhi, saving a mastery of ancient decorative paintings are distinguished for growth of realistic features in interpretation of distinct graphic motifs. A picture drawn by him in the house of Mehmandarov in Shusha city, where images of deer and pomegranate tree are distinguished for their free interpretation and sappiness of forms, is the most famous picture of the artist. The artist created on the basis of both earlier developed canonized schemes and immediate observations.

In her home state, she was known as Auntie Nona. She was an early proponent of the ancient form of the hula being perpetuated through teaching and public performances. Beamer was the granddaughter of Helen Desha Beamer. A cousin to Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame inductee Mahi Beamer, she teamed with him and her son Keola to form a touring North American troupe performing ancient hula and the Hawaiian art of storytelling. She was a teacher at Kamehameha Schools for almost 40 years, but had been expelled from that same school as a student in 1937 for dancing the standing hula. Beamer's sons Keola and Kapono are established performers in the Hawaiian music scene. Her grandson Kamanamaikalani Beamer is a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and CEO of the Kohala Center. She ran a Waikiki hula studio for three decades. In 1997‚Äîindignant at proposals to cut Hawaiian curriculum from Kamehameha Schools‚ÄîBeamer became the catalyst for public protest and legal investigation into Bishop Estate management, which eventually led to the removal or resignation of the trustees. Early life and background She was born Winona Kapuailohiamanonokalani Desha Beamer to Pono and Louise Beamer on August 15, 1923, in Honolulu, United States Territory of Hawaii (a state since 1959). Much of her early life was spent on the island of Hawaii, under the guidance and tutelage of her grandmother, Helen Desha Beamer, who taught her hula at about the age of three. As the cultural influence of the United States began to be felt on the territory, Beamer began to get more intensely involved in Hawaii's cultural heritage. Before she was a teenager, Beamer was composing meles by adding melodies to ancient chants. She attended Colorado Women's College, Barnard College, and Columbia University, studying anthropology. Beamer is credited with coining the term \\"Hawaiiana\\" as early as 1948. In 1949, she became a high school instructor of Hawaiian culture at Kamehameha Schools, and served in that position for almost 40 years. Hula and Hawaiian storytelling Beamer was briefly expelled in 1937 from the Kamehameha Schools for performing a standing hula. When Kamehameha Schools was established through the 1883 will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the original trustees of the Bishop Estate were Charles R. Bishop, Charles McEwen Hyde, Samuel M. Damon, Charles Montague Cooke, and William Owen Smith, who were either missionaries, or had ties to those in the profession. They found the hula too suggestive and had banned it from being performed at the school. The standing hula was not allowed to be performed on campus until the 1960s. Beamer was a pivotal influence in reviving the art of the ancient hula, in the face of a more commercialized version invented for the tourism trade in Hawaii. Beamer, her cousin Mahi Beamer, and her brother, Keola, formed their own touring North American dance troupe to promote the authentic ancient hula and the Hawaiian art of storytelling. She ran her mother Louise's Waikiki hula studio for three decades. The storytelling culture of Hawaii was expressed as entertainment in the royal courts and the private homes of the ancient Hawaiians. It came in an era before the written word was used as a method of preserving the histories, genealogies, and mythologies of the Hawaiian people. Winona Beamer brought international attention to the hula and other forms of Hawaiian storytelling through music and the Native Hawaiian arts. Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate Winona Beamer had been the Hawaiian culture instructor at the Kamehameha Schools when the curriculum became in danger of being cut. She wrote a May 1997 letter to the Hawaii Supreme Court, expressing her concerns, and asking for the resignation of trustee Lokelani Lindsey. Beamer became the catalyst for a groundswell that led to an investigation of the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate trust. Her letter resulted in a public outcry over the management of the estate trust. In November 1997, Beamer joined Isabella Aiona Abbott, Gladys A. Brandt, Roderick F. McPhee, and Winona Ellis Rubin in releasing a public statement calling for the removal of Lindsey from the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate. The statement was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin as part of its coverage of the investigation into the management of the trust. The investigation led to an investigation by the Hawaii attorney general, a reorganization of the trust, and the resignation of Lindsey. Death and legacy She became known as Auntie Nona in Hawaii, and was a champion of teaching authentic Hawaiian culture. In the course of her life, she published multiple books, music scores, and audio and video recordings. In 1983, she and Richard Towill formed Ka Himeni Ana to encourage participation in authentic Hawaiian music. Beamer moved to Lahaina, on the island of Maui, in 2006. On April 10, 2008, she died in her sleep in Lahaina. She was survived by her musician sons Keola and Kapono, her only grandchild, Kamanamaikalani Beamer, and two HƒÅnai (adopted, extended family) children: a daughter, Maile Loo Beamer, and a son, Kaliko Beamer-Trapp. On August 27, 2020 a documentary titled Hawaiina was released about Beamer.

The Spanish drove the outnumbered French soldiers out of their camp near Mas Deu and compelled them to retreat to Perpignan. The victory enabled the Spanish forces to lay siege to the Fort de Bellegarde, which dominated the best road through the Pyrenees from Barcelona into France. For the next month, Ricardos was preoccupied by the Siege of Bellegarde. Mas Deu is a former Knights Templar establishment east of the town of Trouillas in Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. The action was fought during the War of the Pyrenees, part of the War of the First Coalition. Background On April 17, 1793, Captain General Antonio Ricardos began the invasion of France when he descended on Saint-Laurent-de- Cerdans in the French Cerdagne with 4500 Spanish troops. The six battalions and eight grenadier companies led by Ricardos chased 400 French soldiers out of the village. The Spanish next headed for C√©ret on the Tech where they encountered one French regular battalion, 1000 volunteers, and four artillery pieces on 20 April. The clash ended disastrously for the 1800 French, who quickly took fright and ran away. Between 100 and 200 Frenchmen were casualties while another 200 drowned trying to swim across the Tech. Ricardos admitted losing only 17 men wounded in the skirmish.Smith (1998), 45 The Captain General left a force at Le Perthus to watch the garrison of the Fort de Bellegarde and keep it from interfering with his supply convoys.Rickard, Bellegarde On 14 May 1793, the French divisional general Louis-Charles de Flers took command of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. At about the same time, the French brigadier general, Luc Sim√©on Auguste Dagobert and Colonel Eustache Charles d'Aoust arrived with reinforcements from the Army of Italy. The French army was encamped on a hill high near Mas Deu, which is located east of Trouillas. The position overlooked the Aspres plain and was protected by two deep-cut stream beds.Prats, Bataille de Mas Deu The Chateau of Mansus D√©i was built by the Knights Templar in the 12th century and used as an administrative center for their extensive properties in Roussillon. In its heyday, the Templar establishment raised cattle, grapes, olives, and other crops on lands that stretched from Fenouill√®des in the north to Banyuls-sur- Mer in the south.Oliver, Chateau du Mas Deu The wealth and secrecy of the Templar Order made powerful enemies. Desiring to appropriate the order's riches, Philip IV of France, the Capetian king, demanded the arrest of all Templars in France in 1307. The knights were rounded up, put to the torture, burned at the stake in many cases; their wealth became the property of the French king. Philip soon bent Pope Clement V to his purposes and the Templar Order was suppressed outside France as well. In 1312 all property of the order was given to the Knights Hospitaller.Costain (1964), 157-164 In time, the name of the place changed to Mas Deu. In World War II, the German occupiers used the chateau as an ammunition dump. This was detonated in 1944, destroying the ch√¢teau, though some outbuildings survived to be used in the modern-day winery.Oliver, Chateau du Mas Deu. The source does not specify whether the Germans or the French resistance were responsible, or if the explosion was an accident. Battle Map of the eastern theater of the War of the Pyrenees On 16 May, Ricardos advanced from C√©ret with 12,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, 24 cannons, and six howitzers. Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 9th Duke of Osuna commanded the 4860-strong Spanish right wing. His deputy was Pedro Mendinueta y M√∫zquiz and the force included four battalions of Royal Guards and one battalion each of the Mallorca Line Infantry and Volunteers of Catalonia Light Infantry Regiments, and Andalusian artillery. Ricardos accompanied the 2460-man center, which was led by Luis Firm√≠n de Carvajal, Conde de la Uni√≥n. The 4680-strong Spanish left wing was led by Juan de Courten, Rafael Adorno, and Jos√© Crespo. The left was made up of three battalions of Walloon Guards, three companies from Tarragona, one battalion of an Irish regiment, one company each from Granada, Valencia, and Burgos, the Lusitania Cavalry Regiment, and artillery from New Castile. De Flers' staff worked out a plan whereby the French artillery would bombard the Spanish positions, pinning their infantry in place. Then the French left wing would make a feint attack against the Spanish right. After this distraction, the reinforced right wing would deliver the main French assault. To implement this strategy, De Flers had only 5,000 foot soldiers, 300 horsemen, 15 cannons, and nine howitzers. Claude Souchon de Chamron led the 1,180 men of the left wing. This comprised Pierre Fran√ßois Sauret's 7th Battalion of Champagne, Pierre Banel's 7th Battalion of the Aude, Charles Dugua's artillery of Gard, and Paul-Louis Gaultier de Kerv√©guen's 3rd Company of Lavaur. Dagobert's 2680-man right wing included Louis Andr√© Bon's 9th Battalion of Drome, Jean-Jacques Causse's 1st Battalion of Mont-Blanc Volunteers, Jacques Laurent Gilly's 2nd Battalion of Gard, Guillaume Mirabel's Herault Cavalry, and Antoine de B√©thencourt's 180 cavalrymen. De Flers and Joseph √âtienne Timoleon d'Hargenvilliers accompanied the 740 soldiers of the center. Ricardos planned to maneuver Conde de la Uni√≥n's cavalry and then send Courten's Walloon Guards on a sweep around the village of Thuir to hit the flank of the Mas Deu camp. At 5:00 AM on the morning of 17 May, two Spanish batteries under the command of the Prince of Montforte opened fire. Each battery was composed of 12 4-pound guns and four 6-inch howitzers. The bombardment went on until 9:00 AM with the French infantry sheltering in the ravines near the camp. Apparently this ended the action for the day, with the French troops holding firm despite the prolonged artillery barrage.Prats, Bataille de Mas Deu. The same article listed a total of six Spanish howitzers, but also asserted that four howitzers were in each battery. On the 18th, Ricardos reorganized his center, placing Jos√© Urrutia y de la Cases and Juan Manuel Cajigal in charge of the reserve cavalry. They were ordered to break through the French center where the troops of Victor Am√©d√©e Willot and Kerv√©guen stood. Kerv√©guen's counterattack against Cajigal's horsemen failed and Dugua's guns had to cover the withdrawal of Kerv√©guen's soldiers. Evening found the French line still intact but stretched by trying to hold back their adversaries' superior numbers. In the night, a rumor swept through the French camp that the Spanish were massacring the outposts. At 3:00 AM firing broke out between the pickets of both sides. Numbers of French troops panicked and fled back to Perpignan. That night, Bonaventure Benet, a priest who helped bury the French dead, spied out the location of each French unit and sent this information to Spanish headquarters. On 19 May, Sauret was wounded in the leg and his battalion lost heart and retreated. Exploiting this withdrawal, Ricardos ordered Osuna to break into the camp supported by the fire of 14 cannons. To counter Osuna's attack, Dagobert sent help from the right flank. The Bezieres Volunteer Battalion and the 2nd Battalion of Haute-Garonne counterattacked but were repulsed by the Spanish soldiers' disciplined ranks. The French began to abandon their camp and artillery. While his horsemen covered the retreat, Mirabel was wounded in the leg by an exploding howitzer shell. De Flers personally rallied one battalion, but it was driven off by the Spanish cavalry.Prats, Bataille de Mas Deu. The B√©zi√®res and Haute-Garonne battalions were not listed in the original order of battle. Possibly they were reinforcements.

Results The next day, Perpignan was crowded with demoralized soldiers and frightened refugees. The local political leaders appropriated churches, convents, and the homes of √©migr√©s to house the refugees. De Flers issued an address, \\"Soldiers, great cowardice has been committed. Some of the defenders of liberty have fled the satellites of despotism...\\" One volunteer battalion declared that it would not fight the Spanish and had to be disbanded. Historian Digby Smith credited the Spanish army with only 7,000 men in six line battalions, eight grenadier companies, and 30 provincial militia companies. He listed French casualties as 150 killed and 280 wounded, with three 6-pound cannons and six ammunition wagons becoming prizes of the Spanish. The Spanish admitted losing 34 killed but did not list the number of wounded. Rather than follow up his badly shaken opponents, Ricardos chose to turn back and invest the Fort de Bellegarde.Smith (1998),46 This fortress dominated the main road through the Pyrenees at the Col du Perthus.Goode, Bellegarde The Siege of Bellegarde began on 23 May and lasted until 24 June when Colonel Boisbrul√© surrendered the 1,450 surviving members of the garrison. Another 30 men had been killed and 56 wounded. The fortress was armed with 41 cannons and seven mortars. Ricardos maintained 6,000 Spanish troops and 34 guns in the siege lines.Smith (1998), 48 While the main siege went on, the Spanish were also obliged to reduce two outworks, Fort les Bains and Fort de la Garde. These places surrendered on 3 and 5 June, respectively. De Flers tried to send a resupply convoy into Bellegarde on 29 May, but the effort failed when the 3,350-man escort was driven off.Smith (1998), 47 On 24 May, de Flers began construction of the Camp de l'Union. This was laid out under the walls of Perpignan between the village of Cabestany on the east to the mill of Orles on the west. As a result of the battle, Dagobert was elevated in rank to divisional general, while Sauret was promoted to colonel. On the Spanish side, Osuna proved to be a difficult subordinate and was transferred to the Army of Navarre in the western Pyrenees in October.

Two were built; the second of which was later fitted with a high aspect ratio (30:1) wing, becoming the Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-9 Stratus. Design and development The Akaflieg Braunschweig or Akademische Fliegergruppe Braunschweig () is one of some fourteen German undergraduate student flying groups sponsored by their home technical university. Several have designed and built aircraft, often technically advanced and leading the development of gliders in particular. The Brunswick students had been exploring the use of GRP in a series of related gliders, beginning with the SB-6. From the SB-8 to the SB-10, wingspan and aspect ratio were progressively increased. Aspect ratio was increased from 23 to 36.6, resulting in aeroeleastic problems. =SB-8= The SB-8 is similar to the SB-7, which also had an aspect ratio of 23. It performed well but had difficult handling characteristics, attributed to its Eppler aerofoil section. The SB-8 has an wingspan, a two-piece wing of Wortmann FX 62 profile with an unswept leading edge, a slightly tapered centre section, and more strongly tapered outer sections. It is built around a box beam, with balsa ribs and a torsion shell of glass fibre laid over balsa. The wing is shoulder mounted at 1.5¬∞ dihedral, with Schempp-Hirth airbrakes at mid-chord midway along the center section and ailerons on the outer panels. Both SB-8 built have camber flaps on the inboard wing panel and ailerons which are coupled to the flaps (flaperons) on the outboard panels. The fuselage of the SB-8 is built with a fibreglass skin, over a balsa shell, with balsa vertical frames and two pine plywood main formers in the region between the wings. The nose is pointed and slightly drooped, with a short, single piece, canopy just ahead of the wings, tapering gently aft to a straight tapered balsa/GRP T-tail unit. The tailplane carries a conventional single piece elevator and the rudder is fabric covered. On the groung the SB-8 is supported by a retractable, unsprung monowheel undercarriage, assisted by a tail bumper. The first flight was made from Brunswick airport on 25 April 1967; testing confirmed that the glass fibre structure was too flexible and at high speeds the SB-8 exhibited wing flutter, limiting its maximum permitted speed to . The low wing loading also limited its smooth air cross country speed as there was no provision for ballast. Later, removable steel tubes filled with lead pellets were added to the wing roots of the SB-8 V1 to increase wing loading. A second aircraft, SB-8 V2, was therefore built with a stiffened, heavier wing and provision for water ballast, which addressed both aero-elasticity and wing loading problems, allowing the glider to fly safely, without flutter, at . =SB-9 Stratus= The SB-8 V2 had shown that glass-fibre wings could be made stiff enough to avoid aeroelastic flutter problems and that the higher aspect ratio produced the expected improvement in glide angle. It was natural for the next Akaflieg Braunschweig design to have a wing of greater span, replacing the wing of the SB-8 V2 airframe with a four-panel wing of similar construction but span. At the time of its first flight in January 1969 the SB-9 had probably the greatest span of any glider then flying, though the -span Holighaus Nimbus 1 flew only three days later. The increase in aspect ratio over the SB-8 increased the measured best glide ratio from 40:1 to 46:1 and decreased the measured minimum sink rate from to . The new wing took advantage of the flexibility of glass fibre to implement elastic flaps. The intention was to avoid the interruption to the wing profile at the hinge, particularly on the critical upper surface, and leakage through it by bending the upper surface instead. This method had been used earlier in the wooden-winged HKS-1 glider of 1953. Operational history Both SB-8s competed at the German National Championships of 1968, Wolfgang Beduhn finishing fifth in the V1 and Helmut Treiber seventh in the V2. The V2 went on to become the SB-9, but the V1 remained in regular use at Brunswick until 1989. It remained airworthy after that, though flown less often, and was still on the German Civil Aircraft register in 2010. The SB-9 was used by the Akaflieg students in competitions between 1969 and 1971. It also gave them the opportunity to film and study the alarming motions of the wing when fluttering, recording their observations on film in slow motion and in the air. Two antisymmetric, odd, sine-like lateral displacement modes were observed at . The fundamental mode was seen, at a frequency of 3.3 Hz but at the wing oscillated at 5.8 Hz in a second harmonic mode. During these largely vertical excursions, the wing also twisted and its overall motion excited vibrations in the rear fuselage and tail unit. The flutter problems were addressed by mass-balancing, the ailerons, and by a span reduction to . The career of the SB-9 ended in 1972, when it was decided to use its wing on the SB-10 two-seater, a new design with a very different fuselage and the span increased still further with an 8.7 m (28t ft 7 in) centre section.

Retrieved November 15, 2013.  Early life and career  Born to H. T. and Vasundhara Ramanujam into a middle-class Tamil family in the city of Pune, India. Sawant was raised mostly in Mumbai.https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/others/sunday-read/how-to-defeat- the-worlds-richest-person/articleshow/72204928.cms Her mother is a retired principal and her father, a civil engineer, was killed by a drunk driver when she was 13 years old. She describes her family as ‚Äúfull of doctors and engineers and mathematicians‚Äù but says that ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt exposed to any particular ideology growing up.‚Äù Sawant graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Mumbai in 1994. After moving to the United States with her husband Vivek, she decided to turn her attention to economics following a year and a half stint as a programmer. She received her PhD in economics from North Carolina State University in 2003.Rob Mackay, , KCPQ (January 6, 2014). Her dissertation was titled Elderly Labor Supply in a Rural, Less Developed Economy. Sawant has indicated that the genesis of her becoming a socialist began in India, a country plagued by immense poverty. This development was furthered when she arrived in the United States, the wealthiest nation in the world, and was surprised to encounter poverty and homelessness. In 2006, she attended a Socialist Alternative meeting after reading a pamphlet and proceeded to become a member.  Career  After moving to Seattle, she taught at Seattle University and University of Washington Tacoma and was an adjunct professor at Seattle Central College. She was also a visiting assistant professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. = Washington State House of Representatives campaign = In 2012, Sawant ran unsuccessfully for Position 1 in the 43rd district of the Washington House of Representatives, representing Seattle. Sawant also ran and advanced past the primaries as a write-in win for Position 2. Washington state law allowed her to choose the election in which she would run, but as a write- in candidate, she was not permitted to state her party preference. Sawant successfully sued the Washington secretary of state for the right to be listed as a Socialist Alternative member on the ballot. Sawant challenged incumbent House speaker Frank Chopp in the general election on November 6, 2012. She received 29% of the vote to Chopp's 70%.  Seattle City Council  = 2013 election = After her unsuccessful run for the House, Sawant entered the race for Seattle City Council with a campaign organized by the Socialist Alternative. She won 35% of the vote in the August primary election, and advanced into the general election for the at-large council position 2 against incumbent Richard Conlin, making her the first socialist to advance to a general election in Seattle since 1991. On November 15, 2013, Conlin conceded to Sawant when returns showed him down by 1,640 votes or approximately 1% of the vote. Sawant's victory made her the first socialist to win a citywide election in Seattle since Anna Louise Strong was elected to the School Board in 1916 and the first socialist on the City Council since A. W. Piper, elected in 1877. She was sworn into office on January 6, 2014. Sawant on $15/hr National Day of Action in 2015 Sawant declared a victory in May 2014 after Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced an increase in the minimum wage to $15, which was the cornerstone of her campaign for City Council, but she is not pleased that large corporations will be allowed a few years to phase in the wage hike. During a speech at the City Council on the day of the vote she said, \\"We did this. Workers did this. Today‚Äôs first major victory for 15 will inspire people all over the nation.\\" Several Democrats endorsed her candidacy. Celebrity endorsements included Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and System of a Down frontman Serj Tankian. Sawant received no endorsements from sitting councilmembers, while Mike O'Brien expressed support of the idea of third party candidates but explicitly declining to extend an endorsement of Sawant. The Stranger alt-weekly endorsed both her State House and her City Council candidacy. Councilman Nick Licata also declined to endorse her but spoke positively of her campaign saying, \\"she has been able to craft a message that is understandable, simple and eschews most of the rhetoric\\", and when her eventual election victory seemed unlikely, he expressed his hope that Sawant would not \\"disappear after the election if she loses. She represents the poor, the immigrants, the refugees‚Äîthe folks who are not in our City Council offices lobbying us.\\" = Tenure = During her campaign, Sawant said that, if elected, she would donate the portion of her salary as a City Council member that exceeded the average salary in Seattle. On January 27, 2014, she announced that she would live on $40,000 of her $117,000 salary.Jeff Black (January 27, 2014). Seattle's Socialist councilwoman to accept less than half of $117K salary. NBC News. Retrieved January 28, 2014. She places the rest into a political fund that she uses for social justice campaigns. Sawant called for the expansion of bus and light rail capacity with a millionaire's tax. She has also called for \\"transit justice\\", which would include free user fares; an increase in free transit services to the poor, especially communities in south Seattle; and restriction of transit options to communities that \\"can afford other options\\" until the foregoing measures are implemented.  Opposition to U.S. support of Israel During the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, Sawant urged the Seattle City Council to condemn both Israel's attacks on Gaza and Hamas's attacks on Israel, and called on President Obama and Congress to denounce the Israeli blockade of Gaza and to cut off all military assistance to Israel. Sawant's call to condemn Israel's actions prompted a response from Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer, calling for Sawant to retract the statement. = 2015 election = On April 7, 2015, journalist Chris Hedges endorsed Sawant.Kiley, Brendan (June 6, 2015) A Quick Interview With Journalist Chris Hedges. The Stranger.Connelly, Joel (June 7, 2015) Kshama Sawant: I represent \\"aspirations of tens of thousands of people\\". June 7, 2015  Campaign issues  The core issues of Sawant's campaign were a successful minimum wage increase to $15/hour, a successful \\"millionaire's tax\\" or income tax on wealthy Seattleites, and an unsuccessful rent control program. Back during the 2013 campaign, Sawant had said rent control is \\"something everyone supports, except real estate developers and people like Richard Conlin\\" and compared the legal fight for its implementation to same-sex marriage, and the legalization of marijuana in the United States, both of which she supports. Her campaign for a $15 an hour minimum wage has been credited for bringing the issue into the mainstream and attracting support for the policy from both Seattle former Mayors Michael McGinn and Ed Murray. In response to criticism that a $15 an hour minimum wage could hurt the economy, she said, \\"If making sure that workers get out of poverty would severely impact the economy, then maybe we don't need this economy.\\" She is also a supporter of expanding public transit and bikeways, ending corporate welfare, ending racial profiling, reducing taxes on small businesses and homeowners, protecting public sector unions from layoffs, living wage union jobs, and social services. Sawant's platform of non-local Seattle issues, like rent control, income tax, corporate welfare, supporting the minimum wage outside Seattle, in SeaTac, and other cities, and participating in the Seattle Arctic drilling protests drew as much criticism from Sawant's opponents as it won favor with her liberal supporters. Her District 3 opponent Pamela Banks said Sawant's status as a national figure, her travel and fundraising outside Seattle, speaking in support of her Socialist Alternative party, and her devotion to issues outside the jurisdiction of her City Council office were a dereliction of her primary duty to serve her constituents, \\"You can't represent the people without doing the work of government.\\" Banks' campaign said that Sawant was out of touch with her constituents, too busy to meet with them, and that Sawant's strident political positions were divisive, alienating potential allies. The Seattle Times, in their endorsement of Banks, said the City Council \\"isn't a job for an ideologue\\" and that \\"the District 3 seat is more than a podium\\", that it \\"needs a collaborative leader to work with other districts and balance resources and investment.\\" Results Sawant advanced through the primary election for City Council District 3 representative on August 4, 2015 with 52% of the vote, 18 percentage points ahead of her closest opponent, Pamela Banks at 34%. Voters returned Sawant to the City Council and made her the first District 3 representative in November 2015, with 17,170 votes counted for Sawant and 13,427 for Banks, or 56% to 44%. With incumbent O'Brien elected to District 6, and former Licata aide Lisa Herbold elected to District 1, they, along with Sawant, became the new progressive bloc of the Council, which became majority female with the addition of two other women, Debora Juarez and Lorena Gonz√°lez. Sawant, as one of the four people of color on the new Council, also became part of a younger and more diverse Council, the first to seat members by district in more than 100 years. = 2019 election = In 2019, Sawant ran against Egan Orion, a small business advocate and organizer of the city's annual LGBT pride festival. The 2019 Seattle City Council election gained national attention after Amazon spent an unprecedented $1.5 million on the campaign. The company, which is the largest private employer in the city, contributed the funds to a political action committee operated by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce which backs candidates the chamber considers to be more \\"business-friendly\\". The PAC supported Sawant's opponent in the race. Amazon became increasingly involved in city council politics after the passage of the Seattle head tax in 2018, which would have cost the company $11 million annually in order to fund public housing and homeless services. Shortly after enacting the tax, the city council voted 7‚Äì2 to repeal it, with Sawant being one of the two dissenters. On November 5, 2019, Sawant was elected to a third term on the Seattle City Council. = 2020 = Sawant and Mayor Jenny Durkan have repeatedly clashed, and in June 2020, Sawant said that the mayor should resign. In a letter to the Council president on June 30, 2020, Durkan asked the City Council to investigate Sawant under its city charter authority to punish members for \\"disorderly or otherwise contemptuous behavior,\\" writing that Sawant had participated in a march to her home, knowing that her address \\"was protected under the state confidentiality program because of threats against me due largely to my work as U.S. Attorney.\\" The mayor accused Sawant and others of acting \\"with reckless disregard of the safety of my family and children.\\" Durkan also alleged that Sawant had used her council office to promote the \\"Tax Amazon\\" ballot initiative, urged protesters to occupy the East Precinct police station, and involved Socialist Alternative in her council office staffing decisions. Durkan said that she respected policy disagreements with members, but that these disagreements, \\"do not justify a council member who potentially uses their position in violation of law or who recklessly undermines the safety of others, all for political theatre.\\" In response, Sawant accused Durkan of being the leader of a \\"pro-corporate political establishment\\" and of carrying out \\"an attack on working people's movements.\\"  Political positions  = Ideological views and political affiliations = Sawant is a member of the Marxist Socialist Alternative party, the United States section of the Trotskyist international organization the International Socialist Alternative, formerly the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI). Sawant has stated that she does not advocate for any system like the \\"bureaucratic dictatorship\\" of the former Soviet Union, but for \\"democratic socialism\\" meaning \\"the society being run democratically in the interest of all working people on the planet, all children - everybody who has needs, and all that being done in an environmentally sustainable manner.\\"Socialist in Seattle: Kshama Sawant‚Äôs revolution, the indigenous fight against Keystone XL.

In 2020, she spoke at a campaign rally for him at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington. = Involvement with Occupy = Sawant at Transgender Pride Day Proclamation Before running for office, Sawant received attention as an organizer in the local Occupy movement. She praised Occupy for putting \\"class,\\" \\"capitalism,\\" and \\"socialism\\" into the political debate. After Occupy Seattle protesters were removed from Westlake Park by order of Seattle Mayor Michael McGinn, Sawant helped bring them to the Capitol Hill campus of Seattle Central Community College, where they remained for two months. She joined with Occupy activists working with local organizations to resist home evictions and foreclosures, and was arrested with several Occupy activists including Dorli Rainey on July 31, 2012 for blocking King County Sheriff's deputies from evicting a man from his home. The Sawant state campaign criticized the raiding of Occupy Wall Street activists' homes by the Seattle Police Department's SWAT team. She also advocated on LGBT, women's, and people of color issues, and opposed cuts to education and other social programs. She gave a teach-in course at an all-night course at Seattle Central Community College. = Economic policies = Sawant has advocated the nationalization of large Washington State corporations such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon and expressed a desire to see privately owned housing in \\"Millionaire's Row\\" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood turned into publicly owned shared housing complex saying, \\"When things are exquisitely beautiful and rare, they shouldn't be privately owned.\\" During an election victory rally for her City Council campaign, Sawant criticized Boeing for saying it would move jobs out of state if it could not get wage concessions and tax breaks. She called this \\"economic terrorism\\" and said in several speeches that if the company moved jobs out of state, the workers should take over its facilities and bring them into public ownership. She has said they could be converted into multiple uses, such as production for mass transit. Sawant maintains that a socialist economy cannot exist in a single country and must be a global system just as capitalism today is a global system. = Environment, education, and immigration = Sawant greeting students that are touring Seattle City Hall Sawant unsuccessfully opposed the construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel calling it \\"environmentally destructive\\" and \\"something most people were against, most environmental groups were against\\". She unsuccessfully opposed the Seattle Public Schools Measures of Academic Progress test in public schools, and supported the teachers' boycott of the standardized tests. Sawant has called for a revolt against student debt saying that \\"the laws of the rich are unenforceable if the working class refuses to obey those laws.\\" She is an active member of the American Federation of Teachers union and has been critical of American labor union leadership, saying the leadership, \\"...in the last 30 years has completely betrayed the working class. They are hand in glove with the Democratic Party, pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into their campaigns, and they tell rank and file workers that you have to be happy with these crumbs...\\" Sawant believes the American Labor movement should break with the Democratic Party and run grassroots left-wing candidates. Sawant advocates for a moratorium on deportations of illegal immigrants from Seattle and granting unconditional citizenship for all persons currently in the United States without citizenship. She opposes the E-Verify system. =Arrest and statements on civil disobedience= On November 19, 2014, Sawant was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct at a $15 minimum wage protest in Seatac, Washington. She was released on $500 bail. On May 1, 2015, a SeaTac municipal court judge dismissed charges against her. The judge determined that testimony provided by police demonstrated that it was technically the police themselves, not protesters, who had blocked traffic. In a February 2017 article in the socialist magazine Jacobin, Sawant called for a \\"wave of protests and strikes\\" on May Day, including \\"workplace actions as well a mass peaceful civil disobedience that shuts down highways, airports, and other key infrastructure.\\"Kshama Sawant, Why We Should Strike on May Day, Jacobin (February 21, 2017). Her statement was controversial: Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said that it was \\"unfortunate and perhaps even tragic for an elected official to encourage people to confront and engage in confrontations with the police department\\" and the Washington State Patrol called the writings \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"reckless.\\"Steve Kiggins, , KCPQ (April 27, 2017). In June 2020, Sawant was criticized by the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) for working \\"along politically harmless channels by promoting illusions in local police reform\\" and for promoting \\"the anarchistic commune\\" known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). Following a June 20 shooting in the zone that left one man dead and another critically wounded, Sawant said there were \\"indications that this may have been a right-wing attack,\\" for which President Trump would bear \\"direct responsibility, since he has fomented reactionary hatred specifically against the peaceful Capitol Hill occupation\\". Two days later, The Seattle Times reported, Sawant \\"walked back her unfounded claim that the shooting 'may have been a right-wing attack.' She now says that appears to be incorrect.\\" Personal life Sawant is often reticent to speak about her personal life and background, preferring to stick to the issues. She has said that her entire family remains in India with her mother currently residing in Bangalore. During her 2013 campaign for the Seattle City Council, she indicated that she and her husband had been separated for nearly six years.Rob Mackay, , KCPQ (January 6, 2014).

It has a lake which is used for fishing. It is served by the A6 road.  Name  The name of Cocklakes originated in Old English with the \\"Cock-\\" part of the name coming from the Old English word for \\"throat\\" or \\"ravine\\". During the Middle Ages, the name was \\"Cock-Laik\\", which meant \\"cockpit\\" in Middle English. Due to the name, it has been often reported as one of the rudest place names in the United Kingdom, due to cock being a vulgar slang term for penis.  Mine  There had been small scale local mining in Cocklakes prior to the 19th century. Around 1830, the first commercial gypsum mining operations started. It was originally owned by John Howe & Co. before being transferred in 1910 to the Carlisle Plaster & Cement Company and later to British Gypsum in 1953. Cocklakes mine was also the first place to manufacture plasterboard in the United Kingdom, despite workers initially attempting to separate the paper from the plaster. Initially the mine operated on a small scale but due to the Second World War leading to a rise in demand for anhydrite for sulfuric acid. From there, the Cocklakes mine had an underground diesel railway constructed to help with the moving of raw materials. Following the end of the war, a number of migrant workers from Eastern Europe came to Cumbria to work at Cocklakes mine. The railway changed its locomotives to newer diesel trains in 1970 with their old ones being taken by Carnforth Steam Museum by William Steuart Trimble who would become the High Sheriff of Cumberland. In 1975, the railway was put on care and maintenance. References External links * Hamlets in Cumbria City of Carlisle ","title":"Cocklakes"},{"id":"36480714","text":"Vaizey is a surname.

The school was closed in 1945. Today the land is being used for non-aviation purposes.  History  The Hawthorne School of Aeronautics was a World War II civilian flying school, contracted by the United States Army Air Forces to conduct primary pilot training for aviation cadets. The school was under the supervision of the 58th Flying Training Detachment, Eastern Flight Training Center, Army Air Forces Training Command. The president of Hawthorne was Beverly \\"Bevo\\" Howard, who had learned to fly at the age of 16. The military designation of the Hawthorne school was the 2162nd Army Air Force Base Unit. In order to conduct the flying training, the school built an airfield along with buildings and other support structures. The airfield was an all-way turf field, with four delineated runways (00/18; 05/23; 09/27; 14/32). A large aircraft parking ramp and two hangars was also constructed along with a control tower and operations building. The school structures consisted of a group of one and two-storied wooden buildings surrounding an oval-shaped grass area at the northern end of the property which served as a parade ground. The primary trainer used was Boeing PT-17 Stearman. The flight school also operated several auxiliary airfields: * Jennings Aux Field - Aux No. 1 Orangeburg * Hagood Aux Field - Aux No. 2 Orangeburg * Kennedy Aux Field - Aux No. 3 Orangeburg File:Orangeburgaaf-1944-1.jpgAerial photo of Orangeburg Airport, South Carolina, 1944 File:Orangeburgaaf-1944-2.jpgParade Ground, Barracks and Parking Apron File:Orangeburgaaf-1944-3.jpgFormation of Free French flying cadets File:Orangeburgaaf-1944-4.jpgBoeing PT-17 Stearman at Orangeburg At the end of 1944, training of Free French pilots was transferred from Hargrove Van de Graaft Airport, Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Hawthorne. The unit was inactivated on 1 September 1945. During the Second World War, Hawthorne trained 5,924 military pilots, including more than 2,000 French Air Force students. For his leadership, Bevo Howard was presented the French Air Force Wings, the coveted French M√©daille de L'A√©ronautique, and later the Ordre National de la L√©gion d'honneur for his pilot training and accomplishments as an aerobatic flyer. Hawthorne School of Aeronautics 1943 photo pictorial The Hawthorne School of Aeronautics ceased operations at Orangeburg with the end of the war, however it went on to continue operations at Jacksonville, Florida, and Moultrie, Georgia. The firm eventually became the large Piedmont- Hawthorne chain of aviation Fixed-Base Operators. The airport was closed after the war, and was abandoned. The two hangars from the flying school were relocated at some point to the Orangeburg Municipal Airport at which there is also an excellent historical display of the activities of the Hawthorne school.

Since 1984, the wood has been owned by the Chiltern Society, which manages it as a nature reserve with the help of volunteers. Although an ancient woodland, most of the trees in the wood date from the end of the 1940s or later, as much of the wood was felled during the Second World War to produce Bryant and May matches. The wood is now home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including rare species of butterfly and moth. Geography Bottom Wood is located north of the A40 between Piddington and Stokenchurch, north-east of Studley Green and east of Beacon's Bottom. It is within the parish of Radnage, with the southern boundary meeting the border of Stokenchurch parish and the eastern edge meeting the boundary with West Wycombe parish. The southern boundary of the wood also used to mark the border between the counties of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, until county lines were redrawn in 1896.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 6. The wood is in a valley, with trees covering the south-facing valley slope. The elevation ranges from above sea level to above sea level.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 31. The wood covers a crescent-shaped area of ; the original wood is , and there is a newer plantation of on an area known as Toothill. The name Toothill comes from the Old English word tot, which means 'look-out', and the top of Toothill provides a good view across the valley in which Bottom Wood is situated.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 23. Typically for the Chilterns, chalk underlies the wood, with some clay and sand. There is a central bridleway running through the wood, which formerly provided a route for packhorses carrying goods between Piddington and Oxford, via Beacon's Bottom. A sewer now runs underground along this route, taking waste away from Beacon's Bottom.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 22. History The main part of Bottom Wood is ancient woodland,The term \\"ancient woodland\\" in the UK refers to woodlands that have existed continuously since at least 1600. although it is not known exactly how long the area has been wooded.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 5. Medieval documents show that the area was owned by the French Abbey of Fontrevaud, from the 12th century until 1413, when the land was returned to the Crown. The land was later given to Sir John Phillip and remained in the family for several years before coming under the ownership of Eton College and then the Earl of Caernarvon. It subsequently passed through several other hands, until it was acquired by John Scrope, owner of Wormsley Park, in 1737. The wood continued to be part of this estate until the 1930s. A tithe map from 1841 is the first known document naming the woodland as Bottom Wood;Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 5-6. at this time, the eastern section of the wood was known as Dean Hook.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 4. In the early 20th century, while the woodland was still part of the Wormsley estate, timber from Bottom Wood was sold each year at the King's Arms, Stokenchurch.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 7-8. Evidence of some of the saw pits, over which trees were cut into planks, can still be found in the wood. During a serious drought in 1921, the well in the wood proved to be an important feature, as it offered drinking water to local villagers when their personal water supplies ran dry. The well, which is now topped with concrete, is deep and provided a constant supply even in periods of drought.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 21. In the mid-1930s, the wood was sold to Mr Pitcher. During the Second World War, much of the wood was felled for the production of Bryant and May matches. Consequently, most of the trees in the wood date from the late 1940s or later, except for a few in the north of the wood. After the war, various species began to grow again in the woods, including cherry, beech and oak trees. In the 1950s, Mr Pitcher sold the wood to Mr Deane. Helped by the local scout troop, Mr Deane planted the adjoining field of Toothill, at the south-east end of the wood, with Sitka spruce and Scots pine trees. At the eastern edge of the wood, he also introduced some Douglas firs. Mrs Ercolani later bought the wood and managed it as a nature reserve, although much of the wood was untended and deteriorated during this time.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 8-9. In 1984, the wood was given to the Chiltern Society, which had recently set up a Small Woodlands Project (later renamed the Chiltern Woodlands Project) in an attempt to reverse the decline of small woodlands in the Chilterns. This project was overseen by Chairman Charles Mills and Project Officer John Morris. Bottom Wood was chosen as a site in which to train those working in the project in good woodland management methods. The three broad aims of the project were to encourage the growth and planting of trees native to the area, to improve the overall quality of trees in the wood, and to manage the wood as a nature reserve.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 9-10. A small team managed by the Chiltern Society began working in the wood in September 1983, spending an initial ten-week period clearing the bridleway through the wood, getting rid of rubbish that had accumulated under previous owners, and felling some trees in an attempt to encourage the growth of healthier specimens. This included a complete felling of of the Toothill plantation, which was replanted with 350 trees consisting mainly of ash, cherry, beech and whitebeam. Volunteers continued working to improve the quality of the wood in subsequent years, with some timber being sold to local businesses to fund the management project. Further selective felling took place, including in 1989 when further trees were removed in the Toothill section of the wood, with a central section of 0.5 ha remaining unplanted to form a chalk glade.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 10-13. Present use Bottom Wood is currently still owned by the Chiltern Society and managed as a nature reserve by volunteers from the Society's Bottom Wood Group, in conjunction with the Chiltern Woodlands Project. It is open to the public, and can be accessed via Old Dashwood Hill in Studley Green, with some car parking available on the road. Since 2010, the wood has been used by Mary Towerton School as part of a forest school educational programme. Wildlife Bottom Wood is a diverse environment which is home to over 700 plant and animal species. Formal cataloguing of some of these species has taken place, including research into the wood's plants by a PhD student, and a record of moths started in 1993.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 32. =Flora= Bottom Wood supports a wide variety of plants, due to the range of soil acidity and moisture levels across the woodland area. Rare flora includes coral-root bittercress and yellow bird's-nest. The wood is particularly known for its bluebells. The shrub layer is predominantly hazel.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 27. There are also a wide range of trees in the wood, including cherry, oak, ash and beech, yew and hornbeam. =Fauna= The wood is home to at least 25 different species of butterfly, which are particularly found in the area of open grassland in the Toothill section. Three rare species have been sighted, namely the grizzled skipper, the small blue and the white-letter hairstreak. The Duke of Burgundy was also recorded in the wood in 1989.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 33-35. 251 different moth species have been recorded in the wood, including five species classified as 'nationally notable b', meaning that they have been recorded in less than 4% of Great Britain. These species are Drepana cultraria, Paradarisa consonaria, Paradarisa extersaria, Cerastis leucographa and Lithophane hepatica.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, pp. 37-39. Dormice are present in the wood, and are carefully monitored as a protected species. Red kites are frequently seen in the area, as are other rare bird species such as lesser spotted woodpeckers and marsh tits. A red deer was also once sighted in the wood. As with other Chiltern woodlands, trees in Bottom Wood have been damaged by grey squirrels stripping their bark. Management measures are in place to control the squirrel population.Figg, et al., Bottom Wood, p. 20.

The school conducted electronic keyboard music workshops in collaboration with the University of Mumbai from 1996 to 2005, until it came under controversy for allegations of witchcraft and black magic, by parents of some students. Cases were filed in the Bombay High Court regarding the same, and were later dismissed by the Supreme Court of India. Music education Students learn music in a course conducted by the Boss School in Mazagoan, Mumbai (1998) School children learn music under the Music in Schools programme, conducted by the Boss School in Tardeo, Mumbai (2005) The Boss School of Music was founded as a nonprofit organisation in 1996. The school conducted short-term electronic keyboard music courses in suburban Mumbai for novices and professionals, after which students could reportedly perform certain pieces on the electronic keyboard, read music notation and write their own compositions. During its tenure, musicians, educationists, doctors, artists and engineers joined the school as staff, working on a non- salaried basis to design better methods of music education. They ran centres in Bandra, Colaba, Dadar, Vile Parle and Churchgate. They prepared students for standardised graded examinations conducted by Trinity College London in Mumbai, requiring 3‚Äì6 months of training using their methods. Such examinations reportedly required up to 8 years of training using traditional methods. Their education method utilised audio-visual technology and simplified concepts. Students were provided with keyboards during classes, and were given supplementary books and CDs printed and published by the school. They entered into a collaboration with the Department of Music, University of Mumbai in 2002, and conducted classes that could reportedly train a novice student into becoming a music teacher in 6 months. Dr. Vidyadhar Vyas, Head of the Music Department at the university claimed that they \\"revolutionized\\" music learning by teaching complex musical concepts in short periods of time. Controversy In 2005, parents of some students filed cases in the Bombay High Court accusing the school of practising witchcraft and black magic. Investigations by the Mumbai Police found no evidence for such claims, and a local representative of Trinity College London confirmed that the examination certificates received by the students were authentic. The police halted investigation awaiting evidence and witnesses for the allegations. Due to attacks by local mobs and fearing their safety, the school staff and researchers subsequently left their Thane premises. In 2008, several staff members of the school proceeded to the Supreme Court of India with cases against individuals, government officials and High Court judges for shutting down the institution, defamation and \\"witch-hunting\\", an act they termed \\"genocide\\". The Supreme Court dismissed their cases, reportedly because it contained allegations against high-ranking officials, judges and police. The Supreme Court also arrested 4 of the staff members on grounds of contempt, after a staff member hurled a slipper at a Supreme Court judge. The High Court cases regarding the allegations were dismissed by the Supreme Court. Another three staff members filed cases in the Federal Court of Australia, accusing the Sydney-based Exclusive Brethren sect for committing a \\"genocide\\" by destroying their group, and bribing Indian officials and judges to do so. Reportedly, they did not have the funding for proper legal representation, and appeared in court without lawyers. The Federal Court questioned its ability to order the Australian Federal Police to investigate the matter, and the case was adjourned. While defending High Court cases that claimed she was \\"mentally unsound\\", one of the staff members received two gold medals from the Mumbai University for topping the board that year.

Early life Dzapshba was born on 1 January 1961 in the village of Barmysh, Gudauta District. He attended high school in Bambora and graduated in 1975. From 1979 until 1981, Dzapshba served in the Soviet Army. He then studied at the police school in Cheboksary until 1993, when he entered the police department in Tomsk, serving in different positions until 1991. Career in Abkhazia In 1991, Dzapshba returned to Abkhazia. Between 1991 and October 1993, Dzapshba held various positions within the Interior Ministry. In October 1993, he became Deputy Minister. On 10 July 1996, Dzapshba was appointed Deputy Head of Abkhazia's Security Service. In 2002, he was appointed First Deputy Minister for Taxes and Levies. In 2007, Dzapshba additionally became President of the Abkhazian Football Federation. On 12 August 2010, Otar Khetsia was dismissed as Minister for Internal Affairs of Abkhazia and subsequently (on 18 August) appointed Secretary of the State Security Council. Khetsia was temporarily succeeded by First Deputy Minister Ramin Gablaia, until on 22 September Leonid Dzapshba was made the new Interior Minister. On 20 October 2011, after Alexander Ankvab became President following the sudden death of Sergei Bagapsh, he once again replaced Dzapshba as Interior Minister by Othar Khetsia. Indictment for corruption On 25 June 2012, Dzapshba was indicted for the embezzlement of 7,832,368 rubles while he was head of the Abkhazian Football Federation. On 3 July, Dzapshba defended himself in an interview with the newspaper Nuzhnaya. In reply, the Prosecutor General's office released a statement on 9 July. It alleged that Dzapshba had abused funds to buy cars for himself and for family, and to travel to Russia and Europe, supposedly to meet FIFA President Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini. On 12 July, Dzapsha held a press conference, supported by Sergei Shamba, who had been Prime Minister at the time of the supposed acts of malpractice. Dzapshba denied the accusations of the Prosecutor's Office, stating that he had in fact met Blatter and Platini, as evidenced by a letter of thanks written by President Bagapsh. In addition, Dzapshba asserted that the 7 million ruble deficit had arisen in the construction of football pitches, and that he had received permission from President Bagapsh to cover the shortfall with government funds, but that this was thwarted by Bagapsh's death. On the same day, a group of relatives of Dzapshba also sent an open letter addressed to President Ankvab. 2014 Presidential election Dzapshba unsuccessfully participated in the 2014 Presidential election with running mate Boris Abitov, scoring a 3.4% fourth place. The pair had been nominated by an initiative group on 27 June. Dzapshba's campaign manager was former Chairman of the State Committee for Youth Affairs and Sports Rafael Ampar. His candidate for the post of Prime Minister was former Foreign Affairs Minister Maxim Gvinjia. Interior Minister (second time, 2015‚Äì2016) On 9 October 2015, President Raul Khajimba dismissed Interior Minister Khagba, and appointed Dzapshba to the post again. In the run-up to the 2016 presidential recall referendum, Dzapshba gave a speech to officials at the Ministry that angered opposition activists, who claimed Dzapshba had pressured the officials not to participate in the referendum and threatened them with dismissal. On 20 June, three of Dzapshba's predecessors as Interior Minister, Abesalom Beia, Otar Khetsia and Raul Lolua, called upon President Khajimba to dismiss him. On 5 July, some opposition activists stormed the Ministry and demanded i.a. Dzapshba's resignation. As a concession to the protestors, Khajimba suspended Dzapshba for the duration of an investigation into the matter by the Prosecutor General. On 26 July, Prime Minister Artur Mikvabia resigned. On 16 August, MP and former State Customs Committee Chairman under President Vladislav Ardzinba Aslan Kobakhia was appointed Interior Minister (and Vice Premier) instead of Dzapshba, while Dzapshba was appointed presidential advisor on law enforcement agencies.

Sindhi Hindus are Sindhi people who follow the Hindu religion and who originate from the Sindh region of modern Pakistan, which was previously a part of pre-partition India. The Sindhi are known as (Perso-Arabic), ‡§∏‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡•Ä (Devanagari). After the Partition of India during 1947, many Sindhi Hindus were among those forced out of Pakistan, which was predominately Muslim, to India, in what was a wholesale exchange of Hindu and Muslim populations in some areas. Some later emigrated from the sub-continent and settled in other parts of the world.Rita Kothari, Burden of Refuge: Sindh, Gujarat, Partition, Orient Blackswan. Even though there 2011 census listed 2.8 million speakers of Sindhi in India, however the total population of is likely to be mucher higher as many people have either switched to other languages or have stopped speaking it. Hinduism in Sindh Hinduism in the Sindh region, as in other areas of the Indian Subcontinent, was the earliest religion predominantly practiced. Later the area can under control of Qasim after he defeated Hindu Raja Dahir And Bappa rawal of Rajasthan.In the reign of Delhi Sultanate Hinduism and buddhism declined very much in this area and became minority religion.But atleast 2 million Sindhi Hindus are still in this area. Partition of India After the partition of India in 1947, an estimated half of Sindh's Hindus migrated to India, often forced by the religious-based persecution of the time. They settled primarily in neighbouring Kutch district of Gujarat, which bears linguistic and cultural similarities to Sindh, and the city of Mumbai. As per Census of India 2011, there are around 2,772,264 Sindhi speakers living in India. There are also sizable Sindhi Hindu communities elsewhere in the world, sometimes termed, the 'Sindhi diaspora'. Family naming conventions Most Sindhi Hindu family names are a modified form of a patronymic and typically end with the suffix \\"-ani\\", which is used to denote descent from a common male ancestor. One explanation states that the -ani suffix is a Sindhi variant of 'anshi', derived from the Sanskrit word 'ansh', which means 'descended from' (see: Devanshi). The first part of a Sindhi Hindu surname is usually derived from the name or location of an ancestor. In northern Sindh, surnames ending in 'ja' (meaning 'of') are also common. A person's surname would consist of the name of his or her native village, followed by 'ja'. The Sindhi Hindus generally add the suffix ‚Äò-ani‚Äô to the name of a great-grandfather and adopt the name as a family name.

One-Shots/Limited Series =Euthanized= Vlad and Cassie must battle Bobby, a vengeful, undead slasher with the ability to control dead animals. Bobby was revealed to have been a mentally handicapped veterinary assistant accidentally murdered by the vet's fiance, who was jealous of their friendship. This issue has a 4-page origin for Cassie, whose mother's backstory as a killer and slasher are yet to be expanded upon. =Girls Gone Dead= Vlad and Cassie battle Father Wrath, a slasher being controlled by a devoutly crazy Catholic schoolgirl, Laura Lochs. Father Wrath was a traveling Baptist preacher, who was murdered by his nephew when he tried to sexually assault him.

After Cassie is fatally wounded, Ernie sacrifices his life to revive her, and is reborn in a new reality elsewhere. =Land of Lost Toys= Cassie and Vlad battle an undead child, Ashley Guthrie, with the ability to kill people in their dreams. They find out his mother killed him (because he was a horrible child), but he was reborn in the dream plane (ala Freddy Krueger) and uses toys to murder his victims.

Vlad's origin has a four-page spread similar to Cassie's. =Trailers= Short 2‚Äì3 page \\"trailers\\" of books. So far, only \\"Tub Club\\" has been fully expanded, but one of the stories evolves out of \\"Girls Gone Dead\\" and \\"Comic Book Carnage\\", leading to \\"Vs Chucky\\". One of the trailers has Cassie and Vlad take down slasher Hibachi Devil, who reappears in \\"Slice Hard\\". =25-cent Preview= \\"Euthanized\\"'s 4 page spread (Cassie's origin) is reprinted, along with a lead-in to \\"Slice Hard\\" where Vlad and Cassie are captured by a corporation. =Slice Hard= Several slashers (Hibachi Devil, Acid Angel, Mortimer Strick, X-O, and Waking Man), most featured in Cassie's origin, and never actually encountered in the comic series to date, are held prisoner by a company run by Emily Christy, a former Ms. America, that wants to use the slashers to develop anti-aging remedies. If a captured Cassie agrees to help capture the slashers, the company promises to use plastic surgery on Vlad. Ashley, now in a stuffed bear body, has other ideas when it breaks in and frees the slashers, who go after the director, Cassie, and Vlad. In the process, all the slashers are defeated, but Christy uses the \\"slasher formula\\" on herself, becoming a new slasher, named Ms. America. =Vs. Chucky= Cassie and Vlad take on Chucky in a story taking place after the film Seed of Chucky. Serves as a sequel to \\"Girls Gone Dead\\". Laura Lochs uses an ancient relic to body swap out of her currently burnt to a crisp remains and into the body of none other than Vlad. It then falls upon Cassie, Vlad (Now in Laura Loch's body) and Chucky to end the now near unstoppable Loch's evil plans before she can kill several of Cassie's close friends, all having been captured and used in Laura's sick game of revenge. Cassie must also deal with the unlikely and deadly partnership with Chucky, whom she knows all too well can turn and try to kill her at any given moment. =Hack/Slash vs. Halloween Man= It was announced that a crossover with webcomic Halloween Man. Chapter 1 was released online on October 15.Devil's Due Presents HACKoween!, Comics Bulletin, October 2, 2008 = Entry Wound = A cosmic disturbance (caused by Mary Shelley Lovecraft battling a number of superheroes in another dimension) results in all holiday themed slashers to awaken early, prompting Cassie and Vlad to begin frantically hunting them all down. The main villain of the story is Peter Lapage (the Candlemas Murderer) a Pennsylvania centered slasher based on Groundhog Day. = The Living Corpse Annual = In the middle of the woods a pair of campers are frightened away by the Jersey Devil, who in turn is sent home by the Living Corpse. After encountering the fleeing campers Cassie and Vlad go looking for the Jersey Devil, finding it in an abandoned house and dispatching of it with surprising ease, enraging the creature's witch parent Mother Leeds. On the way back to the van Vlad runs into and briefly fights Corpse, but the two are broken up by Cassie (who is acquainted with Corpse). As Cassie and Corpse exchange pleasantries Mother Leeds attacks, wanting revenge for the death of her son (who Corpse states was actually harmless and the only thing keeping the unstable Mother Leeds in check). Producing a never ending stream of ferocious demon \\"children\\" Mother Leeds is killed when Vlad stops her spawn from exiting her body by forcibly cramming Corpse up inside her, causing the witch to explode from the pressure. = My First Maniac = A four issue miniseries, and the first Hack/Slash books to be published by Image, the series explores Cassie's teenage years, showing her life directly after the second death of her mother, and before she met Vlad. After doing some research regarding the possible existence of slashers (through urban legends), Cassie decides to leave her foster home and travels to Manchester, Iowa, where there's a legend of an undead farmer that kills those who trespass on his land. Cassie, though becoming comfortable with the local teens, soon discovers that the slasher is actually the angry spirit of a rebellious young man named \\"Matthew,\\" who is now known as a slasher called \\"Grinface\\" and has help committing his murders by his killer/girlfriend Sarah (a teen Cassie befriended). In the end, Grinface turns on Sarah and is killed by Cassie, who fulfills Sarah's dying wish of destroying her body (so she wouldn't become a slasher). The miniseries ends with Cassie sneaking up and attacking Vlad in Chicago, whom she believes to be a slasher. = A Slice of Hell = Crossover with Devil's Due Publishing character Mercy Sparx.

Ongoing series =Hack/Slash: The Series (Volume 1)= Gross Anatomy (#1) Cassie was used as bait to lure in a slasher, who captures her and tortures her by removing two of her toes in between flashbacks to Hack/Slash: Euthanized (the original one-shot). Vlad frees her and Cassie breaks down to tears at where their life has gotten her. Shout at The Devil (#2‚Äì4) Cassie is sent to the hell dimension of Nef by a rock singer who bargained success for the ritual periodic sacrifice of virgins, and once again it is up to Vlad to save the situation, losing his virginity to be able to take Cassie back. Love Stories (#5) Emily Cristy aka Ms. America is brought back by a group of scientists who are attempting to understand how \\"Revenants\\" (i.e., Slashers) are made. Ms. America escapes, killing one of the scientists and stealing his skin. Cassie and Vlad take a backseat in this issue and their story involves Vlad being ill and Cassie selling her mother's wedding ring so they have enough money to stay in a motel, which will be better for his health. Also Chris and Lisa have a side- story involving a confrontation with Lisa's ex-boyfriend Kyle (last seen in Hack/Slash: Euthanized). Afterwards, Chris and Lisa begin a (mostly physical) relationship. Double Date (#6) A slightly tongue-in-cheek issue done in the style of Archie Comics surrounding the return of Father Wrath, who turns out not to be the original Slasher seen in Hack/Slash: Girls Gone Dead but a teenager named Samuel Lawrence. Samuel is revealed to be Father Wrath's nephew before he is killed by Vlad. Tub Club (#7‚Äì9) Cassie and Vlad investigate a college in Massachusetts where a series of corpses have been discovered, which have been reduced to a pile of flesh. Cassie and Vlad's relationship is somewhat rocky due to the amount of time Cassie has been spending on the phone with Georgia. After Vlad is attacked, Cassie begins questioning the local students and discovers that a number of them are lesbians who are involved in a cult surrounding the mythology of Elizabeth Bathory. After accidentally kissing one of the students, Cassie interrogates her to find out more information about the cult. Before the student, Amber, can lead her to the cult's base of operations, Cassie encounters a government team who are also investigating the situation. One of the team admits that they worked for Cassie's father, Dr. Jack Hack and tells Cassie that he knows how to find him. Cassie, Vlad and the government team are led by Amber into the cult's underground base. They are attacked by Ms. America, who has become stronger by stealing the blood and skin of students in an attempt to regain her original beauty. After a long battle, Vlad, now more comfortable with his own deformities, impales Ms. America. Afterwards, Cassie and Vlad reconcile, though Cassie is uncertain of her feelings towards Georgia. Little Children (#10) Following the clue given to them by the government agent at the college, Cassie and Vlad investigate a cabin in Montana in the hopes of finding information about Cassie's father: Dr. Jack Hack. They find a series of journals describing government-sponsored research performed on a group of feral children. The children were injected with a drug called \\"Rev-D\\", which theoretically will turn them into \\"Revenants\\" i.e., Slashers. Just as Cassie and Vlad are preparing to leave with the journals, the cabin is fire-bombed by the children. Cassie and Vlad manage to escape from the burning cabin but Vlad refuses to hurt the children as it is against his moral code. Upon escaping, Cassie shoots the children, something that Vlad is not comfortable with. At the end, Cassie, in need of comfort, phones Georgia. The Coldest Dish (#11) Cassie and Vlad hunt down Nathan, a one-eyed vigilante, who Cassie believes is a Slasher. However, he is actually hunting down the men he holds responsible for killing his wife and mutilating him. Nathan gets his revenge but dies from a gunshot wound. Between Slasher activity, Cassie attempts to track down her father using a list of government-created false identities she found in the Montana cabin, while at the same time still pondering her feelings for Georgia. Meanwhile, \\"Pooch\\" (the demonic dog from Shout at The Devil) has come to Earth looking for Cassie. As Cassie is busy, she asks Chris to track him down. Using items of Cassie's as bait, Chris locates Pooch and the pair of them return to Chris and Lisa's. Murder/Suicide (Hack/Slash Annual) Chris alerts Cassie and Vlad to the mysterious simultaneous suicides of a number of SuicideGirls. It turns out that the deaths are the work of D1ab0liq, a megalomaniacal and misanthropic blogger and thrill-killer who was electrocuted in a fight with police after being turned in by his Suicide Girl girlfriend. Now an undead entity existing as pure information on the internet, D1ab0liq is capable of possessing people via their computers and forcing them to kill themselves and others. Cassie joins the Suicide Girls website and posts an erotic photoset as an attempt to lure D1ab0liq into attacking her. Cassie and Vlad manage to at least temporarily destroy D1ab0liq, but at the cost of the life of a Suicide Girl whose body he was possessing at the time. BUMPed (#12‚Äì13) The story begins with Cassie having another in a series of recurring nightmares about Milk & Cheese. Afterwards, Cassie and Vlad decide to investigate the \\"Hitchfield Massacre\\" that has been headlining the newspapers. They investigate the scene where several college girls disappeared and find torn clothing, claw marks and encounter a reporter named Phil O'Grady who is also investigating the murders. While Phil shows Cassie a recording of one of the killings a local policewoman is violently killed by a treehugger ‚Äì presumably the same creature responsible for the killings. The creature moves on to attack the Phil's trailer and eventually Vlad kills the treehugger. Following the trail of treehuggers, the group eventually discover a clearing in the forest containing a dilapidated house. Inside they discover a display of human flesh, a horde of treehuggers and eventually encounter Eddie, the creator and puppetmaster of the treehuggers. After a prolonged battle between Vlad and Eddie, Phil pushes Eddie down into the basement. Cassie and Vlad follow, only to discover that Eddie has murdered and mutilated Phil. They also find a store of \\"empty\\" treehuggers awaiting trapped souls, including one labelled \\"Kassy\\". Determined to put an end to the treehuggers, they decide to burn the house down and leave, but are aware that Eddie is still alive. Meanwhile, we discover that an elderly woman named Muffy Joworski (who we were briefly introduced to in Hack/Slash #10) has been tracking Cassie's movements and believes that she is not only responsible for the killings but is in fact \\"the most prolific serial killer in the world\\". At the same time, we see a pair of hired workmen digging up the coffin of Delilah Hack aka The Lunch Lady. Over The Rainbow (#14) Georgia joins a film crew making a remake of The Wizard of Oz after hearing of a murder on set that appears to be the work of a slasher. However, she is on the point of being killed by the slasher when Cassie and Vlad arrive, and is only rescued in the nick of time. Cassie is initially outraged that Georgia has put herself in danger trying to help her, but finally admits how much Georgia means to her, and kisses her non-sexually. Meanwhile, Muffy Jaworski has a vision of the murders committed by Father Wrath in Girls Gone Dead, but sees Cassie as the killer. Finally, Cassie's father Jack Hack at last appears in the comic, meeting Dr. Herbert West in the basement of a head shop. Cassie and Vlad Meet the Re-Animator (#15‚Äì17) Following the list of false identities from Montana, Cassie and Vlad finally find Jack, who is collaborating with Herbert West in an attempt to resurrect Cassie's mother, Delilah, and bring her back to sanity. It turns out that Jack was involved with the sinister government agency that has been researching slashers, and was studying Delilah because her psychological profile suggested that she might become one. However, he fell in love with her and married her, but finally abandoned Cassie and Delilah when the agency tried to force him to accelerate Delilah's potential transformation. Unfortunately, before the family can be reconciled, an only half-restored and still unstable Delilah breaks free. In the resulting mayhem, Delilah eventually kills Jack, and Cassie is forced to help West to kill her mother yet again. Cassie reluctantly allows West to go free. Meanwhile, the Lords of Nef, angered by Pooch's failure to fulfil his mission, select a female demonic warrior and send her to Earth with orders to kill Cassie. Closer (#18‚Äì20) After losing both her parents again, Cassie becomes an emotional wreck and so Vlad phones Georgia in the hope that Cassie will open up to someone. Upon her arrival, Cassie breaks down in her arms leaving Vlad feeling worthless and he retreats to a bar. Cassie and Georgia continue to talk and Cassie confesses that she wants to simply be a normal girl. After a soft kiss, the two of them begin to make out. Vlad returns from the bar to overhear muffled kissing, causing him to become even more jealous. Muffy Joworski continues to investigate slasher incidents, however all leads indicate Cassie is the killer. Therefore, when Cassie goes to the police station to offer information, she is arrested on suspicion of a series of murders. Elsewhere, a demon assassin arrives from Nef with the goal of eliminating both the traitorous Pooch and Cassie. This results in an attack on Lisa and Chris' house by the assassin, who uses Lisa's ex-boyfriend Kyle as a hostage. However, Pooch leads away the assassin in order to save his new masters and is almost killed in the process. Vlad confronts Georgia about his feelings on the two of them, but is interrupted by a call from Cassie asking for help. Vlad visits Cassie in jail and they deduce that the false visions are coming from Ashley Guthrie, the only slasher they've encountered who can influence dreams. This does not convince the police and Cassie is taken to another facility. However, in transit the van is attacked and Cassie is kidnapped by a group called the \\"Black Lamp Society\\", who try to sacrifice her for her \\"crimes\\" against slashers. The arc ends with her being rescued by a mysterious masked man called Samhain. Mind Killer (#21‚Äì22) Cassie awakens after sleeping for two days, once again safe in her van with Vlad and Georgia. They are soon reunited with Gertrude Hall (last seen in Shout at the Devil). The group end up getting in a brawl and are thrown in jail. Ashley's hold over Muffy Joworski becomes more powerful and he possesses her body in order to go after Cassie, enlisting the aid of banished rocker Six Sixx in order to do it. However, he accidentally unleashes more creatures from a hell dimension who capture and torture the group. Six Sixx manages to break free and, after having his powers recharged in Nef, returns to free his fellow hostages. He then returns to Nef with Muffy/Ashley as a payment to his masters for his newly restored abilities. Upon returning to the hotel room a naked Georgia surprises Cassie and suggests they have sex but Cassie turns her down. She then tells Georgia that she is going to continue hunting slashers and that her time with Georgia was a \\"mistake\\" because she was wrong about her sexuality. Double Feature (#23) 14 years ago, a young \\"Nancy Drew type\\" girl named Cat thinks she has found a clue in a crime that has been overlooked by police investigators. However, the police accuse her of being a pest and she decides to investigate it alone. She discovers an item in a house that contains a black oil, which when burned gives off a unique black flame. Then, using her spy equipment, she overhears the residents of the house talking about the Black Lamp Society. However, she is discovered and stabbed by a pumpkin-masked Samhain. Back in the present, Cassie and Lisa are shopping for gear to aid in the hunting of the \\"Snow Blower\\" who has been killing local dogs. They decide to use Pooch as bait and soon enough Cassie and Lisa confront the slasher. Meanwhile, at Lisa and Chris's house, the rest of the gang are enjoying Christmas festivities and Gertrude comforts Georgia about her break-up with Cassie. Sons Of Man (#24‚Äì25) Samhain enlists the help of Cassie and Vlad in an attempt to bring down the Black Lamp Society. Samhain reveals to them the origin of Slashers as well as the fact that he is one, albeit a reformed one. Together, the trio attempt to infiltrate the Society's base and encounter some of the society's mutated creations. During the fighting Samhain is captured and reprogrammed to be a Slasher once more, starting his killing spree with his ex-lover Ava Park. However, a passionate kiss from Cassie breaks his brainwashing. Together they eliminate one of the Society's leaders and escape.

Interpretation \\"A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind\\" addresses the question of the proper use of reason, and is generally assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism. The narrator subordinates reason to sense. It is based to some extent on Boileau's version of Juvenal's eighth or fifteenth satire, and is also indebted to Hobbes, Montaigne, Lucretius and Epicurus, as well as the general libertine tradition. Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself, or a satirised persona. It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II. Reception It is generally supposed to have been written before June 1674, which is the dating of the earliest surviving manuscript. Along with A Ramble in St. James's Park, it is one of Rochester's best known works, and his most influential during his lifetime. It exists in some 52 manuscripts, more than any other work by the poet. It resulted in four direct poetic responses; Edward Pococke's An Answer to the Satyr against Mankind, Thomas Lessey's A Satyr In Answer to the Satyr against Man, and the two anonymous responses An answer to a Satyr [against] Reason & Mankind and An Answer to the Satyr, Against Man. It is alluded to in John Crowne's The Country Wit. It has been argued that John Dryden addressed the poem in Religio Laici.

He was born in 1970 in Sydney, New South Wales. He moved with his family in 1983 to Melbourne, Victoria, where he currently lives and works.  Early life and influences  Graham decided to become an artist from a very young age. His career was strongly influenced by his parents ‚Äì Carolyn Graham, a self-taught printmaker and his father, Bob Graham, a well- known children‚Äôs picture book author and illustrator. Graham graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Painting) from the Victorian College of the Arts, Prahran campus (Melbourne) in 1991, where he studied under Philip Hunter. After leaving art school, Graham received the support and patronage of James Mollison AO, former director of the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria. Graham accompanied James Mollison and Vincent Langford overseas to view art museums in New York, Paris and Rome in 1992, and London and Germany in 1997.  Career  Graham‚Äôs first solo exhibition, ‚ÄòDepot‚ÄîAnimal Magician‚Äôs Hut‚Äô, was held at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, in 1990, on the invitation of its director, Grazia Gunn. The theme of the exhibition was the traveller-explorer: of astronauts journeying into space juxtaposed against the terrestrial search for a wild puma that had been sighted in the Victorian countryside.Grazia Gunn, ‚ÄúHunting the Puma: The Work of Peter Graham‚Äù, Art and Australia, Vol. 35 No. 3, 1998, pp. 382-89. http://www.artaustralia.com/contents.asp?issue_id=41 It was through this search that Graham met his future wife, Caitlin, who was introduced to him because she had sighted the elusive puma while out horseback riding. Since then, Graham has had a dozen solo exhibitions with Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, and Kaliman Galleries, Sydney. In his Tolarno exhibitions ‚ÄòSong of Substance‚Äô in 1994 and ‚ÄòSound of No Shore‚Äô in 1996, his surfaces were ‚Äúdense with different media and techniques, including photography, woodcut, gouache, sewing, charcoal, graphite, and acetate.‚ÄùTom Nicholson, ‚ÄúGhost Stories‚Äù, World Art, No. 15, 1997, pp. 54-57. In ‚ÄòFertile Ground‚Äô in 2005, Graham portrayed a growth of the senses that is stimulated by darkness. His work was ‚Äúpopulated by totemic animal and plant forms, picked out in dots of light‚Äîlike water droplets on a spider‚Äôs web‚Äîa spectral vision in the dark.‚ÄùGlenn Barkley, ‚ÄúHomespun‚Äù, pp. 124-139. In MCA Collection Volume One: Towards a New MCA, Sydney: Museum of Contemporary Art, 2012. In ‚ÄòCharmed Earth‚Äô, a solo exhibition for Tolarno at the Melbourne Art Fair in 2010, Graham produced 100 small sculptures. The idea for the project originated when he started making plasticine forms together with his two children. He first produced the figures in clay, then created rough silicone moulds to cast the figures in coloured polyurethane, which he reworked to obtain shiner, more polished surfaces. Graham has also participated in numerous group exhibitions across Australia. For the National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs ‚ÄòIn Relief: Australian Wood Engravings, Woodcuts and Linocuts‚Äô (1997), Graham used the woodblock print not as finished product but as a starting point for creating ‚Äúdensely layered unique works of art.‚ÄùKirsty Grant and Jason Smith, In Relief: Australian Wood Engravings, Woodcuts and Linocuts, Melbourne: National Gallery of Victoria, 1997, p. 67.

Biography Saecularis was a Roman senator who was appointed Consul suffectus around AD 240. He was later appointed the Proconsular governor of Africa around AD 254, during which time an inscription was erected in his honor at the city of Leptis Magna.Christol, pgs. 188-189; EDCS-06000678 From AD 258 ‚Äì 260 he served as Praefectus urbi of Rome. During his term as Urban Prefect, he was in left charge of Rome at a time when both emperors were absent; Valerian in the east, and Gallienus along the Danube frontier. It is therefore believed that Saecularis was related to the empress Cornelia Salonina.Christol, pg. 188 During this period, Saecularis was also involved in the persecution of Christians in the city. In one example, he is said to have ordered Saint Lawrence to hand over all of the Church‚Äôs wealth in Rome, and Lawrence‚Äôs defiance is said to have led to his martyrdom.Saint Ambrose, De officiis ministrorum, 2.28 In AD 260, Saecularis was appointed consul prior alongside Gaius Iunius Donatus. He held office during the tumultuous period which saw the capture of the emperor Valerian in the east and the rebellion of Postumus in Gaul.Martindale & Jones, pg. 795 He was probably the last member of the old republican gens Cornelia to receive a consulship.
