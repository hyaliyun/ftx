Many physical phenomena can occur when a charged particle is incident upon a solid target, e.g., elastic scattering, inelastic energy- loss processes, secondary-electron emission, electromagnetic radiation, nuclear reactions, etc. All of these processes have cross sections which depend on the impact parameters involved in collisions with individual target atoms. When the target material is homogeneous and isotropic, the impact- parameter distribution is independent of the orientation of the momentum of the particle and interaction processes are also orientation-independent. When the target material is monocrystalline, the yields of physical processes are very strongly dependent on the orientation of the momentum of the particle relative to the crystalline axes or planes. Or in other words, the stopping power of the particle is much lower in certain directions than others. This effect is commonly called the \\"channelling\\" effect. It is related to other orientation-dependent effects, such as particle diffraction. These relationships will be discussed in detail later. Fig. 1. An about 12 nm thick silicon crystal viewed down the 110 crystal direction Fig. 2. Same Si crystal as in Fig. 1 viewed from a randomly rotated direction.  History  The channelling effect was first discovered in binary collision approximation computer simulations in 1963 to explain exponential tails in experimentally observed ion range distributions that did not conform to standard theories of ion penetration. The simulated prediction was confirmed experimentally the following year by measurements of ion penetration depths in single-crystalline tungsten. Mechanism From a simple, classical standpoint, one may qualitatively understand the channelling effect as follows: If the direction of a charged particle incident upon the surface of a monocrystal lies close to a major crystal direction (Fig. 1), the particle with high probability will only do small-angle scattering as it passes through the several layers of atoms in the crystal and hence remain in the same crystal 'channel'. If it is not in a major crystal direction or plane (\\"random direction\\", Fig. 2), it is much more likely to undergo large-angle scattering and hence its final mean penetration depth is likely to be shorter. If the direction of the particle's momentum is close to the crystalline plane, but it is not close to major crystalline axes, this phenomenon is called \\"planar channelling\\". Channelling usually leads to deeper penetration of the ions in the material, an effect that has been observed experimentally and in computer simulations, see Figures 3-5. Negatively charged particles like antiprotons and electrons are attracted towards the positively charged nuclei of the plane, and after passing the center of the plane, they will be attracted again, so negatively charged particles tend to follow the direction of one crystalline plane. Fig. 3. Map of channeling crystal directions for 10 keV Si ions in Si. The red and yellow colors indicate directions with deeper mean ion penetration depth, i.e. directions where the ions are channeled. Fig. 4. Experimentally determined penetration depth profiles for 15 keV B ions in Si along the 100 and 110 crystal channels, as well as in a non-channeling direction. The data is scanned in with smoothing from. Ref. Fig. 5. Computer simulations of the mean penetration depth of 80 keV Xe ion penetration in single crystal Au, considering a tilting of the implantation profile off the main direction. These simulations were made with the MDRANGE code for a study of Xe irradiation of Au nanowires. Also shown are simulations using the binary collision approximation SRIM code which does not take into account the crystal structure and thus does not describe channeling at all. The order of the strength of channeling, i.e. that 110 has the strongest effect, 100 is intermediate and 111 has the weakest, agrees with experimental observations in face-centered cubic metals. Because the crystalline plane has a high density of atomic electrons and nuclei, the channeled particles eventually suffer a high angle Rutherford scattering or energy-losses in collision with electrons and leave the channel. This is called the \\"dechannelling\\" process. Positively charged particles like protons and positrons are instead repelled from the nuclei of the plane, and after entering the space between two neighboring planes, they will be repelled from the second plane. So positively charged particles tend to follow the direction between two neighboring crystalline planes, but at the largest possible distance from each of them. Therefore, the positively charged particles have a smaller probability of interacting with the nuclei and electrons of the planes (smaller \\"dechannelling\\" effect) and travel longer distances. The same phenomena occur when the direction of momentum of the charged particles lies close to a major crystalline, high- symmetry axis. This phenomenon is called \\"axial channelling\\". At low energies the channelling effects in crystals are not present because small-angle scattering at low energies requires large impact parameters, which become bigger than interplanar distances. The particle's diffraction is dominating here. At high energies the quantum effects and diffraction are less effective and the channelling effect is present. Applications There are several particularly interesting applications of the channelling effects. Channelling effects can be used as tools to investigate the properties of the crystal lattice and of its perturbations (like doping) in the bulk region that is not accessible to X-rays. The channeling method may even be utilized to detect the geometrical location of interstitials. This is an important variation of the Rutherford backscattering ion beam analysis technique, commonly called Rutherford backscattering/channeling (RBS-C). At higher energies (tens of GeV), the applications include the channelling radiation for enhanced production of high energy gamma rays, and the use of bent crystals for extraction of particles from the halo of the circulating beam in a particle accelerator.

It gets its name from its domed shape, which resembles that of a skep, an old-fashioned type of beehive. Its apex of popularity occurred in the Americas and Europe all the way until the Industrial Revolution, which saw the advent of gas and electric ovens. Beehive ovens were common in households used for baking pies, cakes and meat. These ovens were also used in industry, in such applications as making tiles and pots and turning coal into coke.  Construction  A fire brick chamber shaped like a dome is used. It is typically wide and high. The roof has a hole for charging the coal or other kindling from the top. The discharging hole is provided in the circumference of the lower part of the wall. In a coke oven battery, a number of ovens are built in a row with common walls between neighboring ovens. A battery consisted of a great many ovens, sometimes hundreds of ovens, in a row. Some mines also employed parallel batteries.  Cooking food  With candle wax wrapped in paper, dry kindling (twigs, small sticks, and/or wood chips), and pine cones, a small fire was made toward the front of the oven. As the fire caught, more kindling was added to produce a thick smoke, which coated the oven with black soot. The fire was then pushed back into the middle of the oven with a hoe. More wood would be added until there was a good, hot fire. After all of these steps were taken, the food would be prepared for baking. The beehive oven typically took two to three hours to heat, occasionally even four hours in the winter. Breads were baked first when the beehive oven was hottest, with other baked items such as cinnamon buns, cakes, and pies. As the oven cooled, muffins and \\"biscuits\\" could be baked, along with puddings and custards. After a day's baking there was typically sufficient heat to dry apples and other fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Pots of beans were often placed in the back of the oven to cook slowly overnight.  Coke manufacture  Coal is introduced from the top to produce an even layer of about deep. Air is supplied initially to ignite the coal. Carbonization starts and produces volatile matter, which burns inside the partially closed side door. Carbonization proceeds from top to bottom and is completed in two to three days. Heat is supplied by the burning volatile matter so no by-products are recovered. The exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the atmosphere. The hot coke is quenched with water and discharged, manually through the side door. The walls and roof retain enough heat to initiate carbonization of the next charge. When coal was burned in a coke oven, the impurities of the coal not already driven off as gases accumulated to form slag, which was effectively a conglomeration of the removed impurities. Since it was not the desired coke product, slag was initially nothing more than an unwanted by-product and was discarded. Later, however, it was found to have many beneficial uses and has since been used as an ingredient in brick-making, mixed cement, granule-covered shingles, and even as a fertilizer.  History  In the thirteen colonies that later became the United States, most households had a beehive oven. Bread was usually baked in it once a week, often in conjunction with pies, crackers, or other baked goods. To heat the oven, the baker would heap coals and kindling inside and wait several hours. Requiring strict regulation, the right amount of wood to ash had to be burned and then tested by sticking one's hands inside. Then one had to add more wood or open the door to let it cool to the right temperature. Beehive ovens were also used in iron-making. Before this time, iron-making utilized large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As forests dwindled dangerously, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and the coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps on the ground in such a way that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 19th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process. The number of beehive ovens between 1870 and 1905 skyrocketed from about 200 to almost 31,000, which produced nearly 18 million tons of coke in the Pittsburgh area alone. One observer boasted that, loaded into a train, \\"the year's production would make up a train so long that the engine in front of it would go to San Francisco and come back to Connellsville before the caboose had gotten started out of the Connellsville yards!\\" The number of beehive ovens in the Pittsburgh seam peaked in 1910 at almost 48,000. Although they made a top- quality fuel, beehive ovens poisoned the surrounding landscape. After 1900, the serious environmental damage of beehive coking attracted national notice, even though the damage had plagued the district for decades. \\"The smoke and gas from some ovens destroy all vegetation around the small mining communities,\\" noted W. J. Lauck of the U.S. Immigration Commission in 1911. Passing through the region on train, University of Wisconsin president Charles van Hise saw \\"long rows of beehive ovens from which flame is bursting and dense clouds of smoke issuing, making the sky dark. By night the scene is rendered indescribably vivid by these numerous burning pits. The beehive ovens make the entire region of coke manufacture one of dulled sky, cheerless and unhealthful\\". In China, beehive ovens were not banned until 1996, and this ban was not fully effective until 2011.https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/chinese-ban-on-small-coal- burning-ovens-took-15-years/  References   External links  The Manufacture of Coke in a Beehive Coke Oven * The History of Beehive Ovens in West Blocton, Alabama * Hearthcook.com Steelmaking Ovens Fireplaces ","title":"Beehive oven"},{"id":"5011811","text":"The Taveuni beetle (Xixuthrus terribilis) is known from the island of Taveuni in the Fiji, and is one of the largest living insect species, with specimens around 14 cm long, excluding legs, antennae, or mandibles.

While it was never formally adopted by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) or the Central Conference of American Rabbis founded four years after its release, and several rabbis who remained associated with Reform in its wake attempted to distance themselves from it, the platform exerted great influence over the movement in the next fifty years. The Platform The most important principles of Judaism as practiced by the largest Jewish denomination in the United States were laid out in eight concise paragraphs: Historical context This founding document of what has come to be called \\"Classical Reform\\" ideology was the culmination of a meeting of Reform rabbis from November 16‚Äì19, 1885 at the Concordia Club in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It explicitly calls for a rejection of those laws which have a ritual, rather than moral, basis. An example of a ritual rejected by the Pittsburgh Platform is kashrut, or the observance of Jewish dietary laws. These ritual laws were seen as detracting from Jewish life in the modern era by placing undue emphasis on ritual, rather than ethical considerations. The platform affirms God's existence, and recognized a universal desire in all religions to experience \\"the indwelling of God in man.\\" In this vein, the Pittsburgh Platform also calls for a recognition of the inherent worth of Christianity and Islam, although it still holds that Judaism was the \\"highest conception of the God-idea.\\" Instead of a nation, the Pittsburgh Platform defines Jews in the modern world as a religious community within their pluralistic nations. For this reason, there was an explicit rejection of Zionism in the form that maintained that Jews were \\"in exile\\" anywhere except in what is now Israel and should all move to Israel as soon as possible; that version of Zionism was viewed as completely inapplicable to American Jews because they were at home in America and to other communities of Jews in free countries around the world. The platform seems to acknowledge the concept of Jewish chosenness accepting in the Bible \\"the consecration of the Jewish people to its mission as the priest of the one God.\\" The form of Judaism practiced by Reform Jews contrasted radically with the traditional and historic practices of Lithuanian, Hasidic, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jews. Traditional Jewish leaders teach and practice a Judaism celebrating historic practices including specific gender roles in prayer and ritual, embracing distinct Jewish clothing styles and customs, using Hebrew in religious services, speaking Jewish languages (Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo- Arabaic), and minimizing social fraternalization with non-Jews. Among the most vocal advocates for Jewish life and practice was Moshe Sofer, z\\"sl, also called the Hatam Sofer (1762-1839), who led a prestigious seminary in Bratislava. The cornerstone of his position is that \\"modification of any kind and in any degree of what had long been established could not fail to be incompatible with halakha [Orthodox religious law] and that the rule was absolute and all-embracing. There could be no question of drawing distinctions between greater and lesser matters, between greater and lesser precepts and injunctions. Innovation, whatever its form and context, was unacceptable.\\" For mainstream orthodox Jews, the codification of Jewish law in the 16th century by Joseph Caro, called the Shulchan Aruch, is the \\"ultimate criterion\\" by which orthodox practice is measured. For the Reformers, this position as results in a stagnation in Judaism. The Pittsburgh Platform helped shape the future of American Reform Judaism by calling for American Jews to not focus on traditional customs and practices but instead on ethical living (rather than custom and ritual) and to engage in acts of social justice as taught by the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. Today this principle, among others, is maintained by the Reform Movement through their commitment to what is sometimes called Tikkun Olam (the healing of the world). There were many early leaders of the \\"Classical Reform\\" ideology, including Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler (who presided over the Hebrew Union College), Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise (who was instrumental in creating the institutions of Reform Judaism), and Rabbi David Woolf Marks. Legacy Rather than resolving the issues of religion and Jewish nationalism it addressed, the adoption of the Pittsburgh Platform only intensified the debate within American Judaism about how Halacha, Jewish peoplehood, and Zionism should be viewed. By openly disavowing those concepts, the leading Reformers alienated more moderate reformers like Sabato Morais, who advocated a compromise approach to Halacha in the belief that it would better maintain Jewish continuity. Morais and his supporters (including Rabbis Alexander Kohut and Bernard Drachman) joined moderates within the traditional community, such as Rabbi Solomon Schechter, in establishing the Jewish Theological Seminary, which would grow into the Conservative Jewish movement in the late 1880s. Today, Conservative Judaism is the second largest Jewish denomination in America. The non-Zionist ideas of the Pittsburgh Platform remained (and remain) controversial within the Reform movement, particularly for those who supported the movement. Every successive major platform of the UAHC (now the Union for Reform Judaism) backed off further from the ideas contained in the Pittsburgh platform. The Union's 1937 Columbus Platform included a more nuanced endorsement of Zionism, noting \\"In all lands where our people live, they assume and seek to share loyally the full duties and responsibilities of citizenship and to create seats of Jewish knowledge and religion. In the rehabilitation of Palestine, the land hallowed by memories and hopes, we behold the promise of renewed life for many of our brethren. We affirm the obligation of all Jewry to aid in its upbuilding as a Jewish homeland by endeavoring to make it not only a haven of refuge for the oppressed but also a center of Jewish culture and spiritual life.\\" This major re-statement of the \\"Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism\\" was an acceptance of the massive demographic shift caused by recent waves of eastern European Jewish immigrants attracted to Zionism, as well as influential pro-Zionist Reform rabbis like Stephen S. Wise, Abba Hillel Silver, and Max Raisin, the formation of the competing and \\"ardently Zionist\\"Religion: Jews v. Jews, Time, Jun. 20, 1938 American Jewish Congress, and the recent sharp increase in European antisemitism brought on by the rise of Fascism. Prominent Reform rabbis who were more integrationist, unwilling to abandon the principle that Jews should live as free and equal citizens in the United States and other countries around the world, and who rejected the idea in 1942 of a religiously segregated Jewish army to fight alongside the Allies, formed the American Council for Judaism. In 1976, nearly thirty years after the establishment of Israel, the recognition of Jewish \\"peoplehood\\" was noted by the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) in their \\"Centenary Perspective\\", adopted in San Francisco, and marking the centenaries of the founding of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Marking the 100th anniversary of political Zionism in 1997, the CCAR dealt specifically for the first time with issues related to Zionism in its ‚ÄúReform Judaism & Zionism: A Centenary Platform‚Äù, also known as the \\"Miami Platform\\". The perspective noted the trends that had occurred within Reform Jewish thought with respect to the religion, its people and religious practice, their movement from degradation to sovereignty, their relationship and obligations to Israel, as well as Israel's obligations to Jews of the Diaspora, and redemption. The Union's new 1999 \\"Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism\\", also called the Pittsburgh Platform, again noted the trends that had occurred within Reform Jewish and codified these with respect to religious practice and the modern state of Israel. The 1999 platform called for \\"renewed attention\\" to \\"sacred obligations,\\" of which it mentioned the observance of holidays and Shabbat, prayer, and the study of Torah and the Hebrew language. The statement endorsed aliyah (emugration to Israel) for the first time, and notes differences within both the country Israel and Reform Judaism concerning the relationship of Medinat Yisrael (the modern state of Israel) and Eretz Yisrael (the Biblical Israel), included in on-going debates regarding conceptions of Zionism. Reform Judaism still holds that Halacha is not binding, and has since embraced other concepts like patrilineal descent that keep it in tension with the more traditional movements of Judaism, and in control of religious law in Israel. The principles of the Platform were often evoked by organisations espousing a \\"classical\\" approach to Reform Judaism, like the American Council for Judaism and Society for Classical Reform Judaism.

The company was split off from the Ontario Foundry in 1873 by James Crossen Jr., the foundry's owner. When James died in 1890, control of the company passed to his children, who renamed it as the Crossen Car Manufacturing Company. Supplying almost all of the major Canadian railways, as well as many local regional lines, the Crossen works became the largest car company in Canada. The move to all-steel constructed and CPR's decision to open their own works led to a rapid downturn in business, and the company closed in 1913. History =James Crossen Jr. and the Ontario Foundry= The company evolved from the Helm Foundry, a foundry, that supplied cast metal fittings and components to grist and flour mills throughout Northumberland County. James Crossen Jr. emigrated from Ireland to Batavia, New York in 1842 with his family. At the age of 17, Crossen left his family behind and moved to Cobourg, Ontario where he began work in the Helm Foundry. He moved up the ranks of this company and eventually became a full partner. Eventually the company was renamed Ontario Foundry and, by 1865 James Crossen was listed in a Northumberland/Durham Counties Directory as the sole proprietor of the company. = Cobourg Car Works= The Ontario Foundry was approached by the Cobourg, Peterborough & Marmora Railway and Mining Company to build twelve wooden railway dump cars for the transportation of ore. Crossen, realizing the capabilities of his foundry to manufacture the metal wheels and under carriage components of the cars, and knowing of a nearby supply of timber, agreed to fill the order. Eventually, one order for cars and rolling stock replaced the previous. By 1873 various railway companies were coming to the Ontario Foundry to have cars built, and Cossen took the opportunity to form the Cobourg Car Works. The Ontario Foundry faded as his attention turned to the new market. Some of company's earliest customers included the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and the Intercolonial Railway. By 1878, the Cobourg Car Works added First Class Passenger Coach Construction to its operations putting it into direct competition with the American firms of the Pullman Company and the Barney and Smith Car Company. In 1879, the Canadian government passed legislation to restrict American Imports of manufactured goods and products. Called the \\"Tilley Tariff\\", duties and taxes where put on the importation of products from outside of Canada. This tariff allowed the Cobourg Car Works to flourish, as they could provide an equivalent product at a cheaper cost to railway companies. =Crossen Car Manufacturing Company= James Crossen died at the age of 64, leaving control of his company to his six children in 1890. The family re-organized and incorporated the company in 1891 under the name Crossen Car Manufacturing Company of Cobourg. James oldest son, William, served as the company's General Manager while his son Frederick served as Secretary Treasurer. His son-in-law, William Renwick Riddell, a prominent Cobourg lawyer, husband of Anna Crossen was elected as the Company President. In 1896, Frederick Crossen, died at the age of 26 and the continuation of the company was left to William Crossen. At the company's peak, it provided employment to as many as 500 workers, and the company's production output rose to as high as 7 passenger cars and 150 freight cars per month. =Closure= By 1948 all that remained operational was the foundry, seen in the upper left. The tracks of the Cobourg and Peterborough Railway run through the image. In a display of photographs and materials presented by the Art Gallery of Northumberland, in the 1989 exhibition \\"Some Prominent Citizens\\" the exhibit claimed, that Crossen Car Manufacturing Company ceased operations in 1913 and the company's directors liquidated factory's assets soon afterwards. The Gallery referenced, their source of information and materials, as obtained from a great grand daughter of James Crossen, company records and a scrapbook in her possession. It was also stated that the company's demise came as a result of the introduction of the all-steel cars in 1910. At the time, the company did consider converting their operations to all-steel production, but when one of the company's largest and oldest customers, the Canadian Pacific Railway decided to open their own manufacturing facilities to build cars, it put an abrupt end to the Crossen Company's deliberations. William Crossen died in Toronto in 1927. The production facilities were later acquired by Dominion Wheel & Foundries Limited and vacated in 1960. The site (northwest of University Avenue West and Division Street) still remains vacant and all buildings relating to Crossen demolished. A small street, Crossen Street, is the only reminder of the company's existence in the area. The homes of James Crossen at 465 George Street remains near the former manufacturing site.http://www.cobourghistory.ca/histories/cobourg-industries/25-crossen-car- manufacturing Customers The company built cars for the Toronto Railway Company (SE-ST-M) and Birney cars for rival and city owned Toronto Civic Railways.

Locally, the Global Marijuana March is associated with names including Global Cannabis March, World Cannabis Day, Cannabis Liberation Day, Global Space Odyssey, Ganja Day, J Day, and Million Blunts March.  Events by country  = Brazil = On June 15, 2011, the eight ministers of Brazil's Supreme Court (STF) that participated in the trial were unanimous in free demonstrations for the legalization of drugs, such as the Marcha da Maconha (, Marijuana Walk) in Brazil, in which they decided that the demonstrations are an exercise of freedom of expression and not incitement to crime, as argued judges who have banned the march in the past. The discussion of the Marcha da Maconha reached the Supreme Court in June 2009 when the Deputy Attorney General of the Republic Deborah Duprat filed the claim of breach of fundamental precept, ADPF 187. In the lawsuit, the attorney states that the legal prohibition of the demonstrations in favor of marijuana and other narcotics have been based on misinterpretation of the Criminal Code. She said that it is \\"wrong\\" to say that the realization of these events are an \\"apology to crime\\". Marijuana was brought to Brazil by its African slaves, and with the eugenic positivist intellectual and political status quo of the Western civilization in the early 20th century, its use was deemed as a signal of decadence by its stigmatized use as a recreational drug of the poor, the rural people and the Afro-Brazilian. Its association with the counterculture and left-wing youths during the highly anti-Communist military dictatorship, initially a strong ally of the United States' government, fortified its negative perceptions both by the authorities and the masses. Nevertheless, since the neoliberal centre-right government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994‚Äì2002), position strengthened in the so-called Era Lula (2003‚Äì2010), individual marijuana use by adults started to have no major importance to police and government instances ‚Äì though not (since the country has major crime problems with drug dealers) its domestic cultivation for own consumption. One can see and smell people smoking the so-called maconha openly in Brazil's Centre-Southern half as well as in the Northeastern states, and recreational use of cannabis in private became more accepted among large sectors of the middle classes since the early 1990s. The academic milieu is no exception and, today, a sizeable minority of Brazilian University lecturers, students and researchers smoke marijuana. = Canada = Calgary, Alberta, Canada. May 5, 2007.

Regina, Saskatchewan  Held in Regina on the first Saturday of May since 1999, originally at the Saskatchewan Legislature. Starting in 2001, it was held in Victoria Park, in the center of Regina's downtown, until 2008 when changes to the City's permit policy forced organizers to change the location to Central Park. The event features live music mixed with speakers on various topics, sometimes with only an incidental connection to marijuana.  Vancouver, British Columbia  Held in Vancouver, BC on the first Saturday of May. People gather at the fountain at the Vancouver Art Gallery at or before 2:00pm for a marijuana legalization parade through the streets of downtown Vancouver. The parade route is different every year. = France = In France the so-called Marche Mondiale pour le Cannabis is celebrated in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Marseille, Rennes, Lille, Saint-Denis-de-la-R√©union, Cognac, and some other minor cities in the country. = New Zealand = In New Zealand J Day is celebrated in some of the major cities.  Dunedin  J-Day in Dunedin, is celebrated in the city's centre of town, The Octagon, on the first Saturday of May from 'High Noon' until 4:20 pm. Dunedin is arguably chronologically the first city in the world to host any GMM event. Named '4:20 Extreme', local participants climb the famous Baldwin Street to meet at the top by 4:20 am. Locally J-Day coincides with The University of Otago Capping Parade, in which a multitude of ceremony- attending graduates parade down the main street on their way to the Town Hall ceremony, and also the University Hall Parade, in which University of Otago dormitory-student decorated themed floats parade down the main street, stopping in the Octagon typically armed with many water balloons, and collectively shouting chants of dormitory-specific pride. Dunedin became famous for its JDay festivities in 2003 when around 50 activists marched to the Central Dunedin Police Station, where they planted cannabis plants and smoked cannabis in the main foyer as acts of protest.[Otago Daily Times, May 5, 2003] The event was given considerable national and international media attention as no arrests were made.[Otago Daily Times, May 6, 2003] The Central Dunedin Police Station was hot-boxed again on JDay in 2004 by over 100 activists, again with no arrests. This second incident was also covered by the media, resulting in the Dunedin Area Police Commander, Dave Campbell, justifying the fact that no arrests were made with the quote, \\"We had more important things to do\\" in the Otago Daily Times. The 2007 International J-Day in Dunedin featured political speakers and music provided by local DJs and counted 170 people at mid-day. In the lead up to J-Day 2008, NORML NZ's Maryjane the Cannabus toured 42 towns between Auckland and Dunedin in 42 days for daily law reform rallies. The Cannabus arrived in Dunedin, New Zealand's most cannabis friendly city, on April 25 for a week-long 'Cannabis Awareness Week' which was planned by Otago NORML and featured public workshops, informational lectures at Otago University, and a round-table discussion featuring university academics, MPs, and policy researchers. Cannabis Awareness Week culminated with J-Day on May 3, 2008. The 2008 J-Day in Dunedin was well attended despite sleet and hail early in the day. Over 500 supporters participated in the event, enjoying games, prizes, political speeches and music from Bushmaster and Ashes of Eden. = Denmark = Copenhagen In Copenhagen the Marijuana march has been an annual tradition for more than 15 years. The march takes places on the first Saturday of may and departs from The Freetown Christiania, walks through central Copenhagen and ends at the city hall square. Klaus Trier Tuxen from Danish the Hampepartiet has had a prominent role in organizing the event in recent years. Cannabis smoking is illegal in Denmark, but during the march the police does not enforce this regulation and smoking is de facto allowed during the demonstration. = United States =  Los Angeles Million Marijuana March 2011  As of 2011, the Moorish Science Temple of America has been doing the Los Angeles Million Marijuana March for 13 years at Leimert park in Los Angeles, California. The 2-day 2011 celebration marks the first time bands have filled the 2 days. Leimert Park is a famed free speech arena, which has also held Black Panther rallies and more since its inception. Acclaimed rap artist Ditch headlined both days, and was in charge of band booking and advertising. The event went off well with over 2,000 people attending over the 2 days. Ditch was honored for being able to bring unity to that area among so many different races and types of people. Ditch also honored jailed freedom fighter Eddy Lepp at the event. Eddy then called in live to the audience from Federal prison in which he is serving 10 years for cultivation of marijuana. Eddy's wife Linda Lepp was on hand to receive the award. This marks the third time so far that Eddy Lepp has spoken to a live concert audience from prison. Rapper RBX also performed at the Los Angeles march marking the first time in years he has performed in South Central Los Angeles.  New York City  In 1999, during the first worldwide Million Marijuana March New York City held another of its annual marijuana marches. The Village Voice reported on the police and organizer estimates of the crowd size: \\"the police claim it was 4,000 people while organizers say 20,000\\". In 2009, the event organizer, Dana Beal, along with Chris Ryan, and Jay Stetzer on their way back from the NORML Conference in San Francisco all three men were charged with possession with intent to distribute and possession with intent to deliver 150 lbs. of marijuana. In 2010, the event began to be organized by a new group of activists poised to take on New York city. It was after this that the NYC Event was renamed to, NYC Cannabis Parade. The NYC Cannabis Parade, organized by a steering committee of activists, have turned the event into a celebration of cannabis culture in NYC with a nearly 20 block parade and 4 hour rally proceeding it, there has not been a recorded arrest for possession or use for over 4 years now. \\"'We have zero arrests, and we don‚Äôt plan on having any,' one sergeant told a Post reporter.

Riessin 1970 http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5q2nb29x&brand;=oac&doc.view;=entire_text Early career Taylor's research career was launched by the progressive sociologist Edith Abbott. As head of a Social Science Research Council project, she was looking for someone to undertake a study of the rapidly increasing Mexican migration into the United States. Taylor took up this task. From 1927 to 1930 he spent a great deal of time on the road, driving through the San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys in California, into Colorado and Texas, and as far east as Pennsylvania. He not only sought quantitative data on Mexican employment patterns but also learned Spanish and interviewed workers and employers. He documented what he encountered with photographs. He went on to spend six months in Mexico during 1931. \\"The Berkeley economics department responded to his unconventional work by denying him promotions and salary increases.\\" His approach integrated the institutional economics advocated by his professor John Commons with cultural and ethnographic matters ‚Äì for example collecting Mexican corridos (popular ballads). He published thirteen monographs on Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. In this period he was the \\"only\\" Anglo scholar paying attention to Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. Taylor was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1930, using it to further his studies in Mexico for 4 months in 1931 and 2 months in 1932.Gordon, Linda (2009). \\"Dorothea Lange: A Life Beyond Limits.

They both divorced their first spouses and on December 6, 1935California, Biographical Index Cards, 1781-1990 married one other, forming a living and working partnership that continued until Lange's death in 1965. They had no children together but were parents to Lange's two sons from her first marriage as well as Taylor's three children. In 1935 they produced five reports on the conditions of migrant agricultural workers, and Taylor used their data to get state and federal relief funding for housing for farmworkers. Migrant farmers In the course of their research Taylor and Lange encountered the \\"Dust Bowl\\" westward migration of ruined tenant farmers across the United States. Lange was hired as a photographer by the federal Farm Security Administration, and throughout the 1930s the two often traveled together; Taylor collecting quantitative and qualitative information as Lange made photographs. Together Lange and Taylor brought the poverty and exploitation of sharecroppers, tenant farmers and migrant farmworkers to the attention of the American public in their hope that the New Deal would be extended to benefit those who worked on farms. Taylor risked his colleagues' further disapproval by publishing, with Lange, a popular book of text and photographs on the Dust Bowl, \\"American Exodus,\\" in 1939. The La Follette Committee Taylor's research formed a basis for the 1939 hearings conducted by the La Follette Committee of the U.S. Senate on civil liberties violations against farmworkers. This work antagonized powerful people at the University of California, Berkeley, where agribusiness was well represented among the university's regents and where university agricultural research provided direct support to the big growers (for example, creating hybrids, designing farm machinery, training in agricultural management). Taylor's research, combined with the values of his Iowa upbringing, brought him to the conclusion that the power of the big growers in California agriculture was incompatible with democracy. Despite Robert La Follette's expos√© of violence against farmworkers by sheriffs and deputies recruited by the Associated Farmers (the organization of big industrial farm owners), farmworker unionization struggles were not successful until the 1960s, when Taylor, then retired, supported the United Farm Workers. Later career During World War II, Taylor was one of a tiny handful of prominent whites to protest the mass incarceration of Japanese-Americans. In 1943, Taylor became involved with protests against federal provision of vast quantities of water to agribusiness at the taxpayer's expense. After 1950, this became the major focus of his work. The federal Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which provided funding for dams and canals to bring water to parched southwestern farms, had limited the amount of subsidized water for irrigation to per person. But this restriction was systematically violated, so the reclamation programs constituted huge subsidies to the biggest growers and enabled them to squeeze out small farmers. In 1944, Taylor led opposition to the insertion of an exemption from the limitation into the U.S. Senate bill authorizing the Central Valley Project to bring water into the San Joaquin Valley. For the rest of his life Taylor fought a losing battle against this policy. From 1952 to 1956 Taylor served as chair of his department; he then headed the university's Institute of International Studies until his retirement in 1964. Beginning in the late 1950s Taylor served as a consultant for the U.S. State Department and the Ford Foundation, investigating land tenure and advocating land reform in Vietnam, Egypt, Colombia, Korea, and Ecuador. He applied to the Third World the principles and knowledge he had developed from decades of work on U.S. agriculture and rural poverty. Always strongly anticommunist, Taylor argued for land reform and community development in the conviction that the concentration of vast landholdings in a few hands and the severe exploitation of farm labor made the development of democracy impossible and made communist popularity grow.

The revelation caused several opposition politicians to call for Ditlev-Simonsen's resignation. Erna Solberg, the head of the Conservative Party, asked that Ditlev-Simonsen refrain from active campaigning for his party ahead of the local elections scheduled for 10 September. Even if he had not resigned, the 75-year-old Ditlev-Simonsen was set to retire after the election. The incident was believed to be a cause of the Conservative's 4 percent drop in opinion polls, three weeks ahead of the election.

It was originally based in Chicago, but had a subsidiary factory in Paris, Illinois, and in its last years it was based in the latter city. It was founded in 1888 as the McGuire Manufacturing Company, later becoming McGuire-Cummings, and finally the Cummings Car and Coach Company. Snowplow cars and snow sweepersstreet railway cars designed specifically for snow removalwere among its most popular and best-known products. The company built its last streetcars in 1930, but remained in business until 1943. McGuire-Cummings was one of a few suppliers for the Toronto Civic Railways.  History  =Overview= In The Time of the Trolley, historian William D. Middleton wrote that the company \\"was initially active as a builder of [street]car trucks, later produced [street railway] snowplows and sweepers, and finally manufactured a general line of steam and electric railway equipment.\\" Although North America was its principal market, the company also sold its products in foreign markets. Its snow sweeper, in particular, \\"was a popular item on dozens of European tramway systems,\\" Middleton wrote. In 1904, McGuire Manufacturing was renamed the McGuire- Cummings Manufacturing Company, with Walter J. Cummings as president. In 1925, it became the Cummings Car & Coach Company, and was based in Paris, Illinois. The company's streetcar production ended in 1930. =Notable production and sales= McGuire locomotive for General Electric Co., 1899 The McGuire Manufacturing Co. delivered in 1899 to the General Electric Co., of Schenectady, New York, one of the most compact electric locomotives that it had turned out until then.

The McGuire company was contracted in 1899 to build 60 trucks for San Francisco, 120 for Havana, Cuba, 30 pairs for the Australian Government, and finishing the order for 300 for the Northwestern Elevated Railroad of Chicago, with smaller orders from every part of the United States. It was closing up the largest snowplow business the company has ever done in one year, with two orders, 10 for Washington, D.C., and 15 for St. Louis, besides a large number of single orders, among them being one for Spokane, Washington, and one for Burlington, Vermont. Plans were being prepared in 1899 for an additional building to be added to the McGuire plant that winter. It was planned to cover the piece of ground on the corner of Kinzie and Morgan Sts., being . on Morgan by . on Kinzie.

Project Ragna Rok is a fictional plan from Mike Mignola's Hellboy comics. It involved a secret team of Nazi scientists and occultists, headed by Rasputin, aiming at creating a doomsday weapon which could end World War II and bring about a victory for the Third Reich. It was named after the apocalypse in Norse mythology, \\"Ragnar√∂k\\". Ragnarok Project During the last stage of the second World War, confronted with the possibility of defeat, Adolf Hitler launched numerous ‚ÄúDoomsday‚Äù projects aimed at bringing about a Nazi victory, through either scientific or occult means. The Ragna Rok (Fatal Destiny) Project was one such. During his meditations in Italy, Grigori Rasputin was approached by Heinrich Himmler to lead a group of Nazi occultists in building weapons of mass destruction. Eventually, after recognizing the potential in Haupstein, Kurtz, and Kroenen, Rasputin assembled them as part of his Ragna Rok project. Rasputin promised Hitler a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù which would turn the tide of the war. Secretly, Rasputin hoped to trigger an apocalyptic event that would begin a new Eden. On December 23, 1944, on Tarmagant Island, (a small island off the Scottish coast) Project Ragna Rok entered into its final phase. Rasputin called forth the key to the apocalypse from Hell. Complications arose when the key did not appear on Tarmagant Island, but rather in a ruined church in East Bromwich, England. Even worse, the key, serving as the massive stone right hand of an infant demon, was recovered by the Allies. The demon would later become Hellboy, and his right hand would be much sought after. Von Krupt viewed the project as a failure, and the team officially disbanded. Rasputin headed to the Arctic Circle in pursuit of a long-lost temple to the Ogdru Jahad, while Haupstein, Kurtz, and Kroenen cryogenically froze themselves until Rasputin needed them once again. Team members =Klaus Werner von Krupt= Hitler's liaison with the project, General Von Krupt believed Rasputin's promises of a miracle, though he doubted the monk's ability to deliver. Entirely unaware of Rasputin's motives, he declared the project a failure when he failed to see results. Von Krupt died six months after being committed to Eisenvalt Sanitarium, his corpse discovered to be infested with beetles of unknown species or origin. Portrayed by William Hoyland in the 2004 film, Von Kurpt appears in the movie prologue with his fate when US army forces invade unknown. Joel Harlow portrays Von Kurpt in the 2019 reboot. =Leopold Kurtz= A young Nazi occultist who threw his lot in with Rasputin and Project Ragna Rok. Kurtz relocated to a base in Norway with Kroenen and Haupstein after Rasputin's failure at Cavendish Hall. When Roderick Zinco found the severed head of Herman von Klempt, Kurtz registered his disapproval at von Klempt's inclusion in their plans. Kurtz later attacked the severed head after he caught it discussing treason with Kroenen, Kroenen accidentally stabbing Kurtz while rushing to defend his old friend. Kurtz is later revealed to have survived by Kroenen's stabbing and the following explosion, helping Zinco CEO Marsten in what he later learned to be the resurrection of the Black Flame. In the 2019 film, Kurtz is portrayed by Dimiter Banenkin. =Ilsa Haupstein= Another Nazi scientist recruited by Rasputin for his Ragna Rok project, Ilsa displayed extreme devotion and loyalty. After Rasputin's ghost returned from the failure at Cavendish Hall, she helped maneuver Hellboy into the hands of Count Giurescu, a vampire who she fell in love with during the Second World War and was reviving. But Ilsa is contacted by the spirit of Rasputin to follow him to a mystical iron maiden that he has brought by Baba Yuga's servant. In an attempt to demonstrate her faith in Rasputin, who intended her to be by his side, Ilsa encased herself in the iron maiden under the notion that she would become a part of it and be able to survive the upcoming apocalypse. But Rasputin later learned that Ilsa immediately perished with her body serving as a new vessel for Hecate after her physical death at Hellboy's hands. In the 2004 film, played by Bridget Hodson, Ilsa serves as one of the antagonists as Rasputin gave her eternal youth to act on his behalf. In the end, she remains by Rasputin's side as they are crushed to death by the Behemoth. Ilsa is portrayed by Vanessa Eichholz in the flashback sequence in the 2019 film reboot. =Karl Ruprecht Kroenen= The perpetually masked Kroenen attended university with Herman von Klempt. Recruited by Rasputin for the Ragna Rok project, Kroenen froze himself alongside Ilsa and Kurtz after the Tarmagant debacle, and resurfaced after the events at Cavendish Hall. Kroenen worked with Kurtz and Zinco, until Zinco's discovery of von Klempt's head. Moved by sympathy for his old colleague, Kroenen allowed von Klempt to tempt him into disobeying Rasputin. Kurtz overheard and attacked the head, forcing Kroenen to kill him. This triggered retribution by Rasputin's ghost which ended in a fiery explosion which killed both Zinco and Kroenen. Kroenen survived and resurfaced years later to acquired a vessel from the BRPD which he learned is intended for the Black Flame, having been tricked into thinking his group were bringing Rasputin back from the dead. A disillusioned Kroenen escaped with von Klempt, the two recruited by Varvara to join her cause of rebuilding Pandemonium on Earth. Kroenen ended up being incinerated by Varvara over his suspicions of her intentions. In the 2004 film, played by Ladislav Beran, Kroenen serves as one of the antagonists with his character altered as an assassin and Thule Society member who heavily modified his body with a clockwork heart and later a hand protesis. He is played by Ilko Iliev in the 2019 film reboot. =Grigori Efimovich Rasputin= After being assassinated by Prince Felix Yusupov on December 17, 1916, Rasputin was revived and contacted by the Ogdru Jahad. They enlisted him as their mortal agent in the world. Soon after, Rasputin was contacted by the Nazis to begin development on an occult method for ending the war. From this, Project Ragna Rok was born. The Nazis sought to use Rasputin to defeat the Allies, but Rasputin knew this would never happen. He merely intended to use the Nazis' resources as long as he could to achieve his own goals: to trigger the apocalypse which would jumpstart a new Eden. Though the Nazis believed he had failed, Rasputin knew that he had summoned Hellboy on the night of the 23rd. With Hellboy in Allied care, it took him many years to engender a situation where he could use Hellboy to summon the Ogdru Jahad. Rasputin succeeded at Cavendish Hall, but was ultimately thwarted. He tried again when he forced Hellboy into a confrontation with Hecate, but Hellboy destroyed her mortal form and Rasputin's ghost retreated. Some time later, Hecate would find his aimless spirit and explain that he was nothing more than a pawn to the Ogdru Jahad. Rasputin, infuriated, attacked her and was virtually destroyed. The Baba Yaga kept a small piece of his soul in an acorn she wore around her neck.

One bi-tangent circle is shown. In geometry, the symmetry set is a method for representing the local symmetries of a curve, and can be used as a method for representing the shape of objects by finding the topological skeleton. The medial axis, a subset of the symmetry set is a set of curves which roughly run along the middle of an object. In 2 dimensions Let I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R} be an open interval, and \\\\gamma : I \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^2 be a parametrisation of a smooth plane curve. The symmetry set of \\\\gamma (I) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2 is defined to be the closure of the set of centres of circles tangent to the curve at at least two distinct points (bitangent circles). The symmetry set will have endpoints corresponding to vertices of the curve. Such points will lie at cusp of the evolute. At such points the curve will have 4-point contact with the circle. In n dimensions For a smooth manifold of dimension m in \\\\mathbb{R}^n (clearly we need m < n). The symmetry set of the manifold is the closure of the centres of hyperspheres tangent to the manifold in at least two distinct places. As a bifurcation set Let U \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^m be an open simply connected domain and (u_1\\\\ldots,u_m) := \\\\underline{u} \\\\in U. Let \\\\underline{X} : U \\\\to \\\\R^n be a parametrisation of a smooth piece of manifold. We may define a n parameter family of functions on the curve, namely : F : \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\ , \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where} \\\\quad F(\\\\underline{x},\\\\underline{u}) = (\\\\underline{x} - \\\\underline{X}) \\\\cdot (\\\\underline{x} - \\\\underline{X}) \\\\ . This family is called the family of distance squared functions. This is because for a fixed \\\\underline{x}_0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n the value of F(\\\\underline{x}_0,\\\\underline{u}) is the square of the distance from \\\\underline{x}_0 to \\\\underline{X} at \\\\underline{X}(u_1\\\\ldots,u_m). The symmetry set is then the bifurcation set of the family of distance squared functions. I.e. it is the set of \\\\underline{x} \\\\in \\\\R^n such that F(\\\\underline{x},-) has a repeated singularity for some \\\\underline{u} \\\\in U. By a repeated singularity, we mean that the jacobian matrix is singular. Since we have a family of functions, this is equivalent to \\\\mathcal{r} F = \\\\underline{0}. The symmetry set is then the set of \\\\underline{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n such that there exist (\\\\underline{u}_1, \\\\underline{u}_2) \\\\in U \\\\times U with \\\\underline{u}_1 eq \\\\underline{u}_2, and : \\\\mathcal{r} F(\\\\underline{x},\\\\underline{u}_1) = \\\\mathcal{r} F(\\\\underline{x},\\\\underline{u}_2) = \\\\underline{0} together with the limiting points of this set.

Miller in 1982. As of 2019, its home office is in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The company was named after Baekgaard's mother. Its original luxury cotton bag product lines have expanded to include fashion and home accessories, office supplies, and patterned gifts. Many items have distinctive florals, paisleys, or geometric prints with complementary linings, as well as elongated diamond quilting. The patterns were originally inspired by French Proven√ßal country fabrics and have limited seasonal releases each year. Company creation and growth A selection of open Vera Bradley products with traditional contrasting cotton fabrics and distinctive diamond stitching The founders, Baekgaard and Miller, met in 1975 in Fort Wayne. Baekgaard was redecorating her home by hanging wallpaper when Miller, who was new to the area, came over to her house and introduced herself. Baekgaard asked for help hanging the wallpaper and this experience developed into a wallpapering company they created, called Up Your Wall. Eventually the pair started selling clothing together through trunk shows at homes. While traveling back from Florida through an airport prior to a spring trunk show, they noticed the bland, masculine carry-on bags that many travelers were using and thought that women would want to use something brighter and more feminine. Once back in Indiana, they borrowed a total of $500 from their husbands, bought some fabrics inspired by the Pierre Deux French Proven√ßal look popular at the time, and had a seamstress friend develop prototype bags. They disassociated the bags from the clothing they sold in order to find out what the demand would be if the customers were not aware the bags were produced by them, calling them \\"Vera Bradley\\", after Baekgaard‚Äôs mother. The bags sold well, and family members ran the business out of Baekgaard's basement, with the first logo for the company being created by Baekgaard's teenage daughter, and mother Vera becoming a sales representative in Florida. Vera Bradley store interior, Jefferson Pointe in Ft. Wayne, IN Vera Bradley Designs was incorporated on November 15, 1982. The majority of bags were initially sold through small shops as well as Marshall Field's. The business did not have issues with selling the bags, but did encounter difficulty keeping up with the demand. They hired local seamstresses as well as provided a loan for the creation of Phoenix Sewing, a company dedicated to making Vera Bradley products. Phoenix Sewing was under contract to not produce other products unless their board agreed to do so, and Baekgaard and Miller were board members. Eventually several sewing companies formed and expanded in the area to produce the products. Vera Bradley store exterior A news story on Good Morning America generated more interest in the products when it featured an interview with college students about various campus trends, and one of the sorority girls had a Vera Bradley bag. Continued growth was initiated when the company started selling online in 2004. Small shop owners who had helped the company gain its market early on were disgruntled, but the Vera Bradley owners claimed the wider exposure would be able to drive more people to the small shops, when they might've passed them by previously. The annual Spring Outlet Sale in Fort Wayne proved to be so popular that in 2005, the company sold out of products and the next year, a per-person spending cap was initiated. In an attempt to appeal to millennial buyers, who perceived the goods as not pertinent to their lifestyles, the brand was refreshed. The logo was updated, goods made of microfiber and leather were introduced, technical accessories such as bags with grommets and pockets for charging electrical devices and computer and tablet bags were made, and advertising was done on Hulu, Pandora Radio and Spotify as well as in Glamour and InStyle magazines. Licensing deals were made with other companies to use Vera Bradley designs on their goods. The initial \\"#itsgoodtobeagirl\\" campaign was perceived as patronizing and old- fashioned, but was quickly amended to portray women in active, unusual jobs and promoted the company‚Äôs image as being socially conscious. In 2019, the company purchased a 75% stakeholder share in Creative Genius, parent company of Pura Vida Bracelets, a bracelet company based in La Jolla, California. They have the option to purchase the remainder of the company in 2024. Overseas production expansion Circa 2007, the company started to employ overseas manufacturing to lower costs and keep up with demand. As a result, several US- based sewing companies, including Superior Sample, Phoenix Sewing, and one of their oldest partners, KAM Manufacturing, had to reduce their workforce or close their facilities altogether. In 2008, customers started to aggressively inquire about where their products were being made, after making online complaints that the labeling said China instead of the US. When they were directed to the company's website, it stated that most products were manufactured within 90 minutes distance from the Fort Wayne area, and a company representative said that production fluctuates at locations according to consumer demand. The company has expressed concern regarding potential difficulty in dealing with tariffs the Trump administration has considered on goods imported from China. In a 2018 letter to United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Steve Bohman, the Vice President of Global Sourcing for Vera Bradley, stated that \\"Between 2014 and our expectations for 2019, we will have reduced our China-based production from approximately 95% to under 50%, a r.\\" but \\"In approximately 21% of our categories, there is not a viable alternative supply outside of China.\\" The letter requested the removal of the category of import tariffs that would affect their products. A retail analyst stated that if the tariffs remained, it would provide an incentive to move production of the goods to yet another country instead of bringing production back into the US, due to a lack of sewing companies based in the US. The company had already started moving production from China to Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, but due to the tariff issue, sped up the move to the other manufacturing locations. Counterfeiting and design piracy Despite licensing to many different purveyors, due to the popularity of the designs, the company has had issues with other companies manufacturing replica goods. In 2005, Vera Bradley brought a suit against Target (which was later settled out of court) for using designs resembling their copyrighted ones on various articles of clothing. In 2018, Amazon and Vera Bradley jointly filed suits against sellers who were importing and selling bags on Amazon that were verified as being counterfeit. Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer Mary Sloan, longtime friend to Baekgaard and Miller and one of the company's first sales representatives, died in the early 1990s from breast cancer; both her mother and grandmother had died from the disease as well. In 1993, Baekgaard and Miller initiated contributions to assist in funding research for a cure for breast cancer with a portion of Vera Bradley profits. The Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer was created in 1998 and sponsors the annual Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer Classic, which is a multiple- day fundraising event with yoga, golf, and tennis or pickleball (which replaced tennis in 2019), finally concluding with a dinner. As of 2015, it was the largest amateur women‚Äôs golf and tennis charity tournament in the country. The public and corporate sponsors are invited to volunteer and donate. The company also produces special Breast Cancer Awareness fabric patterns that have the color pink as a main component. Funds collected from the activities and donations go to the Vera Bradley Foundation Center for Breast Cancer Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Posts from the cancer researchers and Vera Bradley on Facebook, Instagram and the company's blog were used to help recruit patients for clinical trials.

Besides the single- and multiplayer modes, including Story mode, Battle Raper features the Extra mode for the additional unlockable content. It allows the player to see unlockable artwork and animations, as well as featuring an option to allow to freely molest any of the four female characters (Mai Kisaragi, Suzume Hachisuka, Fa Taolee, Chihaya Kagami: the only male character is Zenon).  Reception  The game has gained notoriety because of its forced sex elements and was credited to be one of the Japanese adult games that not only resulted in \\"a widely publicised outcry in the West which only started years after the fact\\" but also led to the establishment of the Ethics Organization of Computer Software in 2009. Battle Raper was included on the GamesRadar's lists of the seven \\"most evil\\" video games in 2007: \\"At first, seeing female brawlers beat each other's clothes off is pretty amusing in a twisted way, but the streaming tears that come when the raping begins quickly kills any quirky humor or titillation to be had with this sick hentai title.\\" and the 12 weirdest fighting games in 2008 (\\"Humiliation, rape and degradation are wrapped up in one package of shame, that's not only a shitty fighting game, but a sick idea as well\\"). The Washington Post included it among the 15 most morally controversial video games. The game was banned on the streaming video service Twitch. Battle Raper II =Gameplay= Battle Raper II is a weapon-based 3D fighting game in which the players are able to knock female opponents' clothing off. Every character has unlimited guard, a move that cannot be blocked, as well as a super move. The game also features a variety of alternative clothing items and weapons for all the characters that can be used to edit their models. The game includes a single-player story mode, a multiplayer mode, and an Extras mode which is unlocked after finishing the storyline. As opposed to the first Battle Raper, the sequel actually does not feature rape but only consensual sex. Once a fight against a female character is won, the game enters a special mode where the unconscious woman lies on the ground in front of the player who now has to heal her wounds. The Replay mode allows the player to have sex with a chosen female character. =Plot= The game's plot has no relations to the original Battle Raper and is set in the year \\"20XX\\". The Story mode follows a young treasure hunter swordsman named Yuuki. The player gets to choose one of the female characters to accompany Yuuki, while he travels the island, fighting undead monsters and other female characters (their competitors) and to lie with her in the end. =Characters= *Yuuki Kukami (‰πùÈ¨º ÊÇ†Ê®π): Yuuki is the game's main character and the only male character. He is armed with a sword and a gauntlet called the Soul Eater. He is followed by a bat-winged fairy named Eliza („Éù„Ç´), who shapeshifts into the sword, and is 180 cm tall. *Setsuna Yagami (ÂÖ´Á•û ÂàπÈÇ£): Setsuna is a purple-haired female ninja of the Osei clan. She is armed with the Sun and Moon daggers and uses the elements of Light and Darkness. In the Story mode, from the conversations, it is clear that Yuuki knows Setsuna and that she has not forgotten him. She is 167 cm tall and her measurements are 92/58/87. As a popular character, Setsuna was also featured in Sexy Beach Zero. *Yura Kamishiro (Á•û‰ª£ Áî±ÁæÖ): Yura is a girl with orange hair in the Arcana clan which finds artifacts. She uses two Eagle Claws and holds an artifact which allows her to use the element of fire. Yura is more rambunctious and outgoing than her bespectacled older sister Sara. She is 163 cm tall and her measurements are 86/58/82. *Sara Kamishiro (Á•û‰ª£ Á¥óÁæÖ): Sara is Yura's older sister. She is a member of the Arcana clan who specializes in computers. She is armed with a Dread Scythe and her element is vorpal. Sara is sent in with Yura to search for the Divine Element. She is 144 cm tall and her measurements are 80/52/77. *Yayoi Mibu (Âæ°Ê≠¶ Âº•Áîü): Yayoi is a dark-haired young woman who is a member of the Eisen Kreuz guild. She is armed with a Holy Dragon Blade and her element is wind. She is very hot-tempered, prone to letting her sword do the talking. Despite her personality, she is fond of cute things like Eliza. She is 163 cm tall and her measurements are 86/58/82. *Elferris Kyougoku („Ç®„É´„Éï„Çß„É™„Çπ ‰∫¨Ê•µ): Elferris is a blond girl who is armed with a weapon called 'Zubra' which is similar to a rapier, and her element is thunder. Like Yayoi, she is also a member of the Eisen Kreuz guild and is her superior. Elferris, in contrast to Yayoi, is regal and dignified, and would resort to using her sword only as a last resort. She is 165 cm tall and her measurements are 88/58/64. =Release= Battle Raper II was released only in Japan on April 22, 2005. Two add-ons were later released for the game: *Sexy Raper allows the player to take pictures of all the female characters in poses with different outfits and backgrounds. *CapRaper adds three additional characters from previous Illusion titles. The characters are Mayu Huzikawa (from Biko 3), Bael Altarus and Esk Andersson (from Des Blood 4): they cannot be used in the Story mode. =Reception= The game has gained some notoriety for its controversial content and for being associated with its infamous predecessor. Satirically reviewing the game in 2005, Something Awful's Zack Parsons tongue-in-cheek wrote: \\"I want to say that I am glad they took the rape out of Battle Raper 2, but sadly, I just can't. If you're going to make a game with rape in the title there needs to be rape in it.\\" In 2010, Machinima.com's Steve and Larson ranked it as the fourth most offensive game ever.

He is the author of several books on cultural studies, disability rights, liberal and conservative politics, and debates in higher education. From 2010 to 2017, he was the Director of the Institute for the Arts and Humanities at Penn State; from 1997 to 2001 he was the founding director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities. He was the 2012 president of the Modern Language Association, and served as vice president from 2010‚Äì2011. He served two terms on the National Council of the American Association of University Professors from 2005 to 2011, and three terms on the AAUP's Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure from 2009 to 2018. He was a member of the International Advisory Board of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes for two terms, 2011-2017. B√©rub√© was named a University Scholar for research at the University of Illinois in 1995 and was awarded the Faculty Scholar medal for research from Penn State in 2012.  Life, education and career  The son of Maurice Berube (now Eminent Scholar Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Educational Leadership at Old Dominion University), B√©rub√© was born and raised in New York City. He attended Regis High School. He received a B.A. in English from Columbia University in 1982 and a Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia, where he studied from 1983 to 1989. B√©rub√© held a professorship in the English department at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign from 1989 to 2001, where he was affiliated with the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory and the Afro- American Studies and Research Program. In 2001, B√©rub√© moved to Penn State for the then-newly created Paterno Family Professorship in Literature, from which he resigned in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. From 1996 to 2016, B√©rub√© edited \\"Cultural Front\\", the New York University Press series which published his 2009 book The Left at War and his 1998 book The Employment of English, as well as fifteen other titles, many in disability studies. He now co-edits \\"Crip: New Directions in Disability Studies\\" for NYU Press along with Robert McRuer and Ellen Samuels. He maintained a personal blog from 2004 to 2010 and wrote for Crooked Timber from 2007 to 2012.  Publications and achievements  B√©rub√© drew attention in the early 1990s for his essays in the Village Voice and Village Voice Literary Supplement (VLS), which dealt with (among other things) political correctness, postmodernism, and cultural studies. In 1994 he published an essay in Harper's Magazine, \\"Life As We Know It: A Father, A Son, and Genetic Destiny\\", about his son Jamie, who has Down syndrome, and in 1995 a review essay in The New Yorker on contemporary black intellectuals; these essays, particularly the latter, drew a wide array of energetic and often contentious responses. Some of the VLS essays were revised and republished in B√©rub√©‚Äôs second book, Public Access (1994). Since then, B√©rub√© has continued to write for newspapers and magazines, including Dissent, the Nation, the New York Times (and New York Times Magazine), the Boston Globe, the Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post. Since 1997 he has also been a contributor to the Chronicle of Higher Education. B√©rub√©'s third book, Life As We Know It: A Father, A Family, and an Exceptional Child, was published in 1996. Following a positive review by Beverly Lowry, Life As We Know It was named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year; it was also named as one of the best books of the year by Maureen Corrigan of National Public Radio. It is an expanded account of Jamie's first four years, as well as a discussion of disability rights, abortion and prenatal testing, early intervention programs, early childhood language acquisition, school policy, and theories of justice. In 2005-06, B√©rub√© emerged as a critic of David Horowitz's \\"Academic Bill of Rights\\"; an account of that campaign, together with a description of B√©rub√©'s pedagogy in undergraduate classes, makes up most of B√©rub√©‚Äôs fifth book, What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts? Classroom Politics and \\"Bias\\" in Higher Education (2006). B√©rub√© also published a number of essays critical of figures on the antiwar left and their response to the terrorist attack of 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, though he said he opposed the Iraq War; the argument was elaborated in his seventh book, The Left At War, published in 2009. In 2016 B√©rub√© published two books in disability studies: The Secret Life of Stories, a study of narrative strategies involving varieties of intellectual disability, and Life as Jamie Knows It, a sequel to Life as We Know It written with substantial input from the now-adult Jamie B√©rub√©. B√©rub√© lives in State College, Pennsylvania, with his wife Janet Lyon. Their first child, Nicholas, is an architect working in Boston.

He was the assistant commander of a platoon of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Regiment during World War II. He was the first Azerbaijani to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, on 11 December 1941. Mammadov was awarded the title for reportedly killing 70 German soldiers and three officers.  Early life  Mammadov was born on 16 March 1919 in Chaparly to a peasant family. He graduated from the Kirovabad Industrial College. He worked at a textile mill. Mammadov volunteered for the Red Army in 1939.

Understanding their strategy, Mammadov ordered his troops to hold fire, allowing the enemy to get within 10‚Äì15 meters. After three German assaults, he launched a counter-attack with bayonets. The Germans lost over 300 soldiers and retreated. Mammadov personally killed approximately 70 enemy troops, including three officers.

Career Much of Hunter's fame was built upon her resemblance to Marilyn Monroe; indeed, her Playboy pose was obviously inspired by Monroe's notorious 1949 nude photo session with Tom Kelley from which her own Playboy photo came. The similarity in look between Hunter and Monroe also came into play when a nude Hunter starred in a stag film called, The Apple-Knockers and the Coke. For many years there have been those who have seen the film and have mistaken Hunter for Monroe. Hunter went on to have a film career that consisted mostly of sexy parts in B-movies such as White Lightnin' Road and The Art of Burlesque. She also appeared alongside the Three Stooges in 1957's Outer Space Jitters. Perhaps one of her biggest film roles was with fellow bombshell Mamie Van Doren in Sex Kittens Go to College. She also had guest roles in prominent television series such as Perry Mason and My Three Sons, and appeared in a 1962 episode of Straightaway.

In 358 career games, Clark recorded a batting average of .262 and accumulated 32 home runs and 149 runs batted in (RBIs). Clark was born in South Amboy, New Jersey, where he attended St. Mary's High School, and joined the New York Yankees organization after graduating. He spent the next six seasons playing minor league baseball and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. He made his major league debut in 1947, and after one year with the Yankees, he spent four seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He was a member of the World Champion Yankees and Indians after the two teams won the 1947 World Series and 1948 World Series, respectively. He then played with the Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox through 1953, and played minor league baseball until 1958. After retiring, he returned to South Amboy and resided there until his death in 2012. Early life and minor leagues Clark was born in South Amboy, New Jersey on June 16, 1923. His parents were Alfred and Helen Clark, and he had four brothers and two sisters. He attended St. Mary's High School in South Amboy, which is now Cardinal McCarrick High School, where he served as the baseball team's shortstop. Clark led the 1939 baseball team to the county and state championships, and was named to the All-State baseball team that year; he has since been inducted into his high school's athletic Hall of Fame. After graduating from high school, Clark was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. He was scouted while in high school, and was invited to a tryout in Newark, New Jersey, where he was signed to a minor league deal. Clark spent his first year in their farm system with the Easton Yankees of the Eastern Shore League and the Amsterdam Rugmakers of the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican League. He hit .325 for the Yankees in 70 games, and .368 in 20 games for the Rugmakers. In 1942, he was promoted to the Norfolk Tars of the Piedmont League, where he spent the season as the team's second baseman and played with future major league teammate Vic Raschi. In 129 games with the team, he hit .328 with 34 doubles. The following year, Clark was promoted to the Newark Bears of the International League, having played one game for them the previous year. After playing in 24 games for the Bears, he was called to serve the United States Army in World War II. Clark served with the combat medical corps in England and France, and saw some active combat in Germany. After being discharged at the conclusion of the war, Clark returned to baseball in 1946. He was unable to stay in baseball shape due to combat duties, and as a result of having slowed down, the Yankees organization converted him to an outfielder and third baseman. In 97 games for Newark, Clark hit .344 with 14 home runs and 70 runs batted in. Major leagues Clark played well enough in 1946 to earn a tryout for the 1947 New York Yankees, and competed with Frank Colman for the final outfield position. He lost the battle and began the season in Newark. Over the course of the 1947 season in Newark, he had a batting average of .334 with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs. His efforts got him noticed by the Yankees, and he made his major league debut on August 5. Within two weeks of being called up, Clark had a streak of six straight at-bats with a hit. He finished the regular season with a .373 batting average in 24 games. He was named to the 1947 World Series roster, and played in three games. In game seven, he served as a pinch hitter for Yogi Berra, hitting a single, which helped the Yankees win the World Series; he considered this one of his greatest moments in professional baseball. He wore the #3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947, and was one of the last players to wear it before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the following year. On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Walt Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm. He was primarily a starter in the outfield for the first half of the season, and during the second half he split time in right field with Hank Edwards. Clark finished the year having played 81 games, most in the outfield and a few at third base, and hit .310 with nine home runs and 38 RBIs. The Indians tied with the Boston Red Sox that season and had to play a tie-breaker to earn the right to play in the 1948 World Series. In that game, Indians manager Lou Boudreau placed Clark at first base, the first time he had played that position at any level. Clark then played in one game in the World Series, going hitless in four plate appearances as the Indians won the series. Clark started the 1949 Cleveland Indians season primarily as a pinch hitter, having lost his platoon duties alongside Edwards to Bob Kennedy. He was used mainly as a pinch hitter throughout the year, and by August he was sent down to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League to make room for Luke Easter, finishing the year with a .176 batting average in 35 games. In 42 games with San Diego over the last two months of the season, Clark hit .295 with 11 home runs. During spring training in 1950, Clark hit .473, leading to a battle with Kennedy and Easter for the right field spot. He spent the season in Cleveland as the backup in right field for Kennedy, and had a .215 batting average with six home runs in 59 games. In 1951, Clark served as a substitute outfielder for three games with the Indians after Easter was out due to injury. After those three games, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics along with Lou Klein for Sam Chapman. His outings that season included a four-hit game against the St. Louis Browns on June 24. In 59 total games, 56 with the Athletics, Clark had a .251 batting average in 171 at-bats. He spent the 1952 Philadelphia Athletics season as the fourth outfielder after being considered for a starting outfield position alongside Elmer Valo and Gus Zernial. In a game on June 12, Clark ran into the outfield fence chasing a fly ball, and missed some playing time as a result. Late in the 1952 season, Clark was ejected and fined $50 for arguing strikes in a game where Athletics Eddie Joost and manager Jimmy Dykes were also ejected; Clark's was the only fine not to be rescinded, a move that occurred on Dykes's request. In 71 games, he hit .274 with seven home runs. Clark started the 1953 season with the Athletics, and started off the year with a grand slam home run in spring training against the Philadelphia Phillies in the tenth inning. In 20 games with the Athletics, Clark had a .203 batting average and 13 RBIs, which led the team when that he was sold to the Chicago White Sox in mid-May. A month later, after playing in nine games for the White Sox, he was purchased by the Rochester Red Wings for $20,000, returning to the minors and ending his major league career. Later life Clark spent the next five seasons with the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, part of the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In 80 games in 1953, he had a .328 batting average. He came close to making the 1954 International League All-Star team, but missed the cut by four votes to Sam Jethroe. He finished the year with a .323 average and 18 home runs. During the offseason when he was with Rochester, Clark also played winter baseball for various teams in the Puerto Rican League. To start the 1955 season, Clark held out for a new deal because he felt that he deserved a promotion to the Cardinals' major league roster; he ended the holdout in March. That season, he hit .308 with 23 home runs, 84 RBIs, and was named as a finalist for the International League Most Valuable Player Award. For the next two seasons, Clark hit .289 and .285, and he finished his time in Rochester with four straight seasons of 20 or more doubles. He ranks in the top ten in Red Wings history for RBIs (7th), home runs (9th), games played (9th), and hits (10th), and is a member of the Red Wings Hall of Fame, inducted in 1998. He began the 1958 season with the Denver Bears, but left the team due to the distance between himself and his family. In his final year of professional baseball, he played a combined 70 games with the New Orleans Pelicans, San Antonio Missions, and Indianapolis Indians. After retiring from professional baseball, Clark worked for 30 years as an employee of Iron Workers Local 373, and served as a member of the South Amboy city council. He lived with his wife, Frances, and the two had six children together. He died on April 2, 2012, in South Amboy.

Palmer first rose to prominence in 1160 as one of the triumvirate of grandees who replaced the assassinated Admiral Maio of Bari. He was \\"a man of great learning and eloquence,\\" according to Hugo Falcandus. On the death of Bishop Rinaldo de Lusio in 1154, Palmer was elected bishop of Syracuse, but he was not consecrated until 1169. On Saturday 11 March 1161, he joined with three other great ecclesiastics of the kingdom-- Romuald, Archbishop of Salerno; Robert, Archbishop of Messina; and Tristan, Bishop of Mazara--to incite the people of Palermo to rise against the rebels led by Matthew Bonnellus and free the royal family. In 1162, Sylvester of Marsico died and Henry Aristippus was disgraced, thus Palmer was the only member of the original triumvirate left in power. The replacements, Matthew of Ajello and the ca√Ød Peter, remained in power until the death of King William I in 1166. They automatically became the chief advisors of the regent, the queen mother Margaret of Navarre. Margaret, however, distrusted Palmer and Matthew and appointed the ca√Ød above them, greatly disaffecting the two. Palmer joined Gilbert, Count of Gravina, cousin of the queen, in open opposition to the eunuch. At that time, Palmer was a candidate for the vacant archdiocese of Palermo, as were his fellow bishops: Tristan of Mazara, Roger, Archbishop of Reggio, and Gentile, Bishop of Agrigento. However, Margaret further ostracised the court by securing the consecration of Stephen du Perche, her own cousin, as archbishop (1167). Of all the ecclesiastical contenders, Palmer was most infuriated. The next year (1168), however, a rebellion led by Henry, Count of Montescaglioso, a brother to the queen, toppled the new archbishop and forced him to flee. Palmer was a guarantor of the outgoing Stephen's safety. With Stephen gone a council was set up to assist Margaret. It included not only Palmer, but Romuald of Salerno, Gentile of Agrigento, John, Bishop of Malta, Matthew of Ajello, the new ca√Ød Richard, Henry of Montescaglioso, Counts Richard of Molise and Roger of Geraci, and Walter of the Mill, a fellow Englishman who would eventually take up the Palermitan see so coveted of Palmer. Palmer had opposed Stephen and he opposed Walter, too. He joined the queen, not in writing to Pope Alexander III, but to Thomas Becket, who wrote back: :There is one other request, which I will whisper in your ear and which I hope you will grant me; and that is that you would do your utmost with the King and Queen to obtain the recall to Sicily of that noble man Stephen, Elect of Palermo; for reasons which shall at present be nameless and also because by doing so you will earn the lasting gratitude of the King of France and his entire Realm.\\" Clearly, Becket was unaware of Palmer's deep dislike of Stephen. Palmer was to become estranged from Becket in the near future, however. In 1170, Palmer and Robert of Loritello went to discuss the marriage of the young king with Joanna, daughter of Henry II of England. According to Becket, then at odds with Henry (odds that famously soon killed him), Palmer was enticed to the king's side by an offer of the bishopric of Lincoln. However, Palmer had recently been consecrated by the pope himself with the pallium and raised to metropolitan status: an offer of Lincoln, in England, would probably not have wooed him. After the betrothal was confirmed, Palmer and Alfano, Archbishop of Capua, travelled to Saint Gilles to receive Joanna and accompany her to Sicily. In 1182, Palmer was transferred to the see of Messina. In 1190, he was part of a delegation along with the archbishops of Monreale and Reggio, Margaritus of Brindisi, and the strategos of Messina, Jordan du Pin, who failed in negotiations with Richard the Lion-Hearted. Palmer died soon after. Palmer had tried but could not convince Peter of Blois to return to Sicily. Palmer was responsible for the glass and mosaics of Syracuse Cathedral. His tombe survives in the Cathedral of Messina, almost intact. Sources * *Norwich, John Julius. The Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194. Longman: London, 1970. *Hugo Falcandus.

She was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan, Scotland. Bangor was the lead vessel of her class and one of the diesel-engined versions. She was ordered on 12 July 1939, laid down on 19 September 1939, launched on 23 May 1940, and commissioned on 7 November 1940.  Wartime service  On 18 November 1940 Bangor was assigned to the 9th Minesweeping Flotilla (MSF) based at Scapa Flow. On 12 February she was bombed whilst in the Moray Firth. No damage was done but her W/T was out of action and she retired to Aberdeen for repairs. In March 1941, the 9th MSF transferred to the Portsmouth Command. On the morning of 19 May, Bangor and a group of minesweeping trawlers were attacked by nine Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Three bombs were dropped, aimed at Bangor, Darthema and Computator from a low attack. Darthema and Computator both suffered minor damage from near misses with no casualties. Bangor and Darthema claimed to have damaged two of the aircraft, which both retired southwards, making smoke and losing height. In December 1941 the flotilla moved its centre of operation to Harwich. In August 1942 Bangor was involved in Operation Jubilee - the raid on Dieppe. As a large area off Dieppe was believed to have been mined by the enemy, the minesweepers opened proceedings for the raid. During the afternoon of 18 August, the 9th and 13th MSFs sailed separately from Portsmouth for the vicinity of Beachy Head, so as to give the impression that one was carrying out a clearance sweep in the area, the other proceeding on passage up the channel. The 9th Flotilla commenced sweeping at 00:03 and at 01:05 turned to port and got in sweeps; the 13th Flotilla began 8 minutes earlier and finished at 00:51. Everything went without a hitch; the channel was about four cables wide, clearly marked on both sides and at the ends; only one mine was seen. The Flotillas then manoeuvred to keep clear of the approaching expedition and soon after 05:00 turned for home, setting flag Dan buoys to mark the channels in daylight on the way back. They returned in company to Portsmouth, having carried out their work with efficiency and precision. In June 1944, Bangor was involved in Operation Neptune - the naval component of the D-Day landings in Normandy. The 9th Flotilla was part of Force J, sweeping channels. In the post assault phase the Flotilla was part of Task Force 129, which sailed from Portland on the night 24/25 June with the intention of bombarding Cherbourg. At 11:55 the minesweepers of Unit 1 (the 9th MSF) made their turn to sweep Fire Support Area 3, closely followed by the bombarding ships of group 1. As they entered the area they came under heavy fire; the German batteries had evidently been waiting until they were well within range. The destroyers, screening on the flanks, made smoke, but the enemy fire increased and after sweeping just three miles (half the intended distance) the minesweepers was forced to withdraw northwards. Bangor as HNoMS Glomma (M309) In May 1945 Bangor was involved in minesweeping operations to Norway. Norwegian service In June 1945 she was one of five Bangor-class minesweepers offered to the Royal Norwegian Navy on loan and was transferred on 11 November 1945. In October 1946 the Norwegian government decided to retain Bangor by purchase and was renamed Glomma. She was stricken in December 1961 and broken up.  References  * Warships of World War II, by H.

The width and depth of the trochanteric fossa varies taxonomically.Gray's AnatomyNetter 2003Romer 1956 In reptiliomorphs such as Seymouria or Diadectes and basal reptiles such as Pareiasaurus, the trochanteric fossa (also known as the intertrochanteric fossa) is a very large depression on the ventral/posterior side of the femur. It is bounded medially by the internal trochanter (also known as the lesser trochanter), laterally by the posterior branch of the ventral ridge, and inferiorly by the convergence of the anterior and posterior branches of the ventral ridge and the adductor ridge. In these taxa, the trochanteric fossa is the insertion point for the puboischiofemoralis externus muscle. In turtles, the intertrochanteric fossa is bounded anteriorly by the trochanter minor (sometimes called the lesser trochanter) and posteriorly by the trochanter major (sometimes called the greater trochanter; neither of these structures is likely homologous to the greater or lesser trochanter in mammals). Often, the intertrochanteric fossa is small and shallow due to the expansion of the two trochanters. In lepidosaurs, the intertrochanteric fossa is shallow but broad. It is bounded medially by the internal/lesser trochanter and anterior branch of the ventral femoral ridge, and often less distinctly bounded laterally as the greater trochanter and posterior branch of the ventral ridge are highly reduced or absent. In archosaurs and especially in dinosaurs, the intertrochanteric fossa is highly developed as both the internal/lesser trochanter and the greater trochanter are better developed.

They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and species of the genus Diomedea (great albatrosses) have the longest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to 3.7 m (12 ft). Albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but disagreement exists over the number of species. Albatrosses are the most efficient travelers of all vertebrates on the planet. They expend zero energy soaring hundreds of miles over the ocean each day using dynamic soaring and slope soaring. They have a tendon in each shoulder locking their wings fully-extended, so once aloft and soaring across a fair breeze they never need to flap their wings. Like some vultures they hunt by smell, sensitive to the odor of carrion and other biological processes. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of \\"ritualised dances\\", and last for the life of the pair. A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt. A Laysan albatross, named Wisdom, on Midway Island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world; she was first banded in 1956 by Chandler Robbins. Of the 22 species of albatrosses recognised by the IUCN, all are listed as at some level of concern; three species are critically endangered, five species are endangered, seven species are near threatened, and seven species are vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers. Albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks, and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations, and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.  Science  = Taxonomy and evolution = The \\"albatross\\" designation comprises between 13 and 24 species (the number is still a matter of some debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks. The taxonomy of the albatross group has been a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey, and many others in a greatly enlarged order, the Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. The albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight). Within the family, the assignment of genera has been debated for over 100 years. Originally placed into a single genus, Diomedea, they were rearranged by Reichenbach into four different genera in 1852, then lumped back together and split apart again several times, acquiring 12 different genus names in total (though never more than eight at one time) by 1965 (Diomedea, Phoebastria, Thalassarche, Phoebetria, Thalassageron, Diomedella, Nealbatrus, Rhothonia, Julietata, Galapagornis, Laysanornis, and Penthirenia). Thalassarche melanophris) on display at the Museum of Osteology. By 1965, in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatrosses, they were lumped into two genera, Phoebetria (the sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble the procellarids and were at the time considered \\"primitive\\" ) and Diomedea (the rest). Though a case was made for the simplification of the family (particularly the nomenclature), the classification was based on the morphological analysis by Elliott Coues in 1866, and paid little attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of Coues's suggestions. More recent research by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) and other researchers around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses. They proposed the resurrection of two of the old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers. While some agree on the number of genera, fewer agree on the number of species. Historically, up to 80 different taxa have been described by different researchers; most of these were incorrectly identified juvenile birds.Double, M.C. & Chambers, G.K., (2004). \\"The need for the parties to the Agreement on Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) to establish a robust, defendable and transparent decision-making process for the construction and maintenance of their species lists \\". Proceedings of the Scientific Meeting of Agreement on Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), Hobart, Australia, 8‚Äì9 November 2004 Phylogenetic relationships of the albatross genera, based on Nunn et al., 1996 Based on the work on albatross genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species,Robertson, C. J. R. and Nunn, G. B. (1998) \\"Towards a new taxonomy for albatrosses\\" in: Proceedings First International Conference on the Biology and Conservation of Albatrosses, G.Robertson & R.Gales (Eds), Chipping Norton:Surrey Beatty & Sons, 13‚Äì19, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with the conclusion that the Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all‚Äîin 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's molecular study of the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period 35‚Äì30 million years ago (Mya), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 Mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. The oldest widely accepted fossil albatross is Tydea septentrionalis from the early Oligocene of Belgium.Mayr, G.; Tennyson, A.J.D. (2019). A small, narrow-beaked albatross from the Pliocene of New Zealand demonstrates a higher past diversity in the feeding ecology of the Diomedeidae. Ibis Diomedavus knapptonensis is smaller than all extant albatrosses and was found in late Oligocene strata of Washington State, USA. Plotornis was formerly often considered a petrel but is now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid- Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 Mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 Mya.Brooke, M. (2004). Albatrosses and Petrels Across the World Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK The fossil record of the albatrosses in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete than that of the Southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of short- tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early PleistoceneGelasian, formerly Late Pliocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. Aldiomedes angustirostris was a uniquely narrow-beaked species from the Pliocene of New Zealand. The articles on Diomedea, Phoebastria, and Thalassarche contain more data on fossil species of living albatross genera. = Morphology and flight = Portrait of a southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora): Note the large, hooked beak and nasal tubes. The albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds; they are the largest of the Procellariiformes. The bill is large, strong, and sharp-edged, with the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. This bill is composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two \\"tubes\\", long nostrils that give the order its former name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes, where the tubes run along the top of the bill. These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft. The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring. Like other Procellariiformes, they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources, whereas most birds depend on eyesight. The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order that can walk well on land. Albatrosses, along with all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in drinking sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes, it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their noses or is forcibly ejected. Taking off is one of the main times albatrosses use flapping to fly, and is the most energetically demanding part of a journey. The adult plumage of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage with a great deal of brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross). Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage. The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) are the largest of any bird, exceeding , although the other species' wingspans are considerably smaller at, down to . The wings are stiff and cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long-winged seabirds: dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind, thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient. The only effort expended is in the turns at the top and bottom of every such loop. This maneuver allows the bird to cover almost 1000 km/day without flapping its wings. Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves. Albatross have high glide ratios, around 22:1 to 23:1, meaning that for every metre they drop, they can travel forward 22 metres. They are aided in soaring by a shoulder-lock, a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure, a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels. Albatrosses range over huge areas of ocean and regularly circle the globe. Albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies take a clockwise route, and those flying south fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained. This efficient long-distance travelling underlies the albatross's success as a long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, but their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas rest on the ocean's surface until the wind picks up again, as using powered flight is not energetically worthwhile though they are capable of flight to avoid danger. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift. The dynamic soaring of albatrosses is inspiring to airplane designers: German aerospace engineer Johannes Traugott and colleagues have charted the albatross's nuanced flight pattern and are looking for ways to apply this to aircraft, especially in the area of drones and unmanned aircraft. = Distribution and range at sea = Three birds on Midway Atoll, 1958 Most albatrosses range in the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California, and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Gal√°pagos Islands and feeds off the coast of South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Gal√°pagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds. It is not known for certain why the albatrosses became extinct in the North Atlantic, although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.Cocker, M., & Mabey, R., (2005) Birds Britannica London:Chatto & Windus, The use of satellite tracking is teaching scientists a great deal about the way albatrosses range across the ocean to find food. They undertake no annual migration, but disperse widely after breeding‚ÄîSouthern Hemisphere species often undertake circumpolar trips. Evidence also exists of separate ranges for different species at sea. A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island, the Campbell albatross and the grey-headed albatross, showed the Campbell albatross primarily fed over the Campbell Plateau, whereas the grey-headed albatross fed in more pelagic, oceanic waters. Wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry, feeding only in waters deeper than 1000 m (3281 ft); so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked, \\"It almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000 m\\". Also, evidence shows different ranges for the two sexes of the same species; a study of Tristan albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged to the west of Gough and females to the east. Birdlife has satellite tracking records for each of the 22 species of albatross in their seabird-tracking database. = Diet = Light-mantled albatrosses regularly dive to feed, and can dive to below 12 m (39 ft). The albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. For most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid. The use of data loggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be an important part of the diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly. Until recently, albatrosses were thought to be predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators, or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird, has shown that while some species, like the wandering albatross, do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the light- mantled albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5 m and can dive as deep as 12.5 m. In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey. = Breeding and dancing = Albatrosses are colonial, usually nesting on isolated islands; where colonies are on larger landmasses, they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from the sea in several directions, like the colony on the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin, New Zealand. Many Buller's albatrosses and black- footed albatrosses nest under trees in open forest. Colonies vary from the very dense aggregations favoured by the mollymawks (black-browed albatross colonies on the Falkland Islands have densities of 70 nests per 100 m2) to the much looser groups and widely spaced individual nests favoured by the sooty and great albatrosses. All albatross colonies are on islands that historically were free of land mammals. Albatrosses are highly philopatric, meaning they usually return to their natal colony to breed. This tendency is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was . Albatrosses live much longer than other birds; they delay breeding for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She is the oldest confirmed wild bird and the oldest banded bird in the world. Albatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly, after about five years, but even once they have reached maturity, they do not begin to breed for another few years (even up to 10 years for some species). Young nonbreeders attend a colony prior to beginning to breed, spending many years practising the elaborate breeding rituals and \\"dances\\" for which the family is famous. Birds arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross language, but can neither \\"read\\" that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately. After a period of trial and error learning, the young birds learn the syntax and perfect the dances. This language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are around older birds. The repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (such as the sky-call). When a bird first returns to the colony, it dances with many partners, but after a number of years, the number of interactions drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used again. An albatross chick at Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, Midway Atoll Albatrosses are held to undertake these elaborate and painstaking rituals to ensure that the appropriate partner has been chosen and to perfect partner recognition, as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment. Even species that can complete an egg-laying cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years. The great albatrosses (i.e. wandering albatross) take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging. Albatrosses lay a single subelliptical egg, white with reddish-brown spots, in a breeding season; if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken, then no further breeding attempts are made that year. The larger eggs weigh from . The \\"divorce\\" of a pair is a rare occurrence, due to the diminished lifetime reproductive success it causes, and usually happens only after several years of breeding failure. All the southern albatrosses create large nests for their egg, using grass, shrubs, soil, peat, and even penguin feathers, whereas the three species in the North Pacific make more rudimentary nests. The waved albatross, though, makes no nest and even moves its egg around the pair's territory, as much as , sometimes causing it to lose the egg.Anderson, D.J. & Cruz, F. (1998) \\"Biology and management of the Waved Albatross at the Galapagos Islands, pp. 105‚Äì109 in Albatross Biology and Conservation (Robertson, G. & Gales, R. eds) Chipping Norton:Surrey Beatty and & Sons In all albatross species, both parents incubate the egg in stints that last between one day and three weeks. Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days (longer for the larger albatrosses), the longest incubation period of any bird. It can be an energetically demanding process, with the adult losing as much as of body weight a day.Warham, J. (1990) The Petrels ‚Äì Their Ecology and Breeding Systems London: Academic Press. After hatching, the chick, which is semialtricial, is brooded and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period, the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty. After the brooding period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around ). The meals are composed of fresh squid, fish, and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most Procellariiformes, and gives them their distinctive musty smell. Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes between 140 and 170 days.Carboneras, C. (1992) \\"Family Diomedeidae (Albatross)\\" in Handbook of Birds of the World Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, which return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea. Hybridization is rare in albatrosses, largely due to the low incidence of breeding-site vagrancy.  Albatrosses and humans  = Etymology = The name \\"albatross\\" is derived from the Arabic al-qƒÅd≈´s or al-·∏°a·π≠·π≠ƒÅs (a pelican; literally, \\"the diver\\"), which travelled to English via the Portuguese form alcatraz (\\"gannet\\"), which is also the origin of the name of the former prison Alcatraz. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the word alcatraz was originally applied to the frigatebird; the modification to albatross was perhaps influenced by Latin albus, meaning \\"white\\", in contrast to frigatebirds, which are black. In modern Portuguese, the word used for the bird, albatroz, is in turn derived from the English albatross. They were once commonly known as goonie birds or gooney birds, particularly those of the North Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the name mollymawk is still well established in some areas, which is a corrupted form of malle-mugge, an old Dutch name for the northern fulmar. The name Diomedea, assigned to the albatrosses by Linnaeus, references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into birds. Finally, the name for the order, Procellariiformes, comes from the Latin word procella meaning \\"a violent wind\\" or \\"a storm\\". = In culture = An 1837 woodcut from the journal O Panorama Albatrosses have been described as \\"the most legendary of all birds\\". An albatross is the central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, representing the innocence and beauty of God's creation. The albatross metaphor is derived from this poem; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have \\"an albatross around his neck\\", the punishment given to the mariner who killed the albatross. A widespread myth holds that sailors believe shooting or harming an albatross is disastrous, due in part to the poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them, as reported by James Cook in 1772. However, other sailors reportedly caught the birds but let them free again, possibly believing that albatrosses were the souls of lost sailors,Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . so killing them would bring bad luck.From the website of the Cape Horners' organisation caphorniers.cl: A.I.C.H. Emblem. (retrieved 24 February 2011). Synthesis of an article written by the International Secretary General of the A.I.C.H., Captain Roger GHYS, as published in LE COURRIER DU CAP N¬∞3 of December, 1999. By Rear Admiral Roberto BENAVENTE, President, Chilean Section AICH The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape Horners, i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title \\"albatrosses\\" in the Cape Horners' organisation. A captive albatross tormented by jeering sailors is also a metaphor for the social travails of the sensitive po√®te maudit in Charles Baudelaire's poem L'Albatros: > Le Po√®te est semblable au prince des nu√©es Qui hante la temp√™te et se rit de > l'archer; Exil√© sur le sol au milieu des hu√©es, Ses ailes de g√©ant > l'emp√™chent de marcher. (The poet is like this prince of the clouds, who haunts the storm and mocks the archer; but exiled on earth surrounded by jeers, his giant wings make him helpless to walk.) In golf, shooting three under par on a single hole has recently been termed scoring an \\"albatross\\", as a continuation on the birdie and eagle theme.The Players Championship ‚Äì What Golf Betting Is All About. scottishgolfhistory.net  Non-European mythologies  The MƒÅori used the wing bones of the albatross to carve flutes. In Hawaiian mythology, Laysan albatrosses are considered aumakua, being a sacred manifestation of the ancestors, and quite possibly also the sacred bird of KƒÅne.Hor Osterlund, Holy M≈çlƒ´: Albatross and Other Ancestors, Oregon State University Press Japanese mythology, by contrast, refers to the short-tailed albatross as ahodori, \\"fool bird\\", due to its habit of disregarding terrestrial predators, making it easy prey for feather collectors. = Birdwatching = Albatrosses are popular birds for birdwatchers, and their colonies are popular destinations for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are taken out of many coastal towns and cities, such as Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart, and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands. = Threats and conservation = This black-browed albatross has been hooked on a longline. In spite of often being accorded legendary status, albatrosses have not escaped either indirect or direct pressure from humans. Early encounters with albatrosses by Polynesians and Aleuts resulted in hunting and in some cases extirpation from some islands (such as Easter Island). As Europeans began sailing the world, they, too, began to hunt albatross, \\"fishing\\" for them from boats to serve at the table or blasting them for sport.Safina, C. (2002) Eye of the Albatross: Visions of Hope and Survival New York: Henry Holt & Company This sport reached its peak on emigration lines bound for Australia, and only died down when ships became too fast to fish from, and regulations forbade the discharge of weapons for safety reasons. In the 19th century, albatross colonies, particularly those in the North Pacific, were harvested for the feather trade, leading to the near- extinction of the short-tailed albatross. Of the 21 albatross species recognised by IUCN on their Red List, 19 are threatened, and the other two are near threatened.IUCN (2004). Red List: Albatross Species . Retrieved July 27, 2007. Three species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross, Tristan albatross, and waved albatross. One of the main threats is commercial longline fishing, as the albatrosses and other seabirds‚Äîwhich will readily feed on offal‚Äîare attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem. On Midway Atoll, collisions between Laysan albatrosses and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths, as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations. Studies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds, the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts, and the destruction of annual nesting sites. Tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed 3000 birds in flight collisions during 1964‚Äì1965 before the towers were taken down. Closure of Naval Air Facility Midway in 1993 eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft. Recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths, though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to poison birds by ingestion.Audubon Watchlist. Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) . audubon2.org Albatross plumes were popular in the early 20th century. In 1909 alone, over 300,000 albatrosses were killed on Midway Island and Laysan Island for their plumes. Another threat to albatrosses is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses have evolved to breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island, the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice.Amos, Jonathan (24 July 2005). Albatross chicks attacked by mice. BBC News. Introduced species can have other indirect effects; cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands, introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat. The remains of this Laysan albatross chick show the plastic ingested before death, including a bottle cap and lighter. Ingestion of plastic flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has increased dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches, and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.Auman, H.J., Ludwig, J.P., Giesy, J.P., Colborn, T., (1997) \\"Plastic ingestion by Laysan Albatross chicks on Sand Island, Midway Atoll, in 1994 and 1995.\\" in Albatross Biology and Conservation, (ed by G. Robinson and R. Gales). Surrey Beatty & Sons:Chipping Norton. pp. 239‚Äì44 Scientists and conservationists (most importantly BirdLife International and their partners, who run the Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines, and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch.Food and Agriculture Organisation (1999) \\"The incidental catch of seabirds by longline fisheries: worldwide review and technical guidelines for mitigation\\" . FAO Fisheries Circular No. 937. Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Rome. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners, which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatrosses taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators. One important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by thirteen countries, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce bycatch, pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.  Species  Current thinking divides the albatrosses into four genera. The number of species is a matter of debate. The IUCN and BirdLife International recognise 22 extant species (listed below), ITIS recognise 21 (the 22 below minus T. steadi), and one recent paper proposed a reduction to 13 (indicated in parentheses below), comprising the traditional 14 species minus D. amsterdamensis. * Great albatrosses (Diomedea) ** Wandering albatross (D. exulans) ** Antipodean albatross (D.

A direct descendant of the 1787-chartered Pittsburgh Academy, and the oldest part of the university, the school serves as \\"the liberal arts core\\" of the university; some 30 departments and programs provide instruction in natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences to all students at the Oakland campus, including more than 10,000 Dietrich School undergraduates. In addition, the Dietrich School has over 1,500 graduate and professional students, over 15% of the university's post-baccalaureate student population, making it the largest graduate school in the Pittsburgh area. History The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, the primary home of the School of Arts and Sciences. In September 2011, a large banner was hung from the Cathedral's 16th to 5th floor announcing the name change for the school. Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as the Pittsburgh Academy and chartered in 1787,The Story of Pitt the School of Arts and Sciences may have originally grown out of a school that was active before the charter was granted, perhaps as early as 1770. Thus the SAS began its life as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin, in what is now downtown Pittsburgh, which was then on the frontier of the United States. The school was established on the principles of teaching the rudiments of the \\"sacred six\\" of the Scottish universities, as Brackenridge was himself Scottish. Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school took the name the Western University of Pennsylvania. By the 1830s, the school faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the state legislature's desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly ended the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state. Similar pressure to abandon the liberal arts focus of the school occurred again between 1902 and 1908 when industrial development in the region was attracting more students to technical trades. Financial pressure mounted to abandon the traditional liberal arts curriculum and focus on more vocational training, but petitions from students, alumni, faculty and some trustees kept the original mission intact. Out of the school, which by then was often referred to as \\"the College\\", came the genesis for some of the university's other schools, such as the School of Engineering and School of Law. Both continued to require the traditional classical studies for a bachelor's degree, but they began to formally separate around the time when the university moved to its new location in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, when it also changed its name to the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. With the formal separation from the school of engineering, the school became known as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Several of the school's departments, like mathematics and chemistry, have an unbroken line of professors from the Pittsburgh Academy. Courses such as astronomy, chemistry, English, mathematic, modern languages, and classics, are essentially descended from the academy and resemble the course listings of the day.

It was written by Dwayne McDuffie and illustrated by Scott Kolins. The first issue of the series was released on July 6, 2006 and the final issue on December 6, 2006. It was edited by Tom Brevoort and lettered by Dave Lamphear. Plot The series follows a group of mismatched superheroes and supervillains -- Hank Pym, the Wasp, Gravity, Medusa, Firebird, Alyosha Kravinoff, Venom (Mac Gargan), The Hood and the Space Phantom --who have been abducted by a cosmic entity, supposedly The Beyonder, to the alien Battleworld for unknown purposes. Deathlok was later introduced to the roster. Synopsis A mysterious man buries three recently killed familiar aliens (Bi-Beast, a Skrull, and a Kree), the newest of many corpses in a huge graveyard. Meanwhile, on Earth, the fledgling hero Gravity, defeats Brushfire in a quick fight, then examines a teleportation device that takes him to outer space. He awakens, meeting Spider-Man, Medusa, Firebird, Wasp, Venom (Mac Gargan, formerly the Scorpion), Henry Pym, Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff), and the Hood. Shortly after, a being, apparently the Beyonder, appears and claims that if they slay their enemies, they will have rewards in a nod to the Secret Wars. Venom promptly attacks Spider-Man, impaling him and demanding his reward. As Spider-Man apparently dies, he mistakes Medusa for Mary Jane Watson. She then retaliates, and after a quick argument with the others, uses her hair to whip Venom. The sonic booms hitting his body cause him potentially fatal damage, and when the others distract her, Venom runs away, destroying the ship's controls. Gravity attempts to steer the ship but is unable to control it and it crashes into the planet below. Medusa protects the others, using her hair like an airbag, but she is injured in the leg. Pym uses a shrunken medpack in his pocket and tends to her injury, when a mysterious man named Michael appears. Pym pulls out a shrunken Quinjet, and Michael says that flying is a bad idea. The group disembarks, only to be pursued by Dragon Man, who destroys the new jet. Michael then morphs, revealed to be Deathlok, while Spider-Man gets up, apparently undeceased. Deathlok manages to overpower Dragon Man, with help from the remaining conscious heroes. Afterwards, Michael/Deathlok reveals that he has been here before, with a group consisting of Captain Marvel, Wonder Man, Darkhawk, Dracula, Terror, Coldblood and Sleepwalker. Michael agreed to stay on the planet so the other heroes could return home. Meanwhile, Kraven manages to find Spider-Man, who is doing well despite massive body damage, and tells Kraven that he needs to slay the others, so that he wins. Kraven realizes this isn't how Spider-Man would talk, and when the Hood shows up, and further damages the questionable hero, takes him to the group. \\"Spider-Man\\" reveals a major secret: he is really the Space Phantom. The heroes battle Space Phantom, who uses his powers to become Xemnu. After a fight with the others, Pym defeats the Xemnu form and the Phantom becomes Northstar. Pym, who tagged the Phantom with a tracer, takes the others into Limbo. The real Northstar is there. Back on Battleworld, Venom destroys Pym's gateway to Limbo, stranding the group there and demanding for the Beyonder to give him his prize. In Limbo, Firebird and Pym have a short romantic interlude, and when the Space Phantom comes back, the team threatens him. He teleports the entire group to Battleworld, where they defeat Venom. Suddenly, Pym seemingly uses a disintegration beam to destroy the entire group, and asks for his reward, and The Watcher appears. In truth, Pym has merely shrunk the group in order to draw out the \\"Beyonder\\". Pym asks for three wishes: to return home, to learn the true identity of the \\"Beyonder\\", who is actually an old X-Men foe named the Stranger who wanted to study humanity, and for the Stranger to stop his experiment and never repeat it. Pym reveals that he only shrunk the group. The Stranger initially refuses to stop his experiment, but the Watcher's presence causes him to reconsider, and he leaves. Battleworld begins to break up, but Gravity temporarily holds together the world and sends the group to the teleporter, back to Earth, sacrificing his life. The entire group attends his funeral, including Mac Gargan. The Watcher states that he was there because Gravity's short career would inspire future events, and story captions state that Gravity's story is not over. Collections *Beyond!

Michael Collins, the Deathlok seen in the Beyond! miniseries, enlists the aid of the Fantastic Four to retrieve the body of Gravity, stolen from its grave. Feeling very angry about this, Collins saw it as his duty to get the body back. The FF agreed to help and after a discussion with the Watcher, they discovered that Gravity's body was stolen by the living alien planet known as Epoch which had plans of her own for the body, reviving him and appointing him the new protector of the universe after Quasar had fallen due to Annihilus.

The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906‚Äì1957) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones. The Nazarov cyclization reaction As originally described, the Nazarov cyclization involves the activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4œÄ-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway. The success of the Nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis. The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published. Mechanism The mechanism of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4œÄ conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a Œ≤-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product. Mechanism of the classical Nazarov cyclization activated by Lewis acid catalyst. Note that Œ±- and Œ≤-substitution are not required for the reaction to occur and that more complex Œ±-substitution is also possible. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with Œ±-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating Œ±-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Relevant conformations for the Nazarov cyclization; Lewis-acid chelation in the s-cis conformer Similarly, Œ≤-substitution directed inward restricts the s-trans conformation so severely that E-Z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction, whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific. The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs. (See Interrupted cyclizations below) Stereoselectivity in the Nazarov cyclization evident via reductive trapping Along this same vein, allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of Œ≤-hydrogens, obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s-cis conformer. Allene substrates for Nazarov cyclization with lowered steric interactions Classical Nazarov cyclizations Though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone. Early investigation into the Nazarov cyclization Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone. Synthesis of Trichodiene using a classical Nazarov cyclization Synthesis of Nor-Sterepolide using a classical Nazarov cyclization =Shortcomings= The classical version of the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate. # Strong Lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction (e.g. TiCl4, BF3, MeSO3H). These promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups, limiting the substrate scope. # Despite the mechanistic possibility for catalysis, multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction. This limits the atom economy of the reaction. # The elimination step is not regioselective; if multiple Œ≤-hydrogens are available for elimination, various products are often observed as mixtures. This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required. # Elimination destroys a potential stereocenter, decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction. # Protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective, meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers. Shortcomings of the Nazarov cyclization reaction Modern variants The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation \\"intercepted\\" in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field; key examples are given below. =Silicon-directed cyclization= The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the Œ≤-silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the mid-1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction. With bicyclic products, the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees. Silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization The silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether. Synthesis of Silphinene using Nazarov cyclization =Polarization= Drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for \\"polarized\\" Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the Œ±-proton, allowing selective formation of the trans-Œ±-epimer via equilibration. Polarized Nazarov cyclization It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone, although the efficiency of the reaction (yield, reaction time, etc.) is typically lower. =Alternative cation generation= By extension, any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been a large number of examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride. Nazarov cyclization initiated by dichlorocyclopropane rearrangement In the total synthesis of rocaglamide, epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stannane likewise generates a pentadienyl cation via ring opening of the resultant epoxide. Nazarov cyclization initiated by oxidation =Interrupted cyclization= Once the cyclization has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping has been developed extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity. Nazarov cyclization cationic cascade Enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is paired with a Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to Œ≤-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group. Tandem Nazarov cyclization and Michael reaction =Enantioselective variants= The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts. Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to \\"rotate\\" in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below. Torquoselectivity in the Nazarov cyclization Silicon-directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the silyl-group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating \\"towards\\" it via unfavorable steric interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary. (The starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization.) Silicon as a chiral auxiliary for the Nazarov cyclization Tius's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. Axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer in the Nazarov cyclization of allenyl vinyl ketones Tius has additionally developed a camphor-based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent. Synthesis of roseophilin using asymmetric Nazarov cyclization The first chiral Lewis acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. Lewis-acid mediated asymmetric Nazarov cyclization Related Reactions Extensions of the Nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name. For example, an Œ±-Œ≤, Œ≥-Œ¥ unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations. =Retro-Nazarov reaction= Because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation, Œ≤-electron donating substituents often severely impede Nazarov cyclization. Building from this, several electrocyclic ring openings of Œ≤-alkoxy cyclopentanes have been reported. These are typically referred to as retro-Nazarov cyclization reactions. Retro-Nazarov reaction =Imino-Nazarov reaction= Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov cyclization reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) have few instances; there is one example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over- stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.

Sea View, the 1885 Elizabethan-Revival mansion already on the site, was incorporated into the design, and lent its name to the new chateau.Vertiges of Sea View, the 1885 James P. Kernochan mansion originally on the site can be seen in the chateau's north wing. Work on the exterior continued for two years, and required the use of many railroad cars and trucks. Rooms that had been imported intact from France and installed in Washington, D.C. 20 years earlier were moved again and reassembled in Newport, and the new building was constructed around them. When the interiors were completed in 1925, there were 17 rooms on the first floor, 25 on the second, and 12 on the third. It is believed to have been one of the largest buildings to be moved in this manner. Seaview Terrace cost over $2,000,000 to build. The main house featured turrets, stained-glass windows, high arching doorways and, in keeping with its seaside location, shell motifs. The American League of Architects awarded Bradley's architect, Howard Greenley, a 1928 medal for the chateau. Bradley's wife, Julia Williams Bradley, died in August 1929, and her funeral was held in the house's chapel. Edson Bradley spent five more summers at the mansion before his death in 1935. The Bradleys' daughter, Julie Bradley Shipman, took over the estate and lived there until 1941. Her husband, the Right Reverend Herbert Shipman, Episcopal Bishop of New York, died in 1930. She vacated the house after a dispute with the City over non-payment of three years back taxes. During World War II, the house was used by the U.S. Army as officers' quarters. In 1949 the property was sold for only $8,000. =Private schools= In 1950, the property became an exclusive all-girl summer boarding school, and was renamed \\"Burnham-by-the-Sea\\". The house was owned and the summer school run by Mr. and Mrs. George Waldo Emerson. During the academic year, Mrs. Emerson was a headmistress for the Mary Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Massachusetts. In 1968, the Mary Burnham School merged with the Stoneleigh Prospect Hill School to become the Stoneleigh-Burnham School, but the summer school continued to be run by the Emersons until they sold Seaview Terrace. During the regular school year, the school operated as Newport School for Girls. In 1971 and 1972, Seaview Terrace also was home for The New School, grades 2 through 8. Headmaster for the New School was Fr. Toller Cranston. ;Filming From 1966 to 1971, the Gothic horror soap opera Dark Shadows used Burnham-by-the-Sea as the exterior set for the fictional Collinwood Mansion, which in turn inspired the depiction of the Kingston Mansion in the \\"What the Hex is Going On?\\" episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. During the summer of 1973 the movie The Great Gatsby was filmed next door. All the children at the school, who had a 9 pm curfew, spent the evenings listening to the filming of the cars driving up and down the old Oelrichs property, Rosecliff. =Carey Mansion= In 1974, Millicent and Martin T. Carey of New York, purchased the mansion. Being one of the largest of Newport's mansions, the Careys were faced with large costs for upkeep. The main house and gatehouse were leased to Salve Regina University, which renamed it the Carey Mansion. The former stables were also leased as a dormitory for Salve Regina, which renamed it Seaview. The mansion's Drawing Room, used by the university for performances and practice, was renamed Cecilia Hall, for the patron saint of music (Saint Cecilia). During the 1980s Seaview Terrace housed the American syndicate of The America's Cup. On August 31, 2009, Salve Regina University terminated the lease with the Carey family. The Careys' daughter, Denise Anne Carey, an architect from New York, currently lives there. The Syfy network featured the mansion in the first season, second episode of its paranormal reality show Stranded on March 6, 2013. Seaview Terrace is privately owned and is not open for tours or tourist visits. Features =Whispering gallery= Cecilia Hall features a whispering gallery, an elliptical room reminiscent of Saint Paul's Cathedral, in which a person standing at one of the foci can hear the slightest whisper uttered at the other. =Stained glass= The Flagellation (circa 1544‚Äì47) was an early-Renaissance stained-glass window designed for Milan Cathedral. It was part of a series portraying the Passion of Christ, and believed to have been made in the workshop of Currado Mochis da Colonia.The Flagellation The window was bought by Edson Bradley for the house when it was located on Dupont Circle, and may have once been owned by Stanford White.The Flagellation =Estey organ= Carey Mansion's pipe organ, Opus 2140, was made by Jacob Estey of Estey Organ Company, Brattleboro, Vermont. It has a Tremolo Electric Detached Console Automatic Player which includes Great pipes, Swell, and multiple pedals. It is no longer operational, and the console is missing.Estey Pipe Organs Opus List =Hedge= Carey Mansion has never throughout its history had any sort of rigid fencing or wall surrounding the property. There are two main gateposts, but around the rest of the property a decorative hedge is used, rather unsuccessfully, to keep people away, making it the largest of its kind in Newport with such a characteristic.

Whether as an admixture or in its pure form, Neste Renewable Diesel is able to supplement or partially replace diesel fuel without problems. Unblended Neste Renewable Diesel meets the requirements set by the European pre-standard CEN TS 15940. Fuel blends meet the European diesel fuel standard EN 590. Despite the former name BTL, the feedstock is vegetable oil and waste animal fats, not whole plants. However, fuel quality is equal to the synthetic Fischer-Tropsch BTL and GTL diesel fuels. Process Neste Renewable Diesel is produced in a patented vegetable oil refining process. Chemically, it entails direct catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (hydrogenolysis) of plant oils, which are triglycerides, into the corresponding alkanes and propane. The glycerol chain of the triglyceride is hydrogenated to the corresponding C3 alkane, propane ‚Äî there is no glycerol sidestream. This process removes oxygen from the oil; the diesel is not an oxygenate like traditional transesterified FAME biodiesel. Catalytic isomerization into branched alkanes is then done to adjust the cloud point in order to meet winter operability requirements. As it is chemically identical to ideal conventional diesel, it requires no modification or special precautions for the engine. Production Two refineries in Porvoo, Finland were brought on stream in 2007 and 2009, each with a capacity of 0.2 million tons per year. Two larger refineries, with annual production of 0.8 million tons both, were brought on stream in Singapore and Rotterdam in 2010 and 2011, respectively.Neste Oil to build a NExBTL Renewable Diesel plant in Singapore - Neste Oil Com Emissions Neste has estimated that the use of NExBTL diesel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 90 percent in comparison to fossil based diesel. Due to the chemistry of the process, the renewable diesel is pure alkane and contains no aromatics, oxygen (although oxygen would have promoted cleaner combustion) or sulfur. Cloud point The cloud point (or gel point) can be adjusted down to ‚àí40 ¬∞C (‚àí40 ¬∞F) during the manufacturing process, compared to petrodiesel's cloud point of ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí22 ¬∞F), which could improve the cloud point of diesel when blended. The cloud point is the temperature when the wax precipitates out of the fuel in the form of small wax crystals, making the fuel cloudy and more difficult to move within the fuel lines and systems of vehicles. The lower the cloud point of a particular fuel is, the more suitable it is in colder environments. Feedstocks A mix of palm oil, rapeseed oil, and waste fat from the food industry can be used. Initially, palm oil was the principal (90%) feedstock, although its share was reduced to 53% by 2013 and to less than 20% by 2017. However, the EU biofuels industry has increased its use of palm oil by 365% during the years 2006‚Äì2012, from 0.4 to 1.9 million tonnes per year, and the trend is increasing.International Institute for Sustainable Development, September 2013. The EU Biofuel Policy and Palm Oil: Cutting subsidies or cutting rainforest? https://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/bf_eupalmoil.pdf Also note that categorising Palm Fatty Acid Distillate, PFAD, as waste is controversial since it can be used to make e.g. soap, candles and animal fodder.

PFAD is also omitted from sustainability requirements regarding biodiversity and high carbon stock areas (HCV).Norwegian Environment Agency: Facts on biofuels. (in Norwegian) 3. March 2016. http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/no/Nyheter/Nyheter/2016/Mars-2016/Fakta-om- biodrivstoff/ Palm oil may endanger the carbon neutrality of the fuel if forest is cleared and swamps drained to make way for palm plantations. In response to this concern, Neste has joined the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to certify that the palm oil is produced in a carbon-neutral, environmentally responsible manner. Neste purchases most of its palm oil from IOI, but requires a separate production chain for the RSPO-certified palm oil, in order not to create demand for rainforest destruction. Deforestation would release carbon to the atmosphere, and reduce the overall carbon binding capacity of the land, thus it would be counterproductive with respect to the carbon balance. In 2007, Greenpeace protested the use of palm oil, concluding the potential for deforestation remains. According to Greenpeace, increasing the production of palm oil reduces the available land area, so indirectly generates demand for rainforest destruction, even if the palm oil itself is rainforest-certified. Greenpeace noted RSPO is voluntary organization and claimed government regulation in palm oil producing countries, such as Indonesia, cannot be relied on because of political corruption. Greenpeace also claimed palm oil diesel can actually produce three to 10 times more carbon dioxide emissions than petrodiesel because of the indirect effects of clearing of swamps, forest fires and indirect generation of demand for land area. Greenpeace demands that Neste should use domestic feedstocks such as rapeseed oil or biogas, instead. However, rapeseed is a slower-growing, cold- climate source with lesser carbon-binding potential than the oil palm, making emissions from cultivation and transport proportionally more severe. In 2017, the share of palm oil in the feedstock has been reduced to less than 20%, being replaced by reclaimed waste oils such as used frying oil, animal and fish fat, and camelina, jatropha, soy and rapeseed oil. Use of reclaimed waste oil reduces the greenhouse gas impact by 88‚Äì91%. Neste is continuing to look into new feedstock, including algae, jatropha and microbial oil. Use This diesel is blended with petrodiesel. A market is created because the European Union required 5.75% of transport fuels should be biofuels by 2010. The EU further decided on 18 December 2008, that by 2020, the share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transportation be at least 10% of the final consumption of energy. Systems and regions without an electrical grid will be the long-term market for hydrotreated vegetable oils, as the EU prefers electrical use by factor 2.5. In the Helsinki area, the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council and the Helsinki City Transport conducted a three-year experiment by running buses with 25% Neste Renewable Diesel at first, and then switching to 100% in 2008.YTV. YTV and HKL lead the way Biofuel reduces bus transportation emissions. http://www.ytv.fi/ENG/transport/travelling_news/lo_2007_10_03_biofuel.htm The trial, which was the largest field test of a biofuel produced from renewable raw materials worldwide, was a success: local emissions were decreased significantly, with particle emissions decreased by 30% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 10%, with excellent winter performance and no problems with catalytic converters. Since then, Helsinki buses have run on Neste Renewable Diesel. As a result of its hydrocarbon nature, Neste Renewable Diesel operates without problems in current diesel vehicles in all climatic conditions. It does not have any of the drawbacks of the traditional ester type FAME biodiesel, such as cold operability, 'best before' date, engine and fuel system deposit formation, risk for microbial growth and water pick up, engine oil dilution and deterioration. Neste Renewable Diesel can be blended into diesel fuel in any ratio, whereas the use of the traditional FAME biodiesel is limited to maximum 7% by the EN 590 standard in order to avoid technical problems in engines and vehicles. The European Union requires the use of renewable fuel, therefore it is expected to be a major market for Neste Renewable Diesel. Following a proposal by VDA, Daimler Trucks and Daimler Buses recommend the biofuel Neste Renewable Diesel as an admixture to petrodiesel.

The Las Marismas zone forms a large part of the province of Huelva, province of Seville and province of C√°diz in Andalucia, Spain. The area includes parts of the municipalities of Isla Mayor, Los Palacios y Villafranca, La Puebla del R√≠o, Utrera, Las Cabezas de San Juan and Lebrija. Rice farming in this area produces 40% of Spain's national crop. Some areas are protected for wildlife and habitat, including dunes. History Approximately two millennia ago the wetlands comprised a large lagoon and estuary, known as Lacus Ligustinus in Latin, leading to the Guadalquivir River mouth with some sand bars to the South. Over time the lake silted up, gradually transforming into marshland. This silt has formed into a barrier of dunes extending approximately along the coast, known as Arenas Gordas (English: \\"the fat sands\\"). The marquessate de las Marismas del Guadalquivir is a Spanish noble title named after the area; this noble title was created by Royal Decree of King Ferdinand VII in 1829 for Alejandro Mar√≠a Aguado y Ram√≠rez de Estenoz.Marquesado de las Marismas del Guadalquivir - Real Decreto de 20 de mayo de 1829 In the early 21st century, the Guadalquivir wetland region's main economic activity is agriculture, specialising in the cultivation of rice. An area of about 400 km¬≤ is devoted to rice farming. It has an annual output of about 310,000 metric tonnes, equating to approximately 40% of Spain's rice production. Protected area The wetland zone acts as a buffer zone between the human settlements of the Guadalquivir region and Do√±ana National Park, a protected area of marshland, streams, and sand dunes. The National Park was established in 1969 as a nature reserve when the World Wildlife Fund joined forces with the Spanish Government to purchase a substantial part of the local wetlands in order to preserve them.  Fauna  The Las Marismas area is home to a large number of wildlife species. Commonly seen terrestrial animals include deer, lynx, and wild boars. Notable avian species include vultures, flamingos, herons, spoonbills, and ducks. The rare Spanish imperial eagle lives here, whose population is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Overall, as stated by Stephen A. Kent, Scientology can be seen as a \\"multi-faceted transnational corporation that has religion as only one of its many components. Other components include political aspirations, business ventures, cultural productions, pseudo-medical practices, pseudo-psychiatric claims, and (among its most devoted members who have joined the Sea Organization), an alternative family structure.\\" Business practices Several of the Church's practices resemble business operations, including paying recruiters a cut of the money made from the people they attract and the franchising network that results in large revenues for the highest levels of the Church. Such activities distinguish Scientology from other religious organizations. The Church pays 10% commissions to recruiters, called Field Staff Members (FSMs), on new recruits they bring in who take a course or receive counseling. In addition, Church of Scientology franchises/missions, pay the Church roughly 10% of their gross income. The Church charges for auditing and other Church-related courses required for advancing through the ranks of Scientology. These programs can run to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Cooper, Paulette Scandal of Scientology, Chapter 19, Tower Publications, NYC, 1971 The Scientology Bridge to Total Freedom consists of one half relating to levels of higher states of spiritual existence, and the other half the skills relating to helping another reach that level. Training is described as \\"50% of the route\\"L. Ron Hubbard OEC Vol 4 page 411 The Religious Technology Center maintains strict control over the use of Scientology symbols, icons, and names. It claims copyright and trademark over the \\"Scientology cross,\\" and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published these protected images without permission in books and on websites. Because of this, it is difficult for individual groups to attempt to practice Scientology publicly without any affiliation or connection to the \\"official\\" Church of Scientology. Scientology has sued a number of individuals who attempted to set up their own \\"auditing\\" practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these competitors down. Writing in Skeptic magazine, Michael Shermer contrasted such practices with mainstream religions: \\"Envision converting to Judaism but having to pay for courses in order to hear the story of Abraham and Isaac, Noah and the flood, or Moses and the Ten Commandments. Or imagine joining the Catholic Church but not being told about the crucifixion and the resurrection until you have reached Operating Theological Level III, which can only be attained after many years and tens of thousands of dollars in church- run courses.\\" The German government takes the view that Scientology is a commercial enterprise, and Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Philippines, Israel and Mexico remain unconvinced that Scientology is a religion. Other countries have recognised Scientology as a religion. An Australian Government Inquiry into Charities in 2001 found that the 1983 High Court case which found Scientology to be a religion, and also defined religion for the Constitution, used as the standard to determine what organisations are charitable. L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology as a business Critics have claimed that L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, decided to market the practice as a religion for practical reasons. Harlan Ellison reported being present when the idea for creating a new religion was first discussed: \\"Lester del Rey then said half-jokingly, 'What you really ought to do is create a religion because it will be tax-free,' and at that point everyone in the room started chiming in with ideas for this new religion. So the idea was a Gestalt that Ron caught on to and assimilated the details. He then wrote it up as 'Dianetics: A New Science of the Mind' and sold it to John W. Campbell Jr., who published it in Astounding Science Fiction in 1950.\\" Hubbard had a different origin story and stated that Dianetics had been researched during the years 1945-50 and it was initially presented as a science, however religious ideas were added into the book Science of Survival published in 1951.\\"The Story of Dianetics and Scientology\\" lecture 18 October 1958 by L. Ron Hubbard: And by 1938, I thought I had a common denominator to all life....So when I got out of the war...I collected my treasury checks and that was what financed the first of the research from which we benefit now. It's very funny but that was what financed it. I went right down in the middle of Hollywood, I rented an office, got ahold of a nurse, wrapped a towel around my head and became a Swami. And I said ‚Äì oddly enough, I gave nobody my name, I didn't say what I was doing, and by 1947, I had achieved clearing.\\" After the commercial failure of the Dianetics Foundation and disputes over the direction of the subject, Hubbard revisited the possibility of classifying his philosophical teachings as a religion. In a 1953 letter, Hubbard wrote that \\"the religion angle\\" seemed to make sense as \\"a matter of practical business\\". The Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. had obtained tax-exempt status in 1956 on the claim that it was \\"a corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes, no part of the earnings of which inures to any individual\\". That status was revoked in 1958, on the grounds (as argued by the U.S. Department of Justice in subsequent proceedings) that the Church's \\"most extensive and significant activities are directed towards the earnings of substantial fees\\" and \\"the founder of the organisation L. Ron Hubbard remains in complete control and receives substantial remuneration and perquisites both from the taxpayer and a network of affiliates\\". The findings of fact in the case included that Hubbard had personally received over $108,000 ($600,000 in 2012 value) from the Church and affiliates over a four- year period, over and above the percentage of gross income (usually 10%) he received from Church-affiliated organizations. In addition, the Church had paid for Hubbard's car and for his personal residence, Mary Sue Hubbard had made over $10,000 renting property to the Church, and while the $3,242 paid to Hubbard's daughter Kay had been \\"generally designated as salary or wages\\", \\"the record is devoid of any evidence showing services performed by Miss Hubbard for [the Church].\\" The Court of Claims concluded \\"What emerges from these facts is the inference that the Hubbard family was entitled to make ready personal use of the corporate earnings.\\"Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology, Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P., Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London December 1971. Cited at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/fosthome.html . More recently the IRS granted religious recognition and full tax deductibility to the Church of Scientology in the USA in 1993. Per policy set by Hubbard, The Church of Scientology is prohibited from providing free services, requiring compensation or some other form of volunteer commitment in exchange. Professional auditors According to the Church of Scientology, Field Auditors usually make a significant amount of their income from 15% FSM (Field Staff Member) Commissions. This is from referring their preclears to nearby (larger) Class V orgs or to the Sea Orgs for advanced training and processing. Field Auditors also charge for auditing services, which the Church of Scientology says can also generate significant income:  Church of Scientology-owned properties  The church owns approximately 12 million square feet of property, with Hollywood at the center, and twenty-six properties worth 400 million. In Clearwater, Florida, is the church‚Äôs spiritual headquarters, where the church possesses 68 parcels of land worth 168 million. Buildings in other countries are typically restored architectural landmarks. The church also owns a 500-acre compound in Southern California, a cruise ship called the Freewinds and a 64,000 square-foot medieval-style castle and resort in South Africa. The church also owns historic buildings, including the 1927 hotel Ch√¢teau √âlys√©e, remodeled as the Celebrity Center International, the 1923 Christie Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard which is now the Church of Scientology Information Center, a community center in South L.A., (a 1930s art deco building), and the Braley building in Pasadena, now a church, constructed in 1906 for Edgar Braley‚Äôs bicycle emporium. In 2016, the church opened the Scientology Media Productions, previously the KCET studios. It was purchased from KCET in 2011 for 42 million dollars and preserved as a Los Angeles historic-cultural monument. Although church spokesperson Karin Pouw says that restoring buildings of historical significance is a way that the church ‚Äúgives back to the community,‚Äù according to LA Weekly, former high-ranking Scientology officials claim that profit is the main reason why the studio was built, while the church maintains its tax-free status.

He is also the first cousin of former Prime Minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.  Early life  Mumtaz Ali Bhutto was born on 28 November 1933 in the village of Pir Bux Bhutto, Larkana District, Sindh, British Raj. Before partition his father Nawab Nabi Bux Khan Bhutto was a member of the legislative assembly and had a strong political background.  Education  Bhutto attended St George's College in Mussoorie and then Lawrence College, Murree, after independence of Pakistan. He got his 'barrister' degree from Lincoln's Inn, and undergraduate and 'master's degrees in 1959 from Oxford University in the United Kingdom.  Political career  Bhutto became a member of the National Assembly at the age of 32 years on 5 March 1965. When he and his cousin Zulfikar Ali Bhutto announced for a new political party 'Pakistan Peoples Party' PPP on 30 March 1967, he also became the founding member and principal executive committee member of the party. He and his cousin Zulfikar Ali Bhutto fought the election of 17 March 1970 against Muhammad Ayub Khuhro and Qazi Fazlullah Ubaidullah. He got a victory against Qazi Fazalullah. His cousin, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan and Mumtaz Ali Bhutto became Governor of Sindh on 24 December 1971, then Chief Minister of Sindh Province on 1 May 1972. His cousin always used to call him a \\"talented cousin\\". Citing differences with Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto split from Pakistan Peoples Party and created his own party, Sindh National Front in 1989. In 2017, he merged SNF with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.  Chief Minister  As a Chief Minister, he announced Sindhi language as the official language of the Province. Sindhi Language Bill, 1972 was introduced by the Chief Minister Mumtaz Bhutto on July 3, 1972, in the Sindh Assembly, Pakistan. The 1972 Language violence in Sindh occurred starting on July 7, 1972, when the Sindh Assembly passed The Sind Teaching, Promotion and Use of Sindhi Language Bill, 1972 which established Sindhi language as the sole official language of the province resulting in language violence in Sindh. Due to the clashes, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, compromised and announced that Urdu and Sindhi will both be official languages of Sindh. The making of Sindhi as an equal language to Urdu for official purposes frustrated the Urdu-speaking people as they did not speak the Sindhi language. On 7 March 1977 he won a National Assembly seat and became a Federal Minister. In the year of 1977, his cousin nominated him as president of \\"PPP.Sindh\\". He was arrested during the struggle against the arrest of his cousin and then exiled by General Zia's government. On 31 March 1985 he announced for a new political Alliance named \\"Sindhi Baloch Pushtoon Front\\" at London to propagate ethnic nationalism in Pakistan. He also announced support for a new constitutional framework for Pakistan as a weak federation. He became the convenor of the alliance for Pakistan, returned to Pakistan, and once again arrested by the military government of Zia.

This data may include, but is not limited to: * raster position * depth * interpolated attributes (color, texture coordinates, etc.) * stencil * alpha * window ID As a scene is drawn, drawing primitives (the basic elements of graphics output, such as points, lines, circles, text etc. The Drawing Primitives by Janne Saarela ) are rasterized into fragments which are textured and combined with the existing frame buffer. How a fragment is combined with the data already in the frame buffer depends on various settings. In a typical case, a fragment may be discarded if it is farther away than the pixel that is already at that location (according to the depth buffer). If it is nearer than the existing pixel, it may replace what is already there, or, if alpha blending is in use, the pixel's color may be replaced with a mixture of the fragment's color and the pixel's existing color, as in the case of drawing a translucent object. In general, a fragment can be thought of as the data needed to shade the pixel, plus the data needed to test whether the fragment survives to become a pixel (depth, alpha, stencil, scissor, window ID, etc.) In computer graphics, a fragment is not necessarily opaque, and could contain an alpha value specifying its degree of transparency. The alpha is typically normalized to the range of [0, 1], with 0 denotes totally transparent and 1 denotes totally opaque. If the fragment is not totally opaque, then part of its background object could show through, which is known as alpha blending. .

Built in 1906 and located at 311 West 34th Street, it houses Manhattan Center Studios (home to two recording studios), its Grand Ballroom, and the Hammerstein Ballroom, one of New York City's most renowned performance venues. In 1976, the building was purchased by its current owner, the Unification Church for $3 million.Biermans, J. 1986, The Odyssey of New Religious Movements, Persecution, Struggle, Legitimation: A Case Study of the Unification Church Lewiston, New York and Queenston, Ontario: The Edwin Melton Press Some of the enterprises residing in the building include: Telemundo, Macy's, CFDA, WeWork, Facebook, iHeart Media, Samsung, American Heart Association, Robin Hood, FX Network, Endeavor, MAC Cosmetics, Viacom, SiriusXM, NBA, NBC Universal, Masterbeat, Broadway Cares Equity Fights AIDS. History The Manhattan Center was originally called the Manhattan Opera House and was built in 1906 by Oscar Hammerstein I. Hammerstein boldly sought to compete with the established Metropolitan Opera by offering grand opera to the New York public at lower ticket prices and with a superior orchestra and stage productions. Rapidly, it received critical acclaimE.g. Richard Aldrich, \\"A New Opera House Worthy of Support\\", New York Times, 30 Dec 1906, p. 31. and became a popular alternative to the Met, and many great operas and celebrated singers debuted at the new theater. In 1910, after the Metropolitan Opera felt it could no longer tolerate the competition, it offered Hammerstein $1.2 million to cease producing opera for a period of 10 years. He accepted the offer and experimented with various other types of entertainment before ultimately selling the building. In March 1911, it was opened as a \\"combination\\" house by the Shubert brothers featuring vaudeville shows during the week and concerts on Sunday nights at affordable prices. In 1922, the Manhattan Opera House was purchased by the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Free Masonry, who built a new building fa√ßade and a new Grand Ballroom on the seventh floor. In 1926, Warner Bros rented the ballroom to set up a studio for the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system to record the New York Philharmonic orchestra for the film Don Juan. That film marked the release of the inaugural commercial film featuring a recorded musical soundtrack. By 1939, the name of the building had been changed to the Manhattan Center, now a multi purpose venue featuring a variety of different types of events. In 1986, Manhattan Center Studios was formed to develop the center into a venue with the capability of holding multimedia festivities. MCS expanded the audio recording facilities when Studio 4 was opened in 1993. Studio 7 was rebuilt in 1996 to become a state-of-the-art control room capable of servicing all types of recordings and live events in the ballrooms. In March 1990, the company began investing in video equipment and studio facilities to expand into the video and television industry. The company's video post production facilities in Studio 9 were completed in 1993 and in the years that followed, two fully equipped television studios were built. Studio 1 was completed in 1994 and Studio 6 was completed in 1995. The connection of the studios to the Ballrooms makes them attractive venues for live broadcast events and webcasts. Studio 1 and Studio 6 were temporarily closed throughout the Spring and Summer of 2003 to complete extensive upgrades as the company entered into a three-year contract with Atlantic Video, a Washington, D.C. based television services and production company. Beginning in 1997, the Hammerstein Ballroom underwent a major renovation and reopened as a concert hall for popular musical acts. Events The Manhattan Center became a hot spot for \\"big band\\" dances as well as trade shows, union meetings and other social functions. Among the diverse events held here throughout the decades that followed were radio broadcasts, recordings and performances by such acts as Bunny Berigan, Paul Robeson, Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte, Perry Como, Leonard Bernstein, David Bowie, Grateful Dead, Bob Marley, Evanescence, Tool and Alison Moyet, among others. WWF Monday Night Raw recorded its inaugural episode at the Grand Ballroom; on January 22, 2018, the Manhattan Center co-hosted the Raw 25th anniversary special with Barclays Center. The Hammerstein Ballroom has hosted Extreme Championship Wrestling events in the years before its closing and in its revivals in 2005 and 2006. Since 2006, the Manhattan Center has played host to yearly Ring of Honor events, both in the Grand Ballroom and the Hammerstein Ballroom. In 2014, TNA taped multiple episodes of their Impact Wrestling TV program at the Grand Ballroom on June 25‚Äì27, and then again August 5‚Äì7 and in 2015 also held their debut on Destination America and taped upcoming episodes on January 7‚Äì9. Several seasons of NBC's America's Got Talent were taped there. The Manhattan Center was home to Al Jazeera America's main studio and production facilities. The Manhattan Center is also the current home of Hillsong Church NYC, with weekly church gatherings happening every Sunday.

Bhuttos have played a prominent role in Pakistani politics and government. The family has held the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), since its inception in 1967. The Bhuttos are of Arain ancestry, based in Sindh province. The Bhuttos have been settled in the area for over three centuries. Two members of the family, Zulfikar and Benazir Bhutto, have been the Prime Minister of Pakistan, whereas Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir's widower, served as the President of Pakistan, from 2008 to 2013. History Bhuttos originally migrated to Rajput family, Bhutto was 712AD invite in Sindh belong to Muslims Rajput family, during Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's reign. Following the conversion he took the title of Khan, becoming 'Sheto Khan'. In Sindh, Bhuttos under Sheto first settled at Ratodero, a few miles north of Larkana. Shah Nawaz Bhutto, a direct descendant of Sheto Khan, came to prominence during the British Raj as a dewan of the princely state of Junagadh in south-western Gujarat in India. During the Partition of India in 1947, the Muslim Nawab of Junagarh wanted to accede his state to the newly created Pakistan, but he faced rebellion by the population of Junagadh, majority of whom were Hindus. The Indian government thwarted Junagadh's accession to Pakistan, and the Bhuttos fled to Sindh in modern-day Pakistan. Shah Nawaz Bhutto moved to Larkana District in Sindh, where his land-ownership made him one of the wealthiest and most influential people in Sindh. Beginning the political dynasty, Shah Nawaz's third son Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1928-1979) founded the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) in 1967 and served as President and Prime Minister. He married an Iranian-Kurdish woman named Nusrat Bhutto. His daughter, Benazir (1953-2007), also served as Prime Minister, while Benazir's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, later served as president from 2008 to 2013. The Bhuttos continue to dominate the leadership of the PPP. Benazir's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari became co-chairperson in 2007.

They are named after the Greek word for \\"ray\\" due to their radial structure. Actinoform clouds can spread out over across and thus cannot be easily seen with the naked eye. In addition, actinoform clouds can form \\"trains\\" that are up to six times the length of the original cloud field, yet they maintain their own, distinct identity.  Description  In a satellite image, they look like distinct leaf-like or spokes-on-a-wheel patterns that stand out from the rest of the low-lying cloud field. However, why they have this shape or how they are formed is not known, but recent evidence suggests that the interaction of both radiation and precipitation may help to organize them on the mesoscale. The individual convective cells that collectively make up an actinoform cloud are quite shallow, with heights generally less than , and would be classified as stratocumulus clouds by an observer on the ground. Given the extensive mesoscale organization of these clouds, it is appropriate to describe them as mesoscale stratocumulus cloud systems (MSCS) in analogy with their deeper counterpart, the Mesoscale convective system.  History and climatology  Actinoform clouds were discovered in the 1960s soon after the launch of the TIROS V weather satellite. But until the late 1990s, scientists had dismissed them as merely a relatively uncommon transitional form between open- and closed-cell formations of stratocumulus clouds. In fact, the term \\"actinoform\\" is not included in the 2000 edition of the Glossary of Meteorology, which is considered to be the comprehensive reference work for meteorologists. However, these clouds are much more prevalent and complex than was originally thought. Careful study of MISR images of the western coast of Peru revealed that actinoform-like clouds showed up roughly a quarter of the time as distinct formations within the more common, stratocumulus clouds in that region. Closer examination showed that actinoform clouds occur worldwide in nearly every region where marine stratus or stratocumulus clouds are common, particularly off the western coasts of continents‚Äîespecially off Peru, Namibia in Africa, Western Australia, and Southern California. Such cloud systems are persistent year-round off the coast, yet in certain seasons they blow ashore and create the \\"June Gloom\\" effect on land. These cloud systems rarely form near the equator.  Meteorological effects  The effect of actinoform clouds on weather systems and climate patterns is still being analyzed. Meteorology professor Bjorn Stevens of the University of California, Los Angeles theorizes that they, in conjunction with open-cell stratocumulus clouds, are associated with drizzle formation. Observations from field studies in both the Northeast and Southeast Pacific seem to indicate that when marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds exist alone, in the absence of these open cells, the cloud formations are associated with light, or no, drizzle. When the open cells are present‚Äîand likewise actinoform clouds‚Äîthere seems to be a corresponding increase in drizzle. Thus, data from recent field studies suggest that the presence of \\"pockets of open cells\\" (POCs) and actinoform clouds is related to the onset of precipitation. In fact, professor Stevens discovered that the shape of the cloud field reorganizes itself when the clouds begin to rain. These clouds have also been known to carry hail.

Starting his career in his native Czechoslovakia, he played over 200 games for Banik Ostrava before moving to England where he played over 300 games for West Ham United. He later played for Queens Park Rangers where he was also goalkeeping coach; a role he later held with West Ham United. He played 40 games for Czechoslovakia and two games for the Czech Republic. Club career Miklo≈°ko started his career in his native Czechoslovakia with Ban√≠k Ostrava. =West Ham United= Miklo≈°ko's talent was noted by West Ham United manager Lou Macari, who signed him in February 1990, just before his resignation and the appointment of Billy Bonds as his successor, for a fee of ¬£300,000. His first game was on 18 February 1990 in a 2‚Äì2 away to Swindon Town. His fourth game was the second leg of the League Cup against Oldham Athletic. West Ham had lost the first leg, 6‚Äì0 with Phil Parkes in goal in what proved to be his last game for West Ham after an eleven-year association with the club. From this point until season 1997-98, Miklo≈°ko was the first-choice goalkeeper. In season 1990-91 he played 56 games for West Ham including every league game as they were promoted as runners-up from the Second Division. This had included conceding only 16 goals in away games, the best in the league. West Ham also made the semi-finals of the FA Cup, before losing to Nottingham Forest, with Miklo≈°ko playing in all of their seven cup games. He was named Hammer of the Year in 1991. Although the Hammers were relegated the following season and missed out on being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992, he helped them win promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt ‚Äî beginning a 10-year unbroken spell at this level. He is well remembered for a Man of the Match performance against Manchester United on the last day of the 1994‚Äì95 season where West Ham drew 1‚Äì1 with Manchester United at the Boleyn Ground to help secure Manchester United's rivals, Blackburn Rovers, their first league title in over 80 years. In his final season, he vied with Craig Forrest for the goalkeeper's position. His last game came on 6 December 1997 in a 2‚Äì0 away defeat by Derby County. Miklo≈°ko scored an own goal in the game. The following game he was replaced in goal by Forrest. A brave and excellent shot-stopper with a huge clearance kick, he played 374 times for the team. =Queens Park Rangers= Miklo≈°ko was sold to Queens Park Rangers in 1998 for a nominal fee after a successful loan spell. His last professional game came on 3 March 2001. In new manager, Ian Holloway's first game in charge, QPR lost 3‚Äì1 at home to Sheffield United. Later in 2001 he retired due to injury. International career Miklo≈°ko received 40 caps for Czechoslovakia and two caps for the Czech Republic. Post-football career After retirement, Miklo≈°ko returned to West Ham to take up a goalkeeping coaching role. He left the club in March 2010; neither club nor Miklo≈°ko commented as to why.

He was voted club player of the year in his first season ‚Äì the first black player to do so for Chelsea ‚Äì as the team finished fifth in the First Division and won the Full Members Cup. He remained with Chelsea until 1992, when he was transferred to Southampton for ¬£750,000 three months after signing a new five-year contract with Chelsea. Southampton faced regular battles for Premier League survival, though the club was never relegated. In the 1993‚Äì94 season he scored a last minute winner in a 5‚Äì4 defeat of Norwich City from a Matt Le Tissier corner that helped the club stay in the Premier League. He stayed on the South Coast until 1999, when he joined Huddersfield Town on a free transfer, scoring once against Yorkshire rivals Barnsley. However, disagreements with Huddersfield manager Steve Bruce ensured his time with the club was short-lived. Monkou made a return to Chelsea during the 2002‚Äì03 season, before finally retiring from the game.

The Redmont, named after Birmingham's Red Mountain is the oldest hotel in Birmingham still in use. It is currently owned by Bayshore Company Tampa, Florida, is managed by Rhaglan Hospitality LLC, and operates as a historic boutique hotel under the Curio Collection by Hilton brand. History The Redmont was opened on May 1, 1925, as a 200-room hotel with plans by architect G. Lloyd Preacher of Atlanta, Georgia. It was unusual at its time for having a private bath attached to every room as well as chilled water and ceiling fans. The \\"Rainbow Room\\" lounge debuted in 1937 and became the watering hole for an informal group of influential persons called the \\"Knothole Gang\\". In 1946 the hotel was purchased by businessman and hotel magnate Clifford Stiles. In 1947 Stiles converted the entire top floor into a New York-style penthouse apartment for himself and his family. This elegant penthouse was complete with terraces, private elevator, a lawn for pets and was the scene of many glamorous parties. Some say that Stiles, who died in 1975, still haunts the building. In 1952, singer Hank Williams spent his last night in the Redmont on an uncompleted trip from Montgomery to Charleston, West Virginia. One of the suites earned the moniker \\"the Lucky Governor's Suite\\" when it served as the local headquarters for the successful Jim Folsom and George Wallace gubernatorial campaigns of the 1940s, '50s and 60s. After decades of decline, the hotel was purchased in 1983 by an investment group made up of NBA players, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ralph Sampson. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 27 of that year. A $7 million renovation led to a grand re-opening in 1985. Another refurbishment in 2000 uncovered previously hidden architectural details and cleaned the exterior. In April 2006 the Redmont's ownership group announced plans to convert its two uppermost floors into nine one- and two-bedroom condominia with another luxury condominium in the penthouse. The condominia would have included hotel services such as housecleaning, valet parking, room service, security and bellhop assistance as well as access to the fitness center. Other plans included adding a coffee bar or doughnut shop at ground level. The owners also dropped their association with Crowne Plaza and began operating the hotel as an independent hotel. Due to the economic environment resulting from the Great Recession, the 2006 renovation plans were indefinitely suspended. thumb Current status Following the award of Alabama State Historic Tax Credits in October, 2013,Birmingham Business Journal, October 21, 2013 the hotel underwent a multimillion-dollar restoration which began in 2014. The restoration of the Redmont was assisted with financial contributions from the Alabama Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits and $400,000 in tax incentives from the City of Birmingham. Interior designer Natalie Toy was commissioned to plan the interior design of the building. The work, contracted to local company Stewart Perry, included completely updating all guest rooms, and adding a new independently-operated restaurant and bar, along with a caf√©.

Casca is a series of paperback novels, and since January 2014, ebooks as well, created and written by author Barry Sadler in 1979. The stories revolve around the life of Casca Rufio Longinus, the soldier in the Roman legions who drove the Holy Lance into the side of Jesus Christ on Golgotha, and (in the novels) who is doomed by Jesus to wander the Earth aimlessly, always as a soldier, until the Second Coming. The character is loosely based on the Longinus legend of Christianity. Sadler wrote some of the early novels in the series while the others were assigned to ghostwriters. Two subsequent novels (Casca 23: The Liberator and Casca 24: The Defiant) were written by Paul Dengelegi. The current author, Tony Roberts, has written all the novels since 2006, excluding Casca 29: Immortal Dragon and Casca 33: The Outlaw, which were written by Michael B. Goodwin. In April 2013, \\"Casca 29: Immortal Dragon\\" was removed from the list of books on casca.net due to alleged plagiarism, and shortly afterwards his other novel in the series, Casca 33: The Outlaw, was removed for the same reason. There is another story, in the form of an unauthorized audiobook, Casca: The Outcast, which was written by Paul Dengelegi in 2004. Series overview Casca was first introduced in Casca 1: The Eternal Mercenary. Little is known about his early life, although vague clues are given in various books in the series. He spent most of his adult life serving the Roman empire in the Legions, and there are some scraps of information about his family. He grew up in the hill country of Etruria, now known as Tuscany, to the north of Rome. The village name was Falerno.Casca 15: The Pirate When he was a child, he saw the 10th Legion march through his village en route to Gaul. His uncle, Tontine, enlisted into the army under Julius Caesar. His family died of plague and the young Casca burned the family home afterward. He enlisted into the 7th Legion at either MessiliaCasca 2: God of Death or Livorno.Casca 1: The Eternal Mercenary His first battle under the eagle of the 7th was on the German border against the Suevii when 15,000 tribesmen attacked them at dawn. Only 300 made it back into the forests of Germania. He joined the 10th Legion and was sent to Jerusalem where he was assigned to the execution detail for three prisoners, amongst whom was Jesus. At Golgotha, Casca stabbed Jesus with his spear, in an attempt to relieve Jesus of his pain and suffering. Jesus condemned Casca by saying, \\"Soldier, you are content with what you are. Then that you shall remain until we meet again. As I go now to My Father, you must one day come to Me.\\" As Jesus died, blood from his wound trickled down Casca's spear and onto his hand, and Casca unknowingly tasted it after wiping sweat from his mouth, causing his body to convulse in pain. Casca did not initially understand what was happening to him until he was condemned to work in labor mines over a 30-year period. There he slowly discovered that he does not age. He learned that he is immortal, although he can feel all pain inflicted on his person. While his wounds heal completely, his body accumulates countless scars over the centuries. (Edit), Casca was stabbed in the stomach by his superior officer, a mortal wound, in a fight over an Armenian dancer, he killed the man so he was arrested and thrown in jail, but by morning he was nearly healed, and he panicked and with a fingernail \\"dug out\\" some flesh from his arm and saw it heal. The curse of Jesus rang in his head: \\"Soldier, what you are today so you shall remain, until we meet again.\\" Then he knew he was immortal. He was sentenced to life in the slave mines and after 30 years managed to escape with help only to find himself in the arena in Rome as a gladiator trained in the school of Corvue. Casca possesses an affinity for spoken languages. He can master most languages that he encounters, including their dialects, colloquialisms, and sub-tongues. Casca is also superbly skilled in edged weapons. He was first trained as a Roman Legionnaire with the Gladius Iberius sword. He later improved those skills as a Gladiator in the Circus Maximus. Casca is easily recognizable by the long facial scar that he possesses. It runs from the side of his eye to his mouth in a crescent shape, giving him a permanent sneer. Casca acquired the scar while trying to short-change a local prostitute in the Holy Land. Over the years many onlookers assume that Casca received the wound while in battle; Casca just chuckles and thinks, \\"If they only knew.\\" Casca knew some of the most famous people throughout history, including: * Jesus Christ ‚Äì book 1 * Niccol√≤ Machiavelli ‚Äì book 3 * Heinrich Himmler ‚Äì book 4 * Adolf Hitler ‚Äì book 4 * Shapur II ‚Äì book 6 * Attila the Hun ‚Äì book 7 * Hern√°n Cort√©s ‚Äì book 10 * Moctezuma II ‚Äì book 10 * Tomas Torquemada ‚Äì book 10 * Omar Khayy√°m ‚Äì book 13 * Hassan-i Sabbah ‚Äì book 13 * Blackbeard ‚Äì book 15 * Max Immelmann ‚Äì book 21 * Genghis Khan ‚Äì book 22 * Marco Polo ‚Äì book 24 * Robert E.

He first met Casca when the latter was brought into the hospital with multiple gunshot wounds and a large mortar shell fragment lodged in his skull and into his brain, which should have been fatal. Dr. Goldman discovered Casca's unusual healing properties and became his biographer and chronicler after hearing his story. He is often visited by Casca for updates on his life and experiences throughout the ages. Dr. Goldman later leaves the Army and establishes his own practice. As Dr Goldman ages and reaches his mid-70s, he introduces Casca to Danny Landries, the son of his former army comrade, Colonel Bob Landries. Danny first meets Casca in book 34 (Devil's Horseman) and gradually takes over from Goldman as his biographer. =The Brotherhood of the Lamb= The Brotherhood of the Lamb is a fanatical religious sect and sworn enemy of Casca. It is run by an elder, who oversees the sect's hierarchy, the Inner Circle. The circle is composed of an elder and twelve other specially chosen brothers who run the militant religious organization. They preach force and power over traditional virtues of piety and compassion. The Brotherhood was founded by Izram, a man who called himself the Thirteenth Disciple, in the wake of Jesus's death at the hands of Casca's spear thrust. He purchased the spear from some of Casca's comrades to be used as a relic and symbol for the events on Golgotha. Known as \\"The Spear of Longinus\\", the sect worships the spear which forms the central focus at prayer times. On the most holy of days in the Brotherhood's calendar, the sect recreates the crucifixion, right down to killing one of their blessed brethren who has been selected to act the part of Jesus. Another, usually the Elder, plays the part of Casca, dressed in Roman uniform, who executes \\"Jesus\\" with their holiest relic, the Spear of Longinus. Izram went into the wilderness for forty days before a revelation came to him: Jesus said to Casca, \\"Soldier, you are content with what you are, so shall you be until we meet again\\". Therefore, he reasoned that when Jesus returned at the Second Coming he would meet Casca. The Brotherhood keeps Casca in their sights until that day; though they may hate Casca for his actions on Golgotha, they must not prevent him from meeting their Lord. Casca Longinus is their path back to Christ and they will stop at nothing in keeping their most hated enemy in their sights for all time. On occasions they inflict severe pain on Casca as punishment for his actions. Once, the Elder Dacort severed Casca's hand for daring to touch the Spear at their monastery in Asia. In Casca 6: The Persian, Rasheed, a minor acolyte, arranges to have Casca burned at the stake, thinking it just punishment for spearing Jesus. In Casca 9: The Sentinel, Elder Gregory murders Casca's adopted son, Demos, and his woman, Ireina, for which Casca crucifies Gregory to death. Casca was also a prisoner of the Brotherhood, in Casca 18: The Cursed and Casca 4: Panzer Soldier. In Casca 28: The Avenger he kills Elder Thassus as part of his mission of vengeance. In the novel Casca 35: Sword of the Brotherhood, the spear of Longinus is stolen by the Sassanid Persians and Casca is blackmailed into retrieving it.

Unbeknown to the Eternal Mercenary, this family slowly grows and seeks to thwart the efforts of the Brotherhood. We encounter them next in Casca 40 where Isabella Longini helps Casca during WWII, and again in Casca 42. Unlike the common habit where when a woman marries a man and loses her maiden name, in all cases of marriage the union results in the family name of Longini being retained, thus preserving their identity to one another.

A collection of standards, traditional and classical works performed as lullabies, the album was recorded in August 2004 in the band's home studio. A portion of proceeds from sales of the album are donated to charitable organisations, including Catholic Relief Services. Composition and style The album's track listing is derived from the songs Karen Peris sang to her young children. Among the covers featured from movies are \\"Stay Awake\\" from Mary Poppins, \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from The Wizard of Oz, \\"Moon River\\" from Breakfast at Tiffany's, and \\"Edelweiss\\" from The Sound of Music. The record features one original song, \\"My Love Goes With You\\", and two from previous releases: \\"Moon River\\" from The Lakes of Canada (1999) and \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\" from Christ Is My Hope (2000). South Korean editions of the album, released by Pastel Music, contain two bonus tracks from Christ Is My Hope: \\"500 Miles\\" and \\"\\"Beautiful Savior\\". All four songs were remastered for this album. Critical reception Australian radio station Kinderling Kids Radio described the album as \\"delightful\\" and \\"full of sweet sounds to send you off to sleep.\\" AllMusic called the record \\"an absolutely beguiling collection of standards\\", describing it as \\"a benefit collection of cover songs that are all centered reverie akin to dreaming. Calling them all lullabies would be stretching a little bit, but the presentations are such that they might as well be.\\" They described \\"My Love Goes With You\\" as \\"perhaps the most beautiful and tender song on the outing\\", before summarizing that the album \\"could have been merely a curiosity piece, a curious addition to a mysterious catalog by a singular group. Instead, it is nothing less than a wondrous little gem.\\" Treble Zine rated it an 'Album of the Week' while also describing \\"My Love Goes With You\\" as \\"one of the best songs on the album\\", saying that it \\"fits in nicely with such great classic and traditional numbers. To be able to write a song that not only stands up to, but almost outshines these tracks is astounding.\\" They went on to praise the quality of the band's performance and production, saying \\"They may be covers, but as 'Hallelujah' is now more associated with Jeff Buckley than almost everyone but Leonard Cohen, so most of these songs should now be associated with Innocence Mission.\\" Track listing Notes * The album's liner notes originally credited \\"Once Upon a Summertime\\" as being written by \\"Barclay/LeGrand/Mercer\\". Eddy Marnay has subsequently been identified as the song's original French lyricist, with his work then being translated into English by Johnny Mercer. * \\"500 Miles\\" and \\"Beautiful Savior\\" are both listed as being 'Traditional'. This version of \\"500 Miles\\" has been credited as being written by Hedy West, with a 1961 copyright held by Atzal Music, Inc. \\"Beautiful Savior\\" is based on the traditional hymn \\"Fairest Lord Jesus\\", with various hymnals attributing the composition to either Richard Storrs Willis or Joseph Seiss.

Hinton was born in Norwood, and brought up in South Norwood London SE25 and attended nearby Ashburton School. He began his football career with Charlton Athletic F.C. having overlooked his local club Crystal Palace, making his debut in the Second Division in the 1957‚Äì58 season. While a Charlton player he won three caps for the England under-23 team. After scoring twice from 131 appearances in the Football League, Hinton was signed for Chelsea by Tommy Docherty in August 1963 for ¬£30,000. He made his Chelsea debut on 12 October 1963 in a 3‚Äì1 win at Ipswich Town. Hinton made his League debut as a full back but he later made a number of appearances at wing-half and inside-forward before earning a regular first-team place at centre-half in 1961 following an injury to Gordon Jago. When Hinton moved to Chelsea he reverted to full back. Playing as part of a richly-talented team including the likes of Charlie Cooke, Alan Hudson, Bobby Tambling, John Hollins, Peter Bonetti and Peter Osgood he was part of the successful Chelsea side of the 60s and early 70s, earning his first winners' medal with the League Cup in 1965. After the departure of John Mortimore and Frank Upton, Hinton formed a long lasting partnership with Ron Harris in central defence. An appearance in the 1967 FA Cup Final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur earned him a runners-up medal and further success was to follow with victory in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Chelsea defeated Leeds United, the reigning League Champions and one of the strongest teams of the era, in a replay at Old Trafford; Hinton came on as a substitute in both games. as the signing of John Dempsey and David Webb increased competition for first team places. Under coach (and later Manager) Dave Sexton, Hinton, Harris and Eddie McCreadie pioneered the zonal marking system of defense in the English First Division, consistently playing together throughout the Sixties. Though a member of Alf Ramsey's provisional 40-man squad for the 1966 World Cup, he never won a full cap. Hinton continued to play for Chelsea until 1976, although further success eluded the club after their 1971 Cup Winner's Cup victory, culminating in relegation to the Second Division a year before Hinton left Stamford Bridge. After his League career he had a spell with Barnet before retirement. In all, he made 344 appearances for Chelsea between 1963 and 1976, scoring 4 goals.

Clinical significance The lateral umbilical fold is an important reference site with regards to hernia classification. A direct hernia occurs medial to the lateral umbilical fold, whereas an indirect hernia originates lateral to the fold. This latter case is due to the placement of the opening of the deep inguinal ring in the space lateral to the lateral umbilical fold, which allows the passage of the ductus deferens, testicular artery, and other components of the spermatic cord in men, or the round ligament of the uterus in women.

He savagely assaults a young member of Ralphie's crew who he happens to see laughing. When Tony confronts him, he blames his anger, but says he loves his \\"Rubenesque\\" wife. On Tony's instructions, Ralphie phones Johnny to try to make peace; against his instructions, he apologizes, which Johnny takes as an admission of guilt. Johnny asks Carmine to allow a hit on Ralphie; he refuses. There are then two sit-downs. At the first, Ralphie is present; Johnny walks out, saying, \\"I cannot be in the same room as this man.\\" At the second, he is inflexible; Carmine says, \\"Get the fuck over it!\\" and Johnny walks out again. Carmine hints to Tony that Johnny can be killed. Silvio and Christopher arrange for it to be done in Boston, where Johnny is visiting his father. At the same time, Johnny arranges for Ralphie to be killed in Miami, where he is staying in a hotel. Johnny leaves home for Boston, but remembers something and goes back. He finds Ginny with a stash of junk food and candy. She cries. He reminds her that he never asked her to lose weight, but he is deeply hurt that she has lied to him. He calls off the hit at the last moment. He tells Tony he will accept Ralphie's apology. Meadow joins a law center representing underprivileged clients in the South Bronx. Tony is not pleased that she is drifting away from her plan to be a pediatrician. Carmela and Tony are arguing bitterly about money and financial planning.

It was Panahi's feature-film debut as director. The film received many strong critical reviews and won numerous awards in the international film fairs around the world including the Prix de la Camera d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. The Guardian has listed this film as one of the 50 best family films of all time. The film is on the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. The film was selected as the Iranian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Iran unsuccessfully tried to withdraw the film from contention but the Academy refused to accept the withdrawal. Plot It is the eve of the Iranian New Year. The film opens in a Teheran market where seven-year-old Razieh (Aida Mohammadkhani) and her mother are shopping. Razieh sees a goldfish in a shop and begins to nag her hurrying mother to buy it for the festivities instead of the skinny ones in her family's pond at home. Almost all of the film's major characters are briefly seen in this market scene, though they won't be introduced to the viewer until later. On their way home, mother and daughter pass a courtyard where a crowd of men has gathered to watch two snake charmers. Razieh wants to see what is happening but her mother pulls her daughter away, telling her that it is not good for her to watch these things. Back home, Razieh is upset about her mother's refusal to let her buy a new goldfish, but continues her campaign of nagging. Her older brother Ali (Mohsen Kalifi) returns from a shopping errand for their father who, although remains unseen has a tangible presence causing tension in the family. He complains that he asked Ali to buy shampoo, not soap, then throws the soap at him. Ali sets off to buy the shampoo and when he returns Razieh enlists his help in changing her mother's mind about the goldfish, bribing him with a balloon. Insisting that she can buy the goldfish in the market for 100 tomans (\\"You're crazy,\\" Ali tells her, remarking that he can see two films with that money), Razieh finally gets her wish. Her mother gives her the family's last 500-toman banknote and asks her to bring back the change. Razieh sets off with an empty glass jar to the fish shop a few blocks away. Between their home and the fish store, Razieh manages to lose the money twice, first in an encounter with the snake charmer, and then when she drops the money through the grate at the entrance to a store which has been closed for the New Year celebration. Razieh and Ali make several attempts to retrieve the money and receive assistance from many people, including the owners of nearby shops and an Iranian soldier. The money, however, is always just out of reach. Finally, the siblings receive help from a young Afghan street vendor selling balloons. He carries all of his balloons on a wooden stick, and has only one balloon, a white one, left. The group attaches a piece of gum to one end of the balloon stick, and with it, they reach down through the grate and pull the money out. The film ends, not with Ali and Razieh, but with the young Afghan boy, who has become an important character only at the very end of the film.

One of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves,‚ÄôBiogradska gora‚Äô National Park this area is one of the last three large virgin forests in Europe. The landscape is one of mountain ridges, glacial lakes, and temperate forest. Location Biogradska Gora is located in the mountainous region of Bjelasica in the central part of Montenegro between the rivers Tara and Lim, and is surrounded by three municipalities: Kola≈°in, Berane and Mojkovac. It is the most northeasterly of the five national parks in Montenegro. Biogradska Gora National Park Biogradsko lake Walking path around the lake The National Park is 54 km¬≤ in area. Basic elements of the Park are: untouched forest, large mountain slopes and tops over 2,000 meters high, six glacial lakes, five at an altitude of 1,820 meters and one easy accessible low land lake (≈†i≈°ko, Mali ≈†i≈°ko, Ursulovaƒçko, Pe≈°ica, and ≈†evarina) located at the very entrance to the park, Biogradsko Lake.Exploring Biogradska Gora National Park in Montenegro Swift streams cut through scenery of Biogradska Gora, green pastures and clear lakes reflecting centennial forests. The Park is renowned as a unique geomorphological region and, as such, it is attractive for scientific research. The seat of the park is in Kola≈°in. The national park abounds in cultural and historic heritage consisting of sacral monuments national building and archeological localities. Numerous authentic buildings of traditional architecture are found throughout the pastures and villages next to the virgin forest reserve on the Bjelasica mountain range. = Exploring the park = The park, between Mojkovac and Kolasin, is accessible by car via Highway E65 or by bus from Podgorica or Bijelo Polje. The park has developed infrastructure for tourists, including a visitors center, hiking trails, campsites, and a restaurant. Visitors have several options in addition to hiking, mountain biking, swimming, fishing and exploring some areas with their four-wheel drive vehicles. An open-air train takes tourists along a 3.5 km track from the entrance of the park to Lake Biograd where row boats and bicycles are available for rent. The visitor centre is nearby featuring traditional furniture from this region and a restaurant and lookout. Three other lookouts are available at higher elevations at various locations within the park: Crna Glava, Zekova Glava, and Bendovac. Used by shepherds as summer homes in the past, the wooden cottages or \\"katuns\\" along the trails can be rented for overnight stays for \\"traditional, rustic food and lifestyle\\", according to one source. Overnight camping is also allowed in the park.Visitor's Guide to Biogradska Gora National ParkBest Places to Stay Near Biogradska Gora National Park Ecology Educational boards along the trail Although it is the one of smallest of five national parks in Montenegro, Biogradska Gora National Park contains great diversity of flora and fauna. There are 26 different habitats of plants with 220 different plants, 150 species of birds, and 10 species of mammals live in this Park and in its forest, there are 86 species of trees and shrubs. In the waters of the park exist three species of trout and 350 species of insects. Rainfall is extremely high in the area, averaging up to 100 inches per year, and allows the growth of temperate rainforest. One of the unique features of the park is its virgin forest, Biogradska Gora (16 km¬≤) with trees over five hundred years old. In the very heart of virgin forest is Biogradsko Lake, the largest glacier lake in this National park. The most common tree species around the lake are European beech, sycamore maple and European ash, and on the slopes beech and silver fir. This National Park is recognized as an Important Plant Area, an Important Fungus Area and an Important Bird Area by UNESCO, which also provides the following additional specifics: ‚ÄôBiogradska gora‚Äô National Park Justification of Value > There is a great number of dynamic and complex eco-systems, high degree of > refugial features of habitats as well as a considerable number of endemic > and rare plant and animal species ...

History of the Park Biogradsko lake When Kola≈°in was liberated from Turkish rule in 1878, people from the Moraƒça and Rovca presented a part of the forest to King Nikola I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° of Montenegro. This forest was known as \\"Branik Kralja Nikole\\" and was protected.National Park Biogradska Gora Biogradska Gora was proclaimed a National Park in 1952. International protection (via UNESCO) was added in 1977 as part of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB). Open to visitors for a modest charge, it is popular in the summer for tourists seeking a cooler environment than the coast.‚ÄôBiogradska gora‚Äô National Park Statements of authenticity and/or integrity Historical events Nearby the National Park, a battle occurred with forces of the Ottoman Empire facing Montenegrins in the 1858 Battle of Kola≈°in. There were also important battles fought in the First Balkan War of 1912 and this region represented the center of activities of partisans in World War II. For years back, shepherds used rich pasture in this region for grazing sheep and cattle.

Almost 12 years later, after an appeal to the High Court of Australia, his conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered. However, the charges against him were dropped and Mallard was released. At the time, the Director of Public Prosecutions stated that Mallard remained the prime suspect and that if further evidence became available he could still be prosecuted. He was released from prison in 2006 after his conviction was quashed by the High Court, and paid $3.25 million compensation by the state government. In 2006 police conducted a review of the investigation and subsequently a cold case review. As a result, they uncovered sufficiently compelling evidence to charge convicted murderer Simon Rochford with the murder of Pamela Lawrence and to eliminate Mallard as a person of interest. After being publicly named as a suspect, Rochford was found dead in his cell at Albany Prison, having committed suicide. The Western Australian Commission on Crime and Corruption investigated whether there was misconduct by any public officer (police, prosecutors or members of parliament) associated with this case and made findings against two policemen and a senior prosecutor. Mallard died on 18 April 2019 in Los Angeles, the home area of his fianc√©e, at about 1:30am local time, after being hit by a car.  Early life  Andrew Mark Mallard was born in England on 16 August 1962 to parents Roy and Grace Mallard, who already had a 10-year-old daughter. The Mallards emigrated to Perth in 1967, and Andrew, unusually tall for his age, had trouble settling in to their new life, and was bullied throughout his school-life. Leaving school at 16, by 18 he was unemployed and often spent his time smoking marijuana and at nightclubs, and unsuccessfully attempted to join the army, before briefly trying to re- emigrate to the UK. His experiences affected him psychologically, and therapy helped him gain enough confidence to move out of home, but by May 1994 he was homeless and living temporarily at his \\"girlfriend's\\" flat in Mosman Park.  Lawrence murder and trial  Pamela Lawrence, a business proprietor on Glyde Street, Mosman Park, was attacked at her jewellery shop, called \\"Flora Mettalica\\", on the afternoon of 23 May 1994. A staff member had finished work at 3:00 pm, leaving Lawrence alone in the shop, and at 5:02 pm, the staff member's school-age daughter was passing by the shop and saw a stranger standing behind the counter, describing him as Caucasian, tall, with a bandanna and a ginger beard. At 6:15 pm Lawrence's husband, Peter, became worried when she had not returned home and tried unsuccessfully to call the shop, then drove to the premises and found her barely alive. Lawrence died of severe head wounds around 7:00 pm in the ambulance on the way to hospital. Mallard quickly became a suspect in the murder. He had been arrested the same day as the murder for a break-in and theft (of his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend's apartment), had been released around 4:00 pm, before arriving via taxi in Mosman Park around 5:00 pm. Despite his personal issues and being unable to clearly account for his movements, Mallard had no history of violence, and no murder weapon connecting him was found. Furthermore, no blood was found on Mallard, despite the severity of the attack, nor was his DNA or trace evidence found. The evidence used in Mallard's trial was therefore scanty and obscure, and it was later revealed that police manipulated or withheld vital information (including an undercover operation) from his defence team. He was convicted chiefly on two pieces of evidence. The first was a set of police notes of interviews with Mallard during which, the police claimed, he had confessed. These notes had not been signed by Mallard. The second was a video recording of the last twenty minutes of Mallard's eleven hours of interviews. The video shows Mallard speculating as to how the murderer might have killed Lawrence; police claimed that, although it was given in third-person, it was a confession. He was convicted on the confessions purportedly given during unrecorded interviews and the partial video-recording of an interview.  Investigation and appeals  Despite the issues in his conviction, Mallard's appeal to the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1996 was dismissed. In 1998, Mallard's family enlisted the help of investigative journalist Colleen Egan, who in turn managed to get John Quigley MLA and Malcolm McCusker QC involved. All were appalled at the manner in which Mallard's trial had been conducted and eventually came to be convinced that he was innocent. Based on fresh evidence uncovered by this team, including a raft of police reports that, against standard practice, had never been passed to the defence team, the case was returned to the Court of Criminal Appeal in June 2003. Despite the fresh evidence and an uncontested claim that the DPP had deliberately concealed evidence from the defence, the Court of Criminal Appeal again dismissed the appeal. In October 2004, Mallard's legal team was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia and on 6‚Äì7 September 2005, Mallard's appeal was heard in the High Court and the justices subsequently judged unanimously that his conviction be quashed and a retrial be ordered. During the hearing, Justice Michael Kirby was reported to have said that on one of the pieces of evidence alone‚Äîa forensic report, not disclosed to the defence, showing that Mallard's theory about the weapon used in the murder could not have been true‚Äîa retrial should have been ordered. The Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP) did not immediately drop charges against Mallard but did so six months later immediately before a directions hearing was due. After almost 12 years in prison, Mallard was released on 20 February 2006. However, in announcing that the trial would not proceed the DPP stated: > \\"Finally, I note for the record and for the future that this decision is > made on evidence presently available to the prosecution. The discharge of Mr > Andrew Mallard on this charge does not alter the fact that he remains the > prime suspect for this murder. Should any credible evidence present in the > future which again gives the state reasonable prospects of obtaining a > conviction again, the state would again prosecute him.\\"  Review of the case  Following the discontinuation of the prosecution by the DPP, the Commissioner of Police instituted a review of the investigation to establish whether there were sufficient grounds for a \\"cold case\\" review. The review quickly located a record of a palm print which matched that of Simon Rochford, who had confessed to murdering his girlfriend, Brigitta Dickens, on 15 July 1994, seven weeks after Mrs Lawrence was killed.Transcript of CCC Public Hearings,Opening Remarks 31 Jul 07 p15 lines 1‚Äì11 The print had been found on the top of a display case in Lawrence's shop, which was significant, as it had been the practice of the shop staff to wipe the top of that case after each customer left. Rochford's appearance, in particular his beard, was more consistent with the original accounts of eyewitnesses than was Mallard's. On this basis the review became a cold case review. The weapon used by Rochford to kill Dickens was a steel collar of the type used by weight lifters to secure weights to a bar. Rochford had attached the collar to a broom handle and used it to club Dickens to death. The actual collar could not be located in 2006 but its dimensions were known and a photograph was available. The shape and dimensions of the collar were consistent with the form of the wounds in Lawrence's skull. The photograph of the collar indicated that it was painted blue and a rucksack belonging to Rochford was found to contain blue paint flakes which were identical in chemical composition to those removed from Lawrence's wounds. Later, at about 7:45 am AWST on 19 May 2006, the body of Simon Rochford was discovered in his cell at Albany Maximum Security Prison by prison officers, just hours after he had been named as \\"a person of significant interest\\" in the Pamela Lawrence investigation. On 12 May 2006, five police officers were stood down by the West Australian Police Commissioner in relation to the original investigation into the murder. On 11 October 2006, the commissioner announced that the cold case review was complete, that Mallard was no longer a person of interest in relation to the case; that there was sufficient evidence to implicate Simon Rochford and that, if he had still been living, the police would have prepared a brief of evidence against him for the WA Director of Public Prosecutions. The police commissioner apologised to Mallard for any part the police had played in his conviction. The Premier of Western Australia indicated that the government would be considering compensation, though the state's attorney general stated that no decision could be made until the Commission on Crime and Corruption had completed its investigation. However, on 22 November 2006, the Adelaide Advertiser carried an AAP story stating that Mallard had received a AUD$200,000 ex gratia payment as partial compensation.  Commission on Crime and Corruption hearings  The Commission on Crime and Corruption (CCC) announced that it was studying the report of the cold case review and would be holding public hearings in 2007. In the meantime it had asked the police to not release the full report, either to the public or within the police service, and in particular, to ensure that police involved in the original investigation had no access to it. The CCC hearings into whether police and/or prosecutors behaved unethically or illegally in the Mallard case began on 31 July 2007. On 7 October 2008 the CCC announced its recommendations that disciplinary action be taken against two assistant police commissioners and the deputy director of public prosecution. The two police officers subsequently resigned, thereby removing any chance of disciplinary proceedings going ahead. In May 2009, Mallard was offered a payment of $3.25 million as settlement, though the premier of the state, Colin Barnett, said that were Mallard to take civil action against those he held responsible for his wrongful conviction, the government would support any servant of the state in that event.  Media  A documentary titled Saving Andrew Mallard was directed by Michael Muntz and produced by Artemis International, focusing on Mallard's family, its struggle to have him freed, the deception undertaken by the original police investigation team and the evidence uncovered that eventually led to Mallard's freedom. It was first aired on ABC Television on 4 May 2006. It was short-listed for a Walkley Award, and Muntz won the Outstanding Achievement in Directing Award in the WA Screen Awards. The documentary's epilogue noted that the DPP still considered Mallard a prime suspect in its investigation at that time. A book about the case, Murderer No More: Andrew Mallard and the Epic Fight that Proved his Innocence, was written by Colleen Egan, the journalist who campaigned on Mallard's behalf for eight years, was published by Allen & Unwin in June 2010.\\"Murderer No More: Andrew Mallard and the Epic Fight that Proved his Innocence\\" by Colleen Egan, published by Allen & Unwin in June 2010. A Casefile True Crime Podcast detailing the case was released on 29 May 2016.  Later life and death  Having completed a university degree in fine art, Mallard moved to London in 2010 to further his studies. He was engaged to be married, and frequently travelled to Los Angeles where his fianc√©e lived. In the early hours of 18 April 2019, he was fatally struck by a car while crossing the road in Hollywood.

It is also referred to as the Y-ligament (see below). the ligament of Bigelow, the ligament of Bertin and any combinations of these names. With a force strength exceeding 350 kg (772 lbs), the iliofemoral ligament is not only stronger than the two other ligaments of the hip joint, the ischiofemoral and the pubofemoral, but also the strongest ligament in the human body and as such is an important constraint to the hip joint. Structure Arising from the anterior inferior iliac spine and the rim of the acetabulum, the iliofemoral ligament spreads obliquely downwards and laterally to the intertrochanteric line on the anterior side of the femoral head. It is divided into two parts or bands which act differently: the transverse part above, is strong and runs parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. The descending part below, is weaker and runs parallel to the femoral shaft. As the lateral portion is twisted like a screw, the two parts together take the form of an inverted Y. It is intimately connected with the joint capsule, and serves to strengthen the joint by resisting hyperextension. Its upper band is sometimes named the iliotrochanteric ligament. Between the two bands is a thinner part of the capsule. In some cases there is no division, and the ligament spreads out into a flat triangular band which is attached to the whole length of the intertrochanteric line. Function In a standing posture, when the pelvis is tilted posteriorly, the ligament is twisted and tense, which prevents the trunk from falling backwards and the posture is maintained without the need for muscular activity. In this position the ligament also keeps the femoral head pressed into the acetabulum. As the hip flexes, the tension in the ligament is reduced and the amount of possible rotations in the hip joint is increased, which permits the pelvis to tilt backwards into its sitting angle. Lateral rotation and adduction in the hip joint is controlled by the strong transversal part, while the descending part limits medial rotation. Turnout used in the classical ballet style requires a great deal of flexibility in this ligament. As does the front split where the rear leg is hyper-extended at the hip. Many externally rotate the rear leg while doing a front split, this external rotation when the hip is not flexed stretches the ligament even more. This \\"martial arts split\\" is distinguished by the rear knee pointing outward sideways (usually the foot along with it) rather than pointing straight down with the patella facing the floor, in a pure extension front split. Additional images File:Gray341.pngLeft hip-joint, opened by removing the floor of the acetabulum from within the pelvis. File:Gray436.pngThe Obturator externus.

Primarily playing as a midfielder or small forward, he represented both the Kangaroos and Melbourne in the Australian Football League. He currently plays for the Robinvale Football Club in Robinvale. Early career Shannon started his playing career with the Northern Territory Football League's Wanderers, a club with which the Motlop family have many associations. As a teenager, he moved to the North Adelaide Roosters in the South Australian National Football League as a teenager, from where he was selected by North Melbourne as the 85th pick in the 1998 National Draft. Kangaroos Motlop represented the Kangaroos in seven matches during his debut season, including the victorious 1999 Grand Final against Carlton. He then became a regular selection for the next two years, during which time he was joined at the club by his brother Daniel. But poor form saw him fall out of favour, making only 12 appearances from the start of 2002 until his eventual delisting at the end of the following season. Having not been picked up by another AFL club and facing the prospect of an end to his time playing at the highest level of the sport, Motlop rejoined the Roosters for 2004. Melbourne Football Club He was given a second chance at the start of the following year, when Melbourne recruited him as a replacement for Troy Broadbridge, who had died during the Boxing Day tsunami. But despite being a stalwart for the club's aligned Victorian Football League side, Sandringham Zebras, during their successful 2005 and 2006 premiership campaigns, Motlop failed to break into the first team, playing just ten times before being delisted once more at the end of his second season and returning to North Adelaide for a third spell.  Dunolly Football Club  It was revealed that for the 2009 season, Motlop would play for the Dunolly Football Club in country Victoria. He played a handful of games for Dunolly in 2009. He scored a goal with his first touch of the footy at Princess Park, playing against Avoca. He played alongside former A.F.L. player Robbie Ahmat.

While many online educational programs started out as and with the advent of web conferencing tools, people can learn at the same time in different places as well. For example, use of instant messaging or live chat, webinars and video conferencing allow for students and teachers to collaborate and learn in real time. Practical applications A lecture is an example of synchronous learning in a face-to- face environment, because learners and teachers are all in the same place at the same time. Another example of a synchronous learning event would involve students watching a live web stream of a class, while simultaneously taking part in a discussion. Synchronous learning can be facilitated by having students and instructors participate in a class via a web conferencing tool. These synchronous experiences can be designed to develop and strengthen instructor-student and student-student relationships, which can be a challenge in distance learning programs.Orr, P. (2010). Distance supervision: Research, findings, and considerations for art therapy. The Arts in Psychotherapy, 37, 106-111. History Synchronous communication in distance education began long before the advent of the use of computers in synchronous learning. After the very early days of distance education, when students and instructors communicated asynchronously via the post office, synchronous forms of communication in distance education emerged with broadcast radio and television.Bernard, R.

With the government of Robert Mugabe keeping a tight rein on the airwaves, the station produced and presented news and current affairs programmes for broadcast in Zimbabwe on short wave and on the Internet. Much of the content comprised pre-recorded but unedited, international telephone conversations between the presenter and ordinary people on the ground in Zimbabwe. These untrained and unprompted members of the public gave their first-person report of happenings, often as they were going down. It was the fact that such reports were broadcast in an unedited form that gave the content huge legitimacy among the listeners. The news broadcasts were therefore considered more factual than those of the state broadcaster. Staffed and run by Zimbabweans in exile, it aimed to promote democracy and free speech, and to counter the mis-information and hate speech broadcast by the Zimbabwe state media. The station's website, www.swradioafrica.com, featured live online streaming. Broadcasts were typically for just 2 or 3 hours each evening. Technical details The two studios of the station were housed in an office building in Borehamwood, where the journalist staff compiled telephone recordings during the day. These recordings were then inserted into the live programme broadcast each evening. The signal was sent from the studio via ISDN lines, then transmitted via satellite to a location in South Africa, and re-broadcast on Shortwave into Zimbabwe. During sensitive times of elections etc, the Zimbabwe government tried to block the signal by jamming with its own shortwave facilities. At such times SW Radio Africa would broadcast on two frequencies simultaneously as the Government could only jam one frequency at a time. An independent organisation monitored the reception for quality inside Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Government considered the station to be pirates and did its best to have its reception driven underground. In popular culture In The Last Resort: A Memoir of Zimbabwe (Chapter 4), journalist Douglas Rogers says of two of his parents' employees: \\"It was only later that I learned the two Johns were fervent MDC supporters and had been for years. It was one of the reasons my father kept them both on. He enjoyed speaking to them about politics, and it was why he had given them his old shortwave radio: so that they could tune into SW Africa, the pro-democracy station that broadcast out of London.\\" References Shed Studios External links *SW Radio Africa *Kenya Radio Stations online Radio stations in Zimbabwe 2001 establishments in the United Kingdom Radio stations established in 2001 2014 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Radio stations disestablished in 2014 ","title":"SW Radio Africa"},{"id":"5012871","text":"Florian√≥polis-Herc√≠lio Luz International Airport , branded Floripa Airport, is the airport serving Florian√≥polis, Brazil.

Some of its facilities are shared with the Florian√≥polis Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force. History The airport was built on the site of an old Air Naval Base, which operated until 1941, when its jurisdiction changed to the Brazilian Air Force. Between 1927 and 1932, the then known as Campeche Field was also used by the French aviators of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale A√©ropostale for its operations in Florian√≥polis. Among them were Jean Mermoz, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and Henri Guillaumet. Between 1942 and 1945 the runway 03/21, apron, control tower and passenger terminal were built. At the same time, some facilities of the Florian√≥polis Air Force Base were built and made operational. In the period between 1952 and 1954 the passenger terminal was rebuilt and was operational until 1976 when a brand-new terminal building and apron were opened. The old facility is today the cargo terminal. The new terminal was further enlarged in 1988 and 2000, reaching the present 8,703 m¬≤. In 1978 the runway 14/32 was opened allowing a great increase in traffic. In 1995 the airport was upgraded to international category and started receiving particularly seasonal and charter flights from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

It is triangular in shape and somewhat flattened. The ligament is implanted by its apex into the antero-superior part of the fovea capitis femoris and its base is attached by two bands, one into either side of the acetabular notch, and between these bony attachments it blends with the transverse ligament.Gray's Anatomy (1918), see infobox It is ensheathed by the synovial membrane, and varies greatly in strength in different subjects; occasionally only the synovial fold exists, and in rare cases even this is absent. The ligament of the head of the femur contains within it the acetabular branch of the obturator artery. Function The ligament is made tense when the thigh is semiflexed and the limb then abducted or rotated outward; it is, on the other hand, relaxed when the limb is adducted. Research suggests it contributes little influence as a ligament past childhood, although it may still be important in transmitting arterial supply to the femoral head. In humans, it has been suggested that it is not the ligamentum teres but the hip capsule (specifically the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments) that provides the primary resistance to dislocation in the extended hip. However, recent research has suggested the ligamentum teres of the femur may have a number of functions, including a significant biomechanical role on the basis of cadaveric studies where increases of range of motion were seen after sectioning of the ligament. Other animals It has been suggested that some animals, such as the orangutan and Indian elephant, lack a ligamentum teres.Femur article, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. However, the presence of a ligamentum teres, albeit with a morphology different from the human version, has been found upon dissection in both these animals. In the orangutan, it is believed to play a significant role in preventing dislocation of the femoral head within extreme ranges of motion. In the Indian elephant, it is the primary support of the hip joint when the hind limbs are abducted.

Loituma Girl (also known as \\"Leekspin\\") is a Flash animation set to a scat singing section of the traditional Finnish folk song \\"Ievan Polkka,\\" sung by the Finnish quartet Loituma on their 1995 debut album Things of Beauty. It appeared on the Internet in late April 2006 and quickly became popular. The animation consists of four frames showing the Bleach anime character Orihime Inoue twirling a Welsh onion or leek, set to a 27-second loop from the song. Content The animation of Loituma Girl is taken from episode two of the Bleach anime series, between the twelfth and fourteenth minute (depending on the version). In the clip, Orihime is twirling a leek while talking to Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki. The scene is an instance of a recurring joke surrounding her character, in which she wants to cook something so unusual that it seems almost inedible. The music used consists of the second half of the fifth stanza (four lines) and the complete sixth stanza (eight lines) from \\"Ievan Polkka\\". Unlike the rest of the song, these two stanzas have no meaning, consisting mostly of phonetically-inspired Finnish words that vary from performance to performance and are usually made up on the spot by the singer (compare scat singing in jazz). These stanzas are therefore not generally listed on lyrics pages, causing confusion for people looking for lyrics that match the animation. There has been some uncertainty about the exact nature of the vegetable in the animation. In the Japanese version of the anime, it is identified as a Welsh onion, but the American dub identifies it as a leek, from which the name of the animation is derived. As with many confusions about vegetables, this debate can be resolved by comparing both scientific and common names. Welsh Onion is a common name for Allium fistulosum, which is a staple in Japanese cuisine referred to in Japanese as . \\"Large varieties of the Welsh onion resemble the leek, such as the Japanese negi, whilst smaller varieties resemble chives.\\" Popularity On 10 July 2006, the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported that Loituma Girl had caused a resurgence in Loituma's popularity, and the band had received thousands of fan letters from around the world. Band member Timo V√§√§n√§nen describes his initial reaction to the video: The author of the meme is reported as Russian blogger \\"g_r_e_e_n\\", having uploaded the animation on 23 April 2006 at 15:40 and posted it in Russian LiveJournal. The song clip soon enjoyed overwhelming popularity in Russia as a ringtone, with most of the young urban population aware of the \\"Yak zup zop\\" lyrics.Russian meme and cultural phenomena wiki Lurkmore - Yak Zup Zop article PRI's The World radio program covered the animation in a segment, in which they noted the clip's trance-inducing qualities. Patrick Macias, who was interviewed in the program, described the animation: As with most Internet memes, numerous videos, remixes, and parodies have been inspired by the Flash animation. These may feature the animated background, the song clip, or otherwise reference the style of the animation. In December 2010, Operation Leakspin played off the \\"Leekspin\\" meme during efforts to raise awareness of potentially important documents leaked by WikiLeaks. Commercialization In August 2006, German ringtone provider Jamba! began selling a collection of media based on the animation. The video shows an anthropomorphic donkey (called Holly Dolly) dancing to the animation which is displayed (flipped horizontally) in the background. The animation is marketed as the \\"Dolly Song\\", and the music is played faster than the original Loituma version. It was also given an extra 30-second drum preface. In January 2007, a similar video entitled \\"Holly Dolly ‚Äì Dolly Song (Ieva's Polka)\\" appeared in the Google Video Top 100, though it had already been present on the Internet for some time. It features the same donkey, along with some dancing sheep and a snowman, but the leek-spinning girl in the background is only there briefly.Holly Dolly ‚Äì Dolly Song (Ieva's Polka). Google Video. In April 2007, a Dutch power company (Eneco) used the melody of Loituma Ievan Polka in its TV commercial for \\"ecostroom\\" (green energy). The Dutch company Artiq Mobile launched a website where people can upload homemade Loituma Girl spoof videos. TV commercials state the best video will win 500 euros. The Romanian company Romtelecom uses the song in one of their commercials for Dolce, a satellite television service.

Acadiana High School opened in 1969 following the consolidation of Judice High School, located in Judice Community, and Scott High School, located in Scott. Donald Aguillard, a former assistant principal at Acadiana High, was among those parties who challenged the Louisiana Balanced Treatment Act regarding evolution and creation science, a measure authored by then State Senator Bill P. Keith of Shreveport, and signed into law by Governor David C. Treen. The law was invalidated by the United States Supreme Court in 1987 in the case named for Aguillard, Edwards v. Aguillard. As an original plaintiff, Aguillard became the defendant on appeal. Sports The first state championship was won by the 1976 Girls volleyball team. Kay Keller was voted most valuable player. The volleyball team won the district championship 3 years in a row and had an overall record of 111 wins and 17 losses. Coach was Donna Mancuso. In the 1996‚Äì1997 soccer season, Acadiana High won the Class 5A State Championship game beating Jesuit. They carried the title over for the 1998 season by beating their hometown rival Lafayette High in the finals, reigning for two consecutive years as State Champs. They returned to the State Finals for a third consecutive year in 1999 but lost to Jesuit 3‚Äì0. Bill Dotson Stadium, home of Acadiana's Wreckin' Rams. =Football= The Wreckin' Rams are well known for the offense they run. The vaunted \\"Veer Machine.\\" This formation has been run at Acadiana since Coach Bill Dotson installed the offense circa 1974. Acadiana has 4 appearances in the state semi-finals 1977, 2001, 2002, and 2017. December 2005 saw Acadiana make their first appearance in the State Football Championship Game. The game was played in Shreveport's Independence Stadium. This due to the damage done to the Superdome by Hurricane Katrina. The Rams lost 28‚Äì7 to the West Monroe High School Rebels. In December 2006, the Acadiana High football team won the Class 5A State Championship. The match up between the Acadiana High Wreckin' Rams and the Sulphur High Tornadoes was held at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA. The final score was 13‚Äì10. Kicker Drew Alleman completed a 32-yard field goal with four seconds left in the final quarter. Kip Jacob was named Most Valuable Player. In 2007, AHS made it to the State Championship once again, but were beaten by Jordan Jefferson and the undefeated Destrehan Fighting Wildcats. 2008 and 2009 saw the Wreckin' Rams make the quarter finals. Both games ended in defeat for the Rams: 10‚Äì7 to the Central Wildcats in 2008 and 35‚Äì28 to the Bears of Catholic High in 2009. The Rams spoiled a 28‚Äì14 halftime lead. In 2010 Acadiana ripped off four wins by double digits. After a setback to St. Thomas More, the Rams won the next two games by a combine score of 110 to 28 including a 75‚Äì14 thrashing of Sulphur who they barely beat in 2006 for the State Championship. The following week, the Rams were informed by the LHSAA that they must forfeit four of their wins for using an ineligible player, including the 41‚Äì14 win over Northside, the 49‚Äì6 win over McDonogh 35, the 51‚Äì6 win over LaGrange, and the 75‚Äì14 win over Sulphur dropping their record to 3‚Äì5. Needing to win out to make the playoffs, the Rams won their last two games 63‚Äì0 and 56‚Äì33. With a 5‚Äì5 record, the Rams made the playoffs as the number 27 team. Throughout the playoffs, the Rams scored 177 points and only gave up 33. The semi-final game was a rematch with St. Thomas More who was the only team to beat the Rams on the field. Acadiana shut out STM 31‚Äì0 securing their fourth state final appearance in six years. Ironically, the game became a rematch of the 2005 final against the West Monroe Rebels. This time Acadiana stopped the Rebels and secured a second State Championship in a thrilling 21‚Äì14 win. On December 14, 2013 Acadiana Rams won its third 5A championship in record setting style over the previously undefeated Parkway Panthers 77 to 41. The Rams broke a Class 5A State Title record for most rushing yards in a game (634 rushing yards), most rushing touchdowns by and individual rusher De‚ÄòEdward Cormier (4), and most points scored in a game (77) by any team that has ever played football in the Louisiana Superdome (High School, College or Pro). Acadiana High has a long- standing rivalry with neighboring Lafayette High School. The rivalry is not only athletically based, but extends also to other extracurricular activities, including academic and speech tournaments. Acadiana defended their state championship in 2014, winning the 5A State Championship by defeating Destrehan High School 23-7 for their fourth 5A title in nine years. Acadiana, which was seeded #15, defeated St. Amant 37-0, Ponchatoula 38-28, Mandeville 28-14 and Zachary 9-3 in the semi-finals.

It was a strong attack on slavery as inefficient and a barrier to the economic advancement of whites. The book was widely distributed by Horace Greeley and other antislavery leaders, and infuriated Southerners. The book condemned slavery, but did not take what Helper considered to be the ineffectually sentimental or moralistic abolitionist approach (as seen in Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852): Hinton explicitly wrote \\"not with reference, except in a very slight degree, to its humanitarian or religious aspects.\\"Helper 1857, \\"Preface\\". Instead, Helper crafted an analysis that appealed to whites' rational self- interest, rather than any altruism towards blacks. Helper claimed that slavery hurt the Southern economy by preventing economic development and industrialization, and that it was the main reason why the South had progressed so much less than the North (according to the results of the 1850 census and other verifiable factual measures) since the late 18th century. Helper tried to speak on behalf of the majority of Southern whites, poor or of moderate means‚Äî the Plain Folk of the Old South‚Äîwhom he claimed were oppressed by a small aristocracy of wealthy slave-owners. Helper's tone was aggressive: \\"Freesoilers and abolitionists are the only true friends of the South; slaveholders and slave-breeders are downright enemies of their own section. Anti-slavery men are working for the Union and for the good of the whole world; proslavery men are working for the disunion of the States, and for the good of nothing except themselves.\\"p. 363 Political impact The Compendium version appeared in July 1859; it was an abridgement that kept the statistics but watered down some of the confrontational rhetoric, for use in Republican Party campaigning. This version met with fierce opposition in the South and many places banned it. Possession of a copy was treated as criminal offense in most of the South. Distributors of the book were arrested, and three men in Arkansas were hanged for possession of it. It widened the gulf between North and South, especially through the protracted December 1859 - January 1860 political struggle about electing John Sherman to the speakership of the House. Historians agree it helped sharpen sectional political differences in the years immediately preceding the American Civil War. In rebuttal, Louis F.

MHS has a set of Advanced Placement courses that allow students to begin their college education while still receiving high school credit. Below is a list of the Advanced Placement, and most notable courses. Levels :Advanced Placement ‚Äì Offers students the ability to earn college credit. These courses are more difficult and require more dedication than the average high school course. Advanced Placement (AP) courses culminate with an exam administered by the College Board which determines how much credit the student receives. :Honors ‚Äì These courses contain challenging material designed for the motivated student. They are more difficult that the standard College Preparatory classes. :College preparatory ‚Äì These courses prepare students for traditional college level education. :Comprehensive ‚Äì These courses are designed to prepare students for junior (two-year) college or work after high school. Advanced Placement Mansfield High School offers Advanced Placement courses in Music Theory, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Calculus AB, Computer Science Principles, Statistics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics C, American History, European History, Spanish Language and Composition, French Language and Composition, and Art History. However each student can take at most seven Advanced Placement courses during their stay at MHS. Grading Students at Mansfield High School are graded on a 0-100 scale, where an A is 90-100, a B is 80-89, a C is 70-79, a D is 65-69, and anything below a 65 is considered failing. Students are awarded credit for each successful passing of a course, however if a student is absent from the course too many times, credits may be deducted. Class rank Class rank is determined by calculating a student‚Äôs course-weighed grade point average over an extended 4.0 scale. Rank is calculated once a year, with the rank calculated after a students sixth semester (junior year) being reported to colleges. Valedictorian and Salutatorian are determined by calculating class rank after the completion of a seventh semester. Rank is calculated by first converting a final grade to the 4.0 scale, then weighting it depending on what level each course taken is at. That average is then multiplied by the number of credits a student earned and then divided by the total number of possible credits for the course. This result is the student's weighted GPA. This process is repeated for each class and then the sum of all class GPAs are averaged to result in an overall GPA. It is possible to get over a 4.0 GPA once weighting of the student's final grade has occurred. =Performing arts= Below are the three areas in which Mansfield High School specializes for students to enroll in the Performing Arts. :Choir - The choir puts on several concerts per year, including the Holiday Concert and Spring Concert, and also directs and produces the school's fall play and spring musical.

Successors of Ghauri  Ghauri had no offspring, but he treated thousands of his Turkic slaves as his sons, who were trained both as soldiers and administrators and provided with the best possible education. Many of his hardworking and intelligent slaves rose to positions of importance in Ghauri's army and government. When a courtier lamented that the Sultan had no male heirs, Ghauri retorted: > \\"Other monarchs may have one son, or two sons; I have thousands of sons, my > Turkic slaves who will be the heirs of my dominions, and who, after me, will > take care to preserve my name in the Khu·π≠bah (Friday sermon) throughout > these territories.\\" Ghauri's prediction proved true. After his assassination, his Empire was divided amongst his slaves. Most notably: * Qutb-ud-din Aibak became ruler of Delhi in 1206, establishing the Sultanate of Delhi, which marked the start of the Slave dynasty of India * Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha became ruler of Multan * Taj-ud-Din Yildoz became ruler of Ghazni * Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji became ruler of Bengal  Slave Dynasty In 1210 Nasir-ud- Din Qabacha declared himself independent. He twice repulsed the attacks of Tajuddin Elduz of Ghazni, but could not defeat Shams-ud-Din Iltutmish and drowned in the Indus River while trying to escape. In 1214 Muhammad II of Khwarezm drove Tajuddin Elduz from Ghazni, and took him to Lahore, and gave the authority to Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha. Iltutmish protested against this act of aggression, and when the protest was disregarded marched towards Lahore. Tajuddin Elduz accepted the challenge and on 25 January 1216, the armies met on the already famous field of Taraori. Tajuddin Elduz was defeated and taken, and after being led through the streets of Delhi was sent to Budaun, where he was put to death in the same year. After the overthrow of Tajuddin Elduz, Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha again occupied Lahore. Iltutmish faced a number of challenges to his rule. In the aftermath of Aibak's death, the Ghurids dominions in India had divided into four. Iltutmish controlled Delhi. At that time Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha was the Governor of Uch and Multan asserted his independence. Ali Mardan, a Khalji noble, who had been appointed Governor of Lakhnauti by Aibak in 1206, had thrown off his allegiance to Delhi after his death and styled himself Sultan Ala-ud-din. His successor, Ghiyas ud din Balban, conquered Bihar. Lahore was contested by Iltutmish, Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha and Tajuddin Elduz, Muhammad of Ghor adopted son and successor in Ghazni. Elduz attempted to bring Delhi under his control. Initially, Iltutmish acknowledged Elduz's suzerainty by accepting the symbolic presents of the chatr and durbash. The Hindu princes and chiefs were discontented at their loss of independence and had recovered Kannauj, Benaras, Gwalior, and Kalinjar had been lost during Aibak's reign while Ranthambore had been reconquered by the Chauhans during Aram Shah's rule. In 1217, Iltutmish moved towards Nasir- ud-Din Qabacha at the head of a large army. Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha attempted to retreat from Lahore towards Multan but was defeated at Mansura. Iltutmish refrained from attacking Sindh due to the presence of Mongols on his north- west frontier. Iltutmish was preoccupied with the Mongol threat and did not threaten Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha until 1227.  Personal life  He was married to the sister of Aibak in 1205.http://www.third-millennium- library.com/readinghall/UniversalHistory/INDIA/Cambridge/III/III- SLAVEKINGSOFDELHI.html =Origin= He was originally a Kipchak, an ancient Turkic people that have since been absorbed into modern Kazakh people, moved during the Islamic Golden Age were Muslims were moving towards the East to expand in Asia. The Khwarezmid Empire was established by Turkmen and Kipchaks Turks who had converted to Islam due to Persian and Arab missionary missions from the 7th century onwards. = Death= As Iltutmish approached Uch his lieutenant, Nasiruddin Aiyitim, advanced from Lahore and besieged Multan, Qabacha took to his boats and fled to the island-fortress of Bhakkar, in the Indus River, leaving his minister to follow him with the treasure stored at Uch. On 9 February 1228, Iltutmish arrived at Uch and opened the siege, at the same time dispatching a force under his minister, Kamaluddin Muhammad Junaidi, entitled Nizam al-Mulk, in pursuit of Qabacha, who in his despair sent Alauddin Bahram Shah, his son by Aibak's daughter, to make terms. Bahram was successful, and in accordance with the treaty Uch was surrendered in 4 May, but Junaidi was either not informed of the treaty or wilfully disregarded it, for he continued to besiege Bhakkar, and Qabacha drowned in the Indus River. The circumstances of his death are variously related; some writers say that he was accidentally drowned in attempting to escape, and others that he committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. His death ended the campaign, and his troops transferred their services to Iltutmish, who returned to Delhi in August, leaving Junaidi to complete the conquest of lower Sindh.

Res. 167, 74th Congress. Other peace resolutions included H.J. Res. 89 and H.J. Res. 158, 74th Congress.Page 74 Representative Louis Ludlow (D-Indiana) introduced the amendment several times between 1935 and 1940. Supporters argued that ordinary people, who were called upon to fight and die during wartime, should have a direct vote on their country's involvement in military conflicts. Page 26 Page 151 Background =History of concept= The idea of a national referendum on any declaration of war was first suggested in 1914, and was supported by such notable politicians as three-time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and United States Senators Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and Thomas P. Gore. Page 208Kauffman, Bill (2006-11-20) The Populist Patriotism of Gore Vidal, The American Conservative In the 1924 election campaign, both the Democratic and Progressive party platforms endorsed the idea of a popular vote on war, \\"except in case of actual attack\\" (Democrats) or \\"except in case of actual invasion\\" (Progressives). Page 97-98 =Public support and opposition= Public support for the amendment was very robust through the 1930s, a period when isolationism was the prevailing mood in the United States, but began to erode as the situation in Europe deteriorated at the end of the decade. A Gallup survey in September 1935 showed that 75% of Americans supported the amendment; the approval rate was 71% in 1936, and 73% in 1937. In January 1938, when it was voted on in Congress, 68% of the US population still supported the amendment. But by March 1939, support had dropped to 61%; and six months later, following the German invasion of Poland, support for the amendment dropped to 51%. In addition, Good Housekeeping magazine, the National Council for Prevention of War, and Roger Nash Baldwin, president of the ACLU, endorsed the amendment. Page 17-18Page 236 Others also opposed the amendment. Michigan Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, who was normally an isolationist, argued that the amendment \\"would be as sensible to require a town meeting before permitting the fire department to face a blaze\\". Author Walter Lippmann argued that the amendment would make \\"preventive diplomacy\\" impossible and would ensure \\"that finally, when the provocation has become intolerable, there would be no remedy except total war fought when we were at the greatest possible disadvantage.\\" Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr opposed the amendment stating that war was a policy area where pure democracy was most pernicious. Panay incident and 1938 congressional vote Congressional debate on the amendment was prompted by the December 12, 1937 bombing of the USS Panay by Japanese warplanes. The Panay, a gunboat, was anchored in the Yangtze River near Nanjing, China and flying the American flag. President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with his cabinet and the military high command the possibility of economic or military retaliation against Japan. Roosevelt drew back, however, when he realized that there was no public outcry for retaliation, and that, in fact, peace sentiment in the country had actually strengthened. \\"We should learn that it is about time for us to mind our own business,\\" Texas Democrat Maury Maverick declared in the House of Representatives. Two days after the Panay was sunk, Congress took up the Ludlow amendment.Page 90 Page 402 The Roosevelt administration attempted to keep the bill in the House Judiciary Committee, where it had been buried since Ludlow introduced the amendment in 1935; but at the end of 1937 the amendment got enough congressional support, including the signatures of nearly half the Democrats in the House, for a House vote on a discharge petition designed to permit debate on the proposed amendment.Page 457 The amendment came closest to overcoming a discharge petition on January 10, 1938, when it was defeated in Congress by a vote of 209 to 188. The difference in votes may have been provided by Postmaster General James Farley, who Roosevelt asked to sway the votes of the Irish Congressmen who were isolationists. Despite Roosevelt's fears, this vote was far short of the two-thirds vote required by both houses of Congress (290 in the House) for later passage of a constitutional amendment. Before the discharge petition vote, speaker of the House William B. Bankhead read a letter written by President Roosevelt: Subsequent proposals In his 1993 book War and Responsibility: Constitutional Lessons of Vietnam and its Aftermath, noted constitutional scholar John Hart Ely made a proposal that \\"[brought] back memories\\" of the Ludlow Amendment,Robert F. Turner, War and the Forgotten Executive Power Clause of the Constitution: A Review Essay of John Hart Ely's War and Responsibility, 34 Virginia Journal of International Law 903, 967 (1994) writing that, when initiating military action, \\"even notice to the entire Congress is insufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement: We the people are part of the process too.\\"Ely, John Hart, War and Responsibility: Constitutional Lessons of Vietnam and its Aftermath p. 87 (1993) Text of proposed amendment :SEC. 1. Except in the event of an invasion of the United States or its Territorial possessions and attack upon its citizens residing therein, the authority of Congress to declare war shall not become effective until confirmed by a majority of all votes cast thereon in a nationwide referendum. Congress, when it deems a national crisis to exist, may by concurrent resolution refer the question of war or peace to the citizens of the States, the question to be voted on being, Shall the United States declare war on ? Congress may otherwise by law provide for the enforcement of this section. :SEC. 2. Whenever war is declared the President shall immediately conscript and take for use by the Government all the public and private war properties, yards, factories, and supplies, together with employees necessary for their operation, fixing the compensation for private properties temporarily employed for the war period at a rate not in excess of 4 percent based on tax values assessed in the year preceding the war.

Sun was the last surviving member of the first graduating class of the Whampoa Military Academy, as well as the last surviving army-level commander of the Second Sino-Japanese War. His career spanned the January 28 Incident, Second Sino- Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.Taipei Times \\"Nationalist general Sun Yuan-liang dies at 103\\" June 12 2006 His son Chin Han is a famous actor. Early life and career Sun was born in Chengdu, Sichuan in 1904. From 1922 to 1924, he studied in the University of Nanjing. He transferred to University of Beijing later. His uncle, Sun Zhen, helped him to secure an appointment in the newly formed Whampoa Military Academy. He performed well in the Northern Expedition and Chiang Kai-shek sent him to study in Japan. Sun attended the Imperial Military Academy in Japan and returned home in 1928. He was appointed as the first commander of the elite German trained 88th Division. In 1934, Sun and Tang Enbo succeed in surrounding the Jiangxi Soviet area and cut off communists retreat route to the south and he was promoted to lieutenant general. Second Sino-Japanese War In the 1932 Japanese invasion of Shanghai, Sun led his division to defeat the Japanese at Miaohang (ÂªüË°åÈéÆ), in what the media billed as the first Chinese military victory over Japan. When full-scale war broke out between China and Japan in 1937, Sun led his 88th Division in the Battle of Shanghai. He personally gave the order to regimental commander Xie Jinyuan to hold onto the Sihang Warehouse at the conclusion of the three-month battle. During the Battle of Nanking in December 1937, he and his troops were surrounded by nearly a quarter million Japanese troops. Sun's superior, Tang Shengzhi, fled the city without giving his commanders any clear instructions on a possible breakout. Sun was forced to abandon his post during the ensuing chaos and escape from Nanking. Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly suspended him for two month and Sun did not receive another command until 1939. In 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army under Hata Shunroku launched Operation Ichigo, the largest military offensive against the nationalist government since the Battle of Wuhan, most of China's best troops were in Yunnan and Burma, and over half million Japanese soldiers attacked major railroad links and large cities, and the vanguard of the Japanese Eleventh Army were only 150 miles from Chungking itself. Chiang Kai-shek dispatched nine hundred men of Sun's 29th corps to the south of Chungking and they drove away the two regiments of the Japanese 3rd Infantry Division despite complete numerical and technological inferiority. Sun was promoted to General and commander of the 16th army. Chiang personally bestowed the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun upon him. Chinese Civil War After the war against Japan was over, Sun was named garrison commander of Chongking and Nanjing, while keeping the command of the 16th army. He participated early successful campaigns against the communist forces along with his old classmates, they were Du Yuming, Fan Hanjie, Hu Lien and Liu Yuzhang. The communists lost all of their holdings in Central and Eastern China except Shandong and Henan Provinces. In November 1948, the determining battle of the Chinese Civil War, the Huaihai Campaign broke out. Due to the poor leadership of Liu Zhi, one of the least effective Kuomintang commanders and major security breaches caused by communist moles, Sun's troops were encircled by the communist Eastern China Field Army commanded by Su Yu. As a seasoned veteran, he urged Du Yuming, the deputy commander of the nationalist troops to break out before it is too late. Du, being a noted Chiang Kai-shek loyalist, decided to wait for reinforcement as Chiang had promised. Sun decided to breakout on his own, his 16th army was destroyed by the communist troops, but he made it safely to Nanjing in 1948. Chiang again appointed him as commander of the 16th army and tasked to reorganize his unit. In 1949, while he was defending Sichuan province from communist attack, many of his officers went to the communists. Sun was forced to resign as army commander and retired shortly after following Chiang Kai- shek to Taiwan. His civilian life was quite successful and he ran a business in Taiwan. Sun died at the age of 103 on May 25, 2007 in Taiwan.

Taj al-Din Yildiz (also spelled Yaldiz, Yildoz, and Yalduz, ) was a Turkish slave commander of the Ghurids, who, after the death of Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad, became the ruler of Ghazni, while, however, still recognizing Ghurid authority.The Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 166.  Biography  After the death of Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad, two factions arose in the Ghurid Empire; a faction of Turkic ghulams, who supported Mu'izz's nephew Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud, while the other faction consisted of native Iranian soldiers, who supported the Ghurid ruler of Bamiyan, Baha al-Din Sam II. Baha al-Din Sam II, however, died after a few days later, which made the Iranian soldiers support his two sons Jalal al-Din Ali and Ala al-Din Muhammad. Ghiyath, however, managed to emerge victorious during the struggle, and became the ruler of Firuzkuh. Meanwhile, Yildiz seized Ghazni from the Ghurid rulers of Bamiyan, but shortly recognized the authority of Ghiyath. Ghiyath, not glad about Tajuddin controlling Ghazni, and not daring to leave Ghur unprotected, requested help from the Khwarazmian Muhammad II. Muhammad, however, instead invaded the domains of Ghiyath, capturing Balkh and Tirmidh. In 1208, the semi-independent Ghurid governor of India, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, attacked and occupied Ghazni, but was defeated by Yildiz forty days later.. In 1214, Yildiz killed Ala al-Din Atsiz, and put the latter's cousin Ala al-Din Ali on the Ghurid throne as his puppet. However, one year later, Muhammad II conquered Firuzkuh and captured Ala al-Din Ali; he shortly marched to Ghazni, where he decisively defeated Yildiz, who fled to Punjab and captured Lahore from Nasir- ud-Din Qabacha. Yildiz later fought the Turkic ruler Iltutmish, and laid claim to the throne of Delhi as the heir to Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad. Iltutmish refused, stating The two armies met at Tarain in January 1216. Yildiz was defeated and taken by Iltutmish, and after being led through the streets of Delhi was sent to Budaun, where he was put to death in the same year. After the fall of Yildiz, Qabacha again occupied Lahore.

This episode is also known as \\"Big Bunny\\" and \\"On the Moon with Big Bunny\\". It was written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Tim and Bill arrive home and are stunned to discover that the door is locked. When they knock on the door, Graeme asks them to tell him the password. Then Bill demands that Graeme let them in, and Graeme opens the door. Tim and Bill are amazed at the change to their office, which has been set up like a space control centre. Graeme has agreed to do his bit to put Britain into the space race by sending two rabbits (called \\"Floppsy\\" and \\"Spiro\\") to the moon. Bill and Tim comment that it would be very expensive to get hold of a rocket to do this, but Graeme says that he was able to buy a second-hand Saturn rocket from NASA, and that the rocket was parked outside. Tim looks embarrassed and comments that he had just posted a couple of letters in it. Graeme then demonstrates to Tim and Bill how he trains the rabbits for their space voyage, including giving the rabbits stress and gravity tests. The rabbits then lift off successfully on their trip to the Moon. Six months later, Graeme is worried because he had lost contact with \\"Floppsy\\" and \\"Spiro\\" -- and Tim intends to send up two more rabbits to the moon to find out what happened to them and Bill agrees. But Graeme does not want to sacrifice two more rabbits because they are like family to him so, when the rocket takes off, it is not Graeme's specially trained rabbits which make up the spaceship crew, but Bill and Tim, who are not at all happy, and do not wish to go. After they have taken off, Tim and Bill get into a bit of banter: :Tim: \\"Look, I just need to nip out to the telephone box.\\" :Bill: \\"WHAT TELEPHONE BOX\\"? :Tim: \\"Er, that one there.\\" The TARDIS from Doctor Who then flies past. Graeme says \\"You're looking good\\", and Tim then looks at his reflection in a compact mirror and thanks Graeme for what he, Tim, mistakenly assumes is a 'compliment' regarding his appearance. Bill asks where the food is, and Graeme tells him where to find it. Tim then asks Graeme where the tea is, and Graeme tells him that the tea is above their heads -- commenting that they will need to drink the tea through tubes. Tim objects, saying that he would rather drink tea from a cup, causing Graeme to yell \\"Don't do that, the weightlessness you fool.\\" Then there is a meteorite shower and Bill opens a window in the rocket to get a better photo. Graeme loses contact briefly, and then says, \\"Captain's Journal, Stardate: February 18. Time: 10:15. It's all very... 10:15?\\" After switching on the television to reveal Monty Python's Flying Circus: \\"Blast. Missed Moira Anderson.\\" When the rocket eventually lands on the moon it can be seen, from all the American flags planted in the dust, that other people have already been on the moon. Tim and Bill leave the rocket and set about collecting moon dust and sing \\"By the Light of the Silvery Earth\\". They become aware of all of the lettuces and carrots which are growing in the soil and Tim comments that it must be to feed all the rabbits. It appeared that \\"Floppsy\\" and \\"Spiro\\" did not perish after all, and \\"Floppsy\\" (who is now called \\"Big Bunny\\") comments that he is going to turn Bill and Tim into rabbits using carrots (with Bill and Tim then doing the Bugs Bunny impression of \\"What's up, Doc\\"), so that the rabbits can return to Earth and take over the world‚Äîwith Bill and Tim as the vanguard of the invasion force. When Tim and Bill return to Earth, they are met by fanfare as the first British astronauts to travel to the moon and safely return. Everyone is then shocked to find that Tim and Bill have been turned into rabbits. Tim and Bill then proceed to wreak havoc wherever they go and Graeme has to find a way to stop them. In the aftermath of havoc, Tim and Bill appear to lose their Rabbit habits and crave for Fish n' Chips and other kinds of food like meat, But they're both in denial and clam to be still sworn servants of Big Bunny so Graeme serves them pies, which Tim and Bill find them delicious. Tim asks Graeme what they were eating. Much to their horror, Graeme reveals that he tricked them into eating Rabbit pies (OH NO!, YOU MADE US CANNIBALS!). Then Big Bunny turns up to stop them eating meat but it was too late. Tim And Bill now crave more rabbits to eat and chase their leader for dinner.

Description The Fitchburg Art Museum is one of the treasured cultural institutions in Central New England, and serves the cities of Fitchburg and Leominster, as well as the surrounding communities in North Central Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. FAM was founded in 1925 through a bequest of artist, collector, and educator Eleanor Norcross. The museum was designed by Mary Almy. Its complex of four interconnected buildings, with over of exhibition space, features exhibitions from its art historical collections plus special loan exhibitions focused on regional contemporary art. Collection strengths include American photography and general African art, including Ancient Egyptian art. The Egyptian collection is presented in an interactive gallery designed for families and school groups. In 2012, FAM began its rotating contemporary New England artist exhibition program, thus connecting the strength of its historical collections with contemporary art practices. There is also an annual survey show featuring the recent work of many living New England artists, including numerous artworks for sale. Each temporary exhibition is accompanied by an interactive educational exhibit in the Learning Lounge, where visitors young and old can learn about what they are seeing in the galleries and better understand their own reactions to the exhibits. Bilingual Initiative Mummification artwork at the Fitchburg Art Museum FAM is continuing to work towards a goal of becoming New England‚Äôs first fully bilingual (English/Spanish) art museum. Going forward, all new permanent collection displays, changing exhibitions, and associated in-gallery education spaces will be accompanied by bilingual educational texts and object labels. FAM has also hired a bilingual receptionist, and offers free admission to all its neighbors in Fitchburg‚Äôs Ward 4B, a predominantly Latino neighborhood. As FAM continues to build this program over the next few years, the Museum will seek to add bilingual printed collateral, website, social media, and docent tours. FAM is assisted in this effort by a local Latino Community Advisory Committee, and by the Cleghorn Neighborhood Association, the primary service organization for Fitchburg‚Äôs Latino and Latino Immigrant communities. This Bilingual Museum Initiative stems from FAM‚Äôs goal to become one of best community museums in the US. In Fitchburg, 39% of the current population is Latino (primarily from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay), and 55% of children enrolled in the Fitchburg Public Schools come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. This demographic is growing, and far exceeds both Massachusetts and national percentages for Latino population. The Fitchburg Art Museum intends to serve everyone in Fitchburg, and has embarked on the Bilingual Museum Initiative to provide cultural and educational enrichment to all.

The Stockholm City Line () is a commuter railway tunnel beneath central Stockholm in Sweden which is used by the Stockholm Commuter Rail. The line is long, double track and electrified. It has two stations: Stockholm City Station is located directly below T-Centralen, the central station of the Stockholm Metro. The Odenplan station is the other station, and it is located next to the Odenplan metro station. The line entered service on 10 July 2017. Route The tunnel significantly improves the traffic throughput to and from south of Stockholm as there are only two tracks in that direction from Stockholm Central Station, the same number that were in place in 1871 when the railway was originally built. It has 24 scheduled trains per hour in each direction. The commuter trains pass Stockholm with up to 16 trains per hour per direction. The other eight are regional and long-distance trains. The tunnel takes all commuter trains, allowing more regional and intercity trains to operate along the old line. Placing the commuter rail traffic into a tunnel of its own thus allows increased capacity for other national rail traffic through Central Station via Centralbron. The entire system for long-distance passenger railways in Sweden suffers from this bottleneck, since 80% of train rides in Sweden start or stop in Stockholm . As a result, there is no room to increase the frequency of commuter, regional, and long-distance trains despite their heavy usage. Seen from south to north, the route of the Citybanan tunnel branches off the Connection Line after Stockholm South Station on S√∂dermalm, and continues beneath the bay bottom of Riddarfj√§rden at S√∂derstr√∂m, beneath the islet of Riddarholmen, beneath Riddarfj√§rden at Norrstr√∂m, to the new City Station. From there, it continues beneath Norrmalm to Odenplan Station, then beneath Vasastaden to join with the East Coast Line at Tomteboda. History Citybanan in March 2009. The sign reads, \\"We're building a tunnel under S√∂derstr√∂m [the southern channel around Gamla stan] as part of the Stockholm City Line.\\" The project was proposed by the Swedish State Railways in 1988 and, after initially being disregarded as too expensive, has been seriously considered since 2002. In 2006, the Swedish Rail Administration agreed with the city and Storstockholms Lokaltrafik on the financing of the project, and the last step in the planning process was scheduled for 2006‚Äì2007. The cost of the tunnel and stations is estimated at 16.3 billion Swedish kronor. After the general elections of 2006, the new Alliance government called the project into question. Representatives of the government announced on October 1 of that year that they were scrapping Citybanan in favor of building a third railway track through the city. In December 2006, however, the government's appointed expert, recommended building the tunnel following a renewed assessment of the project. In May 2007 the government finally decided to build the tunnel. In September 2014 the tunnel reached its full length.

He held the Linacre Chair of Zoology in the University of Oxford from 1921 to 1946. He served as editor of the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science from 1920 until his death.  Life  Goodrich's father died when Goodrich was only two weeks old, and his mother took her children to live with her mother at Pau, France, where he attended the local English school and a French lyc√©e. In 1888 he entered the Slade School of Art at University College London; there he met E. Ray Lankester, who interested him in zoology. On coming to Oxford from London, Goodrich entered Merton College, Oxford as an undergraduate in 1892 and, while acting as assistant to Lankester, read for the final honour school in Zoology; he was awarded the Rolleston Memorial Prize in 1894 and graduated with first-class honours the following year. In 1913 Goodrich married Helen Pixell, a distinguished protozoologist, who helped greatly with his work. His artistic training always stood him in good stead. He drew diagrams of beauty and clarity whilst lecturing (students used to photograph the blackboard before it was erased), and in his books and papers. He also exhibited his watercolor landscapes in London. Goodrich was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1905 and received its Royal Medal in 1936. He was honorary member of the New York Academy of Science and of many other academies, and awarded many honorary doctorates. In 1945 Lev Berg of Leningrad sent a message through Julian Huxley: \\"Please tell [Goodrich] that... we all regard ourselves as his pupils.\\" A small, dapper, thin man with a dry sense of humor, he always complained that, when travelling by air, he was not weighed with his luggage, since his own weight was only half that of an average passenger.  Career  Illustrations of the Coelom, Genital Ducts, and Nephridia of various speciesThe head-region of an Amphibian A, and an Amniote (mammal) B, showing segmentationWhen Lankester became Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Merton College, he made Goodrich his assistant in 1892; this marked the start of the researches which during half a century made Goodrich the greatest comparative anatomist of his day. In 1921 Goodrich was appointed to his mentor's old post, which he held until 1945. From the start of his researches, many of which were devoted to marine organisms, Goodrich made himself acquainted at first hand with the marine fauna of Plymouth, Roscoff, Banyuls, Naples, Helgoland, Bermuda, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. He also travelled extensively in Europe, the United States, North Africa, India, Ceylon, Malaya, and Java. He worked out the significance of the tubes connecting the centres of the bodies of animals with the outside. There are nephridia, developed from the outer layer inward and serving the function of excretion. Quite different from them are coelomoducts, developed from the middle layer outward, serving to release the germ cells. These two sets of tubes may look similar, when each opens into the body cavity through a funnel surrounded by cilia which create a current of fluid. In some groups the nephridia may disappear (as in vertebrates, where the nephridia may have been converted into the thymus gland), and the coelomoducts then take on the additional function of excretion. This is why man has a genitourinary system. Before Goodrich's analysis, the whole subject was in chaos. Goodrich established that a motor nerve remains linked to its corresponding segmental muscle, however much it may have become displaced or obscured in development. He showed that organs can be homologous without arising from the same segments of the body. For example, the fins and limbs of vertebrates; and the occipital arch (the back of the skull), which varies in vertebrates from the fifth to the ninth segment. He distinguished between the scale structures of fishes, living and fossil, by which they are classified and recognised. This is important because different strata may identified by fossil fish scales. Goodrich's attention was always focused on evolution, to which he made notable contributions, firmly adhering to Darwin's theory of natural selection. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1905. On his seventieth birthday, in 1938, his colleagues and pupils published a festschrifta volume of essays in his honour edited by Gavin de Beer: Evolution: essays on aspects of evolutionary biology.

PLOTE's political wing is known as the Democratic People's Liberation Front. Origins PLOTE was founded in 1980 by an ex-surveyor Uma Maheswaran alias Mukundan, who became its general secretary. He was the chairman of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers or LTTE) from 1977‚Äì1980. He was trained in Lebanon and later in Syria under the Palestinian nationalist organization Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. After a bitter rivalry with Velupillai Prabhakaran, Uma Maheswaran left the LTTE in 1980 and formed PLOTE. Coup in Maldives In late 1988, a coup to overthrow the Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's government in Maldives with the help of mercenaries from PLOTE was foiled by India. The People's Liberation Organization was reported to have been offered at least $1 million - some estimates run as high as $10 million. Officials said they were not certain whether money was the only reward the guerrillas were to get for their part in the coup. There have been suggestions that the PLOTE may have been promised one of the small Maldivian islands as a base, possibly for arms shipments. In a recent interview, Vetrichelvan PLOTE's former representative in New Delhi claims it was Athulathmudali, then Sri Lankan Prime Minister, who instigated PLOTE into such a venture on a promise of some islands. Conflict with LTTE On May 19, 1982, a shootout occurred at about 9:45 p.m. at Pondy Bazaar, Mambalam, Madras between LTTE and PLOTE members. V. Prabhakaran and Raghavan (alias Sivakumar) of the LTTE, armed with revolvers, opened fire on Jotheeswaran and Mukundan (alias Uma Maheswaran) of the PLOTE. In the mid-1970s, both Prabhakaran and Uma Maheswaran were members of the LTTE. During the gunfire, Jotheeswaran sustained bullet injuries both in his right and left thighs. Mukundan was also shot at but escaped unhurt. The accused V. Prabhakaran and Sivakumar were arrested and remanded. Both of them were proclaimed offenders of the Sri Lankan government with a reward on their head of Rs. 5 lakhs each. On May 25, 1982, Uma Maheswaran was arrested near Gummidipoondi railway station. At the time of arrest, he opened fire with his revolver and another case was registered against him under the Indian Arms Act. In the meantime, on May 23, 1982 Sivaneswaran (alias Niranjan), an accomplice of Mukundan, was also arrested at Saidapet, Madras and an unlicensed revolver seized from him. All these accused remained in custody until August 5, 1982 when they were released by the orders of the court on conditional bail. The LTTE cadres including their leader V.Pirabhakaran had taken up residence at Mylapore Madras, while the leaders and members of the PLOTE had been staying at Saidapet, Madras. Demise of the organisation PLOTE lost its strength and momentum gradually due to continual conflicts with the LTTE. On July 16, 1989, Uma Maheswaran was assassinated in Colombo. A PLOTE splinter group claimed responsibility, though many still suspect Indian intelligence agency (RAW) involvement. Current status Currently it is functioning under the leadership of D. Siddarthan and is a pro-government minor political party that is alleged to cooperate with the Sri Lankan military against LTTE sympathizers. The group reportedly has around 1,500 permanent cadres in the north and east.\\"Paramilitary Politics, Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting In 2015 it was incorporated into the TNA. =Paramilitary activities= Some former members of the group also function along with the Sri Lankan Army as a para-military group in military activities against the LTTE. They have also been accused of murders against political opponents. A prominent former PLOTE and later paramilitary leader Manika Dasan was killed by the LTTE in a claymore bomb attack in the town of Vavuniya. Another paramilitary leader from the Batticlao region, Plote Mohan, was killed by LTTE assassins in Colombo in 2004.

Recording started on 28 October 2000 and finished in May 2001 even though the record was originally planned to be released before 2001. The CD single was released by the band's own record label, Zoomorphic, in June 2001 and was sold at the pubs where Keane used to play. All fifty copies were handmade and recorded on CD-Rs. Because of its limited production it is one of the most desired collectors' items amongst Keane fans, and has been known to sell for around ¬£1000 on eBay. Its status as a rarity is such that, allegedly, no member of the band is in possession of a copy.Keane's 2004 Fanzine, found on Keaneshaped.co.uk The single features a re-recording of their previous single \\"Call Me What You Like\\", as well as an early version of \\"She Has No Time\\", which would later appear on Hopes and Fears, the band's debut album. Shortly after this record was released, guitarist Dominic Scott left the band, and was Keane's last release with a guitar as part of their instrumentation until the 2007 cover b-side \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\".

It was recorded at Roundhouse Studios and Balfour Studios. Musical structure Most people would say the song is reminiscent to Coldplay's \\"Brothers & Sisters\\" due to the electric guitar entry in the F#sus4 key, similar to the Asus4 found in the latter. However, the \\"epic and dreamlike\\" Keane sound is still found in the track, with Chaplin and Scott vocals, the guitarist backing. \\"Wolf at the Door\\" is the only 6/8 time signature song by Keane to date. *Length: 4:17 *Tempo: approx. 170bpm *Key: F# major *Time signature: 6/8, 8 beat B-sides =Call Me What You Like= This is a re-recording of the original single, which was slower and longer.

FT political content is often subversive and has a progressive/liberal perspective. In 1997, Sandee Beyerle wandered by the offices of Funny Times and stepped inside simply because she wanted to get out of the rain. From there she worked her way up to managing editor, and when Ray Lesser retired as editor, Beyerle became the editor.  Format and subscriptions  The monthly Funny Times publication is printed in the format of a daily newspaper, on newsprint paper, with each of the 24 pages measuring 11 X 17 inches. The only ads it runs are for its own FT-related merchandise. FT subscriptions have been $26 per year since 2013, which increased to $28 in late 2018. Funny Times began release of a monthly digital edition, available on iTunes and at the Kindle Store, in October 2012 and February 2013, respectively.  Content  Each Funny Times issue is organized into sections such as \\"Relationships\\", \\"Dogs\\", \\"Politics\\", \\"Current Events\\", and others, with the section categories varying somewhat from issue to issue. Each issue includes cartoons, columns and essays that derive humor from pop culture, current events, politics and day-to-day living. A full page in each issue is devoted to the syndicated column originally developed by Chuck Shepherd, News of the Weird, which features dozens of bizarre true stories from around the world. Publisher Ray Lesser frequently contributes his own humorous essays. Each issue contains choice selections of such offbeat comic strips as This Modern World by Tom Tomorrow, Bizarro by Dan Piraro, Zippy the Pinhead by Bill Griffith, Too Much Coffee Man by Shannon Wheeler, Tom the Dancing Bug by Ruben Bolling, The K Chronicles by Keith Knight, and Slowpoke by Jen Sorensen.

He was pretender to the throne of Montenegro, holding the title Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zeta, in succession to his father. King Nicholas I of Montenegro was Michael's grandfather. Michael had recognized and acknowledged the Unification of Montenegro with Serbia, renouncing the throne. In World War II he was held prisoner by the Nazis after refusing to take up the throne of the Axis forces' re-established Montenegrin puppet-state. During the period of Yugoslav socialism, he was an active member of the Serb diaspora revolutionary organization and a diplomatic worker against the socialist government led by Marshal Tito. He was a member of the Crown Council of King Peter II of Yugoslavia. Early life Michael was born in Cetinje in 1908, the son of Prince Mirko of Montenegro. In 1916, the defence of Montenegro against the invasion by Austria-Hungary during the First World War collapsed and he, along with the rest of the royal family, fled to Italy. There, he briefly attended a boarding school in Naples before joining his mother, who had taken up residence in Eastbourne in the United Kingdom where he completed his primary education. Accession After his grandfather Nikola died in 1921, the defunct throne was inherited by Danilo, Crown Prince of Montenegro. However, Danilo unexpectedly abdicated a few days later and his nephew the young Michael (who succeeded him as pretender) \\"reigned\\" as King Mihailo I under the guidance of a regent. On 14 September 1929 the Regency of General Anto Gvozdenovic ended and Mihailo renounced his dynasty's claim to the throne of Montenegro and declared allegiance to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In gratitude, the King of Yugoslavia, Alexander I rewarded Prince Mihailo with a pension from the Civil List. The Axis Proposition In 1941, following the Fall of France, Prince Mihailo and his wife were arrested by the German occupation authorities. They were transferred to Germany and were held at a castle on the shores of Lake Constance. It was here that they were visited by Count Galeazzo Ciano and Joachim von Ribbentrop and were offered the throne of a new, independent Kingdom of Montenegro, but under Italian and German protection and guidance. He rejected this offer and remained imprisoned in Germany until his aunt, the Queen of Italy (Elena of Montenegro), secured their release in 1943. They returned to France only to be arrested by the German authorities and transferred to an internment camp at Jeze≈ô√≠ Castle in occupied Czechoslovakia. The couple's son Prince Nicholas of Montenegro was born in 1944 in France, in Saint-Nicolas-du-P√©lem (Bretagne). The Communist Proposition At the end of the war Michael, his wife and infant son were released; they returned to France, taking up residence in Paris. Shortly after this he began talking to Marshal Tito of the newly socialist Yugoslavia and was invited to visit the country. In 1947 the young family took up residence in Belgrade and Prince Mihailo accepted the position as Head of Protocol at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Prince Mihailo was able to visit Montenegro which he had not seen since 1916, and realized that the memory of his family was still alive amongst the people. Eventually disappointed with Tito, he returned to France with his family in June 1948. Opposition to Communist Dictatorship From its founding in 1946, Michael Petrovich spent his years as an active political dissident of the Communist regime and worked to bring about its downfall. He was a member of the revolutionary Serb Liberation Movement Fatherland, aimed at gathering the Serb diaspora and internal dissidents in an effort to destroy the Yugoslav Communists. Later life and death Following his break with the government of Yugoslavia, the money he received from the civil list was terminated. Soon after, he and his wife divorced and he remained in exile until his death in 1986. Their son, Nicholas, was brought up by his mother. Prince Mihailo is buried in the Serbian Orthodox Church cemetery in Paris. Marriage and children Michael married Genevi√®ve Prigent (4 December 1919, in Saint-Brieuc - 26 January 1990, in Lannion), second daughter of Dr Fran√ßois Prigent (1883-1947), a surgeon in Saint-Brieuc, Le prince Nicolas Petrovich-Niegosch du Mont√©n√©gro de retour sur sa terre natale en Bretagne, 01/09/2017 (source : Ouest-France / Le T√©l√©gramme).

With the addition of other hospitals, such as Detroit Receiving Hospital, the campus of the DMC and its adjacent partner institutions (the Karmanos Cancer Institute and the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center) now occupies most of the area bounded Mack Avenue on the south, Warren Avenue on the north, John R. on the west, and Beaubien on the east. Harper Hospital was founded in 1863, receiving its first patients, Civil War soldiers, in 1864. Two years later it opened as a general hospital. In 1882, a new hospital building was constructed on what is now the campus of the DMC. Additional buildings were constructed in 1913 and 1928. Hutzel Women's Hospital, was founded in 1868. Grace Hospital was founded in 1883, and Children's Hospital was founded three years later. Detroit Receiving was founded in 1915, and moved to its present location in 1980.

Corporate governance  Former Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Duggan was President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2004 through December 2012 when he left to mount a campaign to become mayor of Detroit. Joseph Mullany succeeded Duggan as CEO. Former WDIV journalist Emery King is contracted to serve as the voice commonly heard on DMC commercials, and presents the Emery King Healthcare Video Library at the Detroit Medical Center's website. Recognition Two of the Detroit Medical Center hospitals ranked in the top one percent in heart failure outcomes in the U.S. DMC Harper University Hospital and DMC Sinai-Grace Hospital ranked above the national average in a survey compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services. The list included data from 4,807 hospitals across the United States. Of those hospitals, only 38 were ranked above the national average. The results are meant to assist the public in assessing how well their area hospitals care for patients with specific types of medical conditions including heart failure and heart attacks. The Detroit Medical Center is the only health system in the state of Michigan with two hospitals ranked at this level. The Detroit Medical Center was named to the list of the nation's 100 Most Wired Hospitals and Health Systems in July 2007. The list is the result of the Most Wired Survey and Benchmarking Study conducted since 1999 by the American Hospital Association and published in the July 2007 issue of Hospitals & Health Networks Magazine. The survey focuses on how hospitals use information technologies for quality, customer service, public health and safety, business processes and workforce issues. The hospitals in the \\"Top 100\\" show superior outcomes in four key areas: mortality rate, patient safety measures from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), core measures from Hospital Compare and average length of stay. Based on analysis of the ninth annual Most Wired Survey and Benchmarking Study results, hospitals are embracing technology as a key tool for healthcare quality improvements. The Detroit Medical Center received the prestigious \\"Best Practices in Infrastructure Management\\" award in 2006. The award is given annually by Computerworld‚Äôs Infrastructure Management World, the premier conference for leaders in the data center and infrastructure Management sector. The award recognizes DMC's leadership and excellence among users of infrastructure management technology across the nation. The DMC was one of only two organizations bestowed the annual award that year. Harper University Hospital ranked as one of the top 30 hospitals in the country for Neurology and Neurosurgery by U.S. News and World Report. Children's Hospital of Michigan was ranked one of the top 30 hospitals in the country for children by the same publication.

The band are noted for their uncompromising, mostly instrumental sound. Their name comes from a sleevenote on Bob Dylan's 1976 album Desire which reads \\"I have a brother or two and a whole lot of karma to burn...\\" History =First era (1997-2002)= After years of viral self-promotion (such as phoning record companies pretending to be other bands who'd heard an interesting band called Karma To Burn), Karma To Burn was signed to Roadrunner Records in 1996. They were planning to release an entirely instrumental album, but Roadrunner insisted that the contract was only valid under the condition that they hired a vocalist. After a brief trial of then Kyuss frontman John Garcia, they hired a friend of theirs Jay Jarosz. Their first album Karma To Burn was released in 1997, and despite critical acclaim, sold poorly. The band decided to sack Jarosz and as such were fired from Roadrunner. The band continued, releasing 1999's Wild Wonderful Purgatory and 2001's Almost Heathen as entirely instrumental albums. The band unofficially disbanded sometime in mid-2002, when bassist Rich Mullins joined Speedealer. As of 2008, Mullins was playing in the Los Angeles based band Year Long Disaster, Oswald was the drummer in Nebula, and Will Mecum was playing guitar for Treasure Cat.Treasure Cat =Reunion (2009-2010)= On February 23, 2009, Karma to Burn reformed with the line-up being the same as when they disbanded. They toured extensively, hitting both the US and Europe.blabbermouth.net article Their European tour included a second stage slot at the Download Festival, which has now become infamous for the wasp swarm above the crowd throughout. A year after reuniting, Karma To Burn were in the stages of finishing a fourth full-length album, which was produced by Scott Reeder formerly of the stoner rock band Kyuss. The album, Appalachian Incantation, was released in April 2010, and included two vocal tracks: 'Waiting on the Western World', featuring Year Long Disaster vocalist and guitarist Daniel Davies, and 'Two Times,' featuring former Kyuss vocalist John Garcia. The rest of the album consisted of instrumental selections.Appalachian Incantation first details The band toured Europe after its release, including a nine date UK run supported by bassist Mullins's other band, Year Long Disaster. =Merger with Year Long Disaster (2010-Present)= Karma To Burn, with new vocalist Daniel Davies at Sonisphere Knebworth 2010. Year Long Disaster play Download Festival 2010 with all members of K2B as the backing band. In a May 2010 interview with Uber Rock, Daniel Davies commented on a planned merger between the bands Year Long Disaster and Karma To Burn: In June 2010, Year Long Disaster toured Europe with all three members of Karma To Burn as part of the band. The favour was returned on Karma To Burn's European summer tour, with Davies stepping in as an occasional guitarist (and, when needed, vocalist) for the band. Karma To Burn then announced it plans to record a swift follow-up to Appalachian Incantation with an album featuring several songs with vocals by Davies, to be released in 2011, further blurring the boundaries between it and Year Long Disaster. The speculation as to whether Davies had joined the band was confirmed by his inclusion in the band picture on K2B's website and, more solidly, by Rich Mullins himself in an interview with Rock Radio. K2B headlined the J√§germeister stage at the UK leg of Sonisphere Festival 2010., and supported The Sword on their 2010 winter US tour and in Europe the following November. The follow-up to Appalachian Incantation, V, was recorded in February 2011, at Dave Grohl's Studio 606, and includes Davies' vocals on three songs, although he has since started a project outside Karma to Burn and left the group, returning the band to a trio. V was released in June 2011, followed by more extensive touring of the US and Europe. The band were also set to record a song for John Garcia's solo project, Garcia Vs. Garcia. On September 7, it was said via Twitter that Karma To Burn had finished recording 3 tracks with John Garcia, though for which projects was left unclear. Evan Devine of Morgantown metal band Ancient Shores filled in on drums for Karma To Burn during their 2012 European tour.

It is found in lowland and coastal forests throughout most of the North Island and also occurs in the Marlborough Sounds in the north of the South Island. Mature trees grow up to 15m in height, with a trunk up to a metre in diameter. Kohekohe forest used to be common in damp coastal and lowland areas in the North Island, but these forests have mostly disappeared because the land was used for settlement or they were browsed by possums. A fairly close relative of true mahogany (Swietenia), it is also called New Zealand mahogany, because its wood is light, strong and polishes to a fine red colour. Kohekohe is notable for having characteristics normally associated with trees growing in the tropics, for example, its white flowers and red fruit grow directly from the trunk or branches (known as cauliflory), and it has large, glossy, pinnate leaves up to 40mm in length. MƒÅori boiled the bark in water and drank it as a tonic. The wood was used for building canoes but is soft and not as durable as other woods and tends to rot quickly. It is valued for carving. Kohekohe was probably the dominant vegetation cover on Kapiti Island before it was cleared in the early 19th century for cultivation and farming. The kohekohe forest on Kapiti is recovering after possums were eradicated in 1986.

Booktalks are traditionally conducted in a classroom setting for students; however, booktalks can be performed outside a school setting and with a variety of age groups as well. It is not a book review, a book report, or a book analysis. The booktalker gives the audience a glimpse of the setting, the characters, and/or the major conflict without providing the resolution or denouement. Booktalks attempt to make listeners care enough about the content of the book to want to read it. A long booktalk is usually about five to seven minutes long and a short booktalk is generally 180 seconds to 4 minutes long.Bodart, J. R. (1980) Background According to Carol Littlejohn (Keep Talking That Book! Booktalks to Promote Reading Volume II) there is \\"no known inventor of booktalking\\".Bromann, p. 11 As far back as teachers and librarians have promoted reading and literacy booktalks have existed. One of the oldest sources to mention the actual art form of booktalking is Amelia H. Munson's An Ample Field (1950)Bromann, p. 12 and in The Fair Garden and the Swarm of Beasts Margaret Edwards discusses performing booktalks in the 1930s when it was difficult to get into Baltimore schools.Bromann, p. 12 The actual term \\"booktalk\\" was coined in 1985 by children's author and literature teacher Aidan Chambers,Kenny, p. 333 in his book Booktalk: occasional writing on literature and children. In the 1950s, booktalks were originally designed to motivate young adults to read because they had the freedom to read but chose not to.Jones, P. (1998) Teenagers do not read for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to): the notion that reading is not cool, unnecessary, and uninteresting. Books also have to compete with movies, television, the Internet, and other media. By the 1980s, there are also booktalks for adults. For example, booktalks in senior centers and in adult book discussion groups in libraries. Booktalks for adults were geared towards the recommendation of new titles rather than the motivation to read.Bodart, J. R. (1980) By the 1990s, booktalks were also created for children to motivate kids to read at a younger age.Baxter, K. A., & Kochel, M. A. (1999) However, booktalks for children focused heavily on teaching kids to read using mostly picture books. Purpose The purpose of a booktalk is to motivate listeners in order to foster good reading, writing and speaking skills by encouraging self-directed learning through reading. Booktalkers also try to incorporate learning opportunities following a book talk which include discussion topics, ideas for journals, papers, poems or other creative writing, panel discussions or presentations (visually and/or orally).Schall, L. (2007) Book talks are commonly used by school and public librarians, teachers, and reading coaches, to get a reader interested in a book or to recommend similar books. It is an excellent tool for reading motivation. Booktalks were used long before the advent of the Digital Age, and the \\"traditional\\" booktalk of yesterday is still used today. However, librarians and educators have been able to utilize the Internet and computer software in order to modernize and improve book talks. Types of Booktalks = Traditional = The traditional booktalk consists of a presenter using few tools to engage his audience, save the script he has created and a copy of the book itself. Having no real \\"bells and whistles\\", the booktalker has to get and keep his audience's attention. While there are plenty of sources available, both on the Web and in print (see external links and further reading below), that provide examples of ready-to-present booktalks most librarians and teachers recommend that the presenter read at least a part of the book he will be booktalking. The presenter must engage the audience as any good public speaker would, with an excited feeling, a non-monotonous tone of voice, and eye contact. Genre booktalks and first-person booktalks are fairly popular. Genres to consider for a booktalk may include classics, sports, historical fiction, science fiction and fantasy, romance, fairy tales, short stories, mystery, adventure, non-fiction, short or thin books, horror, realistic contemporary fiction, humor, adult books, graphic novels, and poetry.Bromann, p. 28-41 A genre booktalk should consist of multiple books within one chosen genre. The number of books talked depends on the age of the audience. It is encouraged to have multiple genre booktalks ready in case the presenter starts to \\"lose\\" his audience. The first person booktalk is considered most suitable for an \\"entertainer\\" presenter and is best suited for books written in first person. The booktalker presents himself as a character from a book.Clark, p. 24 The presenter is not limited to characters of the same sex. However, when considering presenting an opposite sex first person booktalk the presenter must keep in mind his audience, as some audiences may be unable or unwilling to use their imagination during the booktalk. Some librarians and educators consider the non-fiction booktalk to be the best way to win over a young adult audience. Non-fiction booktalks allow the presenter to tell astonishing yet true stories that can garner an emotional response. Non-fiction booktalks include a wide range of topics such as poetry, history, music, entertainment, crafts, folklore, crime, psychology, UFOs, etc.Charles, p. 12 They lend themselves to audience participation, since the presenter can ask questions throughout the booktalk, such as, \\"Who has heard of a _?\\" \\"Have you ever seen a ?\\" or \\"Who knows what a  is?\\"Charles, p. 12 Common approaches to nonfiction booktalks include using visual or mental imagery, vignettes, notable facts and astonishing statistics, booktalking in the first-person point of view, or initially presenting a nonfiction book as though it were fiction and surprising the audience by revealing that it is nonfiction.Charles, p. 12-13 Indexes and appendixes should be mentioned if they are included in the book.Paone, p. 23 = Digital (BookTalks 2.0) = From creating book talks on Power Point to creating a multimedia booktalk with sound clips and video excerpts, the booktalk has gotten a makeover thanks to the Digital Age (Keane & Cavanaugh, 2009). A number of websites, listed below, have been created solely for the purpose of sharing booktalks or guiding a librarian or educator on how to create one. Teachers can use these sites to create an assignment for their students, asking them to visit a certain number of sites, browse the reviews and/or booktalks and select one book from each site that interests them. From this list the student can then choose one book to read and report on. The teacher can create a book review blog (i.e. ) and have the students post their reviews online, as well as comments on other student reviews, subject to teacher approval.Belben, p. 28 By utilizing Web 2.0, such as wikis and podcasts, and software such as Power Point, the presenter can create multimedia booktalks that incorporate film and videos, music and the Internet.Diamant-Cohen, 2009 Using a projection screen and computer, the presenter no longer has to pass around a book to show cover art, illustrations, or photographs. Within the scholastic setting librarians can work with teachers to create a set of rotating video booktalks that play in any location that have access to the school's closed-circuit television system.Cavanaugh, p. 56 The video booktalk acts as a book trailer and can be as simple as a taped presentation from a podium to as complex as a reenactment of a scene from a book. The possibilities for the contents of a video booktalk are limited only to the creator's imagination and budget. Creating a video booktalk can be used a class assignment, teaching students not only the tools of a booktalk but incorporating the use of audio/visual materials. Software programs, such as Photo Story, iMovie, and Windows Movie Maker, can be used to create a video booktalk without any expensive equipment.Cavanaugh, p. 58 Audience One way to find out which types of booktalks work best is to create an evaluation form for the audience to complete. Some booktalkers may have a natural inclination for first-person booktalks, while others may present typical third-person book talks, or a book talk that's been digitally enhanced to keep the interest of the audience.Clark, Booktalk Evaluation Form, p. 42 The audience will also determine the length of the presentation, how many booktalks are presented, how much information to disclose, and the length of the individual booktalks.Saricks, p. 61 The audiences of booktalks are broken down into the following categories: students (broken down into the sub categories: young children, older children, and teens), adults, senior citizens and professionals (for librarians and educators). Young children have shorter attention spans so booktalks must be kept brief. Older children and teens are able to focus and sit at attention for longer periods of time and so booktalk presentations can be built in to fit within one class period (30‚Äì45 minutes). Within this timeframe 15-20 booktalks that are 2‚Äì3 minutes in length can be presented.Paone, p. 22 The presenter will want to appeal to as many students as possible so the individual booktalks should consist of many genres. Adult and senior citizen booktalks do not have to be strictly limited to adult titles. Choosing a children's title that will also pique the interest of adults helps keep this audience aware of current children's literature. The presenter does not need to limit himself/herself to the obvious literary groups and books clubs.Langemack, p. 85 Booktalks for senior citizens that relate to the life experiences or periods of time that the group may have lived during, help keep the audience intrigued and involved. The presenter should also take into consideration books that available in large print or audio format for older audiences.Langemack, p. 88 Booktalks for professionals, such as librarians and teachers, should generally be up to 5 minutes in length and include plot summary, genre, interest and reading levels, and note controversial issues and curricular interests.Paone, p. 22 Booktalks of this nature can be presented in a lecture format. The presenter may also consider including critical reviews from reliable publications. Creating a traditional book talk Most booktalk creators and presenters suggest only writing an outline of a booktalk so the booktalk can be presented less as a lecture and more as a conversation. They also recommend that the presenter not memorize a script. It is up to the discretion of the presenter exactly how much of the plot to talk about in the booktalk, but it is universally acknowledged that a booktalker should never give away the ending of the book. In The Booktalker's Bible seven parameters are considered when planning a book talk: 1. Size of the group; 2. Age of the group; 3. Geography; 4. Time; 5. Money; 6. Frequency; and 7. Schedule.Langemack, p. 7-11 This title also lists six \\"Golden Rules of Booktalking\\": 1. Read the Book; 2. Like the Books You Booktalk; 3. Know Your Audience; 4. Booktalk; 5. Don't Tell the Ending!; 6. Leave a List.Langemack, p. 27-32 When creating a booktalk, or editing a previously created booktalk, the presenter needs to remember to keep the talk short and simple. The presenter needs to be able to grab the audience's attention in the first sentence. Sonja Cole, host of the video booktalk website Bookwink.com, recommends keeping a booktalk for children to no more the seven sentences. Introduce the main character and setting in sentences 1 and 2, Summarize the conflict in 3 to 5, and sentences 6 and 7 should get the audience thinking about what happens next in the story.Cole, p. 41 When booktalking it is important to remember to connect with their previous experiences and engage with them. The presenter can also define and discuss the characteristics of the type of booktalk and some audiences will benefit from a comparison of print and film versions and why the book is almost always better.Gruenthal, p. 23 There are a variety of ways to approach a book talk. Lucy SchallSchall, L. (2007) (author of many guides to book talks) describes the three following common ways to perform a book talk for all ages: #Sharing passages aloud and reader response #Reflecting on specific passages for discussion or writing #Preparing dramatic readings or performances Caroline Feller BauerBauer, C. F. (1996). Bauer, C. F. (1997). Bauer, C. F., & Laurent, R. (2000). offers the following unique alternatives to perform a booktalk for children: #Making and using crafts with children appropriate to the themes of your books #Performing simple magic tricks to illustrate the themes of your books #Using puppets to act out certain passages in a book, to give a booktalk or to narrate a story. Effectiveness of book talks There is limited research conducted on the effectiveness of booktalks but they clearly demonstrate the increase of booktalked titles being circulated and lack of effect on reading attitudes.Jones, P. (1998) Joni Bodart's dissertation (1987)Bodart, J. (1987). concluded that: #Booktalked titles circulated from the library. #Overall attitudes towards reading is unaffected by booktalks. Pamela Dahl's thesis (1988)Dahl, P. K. (1988). concluded that: #Booktalks can have an effect on the number of pages that students report for independent reading. #Booktalks did not have any effect on students‚Äô reading attitudes. #Gender breakdown in terms of reading interests was pronounced: 61 percent of females read one book a week compared to 21 percent of males. Gail Reeder's dissertation (1991)Reeder, Gail M. (1991). concluded that: #Booktalking significantly increased the circulation of booktalk titles. #Booktalking did not result in a change in reading attitudes. #Booktalking increased circulation of selected titles but did not extend to other books. Terrence David Nollen's dissertation (1992)Nollen, Terrence David (1992). concluded that: #Booktalking had no effect on reading attitudes. #Booktalking had significant effects on student's decisions to check out the booktalked titles. #Booktalking affected student choice, but only for a very short time.

The 6 February 1934 crisis was an anti- parliamentarist street demonstration in Paris organized by multiple far-right leagues that culminated in a riot on the Place de la Concorde, near the seat of the French National Assembly. The police shot and killed 15 demonstrators. It was one of the major political crises during the Third Republic (1870‚Äì1940).Chris Millington, \\"Political Violence in Interwar France.\\" History Compass 10.3 (2012): 246‚Äì259. Frenchmen on the left feared it was an attempt to organize a fascist coup d'√©tat. According to historian Joel Colton, \\"The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the leagues lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end.\\"Joel Colton, \\"Politics and economics in the 1930s\\" in From the Ancien Regime to the Popular Front, ed. Charles K. Warner (1969), p. 183 As a result of the actions of that day, several anti-fascist organisations were created, such as the Comit√© de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes, in an attempt to thwart the rise of fascism in France. After World War II, several historians, among them Serge Berstein, argued that while some leagues had been indisputably pushing for a coup, Fran√ßois de La Rocque had, in fact, turned in a liberal direction, toward a respect for constitutional order. However, if the lack of coordination among the fascist leagues undermined the idea of a fascist conspiracy, the fascist actions on 6 February were an uncoordinated but violent attempt to overthrow the Cartel des gauches government elected in 1932.Brian Jenkins, \\"The six fevrier 1934 and the 'Survival' of the French Republic.\\" French history 20.3 (2006): 333‚Äì351. √âdouard Daladier, who was president of the Council of Ministers, replaced Camille Chautemps on 27 January 1934 because of accusations of corruption (including the Stavisky Affair). Daladier, who had been a popular figure, was nonetheless forced to resign on 7 February. He was replaced by the conservative Gaston Doumergue as head of the government; this was the first time during the tenure of the Third Republic a government fell because of pressures from the street. The 1930s crisis and the Stavisky affair France was affected in 1931, somewhat later than other Western countries, by the 1929 Great Depression, which had been triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 (\\"Black Tuesday\\"). The economic and social crisis particularly affected the middle classes, traditional supporters of the Republic (in particular of the Radical-Socialist Party). Parliamentary instability followed, with five governments between May 1932 and January 1934, which fueled the anti- parliamentarist movement.William D. Irvine, . French Conservatism in Crisis: The Republican Federation of France in the 1930s (1979) The latter took advantage also of a succession of political and financial scandals, such as the Marthe Hanau Affair (she had used her political supporters to attract, with her newspaper La Gazette du Franc, the savings of the petite bourgeoisie); the Oustric Affair (the criminal bankruptcy of banker Albert Oustric provoked the fall of Andr√© Tardieu's government in 1930, because of the involvement of the Minister of Justice); and, finally, the immediate cause of the 6 February 1934 demonstrations, the Stavisky Affair. This new scandal, which involved Bayonne's Cr√©dit municipal bank, exploded in December 1933. The embezzler Alexandre Stavisky, known as le beau Sasha (\\"Handsome Sasha\\") was linked to several Radical deputies, including a minister of Camille Chautemps's government. The press later revealed that Stavisky had benefited from a 19-month postponement of his trial because the public prosecutor was Chautemps' brother-in-law. On 8 January 1934, Alexandre Stavisky was found dead. According to the police report, he had committed suicide, a conclusion that provoked general disbelief. According to the right wing, Chautemps had had him assassinated to keep him from revealing any secrets. The press then started a political campaign against alleged governmental corruption, while the far right demonstrated. At the end of the month, after the revelation of yet another scandal, Chautemps resigned. √âdouard Daladier, another leader of the Radical-Socialist Party, succeeded him on 27 January 1934. Since 9 January, thirteen demonstrations had already taken place in Paris. While the parliamentary right was trying to use the affair to replace the left-wing majority elected during the 1932 elections, the far right took advantage of its traditional themes: antisemitism, xenophobia (Stavisky was a naturalized Ukrainian Jew), hostility toward Freemasonry (Camille Chautemps was a Masonic dignitary), and anti-parliamentarism. As historian Serge Bernstein emphasized, the Stavisky Affair was exceptional neither in its seriousness nor in the personalities put on trial, but in the right wing's determination to use the opportunity to make a left-wing government resign. In this aim, it could take advantage of the fact that the Radical-Socialists did not have an absolute majority in the National Assembly and thus the government was weak and an alternative coalition might be formed by the parties to the right. However, it was the dismissal of the police prefect Jean Chiappe that ultimately provoked the massive demonstrations of 6 February. Chiappe, a fervent anticommunist, was accused of double standards, lenient towards the street agitation of the far-right (demonstrations, riots, attacks against the few left-wing students in the Quartier Latin by the monarchist Camelots du Roy, the youth organization of the Action Fran√ßaise, etc.). According to the left wing, Chiappe's dismissal was due to his involvement in the Stavisky Affair while the right wing denounced the result of negotiations with the Radical- Socialists: the departure of Chiappe would have been exchanged for support for Daladier's new government.  The night of 6 February 1934  =Forces present= Right-wing anti-parliamentary leagues had been the main activists during the January 1934 demonstrations. Although these leagues were not a new phenomenon (the old Ligue des Patriotes (\\"Patriot League\\") had been founded by Paul D√©roul√®de in 1882), they played an important role following World War I, in particular when the left wing was in power, as it had been since the 1932 legislative elections.William D. Irvine, French Conservatism in Crisis: The Republican Federation of France in the 1930s (1979) pp. 98‚Äì126. *Action Fran√ßaise. Among the most important right-wing leagues present on 6 February, the oldest one was the royalist Action Fran√ßaise. Founded in 1905 by Charles Maurras, it was composed of 60,000 members whose stated goal was to overthrow the 'Beggar-Woman', as they called the Republic, in order to restore the Bourbon monarchy (which had been overthrown during the 1848 Revolution). Historian Ren√© R√©mond identified the tradition of antiparliamentary nationalist monarchism to be one of the three major traditions of the French political right; it was not until the downfall of the Vichy regime that this tradition would decline. The actual street agitation was largely carried out by a youth group, the Camelots du Roy. This was a nationalist group that had much influence in the student movement, and was prone to street brawls with left-wing students in the Latin Quarter. *The Jeunesses Patriotes (\\"Patriot Youth\\") had been founded by Pierre Taittinger, deputy of Paris, in 1924. With 90,000 members, including 1,500 \\"elites\\" members, it claimed the legacy of the Ligue des Patriotes. Rather than overthrowing the republic itself, they sought to replace parliamentary rule with an authoritarian government. The Jeunesses Patriotes had close links with right-wing politicians, and boasted several of the capital's municipal councillors in their ranks. *Solidarit√© Fran√ßaise (\\"French Solidarity\\"), founded in 1933 by the Bonapartist deputy and perfume magnate Fran√ßois Coty, had no precise political aims and few members. *Francisme and others. Marcel Bucard's Francisme had adopted all the elements of the fascist ideology, while the F√©d√©ration des contribuables (\\"Taxpayers federation\\") shared its political aims with the other leagues. *The Croix-de- feu. The Croix-de-feu had been created in 1926 as a World War I veterans association. The most important league by membership numbers, it had extended its recruitment in 1931 to other categories of the population under Colonel de la Rocque's leadership. Like the other leagues, they also had \\"combat\\" and \\"self-defense\\" groups, called \\"dispos\\". Although many on the left wing accused it of having become a fascist movement, especially after the crisis, historians now categorise it as a populist social-Catholic protest movement, and that La Rocque's reluctance to order his protesters to join with the other leagues in directly attacking parliament was a key reason for the riots' failure to escalate into a regime change.William D. Irvine, \\"Fascism in France and the Strange Case of the Croix de Feu.\\" Journal of Modern History 63.2 (1991): 271‚Äì295. online *Veterans' associations. The veterans' associations which had taken part in the January demonstrations also took to the streets on 6 February. The most important, the Union nationale des combattants (UNC), directed by a Parisian municipal counsellor whose ideas were close to the right wing, counted 900,000 members. * *Finally, a sign of the complexity of the situation and the general exasperation of the population, also present were elements associated with the French Communist Party (PCF), including its veterans' association, the Association r√©publicaine des anciens combattants (ARAC).Chris Millington, \\"February 6, 1934: The Veterans' Riot.\\" French Historical Studies 33.4 (2010): 545‚Äì572. =The riots= On the night of 6 February, the leagues, which had gathered in different places in Paris, all converged on Place de la Concorde, located in front of the Bourbon Palace, but on the other side of the Seine river. The police and guards managed to defend the strategic bridge of the Concorde, despite being the target of all sorts of projectiles. Some rioters were armed, and the police fired on the crowd. Disturbances lasted until 2:30 AM. 16 people were killed and 2,000 injured, most of them members of the Action Fran√ßaise. Far-right organisations had the most important role in the riots; most of the UNC veterans avoided the Place de la Concorde, creating some incidents near the Elys√©e palace, the president's residence. However, Communists belonging to the rival left-wing veterans' organization ARAC may have been involved; one public notice afterward condemned the governing centre-left coalition (known as the Cartel des gauches) for having shot unarmed veterans who shouted \\"Down with the thieves, long live France!\\". While on the right side of the Seine (north, on the Place de la Concorde), the policemen's charges contained the rioters with difficulty, the Croix-de-feu had chosen to demonstrate in the south. The Palais Bourbon, seat of the National Assembly, is much more difficult to defend on this side, but the Croix-de-feu limited themselves to surrounding the building without any major incident before dispersing. Because of this attitude, they earned the pejorative nickname of Froides Queues in the far- right press. Contrary to the other leagues which were intent on overthrowing the Republic, it thus seemed that Colonel de la Rocque finally decided to respect the legality of the republican (unlike the Action Fran√ßaise) and parliamentary (unlike the Jeunesses Patriotes) regime. In the National Assembly, the right wing attempted to take advantage of the riots to push the Cartel des gauches government to resign. The left wing, however, rallied around president of the Council √âdouard Daladier. The session was ended after blows were exchanged between left and right-wing deputies. Consequences of the riots =Daladier's resignation and the formation of a National Union government= During the night, Daladier took the first measures to obtain the re-establishment of public order. He did not exclude the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, although he finally decided against it. However, the next day the judiciary and the police resisted his directives. Moreover, most of his ministers and his party withdrew their support. Thus, Daladier finally chose to resign. This was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign because of pressure from the streets. The crisis was finally resolved with the formation of a new government under the direction of former president of the Republic (1924‚Äì31) Gaston Doumergue, a right-wing Radical Republican whom the leagues seemed to accept. Qualified as a \\"National Union government\\", it included the most important figures of the parliamentary right wing, among them the liberal Andr√© Tardieu, Radical Louis Barthou, and social-Catholic Louis Marin, although also included were several members of the centre-left (the Radical-Socialist and similar smaller parties), plus War Minister Philippe P√©tain, who would later lead the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II. =Toward the union of the left wing= Following 6 February, the left was convinced that a fascist putsch had taken place, and that it had been temporarily blocked. The importance of the anti-parliamentarist activity of far-right leagues was undeniable. Some of them, such as the Francisque, had copied all of their characteristics from the Italian Fascio leagues which had marched on Rome in 1922, thus leading to the imposition of the fascist regime. Although historian Serge Bernstein has showed that Colonel de la Rocque had probably been convinced of the necessity of respecting constitutional legality, this was not true of all members of his Croix-de-feu movement, which also shared, at least superficially, some characteristics of the fascist leagues, in particular their militarism and fascination for parades. On 9 February 1934, a socialist and communist counter-demonstration took place while Daladier was being replaced by Doumergue. Nine people were killed during incidents with the police forces. On 12 February the CGT trade union (reformist, with loose links to the Socialist Party) and the CGTU (revolutionary, and linked to the communist party) decided to call for a one-day general strike, while the SFIO socialist party and the communist party decided to call for a separate demonstration. However, at the initiative of the popular base of these movements, the demonstrations finally united themselves into one. Thus, this day marked a first tentative union between the socialists and the communists. It had at its core the anti-fascism shared by both Marxist parties; a union had been opposed since the 1920 Tours Congress split, but this new rapprochement led to the 1936 Popular Front (consisting of radicals and socialists and supported without participation in the government by the Communist party). This antifascist union was in line with Stalin's directives to the Comintern, which had asked the European communist parties to ally with other left-wing parties, including social-democrats and socialists, in order to block the contagion of fascist and anti-communist regimes in Europe.Julian Jackson. A The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934‚Äì38 (1988) pp. 17‚Äì52. Furthermore, several anti-fascist organizations were created in the wake of the riots, such as the Comit√© de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes (Watchfulness Committee of Antifascist Intellectuals, created in March 1934) which included philosopher Alain, ethnologist Paul Rivet and physicist Paul Langevin. The anarchist movement also took part in many antifascist actions. =The right wing's radicalization= Following the crisis, the parliamentary right also began to get closer to the counter- revolutionary far right. Several of its leaders would lose all trust in parliamentary institutions. Daniel Hal√©vy, a French historian of Jewish descent, publicly declared that following 6 February 1934 he was now a \\"man of the extreme right\\". Although he personally abhorred Italian fascism or German national socialism, he went on to support the P√©tain regime in Vichy.See, inter alia, Mark Hulliung Citizens and citoyens: republicans and liberals in America and France (2002) at p. 158 The radicalization of the right wing would accelerate after the election of the Popular Front in 1936 and the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). The American journalist John Gunther wrote in 1940 that the Croix-de-feu \\"could easily have captured the Chamber of Deputies. But [de la Rocque] held his men back. 'France wasn't ready,' he explained\\". It was possible, Gunther said, that \\"like Hitler, he hopes to gain power by legal means.\\" In the view of the far right, 6 February represented a failed opportunity to overthrow the Republic, which only presented itself again in 1940 following the balance had been tipped by the √©trange d√©faite (Marc Bloch) or \\"divine surprise\\" (Charles Maurras), that is the 1940 defeat during the Battle of France against Germany. This deception prompted several far-right members to radicalize themselves, turning toward fascism, national-socialism or the wartime Vichy regime. Despite the fears of the left, the 6 February crisis was not a fascist conspiracy. The far-right leagues were not united enough and most of them lacked any specific objectives. However, their violent methods, their paramilitary appearances, their cult of leadership, etc., explained why they have often been associated with fascism. Beyond these appearances, however, and their will to see the parliamentary regime replaced by an authoritarian regime, historians Ren√© R√©mond and Serge Bernstein do not consider that they had a real fascist project. Opposing this view, other historians, such as Michel Dobry or Zeev Sternhell, considered them as being fully fascist leagues. Brian Jenkins claimed it was pointless to look for a fascist essence in France and preferred to make comparisons which led, according to him, to a clear convergence between Italian fascism and the majority of the French leagues, in particular the Action Fran√ßaise (in other words, Jenkins considers fascism an Italian historic phenomenon, and though a fascist-like movement existed in France, it should not be called \\"fascist\\" as that name should be reserved for Benito Mussolini's movement).Brian Jenkins, \\"The six fevrier 1934 and the 'Survival‚Äôof the French Republic.\\" French history 20.3 (2006): 333‚Äì351.Julian Jackson, The Politics of Depression in France 1932‚Äì1936 (2002) See also *Battle of Cable Street *Bonus March *Cartel des gauches *Comit√© de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes *Far- right leagues *French Third Republic (1871‚Äì1940) *Interwar France References Further reading * Beloff, Max. \\"The Sixth of February.\\" in James Joll, ed.

A traditional holdfast is shaped with either a curved or flat top. In use, the shank fits loosely into a hole in the top or side of the bench or in the top of the anvil, and the tip of the hook is pressed against the work. The holdfast is set by hitting the top with a mallet or hammer, which causes the shaft to wedge against the sides of the hole. It is released again by hitting the back side. Contemporary holdfasts are commonly designed to fit in holes, but historically holdfasts with a larger diameter were more common. In workbenches holdfasts typically have dedicated holes, but they can also be used in suitably sized round dog holes. To avoid marking the workpiece, scrap pieces of wood or leather are often used between the face of the holdfast and the workpiece.  Types  Different types of holdfast include: * Traditional holdfasts made as steel castings, or forgings, or modern holdfasts are made from round mild steel bar stock using highly automated cold-working machines. Tool suppliers market such holdfasts, made from cold-rolled bar stock which is slightly under diameter, usually , for use in the now customary bench holdfast holes. The are constructed with either a curved or flat top. * Screwed holdfasts, sometimes called a hold-down. A later adaptation of the traditional holdfast. Rather than being knocked into place with a mallet or hammer it is tightened by turning a screwed handle. * Wooden holdfasts based on the traditional or screwed holdfast design, but made by a woodworker from, for example, timber and plywood. * Wooden holdfasts carved from a forked tree branch. Sometimes called a barilette.  History  Based on a fresco discovered in the ruins of Herculaneum, holdfasts are known to have been in use since at least the 1st century AD. Holdfasts are also described and illustrated in early European books on woodworking, such as Joseph Moxon's 1678 edition of Mechanick Exercises and Andr√© Jacob Roubo's 1774 L'Art du Menuisier. The term holdfast has been in use since at least the 16th Century. The holdfast declined in use throughout the 20th century, but has seen a resurgence in recent years.

One of the West Point Black Knights' most celebrated distance runners, Dick Shea captured Heptagonal and IC4A individual cross country titles in three successive years (1949‚Äì51), helping Army to three straight team \\"Heps\\" titles during that time. The top performer on Army's dominant cross country team, Shea led the Black Knights to a 19-2 record during his West Point career, a mark that included three straight \\"shutouts\\" of arch-rival Navy. He set seven Academy records in indoor and outdoor track and field and established a meet record in the run at the prestigious Penn Relays in 1951. Shea repeated as the two-mile champ at both the Penn Relays and Heptagonal Championships in 1951 and 1952. His standards in the indoor run (4:10) and run (9:05.8) remained on Army's record books for more than a decade. Since 1952, only eight Army runners have achieved a better time in the mile, either indoors or outdoors. Today, Army's outdoor track and field complex bears his name. Turning down the opportunity to attend the Olympic Games, after graduating in 1952, he joined his classmates in the Korean War. Medal of Honor recipient Richard Shea received the Medal of Honor for actions on 7 and 8 July 1953 as an Army first lieutenant and acting company commander at Pork Chop Hill, Sokkogae, Korea during the Korean War. Fighting outnumbered, he voluntarily proceeded to the area most threatened, organizing and leading a counterattack. In the ensuing bitter fighting, he killed two of the enemy with his trench knife. In over 18 hours of heavy fighting, he moved among the defenders of Pork Chop Hill organizing a successful defense. Leading a counterattack, he killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly. Wounded he refused evacuation. He was last seen alive fighting hand-to-hand while leading another desperate counterattack. He left behind both a wife and an unborn son. His Medal of Honor was presented to his widow at the parade grounds of Fort Myer, Virginia by Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens on May 16, 1955. He is buried at Olive Branch Cemetery in Portsmouth, Virginia. VFW Post 9382 in Suffolk, Virginia is named in his honor.

In 1843 the organization came to Pittsburgh before moving their Motherhouse to Bordentown in 1873. They had a church and school built in Hilltop, New Jersey, but the space there was inadequate and they moved back to Bordentown, where they built a new church and school. These two stayed in use, and have been used ever since. This year, 2013, they will be celebrating 125 years of Faith, Service, and Academics.  Philosophy  As a Catholic School in the Diocese of Trenton, St. Mary's is committed to the development of each individual student in a Christ centered environment. Together with our families, we share the awesome responsibility for the total education of the student. Our school is strongly committed to academic excellence. By emphasizing excellence we hope to encourage all students to reach their God given potential.  School life  The students at St. Mary School are academically as well as socially challenged with the classes and activities that happen within the vintage walls of the school. There are advanced math classes, science labs and fair involvement, creativity fair involvement, special subjects that include the arts, technology, music theory, afterschool clubs as well as a comprehensive sports program. The sports program includes basketball, soccer, softball, and cheerleading. Service is also a big component of the school. In the year 2012-2013 alone, students have participated in the Relay for Life, Pink Ribbon Challenge, Clothing Drives, The Giving Tree for infants and children in need, a book collection for Children's Hospital, 1,500 Can Challenge for the St. Mary Food Pantry, altar serving at all masses, and choir for school masses as well as Sunday's Children's mass.

Patton as a lieutenant general Patton's Speech to the Third Army was a series of speeches given by General George S. Patton to troops of the United States Third Army in 1944, prior to the Allied invasion of France. The speeches were intended to motivate the inexperienced Third Army for its pending combat duty. In the speeches, Patton urged his soldiers to do their duty regardless of personal fear, and he exhorted them to aggressiveness and constant offensive action. Patton's profanity-laced speaking was viewed as unprofessional by some other officers but the speech resounded well with his men. Some historians have acclaimed the oration as one of the greatest motivational speeches of all time. An abbreviated and less profane version of the speech became iconic thanks to the 1970 movie Patton, where it was performed by the actor George C. Scott while standing before an enormous American flag. The performance was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture and transforming him into a folk hero.  Background  In June 1944, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was given command of the Third United States Army, a field army which was newly arrived in the United Kingdom and which was composed largely of inexperienced troops. Patton's job had been to train the Third Army to prepare it for the upcoming Allied invasion of France, where it would join in the Operation Cobra breakout into Brittany seven weeks after the Operation Overlord amphibious invasion at Normandy. Patton speaking before a division of the U.S. Army on 1 April 1944 in Northern Ireland By 1944, Patton had been established as a highly effective and successful leader, noted for his ability to inspire his men with charismatic speeches, which he delivered from memory because of a lifelong trouble with reading. Patton deliberately cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that this would inspire his troops. He carried a trademark ivory- handled Smith & Wesson Model 27 .357 Magnum. He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots. His jeep bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. Patton was an effective combat commander, having rehabilitated the U.S. II Corps during the North African Campaign and then led the Seventh United States Army through the Invasion of Sicily during 1943, at times personally appearing to his troops in the middle of battle in hopes of inspiring them. Patton's army had beaten British general Bernard Law Montgomery to Messina which gained him considerable fame, although the infamous \\"slapping incident\\" sidelined his career for several months thereafter. At the time of the speeches, Patton was attempting to keep a low profile among the press, as he had been ordered to by General Dwight Eisenhower. Patton was made a central figure in an elaborate phantom army deception scheme, and the Germans believed he was in Dover preparing the (fictitious) First United States Army Group for an invasion of Pas de Calais. On each occasion, he would wear his polished helmet, full dress uniform, and gleaming riding boots, and carry a riding crop to snap for effect. Patton frequently kept his face in a scowl he referred to as his \\"war face\\". He would arrive in a Mercedes and deliver his remarks on a raised platform surrounded by a very large audience seated around the platform and on surrounding hills. Each address was delivered to a major general-led division-sized force of 15,000 or more men.  The speech  Patton began delivering speeches to his troops in the United Kingdom in February 1944. The extent of his giving the particular speech that became famous is unclear, with different sources saying it had taken this form by March, or around early May, or in late May. The number of speeches given is also not clear, with one source saying four to six, and others suggesting that every unit in the Third Army heard an instance. The most famous and well known of the speeches occurred on 5 June 1944, the day before D-Day. Though he was unaware of the actual date for the beginning of the invasion of Europe (as the Third Army was not part of the initial landing force), Patton used the speech as a motivational device to excite the men under his command and prevent them from losing their nerve. Patton delivered the speech without notes, and so though it was substantially the same at each occurrence, the order of some of its parts varied. One notable difference occurred in the speech he delivered on 31 May 1944, while addressing the U.S. 6th Armored Division, when he began with a remark that would later be among his most famous: Patton's words were later written down by a number of troops who witnessed his remarks, and so a number of iterations exist with differences in wording. Historian Terry Brighton constructed a full speech from a number of soldiers who recounted the speech in their memoirs, including Gilbert R. Cook, Hobart R. Gay, and a number of other junior soldiers. Patton only wrote briefly of his orations in his diary, noting, \\"as in all of my talks, I stressed fighting and killing.\\" The speech later became so popular that it was called simply \\"Patton's speech\\" or \\"The speech\\" when referencing the general.  Impact  The troops under Patton's command received the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted of the end of the speech, \\"The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it.\\" A notable minority of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct for a military officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced \\"We're going to hold the enemy by the balls\\" with \\"We're going to hold the enemy by the nose.\\" Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known that the two men were polar opposites in personality, and there is evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, \\"When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, and it has to be eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag.\\" Under Patton, the Third Army landed in Normandy during July 1944 and would go on to play an integral role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise Pocket in mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December, a feat regarded as one of the most notable achievements in the war. The rapid offensive action and speed that Patton called for in the speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign. Historians acclaim the speech as one of Patton's best works. Author Terry Brighton called it \\"the greatest motivational speech of the war and perhaps of all time, exceeding (in its morale boosting effect if not as literature) the words Shakespeare gave King Henry V at Agincourt.\\" Alan Axelrod contended it was the most famous of his many memorable quotes. The speech became an icon of popular culture after the 1970 film Patton, which was about the general's wartime exploits. The opening of the movie saw actor George C. Scott, as Patton, delivering a toned-down version of the speech before an enormous American flag. It began with a version of Patton's \\"No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country ...\\" quote. Scott's iteration omitted much of the middle of the speech relating to Patton's anecdotes about Sicily and Libya, as well as his remarks about the importance of every soldier to the war effort. In contrast to Patton's humorous approach, Scott delivered the speech in an entirely serious, low and gruff tone. Still, Scott's depiction of Patton in this scene is an iconic depiction of the General which earned Scott an Academy Award for Best Actor, and was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture as a folk hero.

It is a common canopy tree in lowland forests north of Auckland, often growing in association with kauri (Agathis australis), pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa), tawapou (Pouteria costata), and puriri (Vitex lucens) on basalt rocks and soils. Beilschmiedia is a genus of about 40 mainly tropical trees and shrubs with alternate to opposite leaves. Distribution Taraire only occurs in the North Island north of 38¬∞S latitude. It is most common north of Auckland and Thames at about 37¬∞S. However, scattered populations of the tree occur on the west coast between Port Waikato and the Kawhia Harbour, and inland at Pukemokemoke. On the east, it occurs in scattered locations to East Cape. Description The fruit of the taraire is a favorite food of the New Zealand pigeon or kerer≈´. Taraire grows up to 22 m in height, and has a very wide crown. The trunk may be up to 1 m in diameter. The bark is dark brown and smooth. The branches are stout, and tend to spread widely. Fine reddish-brown hairs densely cover the branchlets, young leaves, leaf stems, and young flower buds. The dark-green leaves, which are generally between 50 and 72 mm long, and 34 to 48 mm wide, are alternate, leathery, and simple, with depressed veins. The leaf stems are 8 to 12 mm long. The inflorescence is an erect panicle up to 100 mm long arising from the leaf axils. Flowering occurs between September and December, with a peak in November. The greenish flowers are 3‚Äì5 mm in diameter and often clothed in dense reddish-brown hairs. The fruit is an erect, elliptical to ovoid drupe about 30 by 16 mm, dark purple when ripe, and covered in a waxy bloom. It contains one seed. Fruit ripen between March and November, and are a favorite food of the kerer≈´ (New Zealand pigeon). Taraire is a very distinct species of tropical appearance whose broad, dark-green leaves with their distinctive depressed veins, and large, erect plum-like dark purple fruits distinguish it from all other indigenous trees and shrubs of New Zealand. Taraire is one of three endemic Beilschmiedia species in New Zealand. The others are the common canopy tree tawa (B. tawa), which has thin willow-like leaves, and tawaroa (B. tawaroa), which is similar to tawa, but has broader leaves. Propagation and conservation Propagation is easy from fresh seed, and better germination results if the flesh surrounding the seed is removed. It is not regarded as threatened, but future dispersal may be limited because the kerer≈´ is generally the only species that can disperse the large seeds of the taraire, which pass through its gut unharmed. North Island k≈çkako (Callaeas wilsoni) can also disperse the fruits, but they are now rare in areas where taraire grow. Uses The wood of the taraire is straight-grained, but brittle and prone to split, and is not durable when exposed to the elements. It has been used for flooring, light carts, furniture, picture frames, ship's blocks, and firewood. References W. Mary McEwen, 1978. *A. E.

Types Eating fresh lotus seeds from a lotus (Nelumbo) seed head Dried lotus seeds snack for sale in Thailand Two types of dried lotus seeds can be found commercially; brown peel and white. The former is harvested when the seed head of the lotus is ripe or nearly ripe and the latter is harvested when the seed head is still fully green but with almost fully developed seeds. White lotus seeds are de-shelled and de-membraned. At harvest, the bitter-tasting germ of most seeds is removed using a hollow needle. Brown peel lotus seeds are brown because the ripened seed has adhered to its membrane. The germ of these hard seeds is removed by cracking the seeds in half. Dried lotus seeds past their prime oxidize to a yellow brown color. However, some sellers of dried lotus seeds bleach their products with hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, or other chemicals.

The Manitoba Centennial Centre, which includes Centennial Concert Hall, Manitoba Museum, Planetarium and Manitoba Theatre Centre represents the finest of Manitoba's cultural organizations. Each year, 930,000 patrons take in the entertainment at Manitoba Centennial Centre venues. The Corporation itself manages the Centennial Concert Hall, Manitoba Museum, Planetarium and Science Gallery, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, Tom Hendry Warehouse Theatre, Manitoba Production Centre, Artspace, three nearby surface parking lots, an underground parkade (at the Concert Hall), and the building at 11 Lily Street. History Prior to the Manitoba Centennial Centre's opening, cultural events and displays were held at the Winnipeg Auditorium (now the Manitoba Archives). Duff Roblin P.C. and Maitland B. Steinkopf MBE, QC formed the concept of a Centennial Centre in 1960 to commemorate Canada‚Äôs centenary and initiate a broad scheme of urban renewal in Winnipeg‚Äôs Point Douglas Area. > The Centre will grow and will serve succeeding generations in Manitoba as a > permanent focus for the performing arts, the sciences and the cultures of > the wide spectrum of our people. In November 1964 plans were revealed for the development of the C$13.5 million Centennial Arts Centre. In July1965 a display model was revealed to the media and public, showing the current Centennial Concert Hall, Manitoba Museum and Planetarium, and the Manitoba Theatre Centre. The model was put inside Eaton's downtown department store. At the outset, the proposed development would have seen the demolition of the Confederation Life heritage building. Several hi- rise apartment buildings surround the site, as well as a park behind the Concert Hall. The original model is currently displayed in the basement of the Concert Hall. The Concert Hall opened first (March 1968), followed by the Manitoba Planetarium (May-June 1968), then the Manitoba Museum (July 1970) and finally the Manitoba Theatre Centre (October 31, 1970). In September 2017 a report was released on substantially upgrading all the venues of the Manitoba Centennial Centre.  Financing  The Province had saved up C$6.8 million for the project, of which $2.5 million came from its own funds, $2.5 million came from the federal government, and C$1.8 from the City of Winnipeg. In addition, all Manitoba municipalities were asked to donate 5 cents per citizen. In addition to government funding, a local fundraising campaign called The Manitoba Centennial Citizens‚Äô Campaign was launched. This campaign sought private and corporate donations through various programs and collected close to $7 million to contribute to the project. It was estimated that the cost of the Concert Hall alone would be C$5 million.  Venues  = Centennial Concert Hall = The Centennial Concert hall was opened on March 25, 1968. It seats 2,305 attendees and is the home of the Winnipeg Symphony, Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Manitoba Opera. In 2015 the lighting system was replaced by LED-based system by ArcSystem. There are further plans to renovate the venue. = Manitoba Museum and Planetarium = The Manitoba Planetarium opened in 1968 as Winnipeg's first such planetarium. The Manitoba Museum opened in 1970 and features several galleries the HBC Gallery, the Winnipeg Gallery, and a Science Gallery. Future plans call for expanding the Science Gallery in a stand-alone building adjacent to the Museum.

Historical background The modern Beltane Fire Festival is inspired by the ancient Gaelic festival of Beltane which began on the evening before 1 May and marked the beginning of summer.MacKillop, James (1998) A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology. Oxford, Oxford University Press. pp.39, 400-402, 421Dames, Michael (1992) Mythic Ireland. London, Thames & Hudson . p.206-10McNeill, F. Marian (1959) The Silver Bough, Vol. 2. William MacLellan, Glasgow p.56 The modern festival was started in 1988 by a small group of enthusiasts including the musical collective Test Dept, with academic support from the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh. Since then the festival has grown, and now involves over 300 voluntary collaborators and performers with available tickets often selling out. While the festival draws on a variety of historical, mythological and literary influences, the organisers do not claim it to be anything other than a modern celebration of Beltane, evolving with its participants.Beltane Fire Society - Official event website Modern festival Fire festival dancers, 2006 The current Beltane was started in 1988 by a small group of enthusiasts including Angus Farquhar of the musical collective Test Dept., choreographer Lindsay John, and dancers from Laban, as well as academics from the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh. The event was intended as a celebration of traditional rituals as a local manifestation of an international spirit. Originally intended to take place on Arthur's Seat, the home of earlier Edinburgh Beltane celebrations, for practical reasons the location was moved to Calton Hill. Choreography, iconography and performance were moulded by the originators' research into historical accounts of Beltane and their own influences (e.g. Test Department's drumming, Trinidadian carnival, and ritual dance and performance). The Beltane Fire Society, a registered charity which runs the festival, is managed by a democratically elected voluntary committee, and all the performers are volunteers who either join by word of mouth or by attending one of the advertised open meetings held early in the year. Senior performers and artists in the society help others through workshops with aspects of event production, prop construction, character performance techniques, team building, percussion skills and the health and safety considerations involved. The society has also held fundraising art and music events and has held a 'mini-Beltane' at a local AIDS Hospice, Milestone House. As a community event, each year the performance has evolved as new people bring their own influences and directions. The core narrative remains by and large the same though additional elements have been added over time for theatrical, ritual, and practical reasons. Originally an event with a core of a dozen performers and a few hundred audience, the event has grown to several hundred performers and over ten thousand audience. Key characters within the performance are maintained, though reinterpreted by their performers, and additional participants incorporated each year. Originally, the festival was free and only lightly stewarded, however, as the event has grown in popularity, due to the capacity of the hill, funding requirements, and Edinburgh Council requests, the festival has in recent years moved to being a ticketed event.

Beta-strands in many beta-barrels are arranged in an antiparallel fashion. Beta barrel structures are named for resemblance to the barrels used to contain liquids. Most of them are water-soluble proteins and frequently bind hydrophobic ligands in the barrel center, as in lipocalins. Others span cell membranes and commonly found in porins. Porin- like barrel structures are encoded by as many as 2‚Äì3% of the genes in Gram- negative bacteria. In many cases, the strands contain alternating polar and non-polar (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) amino acids, so that the hydrophobic residues are oriented into the interior of the barrel to form a hydrophobic core and the polar residues are oriented toward the outside of the barrel on the solvent-exposed surface. Porins and other membrane proteins containing beta barrels reverse this pattern, with hydrophobic residues oriented toward the exterior where they contact the surrounding lipids, and hydrophilic residues oriented toward the aqueous interior pore. All beta-barrels can be classified in terms of two integer parameters: the number of strands in the beta-sheet, n, and the \\"shear number\\", S, a measure of the stagger of the strands in the beta-sheet. These two parameters (n and S) are related to the inclination angle of the beta strands relative to the axis of the barrel. Types A mouse major urinary protein. The barrel forms a binding pocket for the mouse pheromone, 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole. () =Up-and-down= Up- and-down barrels are the simplest barrel topology and consist of a series of beta strands, each of which is hydrogen-bonded to the strands immediately before and after it in the primary sequence. =Jelly roll= The jelly roll fold or barrel, also known as the Swiss roll, typically comprises eight beta strands arranged in two four-stranded sheets. Adjacent strands along the sequence alternate between the two sheets, such that they are \\"wrapped\\" in three dimensions to form a barrel shape. Examples =Porins= Sixteen- or eighteen-stranded up-and-down beta barrel structures occur in porins, which function as transporters for ions and small molecules that cannot diffuse across a cellular membrane. Such structures appear in the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. The central pore of the protein, sometimes known as the eyelet, is lined with charged residues arranged so that the positive and negative charges appear on opposite sides of the pore. A long loop between two beta strands partially occludes the central channel; the exact size and conformation of the loop helps in discriminating between molecules passing through the transporter. =Preprotein translocases= Beta barrels also function within endosymbiont derived organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts to transport proteins. Within the mitochondrion two complexes exist with beta barrels serving as the pore forming subunit, Tom40 of the Translocase of the outer membrane, and Sam50 of the Sorting and assembly machinery. The chloroplast also has functionally similar beta barrel containing complexes, the best characterised of which is Toc75 of the TOC complex (Translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts). =Lipocalins= Lipocalins are typically eight-stranded up- and-down beta barrel proteins that are secreted into the extracellular environment. A distinctive feature is their ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules in the barrel calyx. Examples of the family include retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and major urinary proteins (Mups). RBP binds and transports retinol (vitamin A), while Mups bind a number of small, organic pheromones, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo- brevicomin (DHB). Shear number A piece of paper can be formed into a cylinder by bringing opposite sides together. The two edges come together to form a line. Shear can be created by sliding the two edges parallel to that line. Likewise, a beta barrel can be formed by bringing the edges of a beta sheet together to form a cylinder. If those edges are displaced, shear is created. A similar definition is found in geology, where shear refers to a displacement within rock perpendicular to the rock surface. In physics, the amount of displacement is referred to as shear strain, which has units of length. For shear number in barrels, displacement is measured in units of amino acid residues. The determination of shear number requires the assumption that each amino acid in one strand of a beta sheet is adjacent to just one amino acid in the neighboring strand (this assumption may not hold if, for example, a beta bulge is present). To illustrate, S will be calculated for green fluorescent protein. This protein was chosen because the beta barrel contains both parallel and antiparallel strands. To determine which amino acid residues are adjacent in the beta strands, the location of hydrogen bonds is determined. Table for calculating the shear number. The strand order in this barrel (GFP) is: 1 6 5 4 9 8 7 10 11 3 2.The inter-strand hydrogen bonds can be summarised in a table. Each column contains the residues in one strand (strand 1 is repeated in the last column). The arrows indicate the hydrogen bonds that were identified in the figures. The relative direction of each strand is indicated by the \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" at the bottom of the table. Except for strands 1 and 6, all strands are antiparallel. The parallel interaction between strands 1 and 6 accounts for the different appearance of the hydrogen bonding pattern. (Some arrows are missing because not all of the hydrogen bonds expected were identified. Non-standard amino acids are indicated with \\"?\\") The side chains that point to the outside of the barrel are in bold. If no shear were present in this barrel, then residue 12 V, say, in strand 1 should end up in the last strand at the same level as it started at. However, because of shear, 12 V is not at the same level: it is 14 residues higher than it started at, so its shear number, S, is 14. Dynamical features Beta- barrels in proteins may carry out low-frequency breathing-like motion as observed by the Raman spectroscopy and analyzed with the quasi-continuum model.

Early life Arnold George Dorsey was born in Madras, British India (present-day Chennai, India) in 1936,The Complete Marquis Who's Who (2010) one of ten children to British Army NCO Mervyn Dorsey, who was of Welsh descent, and his wife Olive, who according to Dorsey was of German descent.The Age, 2 August 2002 - Children of the Raj celebrate their unique heritageBBC News, 4 January 2013 - Anglo-Indians: Is their culture dying out?The Telegraph, Sunday , 16 September 2012 - Made in India Various sources say that he is of Anglo-Indian descent.The Age, 2 August 2002 - Children of the Raj celebrate their unique heritageBBC News, 4 January 2013 - Anglo- Indians: Is their culture dying out? His family moved to Leicester, England, when he was ten years old. He later showed an interest in music and began learning the saxophone. By the early 1950s, he was playing saxophone in nightclubs, but he is believed not to have begun singing until he was in his late teens. His impression of Jerry Lewis prompted friends to begin calling him \\"Gerry Dorsey\\", a name that he worked under for almost a decade.Stark, Herbert Alick. Hostages To India: OR The Life Story of the Anglo Indian Race. Third Edition. London: The Simon Wallenberg Press: Vol 2: Anglo Indian Heritage Books. Dorsey's attempt to get his music career off the ground was interrupted by conscription in the UK into the British Army Royal Corps of Signals during the mid-1950s. Later, he got his first chance to record in 1958 with Decca Records after his discharge. His first single \\"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\\" was not a hit, but Dorsey recorded for the same company almost a decade later with very different results. He continued working the nightclubs but in 1961, he was stricken with tuberculosis. He eventually regained his health and returned to nightclub work, but with little success. Career =Changes and \\"Release Me\\"= In 1965, Dorsey teamed up with Gordon Mills, his former roommate in the Bayswater area of London, who had become a music impresario and the manager of Tom Jones. Mills, aware that Dorsey had been struggling for several years to become successful in the music industry, suggested a name-change to the more arresting Engelbert Humperdinck, borrowed from the 19th-century German composer of operas such as Hansel and Gretel. Dorsey adopted the name professionally but not legally. Mills arranged a new deal for him with Decca Records, and Dorsey has been performing under this name ever since. Humperdinck enjoyed his first real success during July 1966 in Belgium, where he and four others represented Britain in the annual Knokke song contest. Three months later in October 1966, he was on stage in Mechelen. He made a mark on the Belgian charts with \\"Dommage, Dommage\\", and an early music video was filmed with him in the harbour of Zeebrugge. In the mid-1960s, Humperdinck visited German songwriter Bert Kaempfert at his house in Spain and was offered arrangements of three songs: \\"Spanish Eyes\\"; \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and \\"Wonderland by Night\\". He returned to Britain where he recorded all three songs. He recognised the potential of \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and asked manager Gordon Mills whether it could be released as a single‚Äîbut his request was refused, since the song had already been requested by Frank Sinatra. In early 1967, the changes paid off when Humperdinck's version of \\"Release Me\\" made the top ten on both sides of the Atlantic and number one in Britain, recorded in a smooth ballad style with a full chorus joining him on the third refrain, and keeping The Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"/\\"Penny Lane\\" from the top slot in the United Kingdom. His song \\"Ten Guitars\\", a B-side on the single \\"Release Me\\" became a huge hit in New Zealand. Another groundbreaking video showed Engelbert tied up with a lasso. \\"Release Me\\" spent 56 weeks in the Top 50 in a single chart run. \\"Release Me\\" was believed to have sold 85,000 copies a day at the height of its popularity, and it was the best known of his songs for years. Humperdinck's easygoing style and good looks earned him a large following, particularly among women. His hardcore female fans called themselves \\"Humperdinckers\\". \\"Release Me\\" was succeeded by two more hit ballads: \\"There Goes My Everything\\" and \\"The Last Waltz\\", earning him a reputation as a crooner, a description which he disputed. \\"If you are not a crooner,\\" he told The Hollywood Reporter writer Rick Sherwood: > \\"It's something you don't want to be called. No crooner has the range I > have. I can hit notes a bank could not cash. What I am is a contemporary > singer, a stylised performer.\\" In 1968, following his major successes the previous year, Humperdinck reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart with \\"A Man Without Love\\", and the album of the same name climbed to No. 3. Another single, \\"Les Bicyclettes de Belsize\\",Billboard, 16 November 1968 - Page 71 Billboard HITS OF THE WORLDLes Bicyclettes de Belsize was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom and reached the top 40 in the United States. By the end of the decade, Humperdinck's expanding roster of songs also included \\"Am I That Easy to Forget\\", \\"The Way It Used to Be\\", \\"I'm a Better Man (For Having Loved You)\\" (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David) and \\"Winter World of Love\\". He supplemented these big-selling singles with a number of equally successful albums. These albums formed the bedrock of his fame, and include Release Me, The Last Waltz, A Man Without Love and Engelbert Humperdinck. For six months in 1969‚Äì1970, Humperdinck fronted his own television series The Engelbert Humperdinck Show for ATV in the United Kingdom, and ABC in the US. In this musical variety show, the singer was joined by some of the most popular figures then active in entertainment, including Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Ray Charles, Four Tops, Lena Horne, Liberace, Lulu, Carmen McRae, Dusty Springfield, Jack Jones, Tom Jones and Dionne Warwick. =1970s= By the start of the 1970s, Humperdinck had settled into a busy schedule of recordings, and a number of signature songs emerged from this period, often written by noted musicians and songwriters; among them, \\"We Made It Happen\\" (written by Paul Anka), \\"Sweetheart\\" (written by Barry Gibb and Maurice Gibb), \\"Another Time, Another Place\\", and \\"Too Beautiful to Last\\" (theme from the film Nicholas and Alexandra). In 1972, he starred in another television series, for BBC 1. Titled Engelbert with The Young Generation, the show ran for thirteen weeks, and featured the dance troupe, regular guests the Goodies and Marlene Charell, and international stars. By the middle of the decade, Humperdinck concentrated on selling albums and on live performances, with his style of balladry less popular on the singles charts. He developed lavish stage productions, making him a natural for Las Vegas and similar venues. He performed regularly at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas through the early and middle years of the decade, recording a live album at the venue with the Three Degrees as backing singers. In 1976, Humperdinck's commercial credentials were buoyed by \\"After the Lovin'\\", a ballad produced by Joel Diamond and released by CBS subsidiary Epic. The song was a top 10 hit in the US and was nominated for a Grammy Award, went Gold, and won the \\"most played juke box record of the year\\" award. The album of the same name reached the top 20 on the US charts, and was a Double Platinum hit for the singer. Three of the album tracks were produced by Bobby Eli and recorded at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. As critics point out, the singer's unexpected foray into the \\"Philadelphia Sound\\" was successful, adding to the overall strength of the work. Rounding off the year, Humperdinck made his first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson with a live performance of the hit single. Joel Diamond went on to produce a series of albums recorded by Humperdinck for Epic, including This Moment in Time from 1979 (the title song topped the US adult contemporary charts) and two Christmas albums. In 1979, following his late-decade chart successes stateside, Humperdinck took his stage show to Broadway with appearances at the Minskoff Theatre. =1980s and 1990s= In the 1980s, Humperdinck consolidated his discography, recording regularly and performing as many as 200 concerts a year while continuing with headlining appearances in Las Vegas at the Hilton Hotel (Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino). In the early and mid-1980s, he made a number of special appearances as an actor on popular television dramas of the time, including The Love Boat, Hotel and Fantasy Island. Following his stint as a recording artist with Epic, he released what William Ruhlmann has called an \\"ambitious double album\\" titled A Lovely Way to Spend An Evening (1985). Ruhlmann commends Humperdinck for recording this album of standards from the American Songbook; he notes that the work \\"was a long time coming\\", while acknowledging that \\"the album deserved a broader distribution than it received.\\" The album was released in the United Kingdom as Getting Sentimental and reached the UK Top-40 album charts in the summer of 1985. In the following years, Humperdinck continued with studio recordings, including a duet with Gloria Gaynor for his 1987 album Remember, I Love You In 1989, he recorded Step into My Life (released as Ich Denk An Dich in Germany). Songs on the album were written by songwriters and musicians such as Dieter Bohlen and Barry Mason. It spawned several singles: \\"Red Roses for My Lady\\", \\"I Wanna Rock You in My Wildest Dreams\\", and a version of Dieter Bohlen's first hit from the album The 1st Album, \\"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\\". Humperdinck was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989 and won a Golden Globe Award as entertainer of the year, while also beginning major involvement in charitable causes such as the Leukemia Research Fund, the American Red Cross, the American Lung Association, and several AIDS relief organisations. He wrote a song for one charity-group titled \\"Reach Out\\" (released in 1992, on his studio album Hello Out There). Musical appraisals of Humperdinck's career in the 1990s point to him earning \\"a new hip cachet\\" during the Lounge Revival, and note the success of new artistic ventures such as his recording of \\"Lesbian Seagull\\" for the soundtrack of the film Beavis and Butt-head Do America (1996), and his dance album from 1998. 1995's Love Unchained, produced by Bebu Silvetti, peaked in the UK Top-20 album charts, marking a return to form in his home country. He retained a public profile during these years, making numerous appearances on radio and television, including the Late Show with David Letterman and The Howard Stern Show, and at events such as the 1996 Daytona 500, where he performed The Star-Spangled Banner. In 1988, Humperdinck filed a libel suit against the National Enquirer. The origin of the libelous statements was said to be Kathy Jetter, the mother of Humperdinck's illegitimate child, and were made in an affidavit filed by Jetter in New York Family Court in an effort to increase child support payments from Humperdinck. Jetter lost the action.\\"First Off ...\\", Los Angeles Times (29 December 1988) Jetter had successfully brought a paternity suit against Humperdinck following the birth of her daughter Jennifer in 1977. = 21st century= Humperdinck performing in 2008. Humperdinck's recording career has continued into the new century, with a range of musical collaborations. In 2000, he hit the top five of the British album charts with Engelbert at His Very Best, and returned to the top five four years later, after he appeared in a John Smith's TV-advertisement. In the spring of 2003, Humperdinck collaborated with the American Grammy Award-winning artist-producer Art Greenhaw to record the roots gospel album Always Hear the Harmony: The Gospel Sessions; joining Humperdinck on the album were the Light Crust Doughboys, the Jordanaires and the Blackwood Brothers. The critically acclaimed album was nominated for a Grammy for \\"Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album of the Year\\", while Humperdinck was photographed with generations of fans at the 2004 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. He was back in the studio soon after, releasing Let There Be Love in 2005. Music critics have remarked on the historical span of material in the album, from songs first made popular in the 1920s to more recent ones from the 1990s, and point especially to Humperdinck's version of Nick Lowe's \\"You Inspire Me\\" as a noteworthy cut. In 2007, Humperdinck released The Winding Road. In a conversation with Larry King, Humperdinck discussed the genesis of the album; he pointed out that The Winding Road featured songs exclusively by British composers, as a \\"tribute to [his] home country\\", released as it was to mark 40 years since his first international hit recording. Humperdinck in 2008 During the recording of the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach, Humperdinck was asked by Damon Albarn to contribute to the album as a guest artist. The singer's management at the time, however, declined the offer without Humperdinck's knowledge. Describing the event, Humperdinck stated that the missed opportunity was, \\"the most grievous sin ever committed\\", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz. He added that he had since parted ways with his then-management, handing over duties to his son, Scott Dorsey. At the end of the interview, Humperdinck observed: \\"I'd really like to rekindle that suggestion again and bring it back. Hopefully they will ask me again. My son Scott will definitely say yes\\". On 1 March 2012, the BBC announced that Humperdinck would represent the United Kingdom in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, to be staged in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 26 May. The song, \\"Love Will Set You Free\\" was unveiled on 19 March 2012, produced by Grammy Award-winning music producer Martin Terefe and co-written by Sacha Skarbek. The song was recorded in London, Los Angeles and Nashville, Tennessee, and was mixed by Thomas Juth in London. When Humperdinck's participation was announced, he was set to become the oldest singer to ever participate in the contest at the age of 76. He was however overtaken in the same year when the Buranovskiye Babushki performed later on that night. During the final allocation draw, the United Kingdom was drawn to perform first. Humperdinck eventually finished in 25th place out of 26, coming in second to last in the voting, with 12 points. With a rapid series of recordings, the artist showed no signs of slowing the pace of his work in the 2010s. A career- first double-CD of duets, Engelbert Calling, was released in the United Kingdom in March 2014 by Conehead Records, charting in the UK Top 40. The album finds the singer in the studio with musicians like Charles Aznavour, Elton John, Il Divo, Johnny Mathis, Lulu, Willie Nelson, Olivia Newton-John, Cliff Richard, Smokey Robinson, Kenny Rogers, Neil Sedaka, Ron Sexsmith, Gene Simmons and Dionne Warwick. The album was released in North America by OK! Good Records on 30 September 2014, with Humperdinck making a number of promotional appearances on radio and television, including an extended conversation with Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani on HuffPost Live. A Special Edition Vinyl EP with four tracks from the album was released in May 2015. According to OK! Good Records, the EP was Humperdinck's first vinyl release after a gap of twenty-five years, \\"a limited-edition 7\\" vinyl record with a first pressing of 1,000 copies on transparent cloudy clear vinyl\\". 2017 marked the 50th anniversary of Humperdinck's first international chart success, and two major celebratory disc sets were produced in the early summer. The first, Engelbert Humperdinck 50, is a two-disc album bringing together the singer's charting singles for Decca, other songs from different points in his career, two new studio recordings, and a new remix of \\"Release Me\\". The second is an extended box set of Humperdinck's first eleven albums, reissued by Decca Records, complete with original album artwork and new liner notes. Engelbert Humperdinck 50 was released in the United Kingdom in May 2017, and entered the UK album charts at No 5, indicating the singer's enduring popularity in his home country. The album was released in North America in June 2017. The Man I Want To Be was released in late 2017. While composed largely of newly written material, the album included two notable covers: \\"Photograph\\" (Ed Sheeran), and \\"Just the Way You Are\\" (Bruno Mars). In 2018, the singer came out with a newly-recorded Christmas album, Warmest Christmas Wishes. In May 2019, Humperdinck premiered a new song, \\"You,\\" a self-described ode to motherhood written for him by British songwriters Jon Allen and Jake Fields. As a birthday gift to his wife, Patricia, Humperdinck appeared in a music video of \\"You\\", filmed on location at the Houdini Estate. The singer's record label has recently announced the late-2019 release of an EP of songs titled Reflections. Well into his sixth decade as a successful entertainer, Humperdinck continues with his schedule of international concert dates. While touring North America on an annual basis, he has performed in a range of venues and events in Europe, Australia, and the Far East. In 2009, Humperdinck performed at Carols in the Domain, a popular Christmas event held in Sydney, Australia. In November 2010, he returned to Australia for a number of concerts, adding a new studio album, Released, to his discography. Humperdinck also returns for concerts in the United Kingdom. In May 2015, he appeared at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, the Symphony Hall, Birmingham and the Royal Albert Hall. Humperdinck latest UK concert was at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in November 2017. 2019 sees Humperdinck scheduled for concerts in Singapore, Manila, and Tokyo. In 2020, the singer has scheduled performances in the UK and Europe, including stops in London, Scotland, and Germany. On 25 June 2019 The New York Times Magazine listed Humperdinck among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Personal life In 1964, Humperdinck married Patricia Healey. They have four children‚ÄîScott, Jason, Louise and Bradley. Humperdinck's wife once said that she could paper their bedroom with all of the paternity lawsuits that have been filed against him. He was successfully sued for paternity by two women during the 1970s and 1980s. As of 2001, he had homes in Great Britain and in southern California. He is a practising Roman Catholic. In 2017, the singer revealed that his wife had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years. Humperdinck retains firm ties with Leicestershire, where he spent much of his youth, and is a keen fan of Leicester City.Engelbert Humperdinck reveals his favourite things about Leicester Leicester Mercury, 21 May 2017. Retrieved 1 June 2017. In August 2005, he auctioned one of his Harley-Davidson motorbikes on eBay to raise money for the County Air Ambulance in Leicestershire. In 2006, the University of Leicester awarded Humperdinck an Honorary Doctorate of Music. On 25 February 2009, Leicester City Council announced that Humperdinck would be given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester alongside author Sue Townsend and former professional footballer Alan Birchenall. In 2010, Humperdinck was one of the first nine people to be honoured with a plaque on the Leicester Walk of Fame. Humperdinck has been active in real-estate investments in Hawaii, Mexico and the mainland United States. In the latter half of the 1970s, the singer bought the Pink Palace in Los Angeles, previously the home of Jayne Mansfield; in 2002, he sold the mansion to developers. During the 1980s, Humperdinck bought a hotel property in La Paz, Mexico, and renamed it La Posada de Engelbert. The hotel flourished for a time, acquiring a reputation as an off-the-beaten-path gem. In later years, however, his ownership of the property was successfully challenged. The hotel was demolished in 2012, and replaced by the Posada Hotel Beach Club.

It was debuted on rehearsal days throughout June 2005, before the grand opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12, 2005. The parade takes a few floats and themes from Tokyo Disneyland's former daytime parade named Disney on Parade: 100 Years of Magic. The park was originally scheduled to receive Disneyland's long-running Parade of the Stars, which was debuted for its 45th anniversary celebration in 2000 and was replaced with a new 50th anniversary parade in 2005. However, officials decided on a different parade for the new park. thumb The parade begins in Fantasyland, near the entrance of Storybook Theatre, and ends on Main Street, U.S.A., near the Disneyland City Hall. Floats in Disney on Parade feature Chip 'n' Dale, a studio-like float, Disney Princesses, Alice in Wonderland, The Little Mermaid, Toy Story, and Mickey Mouse and friends in a finale float which looks like the Sleeping Beauty Castle. The parade features almost 100 performers and assisting cast members. During the Christmas season from 2007 to 2010, the parade was enhanced with Christmas themes and ran as the 'Let it Snow' Christmas Parade. In September 2010, Hong Kong Disneyland celebrated its 5th anniversary. Disney On Parade was replaced by a new parade called Flights of Fantasy Parade on January 21, 2011. In June 2010, Steve Davison, the creator of Disney's World of Color in Disney California Adventure, mentioned that he was currently working on a parade for Hong Kong Disneyland's 5th anniversary.http://micechat.com/forums/blogs/in-the- parks/1525-special-world-color-coverage-blue-sky-harry-potter-more.html Parade Units *Opening: This is a logo float, recycled from 100 Years of Magic. *The Band Concert Unit:Based on the 1935 animated cartoon. a marching band leads an 8 meter high balloon of Mickey. his hand with the wand moves. *Chip 'n Dale : the chipmunks are on an art and design float with paint and a flip book of Mickey Mouse. *Plane Crazy Unit: based on the 1928 animated cartoon *Disney Princess Unit:You will be able to see your favourite Disney princesses, Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella from Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty.

It makes a crescent through the northeast corner of the state, running from SH-99 in Osage County to Interstate 40 (I-40) near Gore. It has two lettered spur routes. SH-10 first appeared as part of the original highway system designated in 1924. The route originally served eastern Oklahoma as a border-to-border route, connecting the Red River near Hugo to the Missouri state line near Joplin, Missouri. Much of the southern half of the route was dropped in 1941, while western extensions throughout the 1940s brought the highway to its current routing. Route description East end of OK 10 and US 69 overlap Highway 10 begins at State Highway 99 northwest of the unincorporated town of Bigheart. The highway runs northeast of this point through sparsely-populated Osage County. The route runs across the dam forming Lake Hulah and runs through its eponymous unincorporated community. East of this, it crosses into Washington County, where it skirts Copan Lake. The route then proceeds to the town of Copan, where it intersects US-75. SH-10 progresses east to Nowata County, entering the county near Wann, before meeting US-169 around Elliot. It forms a concurrency with US-169 through the town of Lenapah, and splits off and heads due east from there. It does not intersect any highways or pass through any sizeable towns until Welch, where it meets US-59/SH-2. It then continues east to Miami, Oklahoma where it overlaps with US-59/69 and meets State Highway 125. After passing through Miami and passing the northern terminus of State Highway 137, SH-10 reaches its northeasternmost point at the western terminus of SH-10C (see below). After this point, all of SH-10 is north-south. Scenic SH-10 signage in Adair County, north of the Illinois River area. SH-10 has a brief concurrency with U.S. Highway 60 near Wyandotte. At Wyandotte, the route turns to the south once more for to its junction with SH-25. From this junction, the route turns to the west for the three-mile (4.8 km) stretch to Grove. Until recently, SH-25 and SH-10 were concurrent along this stretch, but SH-25 now ends at the aforementioned junction. In downtown Grove, SH-10 again joins US-59, and is signed with that highway for 30 miles (48 km) through mostly rural parts of Delaware County, including the county seat, Jay, where State Highway 20 joins with SH-10 and US-59 for approximately two miles. South of Jay, the route continues south for to an intersection with SH-116. SH-10 continues south for , coming to an interchange with U.S. Highway 412, the Cherokee Turnpike, at the town of Kansas. (US-59 departs just south of the interchange and follows US-412 east toward the Arkansas state line at West Siloam Springs.) SH-10 then begins paralleling the Illinois River, a popular recreation area primarily accessed through SH-10. It then heads eastbound again at US-62/State Highway 51. SH-10 forms a concurrency with these two highways to Tahlequah, where SH-51 splits off. US-62 and SH-10 remain concurrent until south of Ft. Gibson. After leaving US-62, SH-10 runs mostly parallel to the Arkansas River, passing through the towns of Braggs, Oklahoma and Gore. It has a brief concurrency with U.S. Highway 64 to cross the Arkansas River, and splits off to the south in Webbers Falls. Just after this it ends at Interstate 40. History SH-10 was first added to the state highway system on August 24, 1924. The original route of the highway began at the Texas state line south of Hugo and followed present-day US-271 northward to Spiro, Oklahoma, where it turned west along present-day State Highway 9. The highway then resumed a northbound course along present-day SH-2 to Warner. In Warner, it turned east to follow what is now US-64 to Webbers Falls and Gore. From Gore, it followed its current route to what is now the western terminus of SH-10C. From that intersection, rather than turning west towards Miami, SH-10 continued northeast to end southwest of Joplin, Missouri, approximately where Interstate 44 crosses the state line now. By 1927, however, the northern terminus had been relocated to Miami. The Miami terminus lasted until January 30, 1930, when the highway was truncated to the US-60 junction near Wyandotte. However, this change would be reversed seven years later; SH-10 once again ended in Miami beginning February 3, 1937. SH-10 was extended to the west for the first time in 1941. The route's western terminus was moved to SH-2 at Welch on April 14, 1941. However, the other terminus was moved north at the end of that year, resulting in SH-10 being truncated to Gore after November 12, 1941. SH-10 was then extended farther west, to US-169 at Lenapah, on April 3, 1944. A new section of highway, running from SH-99 to Copan, was added to the state highway system on August 21, 1954. This road was also assigned the SH-10 designation, creating a gap in the highway between Copan and Lenapah. This gap would persist until August 3, 1981, when SH-10 was extended east from Copan to US-169, filling the gap. Interstate 40 was built through Sequoyah County in the late 1960s. SH-10 was extended from Gore along US-64 to Exit 291 on June 1, 1970. This brought SH-10 to its present-day southern terminus. The section of SH-10 east of Gore was pressed into service as a detour for I-40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26, 2002. The detour significantly impacted the town of Gore. Local firefighters directed traffic there 24 hours a day, with daytime temperatures approaching . Businesses in Gore reported loss of revenue due to the traffic; one gas station reported a 30% decline in revenue while traffic was detoured through town. Delays of thirty to fifty minutes on the detour were typical, although trains passing through Gore could lengthen wait times by 15 minutes. Spurs State Highway 10C at the Missouri state line. *SH-10A (6.3 mi) runs from SH-10 north of Gore to SH-100 near Lake Tenkiller. *SH-10C (4.4 mi) is a short branch of SH-10 in Ottawa County. Its western terminus is at SH-10, and its eastern terminus is at the Missouri state line, north of Seneca, Missouri. It continues as Missouri Supplemental Route U which runs less than a mile before it ends at Route 43 north of Seneca, Missouri. The highway is relatively straight, though hilly, and no communities are located on the highway.

Clarkstown North is one of two high schools in the Clarkstown Central School District (CCSD). Since 2006, North offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme to juniors and seniors. In 2015 U.S. News & World Report ranked Clarkstown North Senior High School with a silver award as the 135 Best High School in New York State and 1,329 nationally.2015 Academic Indicators Buildings Clarkstown North consists of three buildings: the main building, the annex, and the new building. =Main= The original building of Clarkstown High School North is the Main, which is built off an early 1900s mansion. Before the construction of Clarkstown High School South, this was the only high school in the Clarkstown Central School District. The Main has the language department, the English department, some of the science rooms, the film making studio, a two- room writer's lab, a two story library, a large gym with boys and girls locker rooms, a smaller gym that serves as the wrestling room, an auditorium and theater department, an orchestra room, a courtyard, a large lunchroom, a special education program, and a bomb shelter. It is the largest building in the school. =Annex= The second building is commonly referred to as the \\"Annex\\" and was completed by the 1960-61 school year. Before Felix Festa Middle School was constructed, the Annex was the school district's junior high school. However, the two buildings were not connected, so for a long time students had to walk outside to get from class to class. The Annex is built on a hill and has three floors. The top floor is referred to as the fifth floor, the one right below it in the middle of the hill is the fourth floor, and the bottom floor is the third. The third floor has science rooms, the fourth has math rooms, and the fifth has math rooms, health rooms, study halls, a small gym with locker rooms, and two small cafeterias. During the 1980s, classrooms were built in trailers called \\"The Mobiles.\\" The Mobiles had been put up in 1985 during the construction of the new library in the Main. These were demolished before the start of the 2009-10 school year. =New building extension= The new building extension was built during the 2004-2005 school year. This expansion connected the \\"Main\\" and \\"Annex\\" buildings, and also added many classrooms. The building stands on three floors consisting of specialty classrooms, including a new band room on the middle floor, and art rooms on the bottom floor, as well as many social studies classrooms. It was intended to have air conditioning, but the budget was apparently not met. Vermin problem and Halloween 2007 walkout On October 31, 2007 Clarkstown North students, from grades ranging from 9th to 12th grade, held a walk-out to protest the sanitary conditions of the school. The protest started in front of the annex building and students walked to the far ball field. Students chanted and held signs from approximately 12:20pm to 1:00pm while a news helicopter hovered above. This was the largest walkout in district history. The other previous walkout was in 1975 and happened because students were against the new rules regarding study halls. Originally, Clarkstown North Students were planning to walk to Town Hall, in the heart of New City, New York. The plan was quickly scrapped as Clarkstown Police Department threatened to arrest anyone who left school grounds on account that it was unlawful assembly and the students could quickly turn into a riot. The next evening, there was an emergency school board meeting in which students and parents spoke about the conditions at Clarkstown North. The meeting started at 7:30pm and went until 11:30pm. During the meeting, it was revealed that there were over 700 recorded absent students during the walkout, far more than the estimated 200-300. The following day, there was a meeting immediately after school for all students to discuss ways to improve Clarkstown North. Field renovation In June of the 2007-2008 school year, construction began on the football field and track. The track and playing field were torn up and replaced by a new rubber track and artificial-turf football field. The renovations were scheduled to be finished by the start of the 2008-2009 school year, but were completed October 25, 2008. Athletics The school offers a variety of varsity and junior varsity sports and competes as part of Section One of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. Clarkstown North's rival schools include Clarkstown South, the other senior high school in the Clarkstown Central School District. The winner of the annual football game between the two schools is awarded the Supervisor's Cup. Despite the inherent rivalry, Clarkstown North and Clarkstown South compete together as one \\"Clarkstown\\" team in several varsity sports such as ice hockey and swimming/diving. The varsity baseball team won the 2002 Class A New York State championship.  Ram's Cave  In the Spring of the 2010-2011 school year, the Ram's Cave was created at North. The Ram's Cave is a small school store in the Main that sells snacks, beverages, and school spirit wear to all students in the afternoons. Members of the PTA volunteer their time to manage the store. In the fall of the 2012-2013 school year, the Ram's Cave was relocated and expanded into the library of the School.

Rieu, CBE ‚Äì a classicist and an accomplished Greek and Latin scholar who had translated inter alia the Iliad and the Odyssey. Rieu revolutionized the art of translation, and became a mentor and key influence upon Dawood's approach to the translator's craft. Rieu and Lane proposed a new translation of the Koran, which at that time was largely unknown to British readers. The only previous translations were in an archaic, literal style; the aim was to produce a modern translation that would be accessible to the English-speaking reader. The first edition was published in 1956 as Penguin No. L52. In this edition, Dawood rearranged the chapters (surahs) into more-or-less chronological order, to make them easier to understand, in line with the chronological approach found in the Old and New Testaments. Later revisions of his translation reverted to the traditional sequence of the surahs (beginning with the short surah Al FƒÅti·∏•ah, but further roughly arranged in descending order of length). His translation of the Koran is still thought to be the best-selling English language version ‚Äì it has been reprinted at least 70 times, appearing in several revised editions and formats. For N J Dawood, the Koran was a lifelong ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù ‚Äì constantly revised and refined in the course of an entire career. Language and use of English change constantly over time: for example, terms such as ‚ÄúMen‚Äù and ‚ÄúMankind‚Äù did not have the same gender-specific connotations for the reader of the 1950s that might apply today, so have been censored. Dawood's translation has never been out of print; a new revised edition was published in May 2014. He died on 20 November 2014.NJ Dawood - obituary Approach to translation N J Dawood's approach to the Koran is that of a scholar approaching the greatest work of Classical Arabic literature, free from any religious bias. He greatly admires the Koran's eloquence and powerful rhetoric (describing it in his introduction as \\"not only one of the most influential books of prophetic literature but also a literary masterpiece in its own right\\"), and his translation endeavours to do justice to both. The translation includes explanatory footnotes. Dawood has also edited and abridged the Muqaddimah of the great philosopher-historian Ibn Khaldun, published by Princeton University Press. He has retold some of the best-known stories of the Arabian Nights in three children's books, in the Puffin Books series. In the late 1950s, Dawood founded the Arabic Advertising & Publishing Co Ltd, a language consultancy specializing in Arabic. The 1960s and 1970s were a crucial time for development of the Middle East as a market for British, European and North American products and services. Some of the best-known brands still use hand-drawn Arabic logos that he developed at that time. The company currently trades as Aradco VSI Ltd, providing translation and language services in every commercially important language. N J Dawood's academic discipline and key tenets govern the company's approach to all its work: a good translation should always appear to the reader to be the ‚Äúoriginal version‚Äù, never a translation of something else.

The Chicago-born Ruth Hartman emigrated to Canada in 1925 when she married Egmont Leo Frankel (d. 1964). She died in Toronto, predeceased by one of her three children. Frankel was active with the Canadian Cancer Society in the late 1940s. In 1950, she founded the Toronto chapter of the Canadian Cancer Society. Subsequently, she worked towards the creation of a lodge at the Princess Margaret Hospital, a facility specialising in cancer treatment. She is also the author of the book Three Cheers for Volunteers (1965, Clarke Irwin). In early 1954, Ontario provincial law was changed to permit Frankel to become the first woman to join the Board of Governors for the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. The Ruth Hartman Frankel Humanitarian Award was established by the society to honour those who have supported research into cancer. Isadore Sharp was the first recipient on 25 September 1983 for his support for Terry Fox and subsequent Terry Fox Run campaigns. However, as of May 2006, Internet searches that included the Canadian Cancer Society website have not yet found any cases where this award was presented after 1983.

The Board replaced the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) established in 1957. It has 15 branch offices and representative offices in 6 markets around the world, and its primary mission is to maximise the social and economic contribution that tourism makes to the community of Hong Kong, and consolidate the city's position as a desired destination. In fulfilling this, it works with the Government, travel industry and other partners to market and promote Hong Kong worldwide, improve the range and quality of visitor facilities and tourism service standards, and enhance the experiences of visitors once they have arrived.

The Commissioner for Tourism, who is an government official, holds the capacity as Deputy Chairman of the HKTB. Quality Tourism Services (QTS) scheme Launched in November 1999, the Quality Tourism Services (QTS) Scheme (Traditional Chinese: ÂÑ™Ë≥™ÊóÖÈÅäÊúçÂãô) is an accreditation programme aimed at promoting service excellence among local businesses and assisting customers to identify quality service providers. To qualify, merchant must fulfill stringent criteria and undergo annual assessment. All accredited merchants must display the gold and black QTS sign on their shop windows for recognition. Initially, shops and restaurants were the only 2 categories covered by the QTS scheme. The scheme was extended to visitor accommodations and hair salons in November 2006 and March 2010 respectively. As at March 2010, over 7,200 merchant outlets have been accredited under the QTS scheme. The QTS scheme is one of the most successful consumer protection programmes in Hong Kong. The Intellectual Property Department reported in 2008 that 4,700 outlets had joined its \\"No Fakes Pledge\\" ‚Äì another well-known consumer protection programme in the territory. After the launch of the QTS scheme, the use of membership badges bearing the iconic red junk logos of the former HKTA was discontinued in 2000. The HKTA membership badge was first introduced in 1965. =TV commercial= Starring famous Hong Kong actor/singer/producer Andy Lau, the 2003 commercial was inspired by Lau's 2002 blockbuster movie Infernal Affairs ‚Äì a movie about an undercover cop and a bad cop working for the triads. The core message of the commercial is shops selling genuine goods and providing high standard service should set themselves apart from dishonest merchants by getting the QTS accreditation. The commercial has been aired from time to time till these days. The QTS commercial is often confused with another public service announcement (PSA) promoting quality services which was also fronted by Andy Lau. The PSA was filmed in 2002 by the Information Services Department. There were 5 different versions all featuring rude vs. courteous shop assistants and drivers. Titled \\"Success Starts with Quality Service\\" (ÂÑ™Ë≥™ÊúçÂãô Ëá¥Âãù‰πãÈÅì), the PSA was a huge success as one of Lau's lines, \\"Service like this just isn't good enough in today's standard\\"(‰ªäÊôÇ‰ªäÊó•ÂíÅÂòÖÊúçÂãôÊÖãÂ∫¶Êú™Â§†Êû∂) has become a popular Hong Konger slang used to describe a poor service or a bad tempered person. =VIP offers= Simply by presenting his/her travel document and a copy of QTS promotional leaflet at a participating QTS merchant, visitor could enjoy special privileges ranging from exclusive discount to small gift (e.g. a free silk tee for purchasing a suit at a custom tailor). In addition to displaying the QTS gold and black sign, participating QTS merchants would also display the red VIP Offers sign as recognition. The VIP Offers programme was discontinued on 31 Dec 2008. =Incidents= 3D-GOLD Jewellery () Investigations were launched against one of the 3D-GOLD outlets after 40 customers complained they had been harassed by staff and prevented from leaving the shop. The entire 3D-GOLD chain store was stripped of its QTS status with effect from 1 Dec 2004. This was the first termination in the scheme's history. The original 3D-GOLD Jewellery Holdings got into more controversies with the sudden death of its chairman, delisting from the stock exchange and it was on the verge of liquidation by the end of 2008. In July 2009, the jeweller was officially taken over by Hong Kong Resources Holdings (). The QTS status of the new 3D-GOLD chain was later reinstated after it had passed the assessment. Director of Audit's report The Audit Commission carried out a comprehensive audit on the HKTB in 2006 ‚Äì 07. In the report released in October 2007, an entire section was devoted to the QTS scheme. The commission made 3 recommendations suggesting HKTB should take action to improve the scheme and reduce the number of complaints, explore ways to achieve self-financing and encourage more operators to apply for the QTS Visitor Accommodation Scheme. In response, HKTB committed to create more places in the quality training workshops for merchants and co-operate with the Home Affairs Department to proactively promote QTS Visitor Accommodation Scheme. Bird's nest vendors The QTS status of 3 merchants specialised in bird's nest ‚Äì a Chinese delicacy ‚Äì were terminated on 27 July 2007. The 3 merchants had publicly admitted infringement of another merchant's trademark. Outsourcing In a bid to save HK$2 million annually (US$256,000) in operating costs, HKTB announced on 5 Nov 2010 that the assessment work of QTS merchants has been outsourced to the Productivity Council, while the work to engage merchants to offer discounts for visitors has been outsourced to AQ Communications. The saving will fund extra marketing work for the QTS scheme. As a result, the jobs of 17 permanent and contract staff of the Partnership & Quality Tourism Services Department had been made redundant with immediate effect. Only 5 staff would be retained to monitor the outsourced work. Local media reported that the staff affected were first notified at 3pm on the same day of the announcement and were asked to leave by day's end. They were given compensation in accordance with the local labour laws but were denied internal transfer to other vacant positions within the organisation. A staff had expressed anger at being kept in the dark about the tendering of the outsourced work in a newspaper interview. HKTB Deputy Executive Director Daisy Lam later reiterated to the media at an event launch function that the outsourcing was a result of an organizational review conducted a year ago in 2009. In an interview to local newspapers, Legislator Lee Cheuk-yan questioned about the quality of work after the outsourcing. Lee also concerned that the affected staff will be unable to secure another job as the end of the year nears. Another lawmaker Wong Kwok-hing critisied HKTB for setting a bad example and he feared the private sector may follow suit. Daisy Lam responded to critics that in addition to compensation, those affected may consider a transfer to the two outsourced bodies. Lam was not worried others would follow HKTB's move as other companies should make their own judgment call.

It was popularized by folklorist Ruth Tongue who also coined the terms ‚Äúchime child‚Äù or ‚Äúchime children‚Äù. The idea behind this piece of folklore is that individuals born during certain hours of the day or night gain special abilities - although what these times are seems to be disputed depending on the individual source or location. What abilities being born at these times grant also seem to range dramatically from source to source with talk of everything from being extraordinarily perceptive towards animals to being able to see ghosts. There are claims of these abilities having at one time led to accusations of witchcraft. It is also said that if chime children or other similarly gifted individuals make use of their abilities for selfish reasons rather than for the benefit of others they are to perish ‚Äúmiserably and spiritually‚Äù. Similar myths have been said to exist in various other parts of the world including Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, and China. Prominent Debates =Chime Hours= There is much contention over which hours comprise the chime hours. Some argue that the only true chime hour is twelve a.m., midnight as referenced by Charles Dickens in the first chapter of David Copperfield. This is generally agreed upon by the people of Somerset and Yorkshire. According to those in Somerset and East Anglia, the chime hours often corresponded with the chiming of church bells marking the hours of monastic prayer (Matins) at eight p.m., midnight and four a.m. In an article for the journal Folklore published by The Folklore Society, Grace Hadow and Ruth Anderson suggest the addition of midday to these hours, referring to the chime hours as eight, midnight, four, and midday. Those in Sussex site the chime hours as being three, six, nine, and twelve o‚Äôclock while Ruth Tongue claims these ‚Äúpotent ghostly hours‚Äù to be from Friday at midnight to cockcrow on Saturday morning. =Powers or Abilities Granted= There are a wide array of abilities said to be granted to those born within the chime hours. For example, some claim that these include the ability to see ghosts or spirits and to speak to these ghosts and fairies without risk of coming to any harm. Others claim these abilities include power over black witchcraft, being musically gifted, control over animals, and being able to cure ailing animals and plants. Additionally, ‚Äúchime children‚Äù are believed to be born with the ability to have exclusive access to sensitive information due to others lowering their guards and speaking openly around these individuals. As Thomas Thistleton-Dyer words it, these individuals have access to ‚Äúmuch that is hidden from others‚Äù. Ruth Tongue attempted to compile an official list of abilities that she and her fellow ‚Äúchime children‚Äù were capable of. This consisted of being able ‚Äúto see the dead and the fairies, and speak with them but come to no harm ‚Äì such encounters must never be sought‚Äù, ‚Äúto have immunity from all ill-wishing, as many of the clergy have‚Äù, ‚Äúto love and control all animals ‚Äì so chime children often become herdsmen or veterinary surgeons‚Äù and, ‚Äúto have a knowledge of herbs and a way of healing others‚Äù. Ruth Tongue Ruth Tongue (1898-1981) was the individual to coin the term ‚Äúchime child‚Äù and draw further attention to the myth of the chime hours by claiming to be one of these ‚Äúchime children‚Äù herself. This was not her only claim to fame, as she made a successful living as a folklorist in general. Tongue documented her experiences as a ‚Äúchime child‚Äù in several publications including Somerset Folklore (1965) and The Chime Child, or Somerset Singers (1968), in which she recalls this rhyme about ‚Äúchime children‚Äù that she recalled having recited to her by a local sexton‚Äôs wife as a child: > ‚ÄúThey that be born of a Friday‚Äôs chime > > Be masters of musick and finders of rhyme, > > And every beast will do what they say, > > And every herb that do grow in the clay, > > They do see what they see and hear what they hear, > > But they never do tell in a hundred year‚Äù. While some regard her words and self-proclaimed first-hand experience as law in terms of the chime hours, it has become clear that she did not grow up in Somerset, where she claims to have spent her childhood and obtained much of the folklore that she would later document. Due to this, there are some individuals that question whether or not she may have made some amount of her material up or inaccurately recalled past experiences. As Jacqueline Simpson and Stephen Roud word it in A Dictionary of English Folklore, Tongue‚Äôs many tales in The Chime Child (1968) are ‚Äúbased on very early childhood memories; in Forgotten Folktales she gives only the vaguest hints as to where, when, and from whom she had obtained the stories; any notes she may have made at the time were lost in moves and fires.‚Äù Mentions of the Chime Hours =Literature= *Adam Slater's The Shadowing #2: Skinned *Leon Garfield's Empty Sleeve *Franny Billingsley's, Chime (novel) *Edward Storey's, Almost a Chime Child *Charles Dickens', David Copperfield =Music/Art= *Faster Than Sound - The Chimes Hour *Memotone - Chime Hours References English folklore ","title":"Chime hours"},{"id":"5014552","text":"St. Kitts Music Festival Logo The St. Kitts Music Festival is a festival of popular music held annually in June on the Caribbean islands of St. Kitts.

When the group revisited the county in March 2012, it was brought to the attention of many Anne Arundel County residents, and a crowd of about 500 people showed up and protested against the Westboro Baptist Church. Meade is one of three high schools in Maryland to be protested by the Westboro Baptist Church, the other two being Glen Burnie High School, also in Anne Arundel County, and Walt Whitman High School of Montgomery County.  Past problems  Meade Senior High School's reputation among Anne Arundel County schools was poor as of 2007, with some parents and students in disagreement. This negative reputation stems from events in 2005, when former Principal Joan Valentine was accused of blocking efforts to investigate the beating of a single white student by ten to fifteen black students in January of that year. Near the end of the 2006‚Äì2007 year, during the final day of exams, around twenty students became involved in a physical altercation which resulted in the involvement of police forces from multiple jurisdictions and minor injuries to policemen. A group of parents lodged complaints against the police for roughing up their children. On September 30, 1994, a brawl started that injured three teachers and six students. Media specialist and Senior Class advisor, Don Gobbi, attempted to break up the fight and was punched and thrown to the floor. As he lay in the fetal position students began to kick him. Gobbi was flown by Maryland State Helicopter to Maryland Medical Center shock trauma. Teacher John O'Neill also attempted to break up the fight and was taken to North Arundel Hospital with minor injuries. The third teacher was not hospitalized. Gobbi was released from the hospital later that day and never returned to his position at the school.

Dean was one of the last elite Australian footballers born and bred in the local suburb for which he played. After the fastest rise of any player in VFL/AFL history, Dean's career bridged two eras with the Tigers: the battling years when the club farewelled their old Punt Road Oval, and the beginning of their glory days which began with a move to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Early days Dean started playing the game seriously while studying at Swinburne Technical School, and so determined was he to play in the VFL with Richmond, he eschewed all other sports. After leaving school, Dean joined junior team Richmond Scouts for two years, before trying out with Richmond's fourths team in 1956. The following year, aged 17, Dean completed the most meteoric rise in the history of elite Australian football. Commencing the year in the fourths, Dean was quickly promoted to the thirds (under 19s) to play half a season under ex-Melbourne premiership player Len Dockett. Impressed with Dean's potential, Dockett recommended the youngster for promotion to the reserves team. As Richmond was having a poor finish to the season and were out of contention to play in the finals, the club's selectors decided to blood Dean in the final game of the season against the league leaders Melbourne, at the MCG. Although a number of players have completed the rise from the thirds to the senior team in one year, no player ever matched Dean's feat of coming from the fourths.. (nb. during the AFL era, the under 19 competition was abolished in 1991 and the reserves disbanded after the 1999 season). Despite its record-breaking beginning, Dean's career was slow to take off; he wasn't a team regular until 1961. The following season, he affirmed his improvement by winning selection for Victoria for the first time. A neat, skilful and determined player who could mark well for a small man, Dean was versatile enough to play in defence or attack and occasionally rove. Although he had good goal sense, Dean played his best football in defence where his steadiness and courage stood out in an era noted for its defensive style of play. The Barassi incident Dean's best remembered attribute is his \\"acting\\" ability. Whenever he sensed an opportunity to stage for a free kick, Dean was not averse to diving on the ground or melodramatically throwing his body around, as if the victim of an illegal tackle. This style of play often earned the ire of opposition supporters, but Dean was one of the most loved players among the Tiger fans. Dean's antics led to one of the most famous incidents in the game's history. On 31 August 1963, two weeks before the finals were due to start, the Tigers played the dominant Melbourne team at Richmond's Punt Road Oval. Dean clashed with Ron Barassi in an incident noticed by the umpire, who subsequently reported Barassi for striking Dean. As the most influential player in the game, Barassi was the key to his team's chances in the finals. The consensus was that Dean staged the incident. Melbourne officials attempted to introduce to the case a videotape of the game taken by the television cameras, to demonstrate Barassi's innocence. The tribunal refused to accept the tape and suspended Barassi, a decision that may have cost Melbourne the 1963 premiership. Ironically, during the modern era, videotape is integral to the majority of cases brought before the tribunal, but was not utilised by the game's authorities until 1973. A new era At this point in Dean's career, the publicity generated by the Barassi case equalled any that Richmond received for its playing performances - the club was the competition's chopping block. In the six years since Dean's debut, the Tigers had managed just 18 wins from 108 games. However, an ambitious plan to move Richmond's home games to the neighbouring Melbourne Cricket Ground, overhaul the administration and spend big money on a recruiting campaign, really got underway in 1964. Dean was one of a group of experienced senior players who provided a nucleus around which the club could build its team. He was in outstanding form as the team dramatically climbed the ladder, finishing in fifth place in both 1965 and 1966. Richmond then made the quantum leap to the top of the ladder in 1967. During a high-pressure finals series, Dean provided much-needed leadership and steadiness to a team that contained not a single player with finals experience. Playing in the back pocket, Dean was one of the Tigers' best in a semi final win over Carlton. In the Grand Final, Dean gathered seventeen possessions and took a courageous mark in the dying minutes of the game, slamming into a point post as he hung grimly to the ball. His shrewd play negated the influence of the brilliant Geelong rovers when they rested in the forward pocket. Richmond's first premiership since 1943 was celebrated with great gusto in the inner-Melbourne suburb; the triumph was close to home for Dean, one of the few players in the team who had grown up in the streets of Richmond. He completed his best ever season with a second placing in the club's best and fairest award. Dogged skipper Dean's excellent finals performances helped win him the position of club captain the following year, following the retirement of Freddy Swift. A plumber for all of his working life, Dean epitomised the blue collar, tough-as-teak image that the Richmond club liked to project. For the remainder of Dean's career, he was used in a variety of positions - he handed the back pocket position to another plumber with a similar reputation, Kevin Sheedy. The Tigers disappointed by missing the finals in his first year at the helm but made amends in 1969 when, aged 28, Dean achieved his greatest individual honour by captaining the premiership side. In front of a record 119,165 people, Richmond achieved a rare victory after coming from fourth place (before the finals) to defeat old rival Carlton in a tense Grand Final, Dean playing well on a forward flank. During the presentation ceremony, the diminutive Dean received the cup with his opposition captain John Nicholls next to him on the dais. Dean held the trophy aloft and then ruffled his hand through the hair of the 189 cm Nicholls. This rare act of impudence toward the game's most feared big man summed up the indomitable spirit of Dean and his team. Dean led Richmond into the finals for a second time in 1971, a season when he became the seventh player to pass two hundred games in yellow and black. After the year ended in a defeat to St Kilda in the preliminary final, Dean handed the club captaincy to the brilliant young Tasmanian, Royce Hart. Fitting farewell Now the veteran of the team, Dean held his place during 1972, often playing up forward. However, disaster struck when he broke a leg on the eve of the finals and missed playing in the Grand Final when Richmond crashed to defeat after starting as one of the hottest premiership favourites ever. He found it difficult to get back to form the following year and played less than half the games during the regular season. Dean was included in the team for the semi final win over St Kilda, but he then lost his place and when it came time to pick the Tigers' Grand Final team, it was clear he would miss out due to age and form. As compensation, he was offered the captaincy of the reserves team, also playing in the Grand Final. On 29 September 1973, the Richmond club was aiming for history with all four of its teams in line for a premiership. After the two junior teams were victorious, Dean led the reserves against Geelong in the curtain-raiser before the main game. He went out on a high, captaining the team to victory and was chaired off by his teammates in front of a crowd that was building up to 116 000. The senior team then won the flag to duly complete a clean sweep, an achievement unimaginable when Dean had joined the club as teenager. It was the end of an era in another way ‚Äì Dean was the last player to have played a senior game at the club's Punt Road Oval. Dean's retirement was absolute. He didn't play or coach at a lower level as most ex-league players do, instead opting to play competitive tennis. He remains one of the most popular players to have played for the club. A fitting tribute to Roger Dean was given by Graeme Richmond: \\"Pound for pound he is the best player in my time at the club.\\" After football In 1998 Dean was named on a half- forward flank in the Richmond Team of the Century. He was an inaugural inductee into the Richmond Hall of Fame in 2002, where in 2019 he was elevated to 'Immortal' status.

The stone monument was originally erected at Bibong Peak on Bukhan Mountain. It was subsequently moved to Gyeongbokgung Palace for safekeeping and is now displayed in the National Museum of Korea. The rectangular monument is built on a two-story pedestal. Because the monument was exposed to the elements for 1400 years it has suffered weathering and erosion damage. It is currently 154 centimeters high and 69 centimeters wide. The Bukhansan Monument was rediscovered in 1816 during the reign of Emperor Sunjo by Chusa Kim Jeonghui, a famous calligrapher. The monument is valuable for the historical information inscribed on its surface. There are 12 lines with 32 characters per line in the Haeseoche style of Chinese calligraphy. The inscription praises the Silla King Jinheung's (540-575 CE) territorial expansion into the Han River valley and commemorates the occasion when the king came and inspected the new borders of his realm. The inscription explains why the monument was built, describes the achievements of King Jinheung, and also describes the royal retinue. While the exact date of when the monument was constructed is unclear because the era name is illegible, it is believed that the monument was constructed in 561 CE or 568 CE because the Changnyeongbi Monument and the Hwangchoryeongbi Monument were built on those dates respectively.

It is the only high school in East Aurora Public School District 131.  History  According to \\"The Educational History of Illinois\\", private subscription schools were taught by various teachers on the East Side of Aurora starting in 1834. The first class from East Aurora High School - four girls - graduated in 1867. The first high school was built on Center Street, and torn down in the 1960s. In August 1912, East Aurora High School opened a new, larger building on Jackson Street. The dedication ceremony was attended by the U.S. Commissioner of Education and Illinois Schools Superintendent Francis G. Blair. The total cost of the structure was $225,000, including $25,000 to buy the land. That building is now K.D. Waldo Middle School. The present East Aurora High School campus opened in 1957. The address for East Aurora High School is 500 Tomcat Lane, in Aurora, IL. Additions were made to the new high school sometime after 1989 school year, adding three stories to the East side of the school for math, science and English. Previous to 1989 there were three stories however a new addition was not put on until after 1988. The new addition is now the freshman classrooms, gym and cafeteria. Currently, construction is being done on the west side of the campus, where the Roy E. Davis stadium will replace the original field.  Tomcats nickname  Through the 1920s, the East High teams did not have an official mascot or nickname. The teams were often referred to as the ‚ÄúRed and Blacks\\", ‚ÄúEast Warriors‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúEast High‚Äù. But by 1934, the high school yearbook referred to the football team as the ‚ÄúTomcats‚Äù. By 1945, all the high school teams had adopted the name. An article in the September 30, 1931, East High Auroran hints that the name was in honor of legendary varsity football coach Glen Thompson, who was known more often as ‚ÄúTommy‚Äù. Thompson had come to East Aurora High School in 1925, and proceeded to resurrect the football team. He was a successful basketball and track coach, and his football teams regularly won conference championships. For decades, the high school teams have been known as the Tomcats and nearly all the East Aurora middle and elementary schools use some sort of cat for their logo and nickname.  Academics  There are Honors and Advanced Placement classes offered in one or more of the following subjects: foreign language, math, science, language arts, social studies and fine arts. According to the 2012 Illinois State report card, East Aurora had an average composite ACT score of 16.6 and graduated 60.1 percent of its senior class. The average class size is 22.8 students. East Aurora has not made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act. The staff is 178 teachers, of whom 60 percent hold an advanced degree. Approximately 250 semester courses by eight major departments are taught at East Aurora.  Athletics  East Aurora has 23 athletic teams - 11 for boys and 12 for girls - which compete in the Upstate Eight Conference and Illinois High School Association. East Aurora's mascot is the Tomcat. Teams include football, tennis, badminton, baseball, softball, bowling, cross country, volleyball, track and field, basketball, soccer and cheerleading. The following East Aurora teams have finished in the top four of an IHSA-sponsored state tournament or meet: * Basketball (Boys): 4th Place (1969); 3rd Place (1972) * Basketball (Girls): 4th Place (1982) * Debate: 3rd Place (1966) * Track and Field (Boys): State champions (1898) * Wrestling (Boys): 3rd Place (1964) The rivalry between the East Aurora and West Aurora High School football teams is considered the oldest football rivalry in the state, and the sixth-oldest in the nation. The teams first met on November 18, 1893. East High won the game 28-0. By 1895, the game was drawing 2,000 fans to Hurd's Island, the neutral area of the Fox River where the two teams played. The game was not played in 1894 or 1897, but the teams met twice in 1896 and 1898. Through 1951, the teams traditionally played on Thanksgiving Day. The 1938 Tomcats football team is considered the school's best ever. That year, the team went 9-0, and outscored opponents 188-6. West High was the only team to score against East that year.  Activities  East Aurora offers dozens of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. Activities include art club, book club, card club, chess club, conservation club, computer gaming club, cooking club, drama, film club, Gay-Straight Alliance, guitar club, heavy metal club, key club, literary magazine, mathletes, music club, National Honor Society, photography, Peace Jam, Scholastic Bowl, student council, Speculum (yearbook), The Auroran (school paper), The school also offers a wide spectrum of clubs and organizations, including: Literary Magazine, GSA (Gay Straight Alliance), NHS (National Honor Society), GHS (German Honor Society), Music Club, Art Club, FCCLA and DECA.

Franklin of The Record (Bergen County, N.J.), taken on September 11, 2001. The picture shows three New York City firefighters raising the U.S. flag at Ground Zero of the World Trade Center, following the September 11 attacks. The official names for the photograph used by The Record are Firefighters Raising Flag and Firemen Raising the Flag at Ground Zero. The photo appeared on The Record front page on September 12, 2001. The paper also put it on the Associated Press wire and it appeared on the covers of several newspapers around the world. It has often been compared to the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal during World War II. Photograph Franklin shot the photograph shortly after 5 p.m. with a telephoto lens. At this time, he was standing under a pedestrian walkway across the West Side Highway that connected the center to the World Financial Center, located at the northwest corner of the World Trade Center site. Franklin said the firefighters were about away from him and the debris was beyond that. They were about off the ground. Franklin had hitched a ride on a tug boat across the Hudson River, arriving around noon after the towers had collapsed. He was with photographer James Nachtwey when he saw the firefighters. The firefighters pictured were Brooklyn-based firefighters George Johnson of Rockaway Beach, Dan McWilliams of Long Island (both from Ladder 157), and Billy Eisengrein of Staten Island (Rescue 2). Flag The flag came from the yacht Star of America, owned by Shirley Dreifus and her late husband Spiros E. Kopelakis, which was docked in the yacht basin in the Hudson River at the World Financial Center. McWilliams cut the yardarm off of the yacht with a K12 Saw and then took the flag and its pole from the yacht to an evacuation area on the northwest side of the site. They found a pole about off the ground. Soon after its raising above Ground Zero, the flag disappeared. The city thought it had possession of the flag after the attack, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki signed it, and it flew at the New York City Hall, Yankee Stadium, and on the during its service in the Mideast. When the flag's owner prepared to formally donate the flag, it was discovered that it was not the flag from Ground Zero. There was a size discrepancy, the yacht's flag measured , the flag the city had measured . Dreifus started a website in an effort to get the flag back. A 2013 CNN documentary film, The Flag, directed by filmmakers Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein investigated the mystery of this missing 9/11 icon and discovered video evidence that the flag went missing hours after it was first raised. The original flag has now been recovered. The recovery came as a result of a lead gathered following the airing of the History Channel's Brad Meltzer's Lost History in 2014. A number of scientists have now verified that the flag is authentic, and it was unveiled on Sunday, September 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, on a History Channel special on the flag, America's 9/11 Flag: Rise From the Ashes. Later use White House photo of March 11, 2002, unveiling of Heroes stamp. From left Postmaster General John E. Potter; Firefighters Billy Eisengrein and George Johnson; George W. Bush; U.S. Rep. Gary Ackerman, 5th District, N.Y. (who sponsored the stamp); Firefighter Dan McWilliams; and Record photographer Thomas E. Franklin, who took the photo featured on the stamp Michael Kessel, a Manhattan attorney, suggested to U.S. Representative Gary Ackerman that the photo be used for a stamp, and the \\"Heroes 2001\\" stamp, USA Scott #B2, was unveiled on March 11, 2002, by President George W. Bush, in a ceremony attended by Franklin, Johnson, Eisengrein, and McWilliams. These stamps were semipostals: they had a purchase price (45¬¢) higher than their postage value (34¬¢), with the balance given to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts. A special exception was thus made to the normal requirement by the United States Postal Service that subjects of stamps be deceased. In December 2001, the New York City Fire Department unveiled plans for a statue based on the photograph to be placed at the Brooklyn headquarters. In an effort to be inclusive of all those who had been affected by the tragedy, the statue was to include black, white, and Hispanic firefighters. The change in ethnicity from the actual firefighters, all of whom are white, proved controversial enough that the statue was never built. On November 5, 2007, a bronze monument based on the photograph called To Lift A Nation and depicting three New York firefighters raising the flag over the ruins of the World Trade Center was dedicated at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Park in Emmitsburg, Maryland. From another angle The picture taken by Thomas E. Franklin is not to be confused with another picture of the same event but from a different angle by Ricky Flores for The Journal News. Flores also was able to get near Ground Zero on the day of the attacks and at around the same time that Franklin took his shot, Flores was able to get into a second story of a nearby building and capture the same picture.

Founding  The 1912 Lincoln Giants The Lincoln Giants can trace their origins back to the Nebraska Indians, of Lincoln, Nebraska, from the 1890s. According to Sol White's History of Colored Base Ball, in 1890, the Lincoln Giants were founded as the first colored professional team in the west. In the early 1910s, Jess McMahon, a white promoter, hired Sol White, former manager of the Philadelphia Giants, to put together a club. White signed eventual Hall of Famers John Henry Lloyd, the greatest shortstop in Negro league history, Cyclone Joe Williams, perhaps the greatest pitcher, and slugging catcher Louis Santop, together with pitcher Cannonball Dick Redding, center fielder Spotswood Poles, and catcher/first baseman Bill Pettus. Lloyd took over from White as manager midway through the 1911 season. With their powerful lineup, the Lincolns were the dominant team in African-American baseball in 1911, 1912 and 1913, winning the unofficial eastern championship each of those years. In 1913, with second baseman Grant Johnson joining the club, the Lincolns defeated Rube Foster's Chicago American Giants for the national black championship.  Split and new management  In 1914, McMahon lost control of the Lincoln Giants name, and formed a rival team, the Lincoln Stars, signing away several of the Giants' players. Jim Keenan continued to run the Lincoln Giants. Joe Williams had taken over as manager when Lloyd left for the American Giants after the 1913 season, and Williams would run the club for several years. In 1920, the Lincolns moved from their old home park, Olympic Field (at Fifth Avenue and 136th Street), to the New York Catholic Protectory Oval in the Bronx.  League play  In 1923, Keenan brought the team into the Eastern Colored League (ECL) for its inaugural season; the formerly dominant club performed unexpectedly poorly, finishing with 16 wins and 22 losses for fifth place (out of six teams). Unceremoniously dumping the 38-year-old Williams (who continued his career into the 1930s, first with the Brooklyn Royal Giants, then the Homestead Grays), the Lincolns rebounded to third, winning 31 and losing 25 under new manager Jude Gans. But 1925 saw the team plummet to last place with a dismal 7-39 record. In 1926 Silas Simmons pitched for the Lincoln Giants. For the 1927 season Keenan kept the Lincolns out of the ECL, but rejoined in 1928, only to have the league fold by the beginning of June. The Lincolns' signing of Fats Jenkins, who had been assigned by the league to the Baltimore Black Sox, fanned the flames of dissension among the circuit's owners.  Demise  The Lincoln Giants joined the American Negro League for its only season in 1929, then put together a powerful independent team for 1930 before succumbing to Depression-era economics.

In 2004, it was named one of the top albums from 1989‚Äì1998 in an issue of the music magazine Band Yarouze. Summary Merveilles is the band's only album on a major record label, being released by Nippon Columbia (Midi:Nette went under the \\"Maitrize\\" name for the only time in its history). Its title is French for \\"Wonders\\". This album marked the pinnacle of the band's success, being their best-selling album, charting high on the Oricon charts, and also earned them several national TV appearances. In 1998, the band played live at the Nippon Budokan which involved a large building as a stage prop and elaborate theatrics; each member performing a skit with another on their own (including a skit in which Gackt fell to the stage to sing the song \\"Le Ciel\\", and returned to \\"Heaven\\" by song's [and concert's] end). It was a success and was released on home video as Merveilles l'espace. In July 1998, the Yokohama Arena's stage would be the last for Gackt as in January 1999, at the height of Malice Mizer's success, he left the band in order to pursue a solo career. A few months after his departure, drummer Kami died of a subarachnoid hemorrhage on June 21. But the band continued to exist, as Kami was replaced by a non-official, supporting member, and new vocalist Klaha was recruited. By then the band had abandoned the lighter pop music sound of the Gackt era for a dramatic mixture of Baroque music, gothic, metal and electronic music, and adopted an elaborate funeral Goth look. =Release= The album was released on March 18, 1998, by Columbia. In the fifth counting week of March it reached number two on the Oricon charts, with sales of 169,290 copies, while in the first week of April it charted at number twelve with sales of 41,900 copies. It charted for sixteen weeks. By the end of the year it had sold 307,450 copies, was the 73rd best-selling album of the year. Also, the album singles are the most successful in the band's history. In 1997, \\"Bel Air\\" and \\"Au Revoir\\" were released, both of which reached number forty-two and ten, while the latter was the band's first top ten entry on the charts, and charted for eleven weeks.

He was Chancellor of the Sorbonne from 1263 to 1268, and bishop of Paris from 1268 until his death. He is best remembered for promulgating a Condemnation of 219 philosophical and theological propositions (or articles) that addressed concepts that were being disputed in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris. Life Born in Orl√©ans, Tempier studied in Paris, where he became master of theology and canon of Notre Dame. During a period of about five years (1263‚Äìca. 1268), Tempier was the Chancellor of the chapter of Notre Dame at Paris, succeeding Erich von Veire. At that time, the Chancellor of the Chapter was also the Chancellor of the University of Paris. He served as bishop of Paris from 7 October 1268 until his death on 3 September 1279. Tempier had been a master in the faculty of theology. Condemnations In 1270 Tempier, encouraged by Henry of Ghent (died 1293), had issued a formal condemnation of thirteen doctrines held by \\"radical Aristotelians\\". These included the unity of intellect, causal necessity, and the eternity of the world. Further investigation into perceived errors then prevalent at the university was prompted by the Portuguese cleric Juliani, who was elected Pope John XXI on 13 September 1276. A former professor of theology at the University of Paris, he wrote Tempier on 28 January 1277. The pope told Tempier that he had heard reports of heretical opinions in the Paris area, and requested to be informed of the situation. By this time Tempier was already investigating possible heretical opinions at the University of Paris. On 7 March 1277, Tempier expanded the number of condemned doctrines to 219. He was assisted by a commission of theologians from the University. Henry of Ghent sat on Tempier's episcopal commission (assessores episcopi) of sixteen masters, which produced the syllabus of 219 propositions condemned by Tempier on 7 March 1277. The condemnations against Aristotelianism in Paris involved Giles of Rome, Siger of Brabant, the arts faculty, and certain doctrines of Thomas Aquinas. The forty-ninth item on the list was the assertion that God is incapable of moving the universe because it implies the existence of a void. Tempier also overturned Aristotle on one point: God could have created more than one world (given His omnipotence) yet we know by revelation He made only one. Tempier's stress on God's omnipotence also opened up all kinds of possibilities for the understanding of the cosmos. In his effort to defend the abilities and unique rights of the Creator, Tempier's propositions led to the new approach taken to understand the workings of celestial and terrestrial bodies. By rejecting that astral bodies were animated, incorruptible and eternal, refuting the idea that their motion was the result of something comparable to animal desires and denying that stars had any influence over individuals, he showed that Christians were prepared to refute Aristotle's world view along with some basic assumptions held by Greek learning. It is not clear what Tempier's intentions were in issuing this condemnation. Nevertheless, scholars have written that \\"the Parisian Condemnation of 1277 is symbolic of an intellectual crisis in the University. It is indicative of fundamental shifts in speculative thought and cultural perception which occurred in the late 13th century, which portend aspects of modern thought.\\" Opposition to and repeal Tempier's prohibitions did not curtail the free discussion of Thomist doctrines and did little to limit their influence at the University of Paris. His decree was actively opposed and eventually overturned in 1325.The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space from Dante to the Internet, Margaret Wertheim, W.W.

A promenade along the western bank of the East River between 63rd Street and 125th Street in Manhattan was named the John Finley Walk in 1940 because he had often walked the perimeter of Manhattan. Biography He was born on October 19, 1863 in Grand Ridge, Illinois, the oldest son of James Gibson Finley and Lydia Margaret McCombs. His father and mother went out as early settlers on the prairies from the East. His father was the great-grandson of the Reverend James Finley, the first minister, it is believed, to settle permanently beyond the Allegheny Mountains in Western Pennsylvania, and brother of Dr. Samuel Finley, President of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in the middle of the eighteenth century. Mr. Finley‚Äôs brother, Robert, who died in his early thirties, was associate editor of the Review of Reviews; his sister, Bertha, died as a missionary in Korea. Finley was educated in the public schools of Grand Ridge, Ottawa Township High School, and Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois, receiving the degree of A.B. and A.M., and afterward took up post-graduate work at the Johns Hopkins University. He was valedictorian of his class at Knox and won the interstate prize in oratory in 1887. He was made an honorary member of the Northwestern chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. He was Secretary of the Illinois State Charities Aid Association, 1889‚Äì1892, and President of Knox College, 1892-1899. In the latter year, he went to New York, but after a year in the editorial departments of the publishing houses of Harpers and McClure's, returned to educational work, upon an invitation to take a newly established chair at Princeton University. He was Professor of Polities at Princeton from 1900‚Äì1903, and President of the College of the City of New York from 1903 until 1913, when he was appointed President of the University of the State of New York and Commissioner of Education of the State of New York.

He held that position until Nov. 16, 1938, when because of poor health he took the title of editor emeritus. Finley was president of the American Geographical Society from 1925 to 1934. He remained an honorary president there until his death. His position on the Times placed him in contact with the great explorers and fliers of the day, who signed their names for him on a terrestrial globe, which he presented to the Society in 1929.Wright, John Kirtland 'The New Age of Discovery, Geography in the Making: The American Geographical Society 1851-1951 (1952) pp. 71-111. ‚Äî George Grady Press He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1925-1940.

It is a single-masted ship propelled by oars. In addition to the mast and oars, the lymphad has three flags and a basket. The word comes from the Scottish Gaelic long fhada, meaning a long ship or birlinn. It usually indicates a title associated with islands, such as Lord of the Isles, specifically those on the west coast of Scotland, including the Hebrides - but is not limited to Scottish arms: prominent examples including the coats of arms of New Zealand and New Brunswick. Although the drawing of the lymphad for heraldic design purposes naturally became standardized, there are minor differences. These usually involve the position of the sails and oars and the tincture of the flags. There are other variations as well, such as the tincture of the ship. Additionally, the basket may be afire and a crew may be depicted.

Elihu S. Williams was born near New Carlisle, Ohio, the son of Henry Williams and Elizabeth Pettigrew, both of Virginia. Elihu Williams worked on his father's farm until 16 years of age, receiving education in the winter at public schools. Not satisfied, he demanded of his father to be sent regularly to school. His father told him if he wanted a better education than he was getting at home, to get it himself. With $1.50 in his pocket, Elihu Williams started out in life for himself. He worked among the farmers to earn money to pay his board for a few months, then attended Antioch College to pass examination for a teacher's certificate. He taught school the following winter in Brandt, Ohio. In 1858, he commenced reading law in the office of F. P. Cuppy, Esq., of Dayton, Ohio, continuing to teach in winters until February 1861, when he was admitted to practice of law by the Supreme Court of Ohio. In October 1861, he enlisted as a private in the 71st Ohio Infantry serving for the duration of the Civil War. He was commissioned first lieutenant February 14, 1862. He was in the Battle of Shiloh. He was promoted to captain February 10, 1863. In fall of 1863, he was detailed to the command of the military post at Carthage, Tennessee and remained there until the close of the war. After the war, Capt. Williams remained in Smith County, Tennessee, and engaged in the practice of law. He took an active part in the first convention for the Reconstruction of Tennessee at Nashville. In April 1865, he was commissioned District Attorney for the Sixth Judicial District of Tennessee until the summer of 1867. He resigned to accept the nomination as Republican candidate for the Tennessee House of Representatives, to represent the district of Sumner, Smith and Macon Counties, serving for two years in the Radical Legislature of Tennessee until 1869. He returned to agricultural pursuits at his farm. On May 31, 1866 Elihu Williams married Alice Gordon, daughter of Dr. Wiley B Gordon and Virginia Russwum. They had 2 children; a third child enumerated as son in 1880 may have been adopted. In 1875, he moved his family to Troy, Ohio, where he established partnership with his brother Henry H. Williams in the practice of law. He also became editor of the newspaper, the Buckeye. In 1886, he was elected as a Republican to the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses from Ohio‚Äôs third district. At the end of his congressional terms, he resumed the practice of law at Troy where he died. He is interred in Riverside Cemetery. Sources * Taylor, William A. Ohio in Congress from 1803 to 1901.

Amongst other miraculous events, levitation is alleged to have occurred when Galluzzi rose to view a crucifix of Christ's Passion agonies through supernatural means. Matter notes that Galluzzi's work is based on the spiritual disciplines of Ignatius Loyola, although the seventeenth- century church investigated her for orthodoxy. However, while Galluzzi survived this scrutiny, her mysticism and piety was never recognized through beatification as a Catholic saint, due to Counter-Reformation Catholic rationalist tendencies and sceptical reception of alleged ecstatic visions. It may be instructive to compare her life to her contemporary, Cecilia Ferrazzi (1609‚Äì1684), to whom she bears many similarities and differences. References *E.

The mosque has ornate designs and is decorated with motifs of blue stars. It was built in the first half of the 19th century by Mirza Golam Pir (Mirza Ahmed Jan). Architecture Built in the Mughal style by Mirza Ghulam in the late 18th century, this mosque was originally a simple rectangular mosque, measuring 33' x 11' with three doorways on the east fa√ßade (main fa√ßade) and one on the north wall and another on the south wall. Three domes crowned the mosque, the central one being the larger. Towers accented the corners and the fa√ßades displayed plastered panel decoration. In early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari financed its renovation when a front verandah was added. The surface was redone in 'Chini Tikri', a popular broken china decoration. The mosque is one of the very few examples of exclusive chinitikri mosaic, found in the striking blue star mosaic, which gave the mosque its name Star Mosque. In 1987, the prayer hall was extended by the Department of Architecture to include two more domes. It was decorated with imported china clay tiles and used both methods of applying chinitikri and used solid colour, cur clay tiles and formed patterns by placing the coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior are covered with different coloured star shaped china clay tiles. The upper portion of the eastern fa√ßade also incorporates a crescent motif. The work assumed another texture by using assorted glazed tiles on the interior. The three mihrabs and the doorways are decorated with mosaic floral pattern. A plant and vase motif is repeated as a decorative element on the pendentive and the interior of the verandah wall. =Exterior decoration= In early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari, a local businessman, financed the renovation of the mosque and added a new eastern verandah. The surface was redecorated with Chinitikri work (mosaic work of broken China porcelain pieces), a decorative style that was popular during the 1930s. The mosque, which previously lacked any historical significance, is one of the few remaining architectural example of the Chinitikri (Chinese pieces) method of mosaic decoration. This decorative technique is found in the striking star motif that is in part the reason for the mosque's current acclaim and popular name, Star Mosque or Sitara Masjid. In 1987, the Ministry of Religious Affairs commissioned Giasul Huque and Zahiruddin to make additions to the prayer hall, which was extended to include two more domes. The mosque is decorated with Japanese and English china clay tiles and used both methods of the Chinitikri application. One approach uses solid colour, cut clay tiles and form patterns through the placement of these coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior surface are covered with different coloured star shaped China clay tiles. The upper portion of the eastern fa√ßade also incorporates a crescent motif. =Interior decoration= Interior of the mosque Chinitikri tile work assumes another texture by using assorted pieces of different designs of glazed tiles on the interior surfaces of the mosque. The three mihrabs and the doorways are decorated with mosaic floral pattern. A plant and vase motif is repeated as a decorative element on the pendentives as well as on the interior of the verandah wall. As a decorative element, the Japanese Fujiyama motif, is found on the surface between the doors.

Biography Louis Hauge Jr. was born on December 12, 1924 in Ada, Minnesota. He was active in all athletics, but left high school after his first year and worked in a canning factory in Ada, where he became assistant foreman. He later was employed by a ship yard in Tacoma, Washington as a painter.\\"Corporal Louis James Hauge Jr.\\", Who's Who in Marine Corps History. He was inducted into the Marine Corps Reserve on April 23, 1943 and completed light-machine gun school at Camp Elliott, California before serving with the 1st Marine Division at New Caledonia and New Guinea. Later, he saw combat action on Peleliu as a message runner with Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines. In this capacity, he distinguished himself for his bravery under fire and was given a meritorious promotion to corporal. Corporal Hauge was killed in action on May 14, 1945, while serving on Okinawa as a member of the 1st Marine Division. For his heroic actions on that day, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. At the time of his death, Cpl Hauge was squad leader of a machine gun squad in Southern Okinawa engaged in an assault against a heavily fortified Japanese hill. It was during the evening that the left flank of Company C, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, was pinned down by a barrage of mortar and machine gun fire. The enemy was pouring enfilade fire into the ranks of the Marines. Quickly spotting the two guns responsible for the damage, Cpl Hauge boldly rushed across an open area, heaving hand grenades as he ran. Wounded before he reached the first gun, he nevertheless continued his one-man assault and completely destroyed the position. Without stopping, he pushed forward and attacked the second gun with grenades and demolished it before falling from the deadly fire of the Japanese snipers. Inspired by his actions, his company rose from their besieged position and pressed home the attack. The award was presented to his father on June 14, 1946 by Col Norman E. True, USMC, who represented the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Corporal Hauge's remains were eventually returned to the United States and interred in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to CORPORAL LOUIS J. HAUGE JR. UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Leader of a Machine-Gun Squad serving with Company C, First Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ry≈´ky≈´ Chain on 14 May 1945. Alert and aggressive during a determined assault against a strongly fortified Japanese Hill position, Corporal Hauge boldly took the initiative when his company's left flank was pinned down under a heavy machine-gun and mortar barrage with resultant severe casualties and, quickly locating the two machine guns which were delivering the uninterrupted stream of enfilade fire, ordered his squad to maintain a covering barrage as he rushed across an exposed area toward the furiously blazing enemy weapons. Although painfully wounded as he charged the first machine-gun, he launched a vigorous single-handed grenade attack, destroyed the entire hostile gun position and moved relentlessly forward toward the other emplacement despite his wounds and the increasingly heavy Japanese fire. Undaunted by the savage opposition, he again hurled his deadly grenades with unerring aim and succeeded in demolishing the second enemy gun before he fell under the slashing fury of Japanese sniper fire. By his ready grasp of the critical situation and his heroic one-man assault tactics, Corporal Hauge had eliminated two strategically placed enemy weapons, thereby releasing the besieged troops from an overwhelming volume of hostile fire and enabling his company to advance. His indomitable fighting spirit and decisive valor in the face of almost certain death reflect the highest credit upon Corporal Hauge and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.Louis J. Hauge Medal of Honor citation, Marines Awarded the Medal of Honor. /S/HARRY S.

The Welch family appealed the decision to the county school board, which upheld the suspension after a 2014 hearing. The Maryland State Board of Education also ruled to uphold the suspension. The suspension was again upheld in county circuit court in 2016, with an 11-page ruling that cited \\"the student‚Äôs past history of escalating behavioral issues\\" and confirmed that \\"a suspension was appropriately used as a corrective tool\\". Shortly after this ruling, the parents' suit was closed by mediation in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals with an \\"undisclosed settlement\\".

The bridge was originally named the Ambridge-Woodlawn Bridge but was soon renamed Ambridge-Aliquippa when Woodland was eclipsed by the rapid expansion of the Aliquippa Works of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Company. Ambridge was incorporated in 1910 - named after the American Bridge Company which had significant operations along the Ohio River opposite the Jones & Laughlin Steel Company. The need for a bridge was beyond doubt and long overdue as the towns of Ambridge and Woodlawn, which had populations in the hundreds at the turn of the 20th century, exceeded 40,000 by the late 1920s. In September 1924, the plans for a bridge over the Ohio River linking Ambridge and Woodlawn were revived from earlier ones shelved in 1917 by the outbreak of the First World War. A bond issue for $1.5 million was submitted to county voters and passed in November 1924. In January 1925 the county commissioners petitioned the court and the grand jury for authority to build the bridge and later that month made application to congress for authority to bridge the Ohio. Dravo Contracting submitted the low bid of $144,000 to construct four piers completed on August 13, 1926 one month ahead of schedule. The steel was supplied by the Aliquippa Works for $609,000. The American Bridge Company charged $337,500. Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, which later became Conrail and CSX, paid $39,000 for the portion over its tracks. The total cost with approaches was $1.25 million - completed in record time and within estimates. It opened to the public on opened December 28, 1926. While the American Bridge Company constructed dozens bridges throughout the US that year, the last one linking Ambridge and Woodlawn across the Ohio river was likely to have been the shortest distance hauled from factory to construction site. When the Ambridge-Woodlawn Bridge opened to the public that winter, the local paper reported the usual fanfare, commemorations, and even an ‚Äúaerial bombardment‚Äù. The extreme convenience of building a bridge with one end adjacent to a steel plant and the other in the bridge company‚Äôs fabrication yard was duly noted. Local supporters claimed, ‚ÄúOnly the paint had to be brought in‚Äù. Even the gravel and sand for the piers were excavated from the river by the local contractor, Dravo. The Ambridge‚ÄìAliquippa Bridge‚Äôs cantilevered trusses are made from riveted steel, a design favored from the 1920s through the 1970s for crossings with 600 to 1,400 foot main spans. In addition to the Ohio River and two railways, the bridge crosses two main highways making the full length 1,908 feet excluding the end spans. Thousands of bridges very similar were built across the US during that time, especially in the eastern US. Contemporaries constructed by the American Bridge Company include the Louisville Municipal Bridge in 1929 with an 820-foot main span, the Huey P. Long Bridge in New Orleans built in 1935 with a 790-foot main span, and the East Bay Bridge of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge built in 1937 with a 1,400 foot main span. The first Carquinez Strait Bridge in Vallejo, CA, built in 1927, was a back-to-back 1,100 foot cantilevered truss.

His mother, Lyuba Feodorov, a woman of Greek descent, raised him as a single mother after his father's early death. Although she attempted to raise her son as a devout member of the Russian Orthodox Church, she simultaneously encouraged him to read the popular novelists of the day. He later recalled, \\"So I began to devour the best known French novelists of the day, Zola, Hugo, Maupassant, and Dumas. I became acquainted with the Italian Renaissance and its corrupt literature, Boccaccio and Ariosto. My head came to be like a sewer into which the foulest muck was emptied.\\"Fr. Paul Mailleux, S.J., Exarch Leonid Feodorov: Bridgbuilder between Rome and Moscow, 1964. Pages 8-9. After his graduation from the Second Imperial Gymnasium in 1901, he enrolled in the Orthodox Ecclesiastical Academy in order to study for the priesthood in the Russian Orthodox Church. After much soul-searching, he left his studies at the Petersburg Spiritual Academy academy in the summer of 1902 and traveled to Rome by way of Austrian-ruled Lviv, where Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church blessed his mission. Conversion and ordination On 31 July 1902, Feodorov was formally received into the Catholic Church at the Church of the Ges√π in Rome. In the aftermath, he began studying at the Jesuit seminary at Anagni under the pseudonym of \\"Leonidas Pierre,\\" which was meant to keep the Tsar's secret police, or Okhrana, off his trail. Although Leonid had originally promised to adopt the Latin Rite, while studying in the Jesuit seminary at Anagni, Leonid came to believe that it was his duty to remain faithful to the liturgy and customs of the Christian East. With the full permission and encouragement of Pope Pius X, Leonid transferred to the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church. As a result of his decision, Leonid was disowned by his former Jesuit mentor and afterwards depended for his finances on Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky of Lviv. On March 25, 1911, he received ordination in Bosnia as a Byzantine rite priest.Arduino, Fabio. \\"Beato Leonida (Leonid) Federov\\", Santi e Beati, December 29, 2011 He spent the following years as a Studite hieromonk in Bosnia and Ukraine and was tonsured with monastic name 'Leontiy' on 12 March 1913. Return to Russia On the eve of the First World War, he returned to Saint Petersburg whereupon he was immediately exiled to Tobolsk in Siberia as a potential threat to the Tsar's government which held Russian Orthodoxy as its state religion. After the February Revolution, the Provisional Government ordered the release of all political prisoners. Pope Benedict XV named him Exarch of Russian Catholics of Byzantine rite. A three-day Synod of the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church opened in Saint Petersburg under the leadership of Metropolitan Andrey. He served as abbot in the Church of the Descent of the Holy Spirit in Petrograd, under his leadership the women's order of the Holy Family, the Community of Sisters of the Holy Spirit, and the Society of John Chrysostom were founded. He made presentations, participated in disputes with Orthodox clergy. The Cieplak Trial Open persecution of religion began in 1922. The clergy were forbidden to preach religion to anyone under eighteen years of age. Then, all sacred objects were ordered to be seized for \\"famine relief\\" and lay councils called dvatsatkii were installed in each parish by the GPU with the intention of making the priest a mere employee. When both the Exarch Leonid and the Latin Rite Archbishop Jan Cieplak refused to permit this, all Catholic parishes were forcibly closed by the State. In the spring of 1923, Exarch Leonid, Archbishop Cieplak, Monsignor Konstanty Budkiewicz, and fourteen other Catholic priests and one layman were summoned to Moscow trial before the revolutionary tribunal for counter-revolutionary activities. According to Father Christopher L. Zugger, > The Bolsheviks had already orchestrated several 'show trials.' The Cheka had > staged the 'Trial of the St. Petersburg Combat Organization'; its successor, > the new GPU, the 'Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries.' In these and > other such farces, defendants were inevitably sentenced to death or to long > prison terms in the north. The Cieplak show trial is a prime example of > Bolshevik revolutionary justice at this time. Normal judicial procedures did > not restrict revolutionary tribunals at all; in fact, the prosecutor N.V. > Krylenko, stated that the courts could trample upon the rights of classes > other than the proletariat.

New York Herald correspondent Francis McCullagh, who was present at the trial, later described its fourth day as follows: Unlike the other defendants, Exarch Leonid insisted on acting as his own attorney, which led to some of the most dramatic moments of the trial. According to Father Zugger, > Dressed in the traditional Russian black cassock, with his long hair a beard > often described as 'Christ-like', Feodorov was a man of the narod, of the > ordinary Russian people for whom the Revolution had been fought.

Page 186. With the verdict and sentences already decided upon in advance, Archbishop Cieplak and Monsignor Budkiewicz were both sentenced to death. Exarch Leonid and all the other defendants were sentenced to the term of ten years imprisonment. The Gulag The international uproar which followed the trial gave the Soviet government pause, however. In 1926, after serving the first three years of his sentence in Moscow's Butyrka prison, Exarch Leonid was transported to Solovki prison camp, located in a former island monastery in the White Sea. He was a pioneer of ecumenism together with the Orthodox with whom he shared the harsh captivity. In Solovki, Roman Catholic Mass was offered in a chapel which had been restored for the purpose with the permission of the guards. Exarch Leonid would offer the Divine Liturgy of the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church every other Sunday. When the camp authorities cracked down on this in 1929, the Masses continued in secret. Release and death On 6 August 1929, Exarch Leonid was released to the town of Pinega in the Arkhangelsk Oblast and put to work making charcoal. After continuing to teach the Catechism to young boys, he was transferred to the village of Poltava, 15 km from Kotlas (not to be confused with the city of Poltava, Ukraine), where he completed his sentence in 1932. He chose to reside in Kirov, Kirov Oblast, where, worn out by the rigours of his imprisonment, he died on 7 March 1935. Legacy On 27 June 2001, Exarch Leonid Feodorov was beatified by Pope John Paul II. He remains deeply venerated among Russian Catholics. Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church said, \\"We expect that the exarch [Leonid Feodoriv] is on the road to glorification through beatification. Of course, it is much too early to talk about this, but all of us were strongly impressed by his holiness, strengthened by the crown of martyrdom and death; this certainly supports our expectations. On the other hand, as a Russian Catholic, as exarch, as someone who died at the hands of the Bolsheviks, it seems to us that he will be right in the center of attention of the entire Church.\\" See also References External links *Biography *Life of Blessed Leonid Feodorov *An \\"Insight\\" episode based on Leonid Feodorov, portrayed by Steve Forrest Eastern Catholic monks Eastern Catholic beatified people 1879 births 1935 deaths People from Saint Petersburg Converts to Eastern Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy Russian beatified people Former Russian Orthodox Christians Russian Greek- Catholics Russian people of Greek descent Russian Eastern Catholics Prisoners and detainees of the Soviet Union 20th- century Roman Catholic martyrs Studite Brethren Beatifications by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Leonid Feodorov"},{"id":"5014974","text":"Eden College is a private secondary school located in Quatre Bornes, Mauritius.

She was appointed Auditor-General in December 2001 and refused to leave the office after the Constitutional Court ruled that her nomination was unlawful. She once again refused to give her office up when she reached her pension age and the Council of State ruled that she could no longer stay in the office. Her refusal to leave the office triggered fierce conflicts within the State Audit Office as some of its officials demanded her to respect the law and filed lawsuits against her. The Administrative Court eventually decided in October 2010 that she must vacate office. Jaruvan is known for her public criticism of deposed premier Thaksin Shinawatra. She has also been criticized for nepotism and lack of transparency, hiring her own son as a personal secretary using the state budget, bringing her children on a state- funded official trip, etc. In November 2015, the Criminal Court sentenced her to imprisonment for corruption in office. Early life and education Jaruvan was the oldest girl in a family of eight children. She converted to Protestant as a teenager. After attaining a bachelor's degree from the commerce and accountancy faculty at Chulalongkorn University she worked as an auditor. She is married and has three children. She graduated with an MBA from Michigan State University on Thai government scholarship. Upon returning to Thailand, she joined the Thai Office of the Auditor-General. Career as Government Auditor In her auditing and accounting career, Jaruvan served as secretary- general and then vice chairman of the Institute of Internal Auditors of Thailand. She was also an auditing board member of the Civil Service Commission. She was also a member of the State Audit Commission (SAC, Thai: ‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à‡πÄ‡∏á‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ú‡πà‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô) and Deputy Auditor General in the Office of the Auditor General. Appointment as Auditor-General Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on July 3, 2001, the SAC Chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. For his decision, SAC Chairman Panya Tantiyavarong was later found by the Criminal Court to be guilty of malfeasance and was sentenced to serve three years in jail. Jaruwan was appointed auditor-general on December 31, 2001 for a term of 5 years. She was responsible for carrying out all audit for government agencies. The questionable nature of her appointment would make her term a controversial one. Constitution Court ruling and subsequent controversy On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its ruling on the constitutionality of Jaruvan‚Äôs appointment by the Senate. The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Khunying Jaruvan as auditor-general was unconstitutional. The court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post. However, when the Constitutional Court ruled on July 4, 2002 that the then Election Commission chairman Sirin Thoopklam's election to the body was unconstitutional, the President of the Court noted \\"When the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post\\". However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted \\"\\"I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision.\\" The commission had suspended her salary and position allowance one day after the Constitution Court ruling. The commission then told Khunying Jaruvan to hand over her duties and any state property to the Office of the Auditor-General. =Replacements appointed= The SAC appointed Puangrat Vongpo, her deputy, as acting auditor-general on July 8. When Puangrat retired on Sept 30, 2004, the commission appointed Jerarat Noppawong na Ayutthaya as acting auditor-general, effective from Oct 1. The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, for the post of Auditor-General. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC. The appointment of a replacement for Jaruvan was strongly criticized by the powerful Wang Nam Yen faction of the Thai Rak Thai party, especially by MP Pramuan Ruchanaseree and faction leader Sanoh Thienthong. In late 2005, the issue came close to breaking the Wang Nam Yen-faction from the TRT. The controversy led many to reinterpret the political role of the King in Thailand's constitutional monarchy. =Protesting against the Thaksin government= While her status as Auditor-General was still in contention, Jaruvan joined the Democrat Party and the People's Alliance for Democracy in petitioning the King to replace Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister. However, demands for royal intervention met with much criticism. The King himself, in a speech on 26 April, responded \\"Asking for a Royally appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational\\" =Reinstatement= On 15 February 2006 The State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate Jaruvan as Auditor-General. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the Office of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Principal Private Secretary, advising that the situation be resolved. The SAC concluded by unanimous vote that the royal command that appointed Jaruvan was still in effect, despite the Constitution Court's ruling that her appointment was illegal and unconstitutional. After the 2006 coup A military coup overthrew the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006. The junta abrogated the 1997 constitution and dissolved most state organizations created as a result of that constitution, but spared the Office of the Auditor-General. =Controversy surrounding the first AEC= The junta soon made Jaruvan a member of an Assets Examination Committee, tasked with investigating corruption allegations involving projects approved by the deposed government. Jaruvan threatened to resign from the Committee if its scope was not expanded to include all cases of alleged irregularity, including the personal wealth of former Cabinet ministers as well as \\"policy corruption\\", where policies were approved to allegedly benefit personal interests. Specifically, she wanted the Committee to investigate the sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. Her lobbying was successful: the original AEC was dissolved in less than a week, she was appointed leader of a new 12-member committee with greater powers, including the power to freeze the assets of members of the Thaksin government accused of corruption. The new AEC was also empowered to investigate allegations of tax evasion. The leader of the original AEC, Sawat Chotephanich, was demoted in the new committee; he later resigned, reportedly in protest. The remaining members of the new committee included several figures who had been publicly critical of the Thaksin government, including Kaewsan Atibhoti, Nam Yimyaem, and Sak Korsaengreung. =Results of investigations= FIDF land purchase The AEC received an hour-long weekly spot to produce a reality show publicizing its work. In January 2007, the AEC requested that the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their 772 million baht purchase of four plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on an alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which specified that government officials and their spouses were prohibited from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authorisation. Article 4 of the Act stated that wrongdoers must be direct supervisors of the damaged party - in this case, the FIDF. However, the FIDF is a financial institution under the direct supervision of the Bank of Thailand, which at the time of the transaction Pridiyathorn Devakula was Governor. Pridiyathorn Devakula defended the FIDF transaction, saying that it was transparent. Chanchai Boonritchaisri, a senior director of the central bank's Legal and Litigation Department, also claimed that the FIDF did not view itself as the damaged party, as the land was sold to the Shinawatras at a price higher than its then appraised value (about 700 million baht). The FIDF originally purchased the land from the bankrupt Erawan Trust in 1995 for 2.14 billion; Erawan Trust had seized the land from a defunct borrower for only 103 million baht. Jaruvan countered by complaining to the public about how some state agencies failed to co-operate with the AEC. She also accused claimed that Pridiyathorn violated the law by sitting on the Board of Directors of more than three state enterprises. Pridiyathorn later resigned from the junta- appointed government. The FIDF eventually filed charges against Thaksin and his wife, noting that \\"damage that occurred was not necessarily due to the price received during the auction, but rather technical problems.\\" Jaruvan then sought legal amendments that allowed charges to be filed against public officials by parties who had not been damaged. Other cases The AEC also appointed panels to investigate alleged irregularities in the Thaksin government's 1.4 billion baht rubber seedling project as well as the procurement of CTX 9000 bomb scanners and power supplies for Suvarnabhumi Airport. Criticisms The Rural Doctors Society has been critical of Jaruvan for the lack of transparency of state audits. As a result, Jaruvan demanded that the Ministry of Public Health investigate the Society. An NGO formally criticized her for hiring her son, Kittirat, as her personal secretary while paying him with a state budget of over 30,000 Baht a month. Jaruvan was also accused of taking her two children, Kittirat and Supang, on a government- funded week-long trip to Russia. Royal decorations Jaruvan was appointed to Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao as a Companion (Third Class), which gives her the title of \\"Khunying\\".

For example, a popular open-G tuning is :D-G-D-G-B-D (low to high). An open-G tuning allows a G-major chord to be strummed on all six strings with neither fretting of the left hand nor a capo. Like other open tunings, it allows the eleven major chords besides G major each to be strummed by barring at most one finger on exactly one fret. Open tunings are common in blues and folk music, and they are used in the playing of slide and bottleneck guitars. Repetitive variants for special instruments The seven-string Russian guitar uses the open-G tuning D-G-B-D- G-B-D. Repetitive open-G tunings are used by Russian guitars, Dobro guitars, and banjos. They repeat three open-string notes. The repetitive open-G tuning :D-G-B-D-G-B-D { \\\\clef \\"treble_8\\" \\\\time 3/4 2\\\\. 4 4 4 4 4 **4 4 2\\\\. } is used by the Russian guitar, which has seven strings tuned mostly in triads, in contrast to other guitars, which are tuned mostly in fourths.: : Dobros use a full six-string tuning with a bottom G: G-B-D-G-B-D, low to high. The two lowest strings are, accordingly, tuned three semitones higher for the lowest string (from E up to G) and two semitones higher for the second-lowest string (from A up to B) while the highest string is tuned two semitones lower (from E down to D), relative to standard tuning. Five-string banjo's standard tuning is also an Open G: g-D-G-B-D, where the lower case \\"g\\" denotes the highest-pitched \\"drone string\\", physically located next to (above) the lowest- pitched string, the first upper case \\"D\\".http://opendtuning.com/open-g-tuning- dgdgbd/ Overtones of the fundamental note G Joni Mitchell used the open-G overtones-tuning G-G-D-G-B-D for \\"Electricity\\", \\"For the Roses\\", and \\"Hunter (The Good Samaritan)\\". Zebra's Randy Jackson played \\"Who's Behind The Door?\\" using the same open-G overtones-tuning. The Rolling Stones's Keith Richards plays a five-string 1953 Telecaster in open-G tuning. Keith Richards and Ted Newman Jones developed the first 5 string open G electric later manufactured by Newman Guitars. String set is: 11, 15, 18 plain, 30, 42.

Gordon, chief military correspondent for The New York Times, and Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general, which details the behind-the-scenes decision-making leading to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It then follows, in depth, the invasion itself and the early months of the occupation through summer 2003. The authors had access to a wide range of materials, including many classified documents, and access to the highest levels of the US and Iraqi government and military. They describe in detail the meetings, correspondence, and positions of the various actors, including not only the US and Iraq, but other countries across the world as they considered the implications of joining the \\"Coalition of the Willing\\". A large part of the book is dedicated to describing the internal meetings and perspectives of Iraqi leadership. Predominant among the actors described are the US and Iraqi generals, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and President George W. Bush and their closest staff members. The book reconstructs the principal battles from primary sources including many interviews with both military leadership and front-line soldiers. Also discussed are the failures of US intelligence and the paucity of planning concerning post-war operations. Themes Gordon and Trainor argue broadly that America's Iraq War difficulties came from five major failures: \\"the misreading of the foe\\", \\"the overreliance on technological advancement\\", \\"the failure to adapt to developments on the battlefield\\", \\"the dysfunction of American military structures\\", and \\"the Bush Administration's disdain for nation- building\\".Gordon, Michael R. and Bernard E.

It stars Leslie Howard as Professor Henry Higgins and Wendy Hiller as Eliza Doolittle. The film was a financial and critical success, and won an Oscar for Best Screenplay and three more nominations; Best Picture, Best Actor (Howard) and Best Actress (Hiller). The screenplay later was adapted into the 1956 theatrical musical My Fair Lady, which in turn led to the 1964 film of the same name. Adaptation Scott Sunderland, Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller in Pygmalion The Hungarian producer Gabriel Pascal wished to create a set of films based on Shaw's works, beginning with Pygmalion, and went to see Shaw in person to gain permission to do so. Shaw was reluctant to allow a film adaptation of Pygmalion owing to the low quality of previous film adaptations of his works, but Pascal managed to convince him (on the condition Shaw retained constant personal supervision of the adaptation) and later went on to adapt Major Barbara, Caesar and Cleopatra and Androcles and the Lion. The resulting Pygmalion scenario by Cecil Lewis and W.P. Lipscomb removed exposition unnecessary outside a theatrical context and added new scenes and dialogue by Shaw. Ian Dalrymple, Anatole de Grunwald and Kay Walsh also made uncredited contributions to the screenplay. A long ballroom sequence was added, introducing an entirely new character, Count Aristid Karpathy (seen both here and in the musical My Fair Lady, named as Professor Zoltan Karpathy ‚Äì mentioned in the final scene of the original play, but with no name or onstage appearance), written wholly by Shaw. Against Shaw's wishes, a happy ending was added, with Eliza fleeing Higgins with Freddy but then returning to Higgins's home (though whether permanently or on her own terms is left deliberately ambiguous). Shaw and his fellow writers did, however, retain the controversial line \\"Not bloody likely!\\" from the play's text, making Hiller possibly the first person to utter that swear word in a British film and giving rise to adverts for the film reading \\"Miss Pygmalion? Not ****** likely!\\". Plot While wandering around Covent Garden transcribing bits of conversation from passers-by, the linguist Professor Higgins is mistaken for a policeman, causing protests from the flower girl Eliza Doolittle. The incident is also clarified with the help of Colonel Pickering, also a scholar of languages and dialects, who came from India precisely to meet Higgins. Bragging about Pickering, Higgins argues that by teaching her to speak correctly, Eliza could have a better fate; indeed, he would be able to pass her off as a duchess. The girl then shows up at Higgins' house to take pronunciation lessons. Colonel Pickering then makes a bet with Higgins: he offers to pay all the expenses if the professor manages to make the girl pass for an elegant lady in the space of a few weeks. A first disappointing experiment takes place in the house of Higgins' mother, at a tea, during which the girl scandalizes those present with her speeches even if pronounced with perfect accent. But one of the guests - young Freddy - is fascinated by Eliza. After a tiring internship to which she is subjected by an inflexible Higgins, and during which the young Freddy tries in vain to see her again, Eliza is finally led by Higgins and Pickering to an embassy reception. Here Higgins meets his former pupil, Count Aristid Karpathy, who has become famous and in demand for his ability to recognize the origin of high society people from their way of speaking. Higgins and Pickering fear that Eliza will cheat on him, but she manages to deceive him perfectly and is so successful that she is mistaken for a princess. Returning from the reception, Higgins and Pickering congratulate each other on their success, neglecting the important contribution of Eliza and her commitment. Wounded by the indifference of Higgins, with whom she fell in love, the girl escapes by taking refuge in the home of the professor's mother. Here the teacher and student have a further discussion at the end of which Eliza abandons Higgins and leaves with the young Freddy, threatening to offer herself as assistant to Aristid Karpathy. Back home alone, Professor Higgins destroys some records in a fit of rage and listens to one of the first recordings of Eliza's voice. This is revealed a few moments later in the professor's room, and the film ends (unlike the previous play) with an open and rather hopeful ending. Cast and crew Wendy Hiller was chosen by Shaw to play Eliza Doolittle after she had appeared in stage productions of Pygmalion and Saint Joan ‚Äì though the film's initial credits stated that this movie was introducing her, she had in fact already appeared on film in 1937's Lancashire Luck. Shaw's choice for Higgins had been Charles Laughton. The movie also includes the very first film appearance (brief and uncredited) of Anthony Quayle, as an Italian wigmaker. Cathleen Nesbitt, credited here as Kathleen Nesbitt in the role of 'A Lady,' portrayed Mrs. Higgins in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady 18 years later. The film's crew included David Lean (on his first major editing job; he also directed the montage sequence of Higgins teaching Eliza), set designer Laurence Irving and the camera operator Jack Hildyard (who later did the photography for Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Sound Barrier and Hobson's Choice).

The copyright of the film Pygmalion lapsed in the United States in 1966 after its rights holder, Loew's Incorporated, failed to renew its copyright registration; as such, the film entered the public domain. However, in the 9th Circuit case Russell v. Price (1979), Shaw's estate was able to assert its rights in the underlying work (Shaw's play), and thus retain control over the film's distribution and public performance in the United States as a derivative work.Steven Mitchell Schiffman, ‚ÄúMovies in the Public Domain: A Threatened Species‚Äù.

Washington originally co-anchored the opening segment of CBS3@4 along with main anchors Natasha Brown and Alexandria Hoff until May 2020, when Brown & Hoff were inexplicably removed from their anchor positions on the broadcast. The move came as a result of layoffs that occurred due to corporate restructuring in the wake of both the December 2019 merger of Viacom and the station's parent company CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, however neither Brown nor Hoff were laid off from the station.https://forums.tvnewstalk.net/topic/17763-developing-cbs-layoffs/. Kartalija was added to join Washington in anchoring the broadcast. Washington formerly anchored Eyewitness News This Morning on CBS and The CW Philly with co-anchor Erika Von Tiehl, as well as Talk Philly with Pat Ciarrocchi which aired weekdays at noon until it was reverted to a regular newscast on June 29, 2015, which was then anchored by then-morning anchor Erika von Tiehl. On July 1, 2015, just four days after hosting the final episode of Talk Philly, Washington was named the new co-anchor of Eyewitness News weeknight broadcasts a day after lead anchor Chris May was fired by station management along with then-Chief Meteorologist Kathy Orr & Sports Director Beasley Reese.

It is part of a genus (Goura) of four unique, very large, ground-dwelling pigeons native to the New Guinea region. The bird may be easily recognized by the unique white tips on its crests and by its deep 'whooping' sounds made while calling.VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON ‚Äì Calling and Displaying. YouTube (2012-04-25). Retrieved on 2012-08-23. Its name commemorates the British monarch Queen Victoria. Description The Victoria crowned pigeon is a deep blue-grey colour with a small, black mask. Its feather crest (the signature feature of crowned pigeons other than their size) is conspicuously white- tipped. On the wing coverts is a row of feathers that are a paler blue-gray with maroon tips. These form a distinct wing bar. The chest is a deep purple- maroon color. As in all crowned pigeons, melanism has been observed. The other two crowned pigeons are somewhat superficially similar, but only the western crowned pigeon overlaps in range with the Victoria species. The Scheepmaker's crowned pigeon does not. In the western species, the crown is more scraggly and hair-like, the chest is a uniform blue-gray and not maroon, and a less distinct wing-bar is present. Both sexes are similar.

It is marginally larger than the two other crowned pigeons on average, thus is considered the largest surviving species of pigeon of Earth.

Yale University Press (2001), . Like other crowned pigeons, this species makes a loud clapping sound when it takes flight. The mating calls of this species are also similar to the other two species of crowned pigeons, consisting of a deep hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota sound. When defending their territories, these birds make a resounding whup-up, whup-up, whup-up call. Their contact call is a deep, muffled, and rather human-like ummm or hmmm. The two subspecies of the Victoria crowned pigeon are G. v. beccarii found on the mainland of New Guinea and G. v. victoria, the nominate race, found on the islands of Yapen, Biak and Supiori. The nominate subspecies is markedly smaller, with a wing chord measurement of , with less robust legs and feet and darker overall plumage. The nominate has a sparser crest with black on the wing coverts and right above the tail. Habitat The Victoria crowned pigeon is distributed in the lowland and swamp forests of northern New Guinea and surrounding islands. It usually occurs on areas that were former alluvial plains, including sago forests. Though typically found at or near sea level, occasionally birds of this species may venture up in the hills to an elevation up to about 3,000 feet. They fly from sea to tree every day. Behavior Skeleton Like other crowned pigeons, the Victoria crowned pigeon is a gregarious species. They usually travel in pairs or small parties as they search for food. They walk with an unhurried gait along the forest floor. Their food typically consists of fallen fruit. Birds of this species in captivity are particularly fond of eating figs. Seeds and invertebrates may occasionally supplement the diet. When disturbed, these birds fly straight up into the canopy or a large horizontal branch of a large forest tree. After being disturbed, they may remain on their perch for a considerable time engaging in contact calls and flicking their tails. In the wild, this species tends to be shier than the western crowned pigeon, but can still occasionally be quietly approached. The males regularly engage in aggressive displays to establish dominance. In these interactions, the pigeons puff up their chests and repeatedly raise their wings as if preparing to strike their opponent. They also make short dashes at each other and may actually hit one another, but rarely make contact and can be completely peaceful towards other males outside of the early mating season. Reproduction Breeding peaks late in wet season and in the dry season. When the male displays for the female, he lowers his head down, stretches forward, and then rhythmically swings his head up and down while simultaneously wagging his fanned tail. Although the female does most direct brooding, both parents help raise the young. The female usually lays a single white egg in a well- built tree nest of stems, sticks, and palm leaves. In the weeks before she lays the egg, the male brings nesting material to the female. The egg is incubated around 30 days. The young leave the nest when they are still much smaller than their parents, but are actively tended to for a total of 13 weeks. Status The Victoria crowned pigeon is now the most rarely occurring of the three crowned pigeon species in the wild, although it is the most widely kept species in captivity. Perhaps the most pressing threat to the species is continuing habitat loss due to logging. It now quite uncommon near human habitations because it is heavily hunted around them, particularly in areas where gun possession is prevalent. It can be quite tame and easily shot, though now seems to be fearful of humans in the wild. Most hunting is for its plumes and meat. Trapping of pigeons to be kept alive for captive collections is now illegal, but is still likely to be occurring. The Victoria crowned pigeon is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Types Forums are classified as public or nonpublic. =Public forum= A public forum, also called an open forum, is open to all expression that is protected under the First Amendment. Streets, parks, and sidewalks are considered open to public discourse by tradition and are designated as traditional public forums. The government creates a designated public forum when it intentionally opens a nontraditional forum for public discourse. Limited public forums, such as municipal meeting rooms, are nonpublic forums that have been specifically designated by the government as open to certain groups or topics. Traditional public forums cannot be changed to nonpublic forums by governments. The use of public forums generally cannot be restricted based on the content of the speech expressed by the user. Use can be restricted based on content, however, if the restriction passes a strict scrutiny test for a traditional and designated forum or the reasonableness test for a limited forum. Also, public forums can be restricted as to the time, place and manner of speech. In the 1972 case Grayned v. City of Rockford, the Supreme Court found that \\"The nature of a place, the pattern of its normal activities, dictate the kinds of regulations of time, place, and manner that are reasonable.\\" In determining what is reasonable, the Court stated that \\"[the] crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.\\" Thus, protesters have the right to march in support of a cause, but not on a public beach during the middle of the day with bullhorns. =Nonpublic forums= A nonpublic forum is not specially designated as open to public expression. For example, jails, public schools, and military bases are nonpublic forums (unless declared otherwise by the government). Such forums can be restricted based on the content (i.e., subject matter) of the speech, but not based on viewpoint. Thus, while the government could prohibit speeches related to abortion on a military base, it could not permit an anti- abortion speaker while denying an abortion rights speaker (or vice versa). Regardless of the type of forum, any exclusion must be done on a viewpoint neutral basis. Exclusion based on the speaker‚Äôs viewpoint is unconstitutional. Forum analysis versus government speech doctrine In several important cases, courts have decided that what appeared to be viewpoint-based censorship in a forum was actually the government's tailoring of its own speech, which need not be viewpoint neutral, and that no forum was in fact created. When a governmental entity, such as a public broadcaster, employs the speech of ordinary citizens to further its goals, the government speech doctrine blocks citizens' First Amendment claims that the government set up a forum for them, and unconstitutionally suppressed speech in it. History Prior to the legal development of substantive due process, state governments had the authority to regulate speech in public places without regard to the First Amendment. In the 1895 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case Massachusetts v. Davis, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that \\"For the Legislature absolutely or conditionally to forbid public speaking in a highway or public park is no more an infringement of the rights of a member of the public than for the owner of a private house to forbid it in his house.\\" The Supreme Court unanimously upheld Holmes' opinion in the 1897 appeal Davis v. Massachusetts. However, in 1939, Justice Owen Josephus Roberts stated that \\"use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges [...] of citizens.\\"Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496 (1939). And in 1965, Professor Harry Kalven described such places as a \\"public forum that the citizen can commandeer\\". Usage The 1988 decision in Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier relied on the notion of a public forum in determining the degree to which a public school newspaper that has not been determined as such a forum can be protected by the First Amendment. The Court decided that such newspapers are subject to a lower level of First Amendment protection than independent student newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression.

It is one of the most famous castles in Aosta Valley, and for its architecture and its many towers and battlemented walls has become one of the major tourist attractions of the region. History The castle first appears in a document in 1242 as a property of the Viscounts of Aosta, the . At that time it probably was a simple keep surrounded by walls. From 1320 to 1420, under the lordship of Aymon of Challant and of his son Boniface I of Challant, the castle was expanded to the actual appearance. Under Aymon's lordship the castle got its pentagonal layout, the external boundary wall and many of the towers. In 1392 Boniface of Challant began a second building campaign to build the staircase and the balconies in the inner courtyard and the prison. He also commissioned Piedmontese painter Giacomo Jaquerio to paint frescoes on the chapel and on the inner courtyard. Under Boniface I the castle reached its greatest splendor: it was a rich court surrounded by a vegetable plot, a vineyard and a garden where the lord and his guests could relax. The castle belonged to the lords of Challant until 1716, when Georges-Fran√ßois of Challant had to sell it to Count Baldassarre Castellar of Saluzzo Paesana in order to pay his debts, and for the castle was the beginning of a period of decline. It was turned into a rural dwelling and became a stable and a barn. In 1895 architect Alfredo d'Andrade purchased it and started a restoration campaign to secure the damaged structures. In 1935 a second campaign by De Vecchi and Mesturino completed the restoration and gave the castle the current appearance. The rooms were also provided with wood period furniture. The castle is today owned by the Autonomous Region Aosta Valley, which turned it into a museum. 220px Description The castle is located in the town of F√©nis in the Aosta Valley region, at about 13 km from the city of Aosta. The keep has a pentagonal layout, with towers at the corners. It is surrounded by a double boundary wall with battlements and by a series of watchtowers linked by a walkway. Detail of a fresco of a Wise Man. Walls of the courtyard's balconies. Despite its impressive defensive structure, the castle is situated at the top of a small knoll and not of a promontory or another inaccessible and easily defensible place. In fact it was not built for military purposes, but to serve as a prestigious residence for the Challant family. The inner courtyard, at the centre of the keep, shows a semi-circular stone staircase and wood balconies. At the top of the staircase a 15th-century fresco features Saint George killing the dragon, while the walls of the balconies are decorated with images of sages and prophets and proverbs in old French. The frescoes are attributed to a painter from the school of Jaquerio. The interior of the castle is divided into three floors: on the ground floor it is possible to visit the weaponry, the kitchen, the woodshed and the storage tank to collect rainwater. On the first floor there were the rooms of the lords of the castle, the chapel with frescoes by Giacomo Jaquerio and his school and the court. The second floor, in the attic, was dedicated to the servant's quarter and is not visitable.

They take the form of two oblong pieces of cloth, usually though not invariably white, which are tied to the neck. The word bands is usually plural because they require two similar parts and did not come as one piece of cloth. Those worn by clergy are often called preaching bands, preaching tabs, or Geneva bands; those worn by lawyers are called barrister's bands or, more usually in Ireland and Canada, tabs. Ruffs were popular in the sixteenth century, and remained so until the late 1640s, alongside the more fashionable standing and falling bands. Ruffs, like bands, were sewn to a fairly deep neck-band. They could be either standing or falling ruffs. Standing ruffs were common with legal, and official dress till comparatively late. Falling ruffs were popular circa 1615‚Äì1640s. Origin In the early sixteenth century bands referred to the shirt neck-band under a ruff. For the rest of the century, when ruffs were still worn, and in the seventeenth century, bands referred to all the variations of this neckwear. All bands or collars arose from a standing neck-band of varying heights. They were tied at the throat with band-strings ending in tiny tassels or crochet- covered balls. Bands were adopted in England for legal, official, ecclesiastical, and academical use in the mid-seventeenth century. They varied from those worn by priests (very long, of cambric or linen, and reaching over the chest), to the much shorter ecclesiastical bands of black gauze with white hem showing on the outside. Both were developments of the seventeenth century lay collar. Legal and academic costume Bands varied from small white turn- down collars and ruffs to point lace bands, depending upon fashion, until the mid-seventeenth century, when plain white bands came to be the invariable neck-wear of all judges, serjeants, barristers, students, clergy, and academics. The bands are two strips of bleached holland or similar material, falling down the front from the collar. Plain linen 'falling bands', developed from the falling collar, replaced the ruff about 1640. By 1650 they were universal. Originally in the form of a wide collar, tied with a lace in front, by the 1680s they had diminished to the traditional form of two rectangles of linen tied at the throat. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, a Roman Catholic priest, wearing preaching bands Bands did not become academically significant until they were abandoned as an ordinary lay fashion after the Restoration in 1660. They became identified as specifically applicable to clerical, legal and academic individuals in the early eighteenth century, when they became longer and narrower in form. From the eighteenth century judges and Queen's Counsel took to wearing lace jabots instead of bands at courts and leve√©s. Bands are now worn by judges, Queen's Counsel, (utter) barristers, solicitors, court officials, certain public officials, university officials and less frequently also by graduands (for example, they are compulsory for male Cambridge graduands, and optional for women). These also form part of the full dress of Queen's Counsel, circuit judges, and the Lord Chief Justice. Mourning bands, which have a double pleat running down the middle of each wing or tongue, are still used by barristers. Clergy may also wear bands, which may be of black material, which are also known as Geneva bands. By the end of the seventeenth century Queen's Counsel wore richly laced cravats. From the later part of the eighteenth century they wore bands instead of the cravat as undress. In the eighteenth century a lace fall was often used as an alternative to the bands by judges in full dress. Both falling and standing bands were usually white, lace or lace-edged cambric or silk, but both might be plain. The standing bands, a semi-circular collar, the curved edge standing up round the back of the head. While the straight horizontal edges in front met under the chin and were tied by band-strings, the collar occasionally was worn turned down. It was supported on a wire frame attached to the neck of the doublet behind. The starched collar rested on this. It was usually of linen, but also lawn and lace. They were popular for a quarter of a century. Methodist minister wearing a cassock, vested with a surplice and stole, with preaching bands attached to his clerical collar The soft, unstiffened collar draped over the shoulders of the doublet were called falling-bands. Until the Civil War barristers wore falling bands, also known as a rabat, with about six tabs arranged one upon the other, and having the appearance of ruffs rather than bands. They differed from the bands of the clergy of that period in that they were not poked as the latter were. Lawyers took to modern bands about the middle of the seventeenth century. They continued in ecclesiastical use well into the nineteenth century in the smaller, linen strip or tab form- short-bands. These are retained by some priests of the Church of England, academics, lawyers, and ministers of the Church of Scotland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and the English non-conformist churches . Bands were adopted early in the eighteenth century, by parish clerks and dissenting ministers, as well as by clergymen of the established churches in Europe. The bands were fairly wide, set close together. The outer white edge is the hemmed linen fabric which, being turned over onto itself three times, is opaque. Lutheran pastor wearing preaching tabs while administering confirmation to youth The falling bands, worn 1540s to 1670s, could take three forms. Firstly, a small turned-down collar from a high neck-band, with an inverted v-or pyramidal-shaped spread under the chin and tied by band-strings sometimes visible but usually concealed. They were plain, or lace edged. These were popular 1590 to 1605, especially in military or Puritan circles, reappearing 1620‚Äì1650, when they were usually larger. Secondly, they could take the form of a wide collar, spreading horizontally from side to side across the shoulder, with the band-strings as formerly. These were popular 1630s to 1640s. Thirdly, a deep collar or bib, square-cut, spreading down the chest, the front borders meeting edge to edge flat, or with an inverted box-pleat. The corners were square or frequently rounded after 1660. Broad lace borders were usual. With the band-strings as formerly, these were popular 1640s to 1670s. Relation to neckties The cravat or neckcloth was popular 1665‚Äì1730. It was a large square or triangle of linen, lawn, silk, or muslin, often starched, with the ends usually bordered with lace, or decorated with tasselled beads, and tied loosely beneath the chin. Formal cravats were always plain white, otherwise they could be coloured or patterned. Tying the cravat in a bow was popular circa 1665. Fastening with a cravat-string was popular circa 1671. By 1680‚Äì1690 the cravat was worn falling over a stiffened ornamental cravat-string. 1695‚Äì1700 saw the Steinkirk style, with the front ends twisted and the terminals either passed through a buttonhole or attached with a brooch to one side of the coat. The cravat was popular until the 1740s, and with the elderly thereafter. In the 1840s several types of cravat were in use, the most traditional being a large bow with pointed ends. The variety of neckwear became very much greater in the 1890s. The scarf, formerly known as the kerchief, was also worn. In the 1890s neckties became popular, commonly in a butterfly- or batswing-shape bow. By the 1850s separate, starched, collars were standard, these reaching three inches in height by the 1890s. Until about 1950, apart from short-sleeved, open-necked sports wear, day shirts always had a long sleeve with cuffs, closed by links or buttons, and with a neck-band with separate collar fastened by studs, or an attached collar. The attached collar is now dominant. The result is that bands are rarely used by graduates, who prefer the contemporary down turn collar and neck tie.

Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing a few feet from U.S. President George W. Bush, in front of an audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. Colbert's performance quickly became an Internet and media sensation. Commentators remarked on the humor of Colbert's performance, the political nature of his remarks, and speculated as to whether there was a cover-up by the media in the way the event was reported. James Poniewozik of Time noted that whether or not one liked the speech, it had become a \\"political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006‚Äîlike whether you drive a hybrid or use the term 'freedom fries.  Performance at the dinner  American comedian Stephen Colbert was the featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, held at the Hilton Washington hotel in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 2006. He was invited to speak by Mark Smith, the outgoing president of the White House Press Corps Association. Smith later told reporters that he had not seen much of Colbert's work. Since 1983, the event has featured well-known stand-up comics. Previous performances included President Gerald Ford and Chevy Chase making fun of Ford's alleged clumsiness in 1975, and Ronald Reagan and Rich Little performing together in 1981. Colbert gave his after-dinner remarks in front of an audience described by the Associated Press as a \\"Who's Who of power and celebrity\\". More than 2,500 guests attended the event, including First Lady Laura Bush, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Peter Pace, U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, China's Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong, AOL co-founder Steve Case, model and tennis player Anna Kournikova, and actor George Clooney. Colbert spoke directly to President Bush several times, satirically praising his foreign policy, lifestyle, and beliefs, and referring to his declining approval rating and popular reputation. Colbert spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking \\"If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail.\\" While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted‚Äîlargely unchanged‚Äîfrom The Colbert Report, including parts of the \\"truthiness\\" monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from \\"the gut\\" rather than the brain and denounced books as \\"all fact, no heart\\". Colbert framed this part of the speech as though he were agreeing with Bush's philosophies, saying that he and Bush are \\"not brainiacs on the nerd patrol\\", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an anti-intellectual. Following this introduction to his style and philosophy, Colbert listed a series of absurd \\"beliefs that I live by\\", such as \\"I believe in America. I believe it exists.\\" He alluded to outsourcing to China and satirized the traditional Republican opposition to \\"big government\\" by referencing the Iraq War. \\"I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.\\" Colbert then mocked Bush's sinking approval ratings: U.S. President George W. Bush gives the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72). He continued his mock defense of Bush by satirizing Bush's appearances aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, and in cities devastated by Hurricane Katrina: Colbert ended the monologue specifically directed at Bush by parodying his energy policy. He then used Laura Bush's reading initiative as a springboard to mock-criticize books for being \\"elitist\\", and harshly criticized the White House Press Corps‚Äîhosts of the event‚Äîand the media in general. Addressing the audience, he remarked: Colbert also criticized the White House Press Corps for what was widely perceived as its reluctance to question the administration's policies, particularly in regards to the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying: For the remainder of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: \\"You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is.\\" Colbert received a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although some in the audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in stark contrast to the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue. At the end of his monologue, Colbert introduced what he characterized as an \\"audition\\" video to become the new White House Press Secretary‚ÄîScott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked \\"Eject\\", \\"Gannon\\" (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and \\"Volume\\", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist David Gregory. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas \\"won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq\\". The dispatcher responds with, \\"Hey, why did we invade Iraq?\\" The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clich√©s, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming \\"No!\\" at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006. Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand after his presentation, several of Bush's aides and supporters walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented that the President had \\"that look that he's ready to blow\\". Colbert recalled that \\"not a lot of people laughed in the front row\\" during the speech, and that \\"when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the whole damn room\\"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making. He also noted actor Harry Lennix gave him props afterwards.  Early press coverage and allegations of a media blackout Cable channel C-SPAN broadcast the White House Correspondents' Dinner live, and rebroadcast the event several times in the next 24 hours, but aired a segment that excluded Colbert's speech. The trade journal Editor & Publisher was the first news outlet to report in detail on Colbert's performance, calling it a \\"blistering comedy 'tribute that did not make the Bushes laugh. The reviewer noted that others on the podium were uncomfortable during the speech, \\"perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting‚Äîor too much speaking 'truthiness' to power\\". The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune covered the dinner, but not Colbert's remarks. The wire services Reuters and the Associated Press each devoted three paragraphs to discuss Colbert's routine in their coverage of the event, and The Washington Post mentioned Colbert several times throughout its article. The most extensive print coverage came from USA Today, which dedicated more space to Colbert's performance than to President Bush's skit. The day after the dinner, Howard Kurtz played clips of Colbert's performance on his CNN show Reliable Sources. On the Fox News show Fox & Friends, the hosts mentioned Colbert's performance, criticizing him for going \\"over the line\\". Tucker Carlson, a frequent target of The Colbert Report before and after the event, criticized Colbert as being \\"unfunny\\" on his MSNBC show Tucker. Much of the initial coverage of the event highlighted the difference between the reaction to Bush and Bridges (very positive) and that for Colbert (far more muted). \\"The president killed. He's a tough act to follow‚Äîat all times,\\" said Colbert. On his show, Colbert joked that the unenthusiastic reception was actually \\"very respectful silence\\" and added that the crowd \\"practically carried me out on their shoulders\\" even though he was not ready to leave. On the May 1, 2006, episode of The Daily Show, on which Colbert had formerly been a correspondent, host Jon Stewart called Colbert's performance \\"balls-alicious\\" and stated, \\"We've never been prouder of our Mr. Colbert, and, ah‚Äîholy shit!\\" Lloyd Grove, gossip columnist for the New York Daily News, said that Colbert \\"bombed badly\\", and BET founder Bob Johnson remarked, \\"It was an insider crowd, as insider a crowd as you'll ever have, and [Colbert] didn't do the insider jokes\\". Congressional Quarterly columnist and CBS commentator Craig Crawford found Colbert's performance hilarious, but observed that most other people at the dinner did not find the speech amusing. Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik thought that Colbert's critics missed the point: \\"Colbert wasn't playing to the room, I suspect, but to the wide audience of people who would later watch on the Internet. If anything, he was playing against the room.\\" Poniewozik called the pained, uncomfortable reactions to Colbert's jokes \\"the money shots. They were the whole point.\\" Some commentators, while noting the popularity of Colbert's dinner speech, were critical of the perceived snubbing he was receiving from the press corps, even though he was the featured entertainer for the evening. The Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin, calling it \\"The Colbert Blackout\\", lambasted the traditional media for ignoring Colbert while focusing on the \\"much safer\\" topic of President Bush's routine with Bridges. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now noted that initial coverage ignored Colbert entirely. Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin remarked, \\"It's too hot to handle. [Colbert] was scathing toward Bush and it was absolutely devastating. [The mainstream media doesn't] know how to handle such a pointed and aggressive criticism.\\" Others saw no intentional snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to a question about why The Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, \\"The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then.\\" Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the \\"quick hit\\" for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. \\"It's an easier set up for visual effect\\", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: \\"Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left- wing conspiracy.\\" Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. \\"Apparently I didn't get the memo,\\" he said. In an article published on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media‚Äîitself included‚Äîhad been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism of the president and discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.  Internet popularity  Even though Colbert's performance \\"landed with a thud\\" among the live audience, clips of Colbert at the dinner were an overnight sensation, becoming viral videos that appeared on numerous web sites in several forms. Sites offering the video experienced massive increases in traffic. According to CNET's News.com site, Colbert's speech was \\"one of the Internet's hottest acts\\". Searches for Colbert on Yahoo! were up 5,625 percent. During the days after the speech, there were twice as many Google searches for \\"C-SPAN\\" as for \\"Jennifer Aniston\\"‚Äîan uncommon occurrence‚Äîas well as a surge in Colbert-related searches. Nielsen BuzzMetrics ranked the post of the video clip as the second most popular blog post for all of 2006. Clips of Colbert's comic tribute climbed to the number 1, 2, and 3 spots atop YouTube's \\"Most Viewed\\" video list. The various clips of Colbert's speech had been viewed 2.7 million times in less than 48 hours. In an unprecedented move for the network, C-SPAN demanded that YouTube and iFilm remove unauthorized copies of the video from their sites. Google Video subsequently purchased the exclusive rights to retransmit the video, and it remained at or near the top of Google's most popular videos for the next two weeks. Both Editor and Publisher and Salon, which published extensive and early coverage of the Colbert speech, drew record and near-record numbers of viewers to their web sites. 70,000 articles were posted to blogs about Colbert's roast of Bush on the Thursday after the event, the most of any topic, and \\"Colbert\\" remained the top search term at Technorati for days. Chicago Sun-Times TV critic Doug Elfman credited the Internet with promoting an event that would have otherwise been overlooked, stating that \\"Internet stables for liberals, like the behemoth dailykos.com, began rumbling as soon as the correspondents' dinner was reported in the mainstream press, with scant word of Colbert's combustive address\\". Three weeks after the dinner, audio of Colbert's performance went on sale at the iTunes Music Store and became the No. 1 album purchased, outselling new releases by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Paul Simon. The CEO of Audible.com, which provided the recording sold at iTunes, explained its success by saying, \\"you had to not be there to get it\\". It continued to be a top download at iTunes for the next five months.  Response  Colbert's performance received a variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and the press corps was negative‚Äîboth groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen found that Colbert's jokes were \\"lame and insulting\\" and wrote that Colbert was \\"rude\\" and a \\"bully\\". Politician Steny Hoyer felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper The Hill that \\"[Bush] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect\\". Conservative pundit Mary Matalin called Colbert's performance a \\"predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor\\". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: \\"I somehow doubt that Bush has never heard these criticisms before\\". She added, \\"Comedy can have a political point but it is not political action\\". On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart remarked, tongue in cheek, \\"apparently [Colbert] was under the impression that they'd hired him to do what he does every night on television\\". While comics were expected to tell jokes about the administration, the 2006 dinner was held at a time when the relationship between the administration and the media was under great strain, and the administration was sensitive to criticism. Attorney and columnist Julie Hilden concluded that Colbert's \\"vituperative parody\\" might have been unfair under different circumstances, but noted that Bush's record of controlling bad press created a heightened justification for people to criticize him when they got the chance. Media Matters and Editor & Publisher came to Colbert's defense, calling his detractors hypocrites. They contrasted the critical reaction to Colbert to the praise that many in the press had for a controversial routine that Bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004, where Bush was shown looking for WMDs in the Oval Office and joking, \\"Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere!\\" and \\"Nope, no weapons over there!\\" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Online columnist Heather Mallick wrote, \\"Colbert had the wit and raw courage to do to Bush what Mark Antony did to Brutus, murderer of Caesar. As the American media has self- destructed, it takes Colbert to damn Bush with devastatingly ironic praise.\\" Comedian and eventual Democratic U.S. Senator Al Franken, who performed at similar dinners twice during the Bill Clinton administration, admired what Colbert had done. In its year-end issue, New York magazine described Colbert's performance as one of the most \\"brilliant\\" moments of 2006. Time's James Poniewozik noted that in the \\"days after Stephen Colbert performed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, this has become the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006‚Äîlike whether you drive a hybrid or use the term 'freedom fries. For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association brought back the less controversial Rich Little. Arianna Huffington reported that Colbert told her he had specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for \\"Gutsiest Move\\". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a \\"cultural primary\\", christening it the \\"defining moment\\" of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. Three and a half years after the speech, Frank Rich referenced it again, calling it \\"brilliant\\" and \\"good for the country\\", while columnist Dan Savage referred to it as \\"one of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years\\". The editor of The Realist, Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, \\"rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now.\\"  References   External links  2006 in American politics 2006 in Washington, D.C.

It is a type of ownership right recognized by property law. This legal concept also supports the intent of a candidate not to abandon one's residence due to work or study. The legal residence is protected by this legal concept, as in the case of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's candidacy for Mayor of Chicago. Purpose The concept was originally created to protect the rights of livestock holders that had free ranging animals. Without the recognition of animus revertendi, any animal that strayed away from the owner's property onto public land could be killed and taken without any compensation to the original caretaker. It takes a lot of time and effort to raise and feed a beast. By recognizing that the caretaker has rights, it promotes the care and feeding of animals, especially for human consumption, creates incentive to produce by eliminating the free rider problem. It may also be applied to pets. Requirements Fair notice of animus revertendi must be given, otherwise the right will not be recognized. The honest mistake of another in the absence of any fair notice will allow another party to claim the animal as his own. Types of notice In the absence of prior knowledge of ownership, one or more of these (or other) factors by itself or in combination with another could be used to determine if a reasonable person would have believed animus revertendi existed. *Species - is an animal that is typically domesticated *Location - out of natural habitat *Identifying marks - ex. nametag, branding *etc. See also * Livestock branding External links * Article on livestock branding * Free Roam Grazing Animals Latin legal terminology Property law ","title":"Animus revertendi"},{"id":"5015301","text":"Edward Hastings Chamberlin (May 18, 1899 ‚Äì July 16, 1967) was an American economist. He was born in La Conner, Washington, and died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Chamberlin studied first at the University of Iowa (where he was influenced by Frank H. Knight), then pursued graduate-level studies at the University of Michigan, eventually receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1927. Economics For most of his career Edward Chamberlin taught economics at Harvard (1937‚Äì1967). He made significant contributions to microeconomics, particularly on competition theory and consumer choice, and their connection to prices. Edward Chamberlin coined the term \\"product differentiation\\" to describe how a supplier may be able to charge a greater amount for a product than perfect competition would allow. In 1962 was admitted as corresponding academician to the RACEF.His profile as researcher at the Real Academia de Ciencias Econ√≥micas y Financieras of Spain. His most significant contribution was the Chamberlinian monopolistic competition theory. Chamberlin published his book The Theory of Monopolistic Competition in 1933, the same year that Joan Robinson published her book on the same topic: The Economics of Imperfect Competition, so these two economists can be regarded as the parents of the modern study of imperfect competition. Chamberlain's book is often compared to Robinson's book The Economics of Imperfect Competition, in which Robinson coined the term \\"monopsony,\\" which is used to describe the buyer converse of a seller monopoly. Monopsony is commonly applied to buyers of labour, where the employer has wage setting power that allows it to exercise Pigouvian exploitation and pay workers less than their marginal productivity. Robinson used monopsony to describe the wage gap between women and men workers of equal productivity.http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rlo/696i/Monopsony_Model_Latex.pdf Chamberlin is also considered one of the first theorists who applied the marginal revenue idea, which is implicit on Cournot's monopoly theory in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Chamberlin is thought to have conducted \\"not only the first market experiment, but also the first economic experiment of any kind,\\" with experiments he used in the classroom to illustrate how prices don't necessarily reach equilibrium. Chamberlin concludes that most market prices are determined by monopolistic and competitive aspects. Chamberlin's theory of monopolistic competition is used by sociologist Harrison White in his \\"markets from networks\\" model of market structure and competition. The works of Chamberlin, Robinson, and other contributors to the Structure- Conduct-Performance Paradigm were heavily discounted by game theorists in the 1960s, but Nobel-Prize winner Paul Krugman and others built the foundations of the New Theory of International Trade by combining such theories of industrial structure with production functions that assumed significant economies of scale and scope.

There was a peak of bloodshed in the mid-1990s and then a gradual subsiding of the conflict. Violence was renewed beginning with the offensive by the Uganda People's Defence Force in 2002. For a seven-year period beginning in 1987, the Lord's Resistance Army was a minor rebel group along the periphery of Uganda. However, two weeks after Museveni delivered his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, LRA fighters were reported to have crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the Khartoum government.O'Kadameri, Billie. \\"LRA / Government negotiations 1993-94\\" in Okello Lucima, ed., Accord magazine: Protracted conflict, elusive peace: Initiatives to end the violence in northern Uganda , 2002. The end of the Bigombe peace initiatives marks a fundamental shift in the character of the Lord's Resistance Army, which is estimated to have consisted of 3,000 to 4,000 combatants at this time.Gersony, Robert. The Anguish of Northern Uganda: Results of a Field-based Assessment of the Civil Conflicts in Northern Uganda (PDF), US Embassy Kampala, March 1997, p. 40 This is the turning point at which the LRA becomes essentially the organization that operates today. Sudanese support expands the scale of the conflict Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting in the civil war in the south of the country. Prior to this support, the LRA could be treated as a minor irritant in the outskirts of the country; now it also had to be considered a proxy force of the Khartoum government. Sudanese support allowed the LRA to increase the intensity of its operations beyond the level at which it was previously capable.Ogenga Otunnu, \\"Causes and consequences of the war in Acholiland\\", in Okello, 2002. Not only was a safe haven granted from which the LRA could launch attacks into Uganda, but Sudan also gave a large amount of arms, ammunition, land mines and other supplies. In return, the LRA was expected to deny territory to the SPLA and periodically participate in joint operations with the Sudanese army.Behind the Violence: Causes, Consequences and the Search for Solutions to the War in Northern Uganda (PDF), Refugee Law Project of Makerere University, Uganda, February 2004, p. 18. The increased intensity of attacks through proxy forces led Uganda and Sudan to the brink of open hostilities in 1995.Ofcansky, T. \\"Warfare and Instability Along the Sudan-Uganda Border: A Look at the Twentieth Century\\" in Spaulding, J. and S. Beswick, eds. White Nile, Black Blood: War, Leadership, and Ethnicity from Khartoum to Kampala. Red Sea Press, Lawrenceville, NJ: 2000, pp. 196-200 Acholi civilians as targets Drawing by a Ugandan child from memory. Translated caption states, \\"Rebels are heading towards Sudan led by Otii Lagony and Lagira. Many people were captured and when one failed to walk was killed.\\" There was also a marked change in how the LRA perceived the conflict. Having become convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength. Mutilations such as those carried out in the wake of the Arrow Group strategy became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people. Other militant groups, such as the West Nile Bank Front, adopted the LRA tactics of abductions and raids. The strategy of forced recruitment was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict, and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the LRA much more easily than adults.Refugee Law Project, p. 20 Furthermore, the LRA no longer had to spend much of its energies in the search for basic supplies now that they were supported by Sudan. The moral rationale was that since the Acholi adults had proven themselves untrustworthy, the LRA must cleanse the land of them and create a new society with the children. This philosophical approach, similar to that taken by the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, has been referred to as \\"auto- genocide.\\"Jackson, P. \\"The March of the Lord's Resistance Army: Greed or Grievance in Northern Uganda?\\" Small Wars and Insurgencies 13, no. 3 (Autumn 2002), p. 43 The attacks on civilians have at least three strategic objectives. First, to deny the government information about its movements by forcing the rural population to flee. Second, to gather resources from the looted villages. Third and most bizarrely, to show the populace that the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection, and thus encourage people to support to the LRA. While the lack of security has certainly embittered many Acholi, this has not translated into support for the LRA forces that are attacking them.Doom, R. and K. Vlassenroot. \\"Kony's message: a new koine? The Lord's Resistance Army in Northern Uganda,\\" African Affairs 98 (390), p. 32 There were numerous incidents that occurred after Sudanese support and are exceptional because of the large number of victims, the identity of the victims, or the circumstances of the incident. On April 22, 1995, Atiak Trading Center in northern Gulu District was attacked and the Local Defense Forces routed. Over the course of the day between 170 and 220 civilians were killed in the absence of resistance from government forces. On March 8, 1996, a civilian convoy of over 20 vehicles with a military escort of 14 soldiers travelling west on the Karuma-Pakwach road was ambushed. Between 50 and 110 civilians were killed, most after the escort had been overcome. Some were executed; others were killed after they refused to exit their buses and explosives were thrown inside. The LRA carried out three separate attacks on July 13 to July 14, 1996 upon a settlement of Sudanese refugees in southern Kitgum (now Pader District) administered by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 100 refugees were killed. In the Lokung/Palabek massacre from January 7 to January 12, 1997, up to 412 civilians were killed in and around the subcounties of Lokung and Palabek in northwest Kitgum. There were no opposing forces and most victims were bludgeoned or hacked to death. The most famous attack of this period were the St. Mary's College/Aboke abductions on October 10, 1996. At about 2 a.m. about 200 armed rebels broke into St. Mary's College in Aboke, northern Apac District, and abducted 139 secondary school girls between 13 and 16 years of age before leaving at about 5 a.m. At 7 a.m., the deputy head mistress of the college, Sister Rachele Fassera, pursued the rebels and negotiated the release of 109 of the girls. Five of the thirty remaining girls died in captivity; all but two eventually made their escape, as of 2006. Government forces have also been the focus of controversy. On August 31, 1995, thirteen civilians, some with their hands tied behind their backs, were killed in a government gunship attack on an LRA column near Lokung, northwest Kitgum. Sixteen LRA combatants were also killed. Critics charged reckless disregard for abductee lives; the government claimed the killings were accidental and unintentional. The military contributed to mob killings in Gulu Town on August 16, 1996. Four LRA suspects were turned over to an Acholi mob that beat them to death. The suspects were under government custody and are reported to have been turned over to the mob in the presence of senior Uganda Fourth Division officers. The deaths of two Acholi elders on 8 June 1996 remains a mystery. Mr. Okot Ogony of Cwero, eastern Gulu, Chairman of the Peace Commission of the Council of Acholi Chiefs, and Mr. Olanya Lacony, a respected elder from Kac-Goma, southwestern Gulu, were found murdered near Cwero in still unexplained circumstances. They were the leaders of a local initiative to restart the peace talks that had collapsed in February 1994 and had the approval of the President of Uganda and an invitation from the LRA. Some blame the LRA, while others point to corrupt National Resistance Army officers. \\"Protected villages\\" created in 1996 The creation of government \\"protected villages\\" beginning in 1996 further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi have toward the government. While many Acholi were already displaced by the conflict, they resented being ordered into camps. A strategy of resettlement, or \\"villagization\\", is a common anti-insurgent technique, used extensively for example by the United States throughout the Indian Wars to isolate Native Americans in reservations. It is intended to free up troops that would otherwise be attempting to defend innumerable small communities and to deny the rebels access to resources. Nevertheless, the population continues to be attacked by the LRA even within the \\"protected camps.\\" The camps are also crowded, unsanitary, and miserable places to live.Dolan, Chris. What do you remember? A rough guide to the war in Northern Uganda 1986-2000 (PDF), COPE Working Paper No. 33, 2000, p. 19, and Weeks, Willard. Pushing the Envelope: Moving Beyond 'Protected Villages' in Northern Uganda (PDF), W. Weeks for UNOCHA Kampala, March 2002, p. 4 A culture of peace and a gradual subsiding The bloodshed in 1995 to 1996 appears to have convinced the population that a negotiated solution was the only acceptable option. This is what one writer calls the emergence of \\"a culture of peace.\\"Weeks, p. 17 As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military solution is widely seen by the Acholi as a massacre of victims. Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi. The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is vital in understanding the current conflict. In response the continued insurgencies by the LRA, as well as other pro-Sudanese rebel factions, the Ugandan government aided \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\" in early 1997, a large-scale offensive by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The SPLA had long fought against the Sudanese government, and was also hostile toward the pro-Sudanese Ugandan rebels. The Ugandan government hoped that it could weaken its enemies by supporting Operation Thunderbolt with tanks, artillery, other ground forces, and supplies. The Ugandan military, along with the SPLA and other allies, consequently attacked LRA bases during this offensive. Though Operation Thunderbolt did not make a tangible impact on the LRA itself, it greatly weakened other Ugandan insurgent factions as well as the Sudanese government. The Sudanese government of the National Islamic Front consequently began to back away from its previous hard-line stance. This also was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the National Islamic Front government. U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan. Over the next several years, Khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the LRA. In 1999 the Carter Center mediated the Nairobi Agreement between Uganda and Sudan, which restored diplomatic relations in 2001.Balam Nyeko and Okello Lucima. \\"Profiles of the parties to the conflict\\" in Okello, 2002. In 2000, the Parliament of Uganda passed the Amnesty Act. This act pardons rebels who give themselves up to the Amnesty Commission and renounce violence. While it did not end the insurgency, it proved effective enough in some of the other regions of the country that had experienced rebellion to be maintained.Weeks, p. 16 The sudden appearance of LRA units in June 2001 who contacted local government officials to discuss the possibility of dialogue created a flurry of speculation that the LRA was tiring of their insurgency. The Uganda People's Defense Force - the renamed NRA - created a demilitarized zone for the talks, a measure that had the implicit approval of President Museveni. The talks were exploratory in nature and the LRA units eventually returned to Sudan. However, analysts believed that they were initiated at the behest of Kony and indicated the most promising diplomatic environment since the collapse of the Bigombe talks in 1994.Afako, Barney. Pursuing Peace in Northern Uganda: Lessons from Peace Initiatives (PDF), May 2003, pp. 6-7 In 1999 Joseph Kony had one of his leading commanders Alex Otti-Lagony executed accusing him of betrayal. The killing appears to have weakened the LRA by depriving it of one of its more effective commanders and spreading paranoia in its ranks. Following the al- Qaeda attacks in 2001 upon the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed. The NIF government was anxious to avoid any blame that may be attached to them for their offering of sanctuary to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden for several years in the 1990s. Also, following the LRA's designation as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department on 5 December 2001, Sudan agreed to stop supplying aid to the LRA.Statement on the Designation of 39 Organizations on the USA PATRIOT Act‚Äôs ‚ÄúTerrorist Exclusion List‚Äù, United States Department of State, 6 December 2001 and Afako, p. 6 Cross-border tensions were dialed down as support to proxy forces fell. The LRA itself appeared settled into their Sudanese base camps and only periodically crossed the border.Refugee Law Project, February 2004, p. 30. Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return to their homes. The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the \\"protected camps\\" would be disbanded.Weeks, p. 36  See also  * Lord's Resistance Army insurgency (2002‚Äì2005)  Notes and references  = Works cited =  Lord's Resistance Army ar:ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸáŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàÿØÿßŸÜŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÜŸäÿ©#ÿ¨Ÿäÿ¥ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ® ŸÑŸÑŸÖŸÇÿßŸàŸÖÿ© (1994-2002) ","title":"Lord's Resistance Army insurgency (1994‚Äì2002)"},{"id":"5015309","text":"Pelindaba Nuclear Research Centre, Gate 3 The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) was established as a public company by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 and is wholly owned by the State. The name is correctly indicated above, although the sequence of letters in the acronym may be taken as suggesting that the name should be the \\"Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa\\".See the 'About us' page on Necsa's website. While the correct name is usually used on its website, there is one instance where the incorrect name, \\"Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa\\", is used on the site. Elsewhere on the web, Necsa's incorrect name is often used. Operations Necsa replaced the country's Atomic Energy Corporation. Apart from several ancillary functions, the main functions of Necsa are to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and related technologies; to process and store nuclear material and other restricted material; and to co-ordinate with other organisations in matters falling within these spheres. Apart from its main operations at Pelindaba, Necsa also operates the Vaalputs radioactive waste disposal facility. The Corporation also serves the State's other nuclear institutional obligations. The chief executive officer of Necsa is Mr. Phumzile Tshelane since 1 September 2012. Necsa is organisationally divided into a commercial group, Pelindaba Technology (PT), which conducts business in a variety of products and markets and another group, Pelindaba Nuclear Institute (PNI), which is concerned with statutory functions, R&D;, support and facility operations. Pelindaba Technology (PT) is a portfolio of businesses of which Nuclear Technology Products (NTP) is a division and serves the international markets for radiation-based technology and products. Also, the Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa, Ltd. (UCOR) which operated a facility at Valindaba (known as the 'Y' plant) to produce HEU. Necsa employs some 1,400 people in diverse areas such as physics, engineering, chemistry and electronics. With changes in the country‚Äôs positioning on nuclear involvement and South Africa‚Äôs re-entry into world markets in 1990, a decision was taken to focus the organisation on commercially driven projects. Today, Necsa supplies a wide range of products and services to South African and foreign market sectors with the SAFARI-1 reactor as the cornerstone of the commercial isotope production programme. This research reactor at Pelindaba, SAFARI-1 produces medical isotopes such as Molybdenum-99 which are sold globally by the NTP. The NTP Radioisotopes Group had sales of 1.222 billion ZAR (‚Ç¨75M) in 2016. History The 20 MW research reactor SAFARI-1 was initially used for high level nuclear physics research programmes and was commissioned in 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, amid reduced output due to embargo of international fuel supply, the focus of activities at Pelindaba was on the exploitation of South Africa‚Äôs uranium resources through the successful design, construction and commissioning of commercial uranium hexafluoride, uranium enrichment, and nuclear fuel assembly production facilities. In 1993 focus shifted to commercial operations and over the following years typical output increased back to 20MW. Since 2009 the reactor has operated solely on low enriched uranium fuel. In December 2018 the South African government replaced all members of the Necsa board, giving as reasons failures in its statutory duties, failure to adhere to shareholder instructions, financial mismanagement, remuneration irregularities and failing to restore its radioisotope manufacturing facility on schedule. This included signing Memoranda of Understanding with foreign companies against express instructions of the government.

She wrote a number of books, including a popular guide to American wildflowers. Early life and education Frances Theodora Smith was born in New York in 1861 to Denton Smith, a tea merchant, and Harriet Shelton Smith. She had a sister, Alice Josephine (1859‚Äì1909), who became an artist and later illustrated two of her books. She was educated privately at Miss Comstock‚Äôs School. She is said to have gained her love of botany during summers spent with her grandparents in rural New York state. Her first husband, William Starr Dana, whom she married in 1884, was a naval officer. He died in an 1890 flu epidemic, and six years later she married James Russell Parsons, a politician in the state of New York and later a diplomat. They had a son, Russell and a daughter, Dorothea, who died as a toddler. James himself died in 1902 in an automobile accident in Mexico City. Following James's death, Parsons moved to New York City, where she was an active supporter of the Republican Party as well as the Progressive Party. She served in various official capacities on party committees, and she managed Fiorello H. La Guardia's successful campaign to become president of New York's Board of Aldermen. She was also an advocate of women's suffrage. Career Following the loss of her first husband, Parsons' sought solace in long walks with her friend the illustrator Marion Satterlee. These outings prompted her first and most important botanical work, How to Know the Wild Flowers (1893), which was the first field guide to North American wildflowers. It was something of a sensation, the first printing selling out in five days. How to Know the Wild Flowers garnered favorable responses from Theodore Roosevelt and Rudyard Kipling, among others. The work went through several editions in Parsons's lifetime and has remained in print into the 21st century. It was organized by flower colors and illustrated with 48 full-page color plates by Elsie Louise Shaw (missing from later editions) and 110 full-page black-and-white illustrations by Satterlee. Parsons' second book, According to Season (1894), was a compendium of nature writing that she had previously published in The New York Tribune. Her third book, Plants and Their Children (1896), was intended for children and was listed as one of the 50 best children‚Äôs books of its day. In 1899, Parsons published How to Know the Ferns, a companion to her first guidebook. The writing of this book was largely prompted by her husband's financial difficulties. After her fourth book, Parsons stopped writing for several decades. In 1952, at the age of 90, she published a memoir, Perchance Some Day.

It is also known as the work-product rule, the work-product immunity, and the work-product exception. It is sometimes mistakenly called the work-product privilege. This doctrine does not apply in other countries, where such communications are not protected, but where the legal discovery process itself is much more limited.Craig D. Bell, Thomas E. Spahn, Christopher S. Rizek, \\"A Guide to the Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product Doctrine for Tax Practitioners\\" (2007), p. 11. Doctrine Under the work-product doctrine, \\"tangible material or its intangible equivalent\\" that is collected or prepared in anticipation of litigation is not discoverable.Hickman v. Taylor. =Comparison with attorney‚Äìclient privilege= The work-product doctrine is more inclusive than attorney‚Äìclient privilege. Unlike the attorney‚Äìclient privilege, which includes only communications between an attorney and the client, work product includes materials prepared by persons other than the attorney him/herself: The materials may have been prepared by anybody as long as they were prepared with an eye towards the realistic possibility of impending litigation. Additionally, it includes materials collected for the attorney such as interrogatories, signed statements, other information acquired for the prosecution or defense of a case. Despite its inclusiveness, the work-product doctrine is less powerful than the attorney-client privilege, and therefore may be overcome by a showing of necessity. An example of a possible exception would be a witness being unavailable due to death or living in a remote/hostile nation. Even if an exception to the work-product doctrine is made, the court would still protect privileged actions by an attorney, by redacting the privileged part of the document. \\"Memoranda, briefs, communications ... other writings prepared by counsel for his/her own use in prosecuting the client's case ... mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories\\" are never discoverable by an opposing party. History The work-product doctrine originated in the 1947 case of Hickman v. Taylor, in which the Supreme Court affirmed a United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit decision which excluded from discovery of oral and written statements made by witnesses to a defendant's attorney. The Supreme Court, acting at the recommendation of the Advisory Committee of the Judicial Conference, later enshrined this doctrine formally in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as Rule 26(b)(3).\\"Certain of the Amendments of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States on March 30, 1970, Effective July 1, 1970, With Advisory Committee's Notes Thereon.\\" Reprinted in References External links * Expanding Scope of Attorney-Work-Product Doctrine: United States v.

Testing for the presence of nitrate via wet chemistry is generally difficult compared with testing for other anions, as almost all nitrates are soluble in water. In contrast, many common ions give insoluble salts, e.g. halides precipitate with silver, and sulfate precipitate with barium. The nitrate anion is an oxidizer, and many tests for the nitrate anion are based on this property. Unfortunately, other oxidants present in the analyte may interfere and give erroneous results. Nitrate can also be detected by first reducing it to the more reactive nitrite ion and using one of many nitrite tests. Ring test Nitrate Test by using Brown Ring Test A common nitrate test, known as the brown ring testEgon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier can be performed by adding iron(II) sulfate to a solution of a nitrate, then slowly adding concentrated sulfuric acid such that the acid forms a layer below the aqueous solution. A brown ring will form at the junction of the two layers, indicating the presence of the nitrate ion.Mascetta, Joseph A. Barron's How to Prepare for the SAT II: Chemistry, 7th edition. Barron's Educational Series, Inc., 2002. p208. Note that the presence of nitrite ions will interfere with this test.Holltzclaw, H; Robinson, W. College Chemistry with qualitative analysis, 8th edition, D. C. Heath and Company:Lexington, MA, 1988, p. 1007. The overall reaction is the reduction of the nitrate ion to nitric oxide by iron(II), which is oxidised to iron(III), followed by the formation of a nitrosyl complex between the nitric oxide and the remaining iron(II), where nitric oxide is reduced to NO‚àí. Formerly it was thought that the complex contains Fe(I) and NO+. :2HNO3 \\\\+ 3H2SO4 \\\\+ 6FeSO4 ‚Üí 3Fe2(SO4)3 \\\\+ 2NO + 4H2O :[Fe(H2O)6]SO4 \\\\+ NO ‚Üí [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]SO4 \\\\+ H2O This test is sensitive up to 2.5 micrograms and a concentration of 1 in 25,000 parts.https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/67354/how-to-test-for- lead-and-nitrates-in-water; Nilay Ghosh Devarda's test Devarda's alloy (Copper/Aluminium/Zinc) is a reducing agent. When reacted with nitrate in sodium hydroxide solution, ammonia is liberated. The ammonia formed may be detected by its characteristic odor, and by damp red litmus paper's turning blue, signalling that it is an alkali -- very few gases other than ammonia evolved from wet chemistry are alkaline. :3 + 8 Al + 5 + 18 ‚Üí 3 + 8 Aluminium is the reducing agent in this reaction that will occur. Diphenylamine test Diphenylamine may be used as a wet chemical test for the presence of the nitrate ion. In this test, a solution of diphenylamine and ammonium chloride in sulfuric acid is used. In the presence of nitrates, diphenylamine is oxidized, giving a blue coloration. This reaction has been used to test for organic nitrates as well.,http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/049/jresv49n3p163_A1b.pdf and has found use in gunshot residue kits detecting nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. Copper turnings test The nitrate ion can easily be identified by heating copper turnings along with concentrated sulfuric acid. Brown, pungent effervescence is observed which turns blue litmus red. Here sulphuric acid reacts with the nitrate ion to form nitric acid. Nitric acid then reacts with the copper turnings to form nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is thus oxidised to nitrogen dioxide. : + 4 ‚Üí + 2 +2 See also *Nitrite test References Chemical tests ","title":"Nitrate test"},{"id":"5015484","text":"The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC; ) is a state-owned entity founded in 1955 in Beijing. CNNC's president and vice-president are appointed by the Premier of the People's Republic of China. However, the CNNC is a state-owned corporation, not a government administrative body. It oversees all aspects of China's civilian and military nuclear programs. According to its own mission statement, it \\"is a main part of the national nuclear technology industry and a leading element of national strategic nuclear forces and nuclear energy development.\\" CNNC is a nationwide industrial conglomerate integrating science, technology, industry, and international trade. History The Ministry of Nuclear Industry built China's first atom bomb, hydrogen bomb and nuclear submarine. It functioned as a government bureau for the national nuclear industry and reported directly to the State Council. It oversaw China's nuclear-related corporations, manufacturers, institutions, research institutes, and plants, including those related to nuclear weapons. It was responsible for the design and operation of nuclear power plants; nuclear fuel production and supply, including the processing of natural uranium, uranium conversion and enrichment, fuel assembly fabrication, spent fuel reprocessing, and nuclear waste disposal. In 1988 the Ministry of Nuclear Industry was re-organised and became the CNNC. The corporatization was partly carried out to gain funds from outside of the government via exports. In the mid 1990s, CNNC had 300,000 employees and managed 200 organisations. Kang Rixin, a senior general manager is currently being investigated (as of August 10, 2009) for $260 million that was earmarked for the construction of three nuclear plants and allegedly used the funds for the stock market sustaining heavy losses. He is also accused of accepting bribes from a foreign company that intended to build nuclear power stations in China.China‚Äôs Rapid Reactor Expansion Raises Concerns KEITH BRADSHER, Published: December 15, 2009 CNNC has 100,000 employees and 110 subsidiaries. It has 4 nuclear power plants with 9 reactors in operation with a generation capacity of 6.5 GWe, with a further 12 reactors under construction. In June 2015, CNNC announced it would aim to raise 13.19 billion Chinese yuan in an initial public offering, that if successful, would be the largest in China in almost four years previously.https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/01/us-china-national- nuclear-ipo-idUSKBN0OH13B20150601 , China National Nuclear aims to raise $2.13 billion in largest IPO since 2011, Reuters, 31 May 2015 In September 2015, CNNC signed a memorandum of understanding with Bill Gates-backed TerraPower for the construction of a traveling wave reactor. In September, CNNC announced a project with the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory to create the Joint Research and Innovation Centre. The centre will investigate aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. The UK and China will jointly fund the project over five years at the cost of ¬£50 million. As of 2017, CNNC was developing a 400 MWth heat-only reactor for district heating. In 2018, CNNC took over nuclear power plant builder China Nuclear Engineering & Construction Corp. Reactor designs =Pressurized water reactors= The CNP-300 pressurized water reactor was the first reactor design developed domestically in China. The first unit began operation at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in 1991. A larger version of the reactor, the CNP-600, was installed at Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant, with two units operational from 2015 and 2016, respectively. A three loop, 1000-MW version of the CNP reactor, the CNP-1000, was under development since the 1990s, but the effort has since shifted towards the development of the more advanced generation-III ACP-1000. Since 2011 CNNC has been progressively merging its ACP-1000 nuclear power station design with the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG) ACPR-1000 design, while allowing some differences, under direction of the Chinese nuclear regulator. Both are three- loop designs originally based on the same French design, but now have different nuclear cores. The first two ACP1000 units will be built at Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant. In early 2014, it was announced that the merged design was moving from preliminary design to detailed design. Power output will be 1150 MWe, with a 60-year design life, and would use a combination of passive and active safety systems with a double containment. Initially the merged design was to be called the ACC-1000, but ultimately it was named Hualong One. In August 2014 the Chinese nuclear regulator review panel classified the design as a Generation III reactor design, with independently owned intellectual property rights. The first units to be constructed will be Fuqing 5 and 6, Fangjiashan 3 and 4, and a build has been proposed in Argentina. =Advanced CANDU reactor= In September 2016 it was announced that SNC- Lavalin has signed an agreement in principle with CNNC and the Shanghai Electric Group to design, market and build the advanced CANDU reactor. Its ability to use reprocessed uranium will reduce China's stock of spent nuclear fuel. =DHR-400= CNNC has developed a pool-type light-water reactor for district heating, called the DHR-400 (District Heating Reactor 400 MWt). It operates at low temperature and air pressure. so is easy to operate and decommission. Building cost is 1.5 billion yuan ($230 million), taking three years to build. It is well suited for the existing centralised heating systems of northern Chinese cities, currently often coal fueled. In February 2019, China's State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) signed a cooperation agreement with the Baishan municipal government in Jilin province for the Baishan Nuclear Energy Heating Demonstration Project, which would use a DHR-400. =ACP100 = In July 2019, CNNC announced it would start building a demonstration ACP100 small modular reactor on the north-west side of the existing Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant by the end of the year. Design of the ACP100 started in 2010. It is a fully integrated reactor module with an internal coolant system, with a 2-year refueling interval, producing 385 MWt and about 125 MWe.  Controversy  On 31 January 2018, CNNC announced that China Nuclear Engineering & Construction Corporation (CNECC) was merged into CNNC. On 28 August 2020, the United States Department of Defense released the names of additional ‚ÄúCommunist Chinese military companies‚Äù operating directly or indirectly in the United States. China Nuclear Engineering & Construction Corporation (CNECC) was included on the list.

Chemical methods =Using iron(II) sulfate= A simple nitrite test can be performed by adding 4 M sulfuric acid to the sample until acidic, and then adding 0.1 M iron(II) sulfate to the solution. A positive test for nitrite is indicated by a dark brown solution, arising from the iron- nitric oxide complex ion. This test is related to the brown ring test for the nitrate ion, which forms the same complex in a ring. In contrast, nitrites turn the whole solution brown and therefore interfere with that test. =Griess test= A common method of quantitative nitrite detection is the Griess test, which relies on the reaction of nitrite with the two components of a Griess reagent to form a red azo dye. This allows the concentration of nitrite to be determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. :File:Griess_Test_Reaction.svg Urinary nitrite test A nitrite test is a standard component of a urinary test strip. A positive test for nitrites in the urine is called nitrituria. This test is commonly used in diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs). A positive nitrite test indicates that the cause of the UTI is a gram negative organism, most commonly Escherichia coli. The reason for nitrites' existence in the presence of a UTI is due to a bacterial conversion of endogenous nitrates to nitrites. This may be a sign of infection. However, other parameters, such as leukocyte esterase, urine white blood cell count, and symptoms such as dysuria, urinary urgency, fevers, and chills must be correlated to diagnose an infection.Blood Cell Count - Control Your Health, Harold Amezcua, Health Testing Centers, September 12, 2015 False negative nitrite tests in urinary tract infections occur in cases with a low colony forming unit count, or in recently voided or dilute urine.Urinary Tract Infection: Providing the Best Care.

Terminology and age The origin of the word cougar as a slang term is debated, but it is thought to have originated in Western Canada and first appeared in print on the Canadian dating website Cougardate.com. It has also been stated to have \\"originated in Vancouver, British Columbia, as a put-down for older women who would go to bars and go home with whoever was left at the end of the night\\". The term has been variously applied to women who pursue sexual relations with men more than eight years younger than they are, and to women over the age of 40 who aggressively pursue sexual relations with men in their 20s or 30s. However, the term can also refer to any female who has a male partner much younger than herself, regardless of their ages. Academia A 2010 British psychological study published in Evolution and Human Behavior asserted that men and women, in general, continue to follow traditional gender roles when searching for mates, and thus concluded that the posited \\"cougar phenomenon\\" does not exist, or more precisely, exists but is rare. The study found that most men preferred younger, physically attractive women, while most women, of any age, preferred successful, established men their age or older. The study found very few instances of older women pursuing much younger men and vice versa.Alleyne, Richard, \\"The 'Cougar' concept: older women preying on younger men is a myth, claim scientists\\", The Telegraph, 19 August 2010 The study has been criticized, however, for limiting their results to online dating profiles, which are traditionally not used by those seeking older or younger partners, and for excluding the United States from the study. Media The cougar concept has been used in television shows, advertising, and film. The 2007 film Cougar Club was dedicated to the subject and, in spring 2009, TV Land aired a reality show called The Cougar where women would pick a date. The 2009 sitcom Cougar Town originally explored the difficulty and stigma of many so- called cougars. In The Graduate (1967), a married mother pursues a much younger man (21 in the film). On the soap opera Days of Our Lives, character Eve Donovan is a cougar, repeatedly sleeping with the much younger JJ Deveraux. The \\"cougar phenomenon\\", as it is called, is frequently associated with present-day, glamorous celebrities such as Madonna, Sam Taylor-Johnson and Demi Moore. However, it has been claimed that the trend of influential women dating younger men extends back a lot further through history to notable figures including Cleopatra, Catherine the Great and Elizabeth I.

He is best known as a lead and rhythm guitarist and for having patented a tuning system for guitars and similar instruments. Feiten also manufactures and markets solid-body electric guitars. Early years Feiten grew up in Huntington Station and Centerport, New York, where he was known by schoolmates and friends as \\"Buzzy\\". The son of a musical mother, Pauline (a classical pianist), and an airline pilot, Howard Sr., Feiten received training in classical music as a child. His older sister Paula was a flautist and fashion model in the mid-1960s. A younger brother, Jon, was also involved in music and the arts. In youth, he studied several musical instruments, settling on the French horn. As a teenager, he played in all-county (Suffolk) and all-state (New York) youth orchestras on the instrument. Feiten first played Carnegie Hall in 1966 on French horn in American Youth Performs. In 1966, he auditioned at the Juilliard School on French horn but was rejected. In high school he belonged to a band called The Reasons Why with Steve Beckmeier (rhythm guitar), Al Stegmeyer (drums), Danny Horton (lead guitar), and Daniel Kretzer (keyboards). The band was successful on Long Island, and two songs, \\"Tell Her One More Time\\" and \\"Same Old Worries\\", were mentioned in a Billboard 'new singles' article in the summer of 1966. Career Still known as \\"Buzzy\\", in late 1968 or early 1969 Feiten was a student at the Mannes College of Music in New York City. Feiten replaced Elvin Bishop in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Feiten recorded on the group's fifth album, Keep on Moving. With Butterfield, Feiten toured internationally and played at the Atlantic City Pop Festival and the Woodstock Festival. Feiten was lead guitarist for The Rascals on their albums Peaceful World and Island of Real. Feiten's debut album Full Moon was released by Warner Bros. in 1982 and was recorded with Ray Barretto, Randy Brecker, Robin Clark, Gene Dinwiddie, Dave Holland, Neil Larsen, Airto Moreira, Tasha Thomas, and Phillip Wilson. A sequel, Buzz Feiten & The New Full Moon, was released in 1999 and recorded with Freddie Beckmeier on bass (brother of Steve from The Reasons Why), Jai Winding, Brandon Fields, and Gary Mallaber. In 1998‚Äì99 he was a member of the Dave Weckl Band. In 2008, Feiten recorded with Steve Postell of Pure Prairie League on the album Time Still Knocking (Immergent). Feiten has worked with Gregg Allman, The Brecker Brothers, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Michael Franks, Al Jarreau, Rickie Lee Jones, Chaka Khan, Dave Koz, Kenny Loggins, Bette Midler, Olivia Newton-John, Wilson Pickett, David Sanborn, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, Etta James, Dave Weckl and Don McLean. Tuning system Feiten patented a tuning system for guitars, marketed as the Buzz Feiten Tuning System, which is intended to correct problems of the standard equal temperament. The system can be retrofitted by a repair shop or luthier that has paid a licensing fee and received specific training. The system consists of a compensated string nut (or \\"shelf nut\\") and a method for intonating the bridge. The system was licensed to Washburn Guitars (1995‚Äì2010) and Suhr Guitars. The tuning system is intended to create more accurate tonality of notes played on the lowest three or four frets. Some guitarists claimed to hear no difference, perhaps attributed to their particular playing style or primary musical genre. A few stated the opinion that, while a BFTS- enhanced guitar was clearly superior when recording alongside electronic keyboards, it generally rendered their tone \\"sterile\\" or \\"thin.\\" Others believe that despite the company's \\"three or four\\" frets claim, the system provided marked improvement in accuracy virtually everywhere on the fretboard. Guitars In 2012, Feiten announced the founding of Buzz Feiten Guitars to manufacture and market solid-body electric guitars. The firm initially offered five models, the Blues Pro, T Pro, Signature Elite, Classic Pro, and Elite Pro. In 2018, the company was renamed Buzz Feiten Guitar Research, offering three models of SuperNova guitar: Classic (two humbucker pickups), Futura (bridge humbucker and neck single-coil pickup), and Futura Super-Trem (three single-coil pickups with synchronized vibrato). The \\"Buzz Feiten Tuning System\\" is mentioned only in regards to the Classic.

Executed in the morning of 13 April 1984, this military operation, launched in the highest battlefield in the world, was the first offensive of its kind. The operation preempted Pakistan's impending Operation Ababeel (which was intended to achieve the same objective as Operation Meghdoot) and was a success, resulting in Indian forces gaining control of the Siachen Glacier in its entirety. Currently, the Indian Army remains the first and only army in the world to have taken tanks and other heavy ordnance up to such an altitude (well over ). Up to ten infantry battalions each of the Indian Army and Pakistan Army are actively deployed at high altitudes of up to throughout the region of the glacier. thumb220x124px  right  alt= The green color part is Pakistan.white part is India and yellow is China. It is just describing the border in Himalayas  This image depicts the border of India and Pakistan in siachen Cause of conflict The Siachen Glacier became a bone of contention following a vague demarcation of territories in the Karachi Agreement of July 1949 which did not exactly specify who had authority over the Siachen Glacier area. Indian interpretation was that Pakistan territory extended only to about the Saltoro Ridge based on the Simla agreement where the territorial line's route after the last demarcated Point NJ9842 was \\"thence north to the glaciers.\\" Pakistan interpretation was that their territory continued northeast from Point NJ9842 to the Karakoram Pass. As a result, both nations claimed the barren heights and the Siachen Glacier. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Pakistan permitted several mountaineering expeditions to climb the peaks in the Siachen region from the Pakistani side, perhaps in an attempt to reinforce their claim on the area as these expeditions received permits obtained from the Government of Pakistan and in many cases a liaison officer from the Pakistan Army accompanied the teams. In 1978, the Indian Army also allowed mountaineering expeditions to the glacier, approaching from its side. The most notable one was the one launched by Colonel Narinder \\"Bull\\" Kumar of the Indian Army, who led an expedition to Teram Kangri, along with medical officer Captain A.V.S. Gupta. The Indian Air Force provided valuable support to this expedition in 1978 through logistic support and supply of fresh rations. The first air landing on the glacier was carried out on 6 October 1978 when two casualties were evacuated from the Advance Base Camp in a Chetak helicopter by Sqn Ldr Monga and Flying Officer Manmohan Bahadur. Contention over the glacier was aggravated by these expeditions, through both sides asserting their claims. Notably, when Pakistan gave permission to a Japanese expedition to scale an important peak (Rimo I) in 1984, it further fueled the suspicion of the Indian Government of Pakistani attempts to legitimize their claim. The peak, located east of the Siachen Glacier, also overlooks the northwestern areas of the Aksai Chin area which is controlled by China but claimed by India. The Indian military believed that such an expedition could further a link for a trade route from the northeastern (Chinese) to the southwestern (Pakistani) side of the Karakoram Range and eventually provide a strategic, if not tactical, advantage to the Pakistani Armed Forces. The operation The Indian military decided to deploy troops from Northern Ladakh region as well as some paramilitary forces to the glacier area. Most of the troops had been acclimatized to the extremities of the glacier through a training expedition to Antarctica in 1982 before eventually launching the operation to occupy the complete glacier.https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/how-raw-outsmarted-isi- to-win-siachen-for-india-through-operation-meghdoot-263062.html In 1983, Pakistani generals decided to stake their claim through troop deployments to the Siachen glacier. After analysing the Indian Army's mountaineering expeditions, they feared that India might capture key ridges and passes near the glacier, and decided to send their own troops first. Islamabad ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London supplier, unaware that the same supplier provided outfits to the Indians. The Indians were informed about this development and initiated their own plan, providing them with a head start. The Indian Army planned an operation to control the glacier by 13 April 1984, to preempt the Pakistani Army by about 4 days, as intelligence had reported that the Pakistani operation planned to occupy the glacier by 17 April. Named for the divine cloud messenger, Meghaduta, from the 4th century AD Sanskrit play by Kalidasa, Operation Meghdoot was led by Lieutenant General Prem Nath Hoon. The task of occupying the Saltoro ridge was given to 26 Sector, commanded by Brigadier Vijay Channa, who was tasked with launching the operation between 10 and 30 April. He chose 13 April, supposedly an lucky date, because it was the Vaisakhi day, when the Pakistanis would be least expecting the Indians to launch an operation.https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/operation- meghdoot-34-years-ago-how-india-won-siachen-5135429/ Preparations for Operation Meghdoot started with the airlift of Indian Army soldiers by the Indian Air Force. The Air Force used Il-76, An-12 and An-32 to transport stores and troops as well to airdrop supplies to high altitude airfields. From there Mi-17, Mi-8 and HAL Chetak helicopters carried provisions and personnel to the east of the hitherto unscaled peaks. The first phase of the operation began in March 1984 with the march on foot to the eastern base of the glacier. A full battalion of the Kumaon Regiment and units from the Ladakh Scouts, marched with full battle packs through an ice-bound Zoji La pass for days. The units under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel (later Brigadier) D. K. Khanna were moved on foot to avoid detection of large troop movements by Pakistani radars. The first unit -- tasked with establishing a position on the heights of the glacier -- was led by Major (later Lieutenant-Colonel) R. S. Sandhu. The next unit led by Captain Sanjay Kulkarni secured Bilafond La. The remaining forward deployment units then marched and climbed for four days under the command of Captain P. V. Yadav to secure the remaining heights of the Saltoro Ridge. By 13 April, approximately 300 Indian troops were dug into the critical peaks and passes of the glacier. By the time Pakistan troops managed to get into the immediate area, they found that the Indian troops had controlled all three major mountain passes of Sia La, Bilafond La, and by 1987 Gyong La and all the commanding heights of the Saltoro Ridge west of the Siachen Glacier. Handicapped by the altitude and the limited time, Pakistan could only manage to control the Saltoro Ridge's western slopes and foothills despite the fact that Pakistan possessed more ground accessible routes to the area, unlike Indian access which was largely reliant on air drops for supplies due to the steeper eastern side of the glacier. In his memoirs, former Pakistani president, General Pervez Musharraf states that Pakistan lost of territory.(pp. 68-69) Time magazine also states that the Indian advance captured of territory claimed by Pakistan. Camps were soon converted to permanent posts by both countries. The number of casualties on both sides during this particular operation is not known.  Aftermath  There are divergent views on the strategic value of the operation. Some view it as a futile capture of non-strategic land which antagonized relations between India and Pakistan. Others consider the operation to be a \\"daring\\" success by the Indian Military and ensured that the Indian military held tactical high ground on the strategic Saltoro Ridge just west of the glacier, albeit at a high cost. The Indian Army currently controls all of the long Siachen Glacier and all of its tributary glaciers, as well as the three main passes of the Saltoro Ridge immediately west of the glacier, Sia La, Bilafond La, and Gyong La, thus holding onto the tactical advantage of high ground. The operation and the continued cost of maintaining logistics to the area is a major drain on both militaries. Pakistan launched an all out assault in 1987 and again in 1989 to capture the ridge and passes held by India. The first assault was headed by then-Brigadier-General Pervez Musharraf (later President of Pakistan) and initially managed to capture a few high points before being pushed back. Later the same year, Pakistan lost at least one major Pakistani post, the \\"Quaid\\", which came under Indian control as Bana Post, in recognition of Bana Singh who launched a daring daylight attack, codenamed Operation Rajiv, after climbing of ice cliff. Bana Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC) ‚Äì the highest gallantry award of India for the assault that captured the post. Bana Post is the highest battlefield post in the world today at a height of above sea level. The second assault in 1989 was also unsuccessful as the ground positions did not change. The loss of most of the Siachen area and the subsequent unsuccessful military forays prompted Benazir Bhutto to taunt Zia ul Haq that he should wear a burqa as he had lost his manliness. = Casualties = No reliable data is available. However, both sides incurred most of their casualties from the weather and the terrain. A large number of soldiers from both sides suffered frostbite and high altitude sickness or were lost in avalanches or crevasses during patrols. In Siachen Glacier Operation Meghdoot, from 1984 till 18.11.2016, 35 officers and 887 JCOs / ORs have lost their lives.

In essence, the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon & Crennan JJ) found the Constitution's corporations power capable of sustaining the legislative framework, while the conciliation and arbitration and territories powers were also seen as supporting parts of the law. Furthermore, the majority also held that the legislation permissibly limited State powers and did not interfere with State constitutions or functioning. A minority (Kirby and Callinan JJ) dissented. The case attracted considerable attention before, during and after the High Court decision was delivered on 14 November 2006. As a legal precedent, it may signify a shift in the distribution of power from the States to the Federal Parliament. Thus, the decision could well be regarded by historians of Australian federalism as an important legal landmark. Background to the case From at least 1904 through to the last decade of the 20th Century, the constitutional basis of most Australian federal industrial relations legislation was the conciliation and arbitration power. In general, the Federal Parliament would exercise this power to establish an independent tribunal to set minimum terms and conditions of employment by the compulsory conciliation and arbitration of interstate industrial disputes. Another important historical fact of note is that for much of the 20th Century, the States and Territories had their own workplace relations legislation setting terms and conditions for employees not affected by the arbitration of interstate industrial disputes. =WorkChoices legislation= In December 2005, the WorkChoices reforms were passed by Federal Parliament. There were many elements in the reforms, including some which elicited political and social controversy and consternation. In a legal sense, perhaps the two most fundamental changes were (1) the purported elimination of State and Territory workplace relations legislation from the federal industrial landscape and (2) the attempt to rely almost completely on the corporations power directly to prescribe minimum terms and conditions of employment regardless of the existence of an intrastate industrial dispute. This unprecedented (but not novel) use of the corporations power to enact federal industrial legislation was accompanied by claims that 85% of the Australian workforce would be covered by WorkChoices. A legal challenge to the constitutional basis of WorkChoices followed in short order. The plaintiffs were States of New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and the Australian Workers' Union and Unions New South Wales. The defendant was the Commonwealth of Australia. Attorneys-General for the State of Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory intervened in support of the plaintiffs. The Full Court of the High Court hearing the case comprised Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ. Hearings of substantial matters began on 4 May 2006, and concluded on 11 May. The outcome of the challenge was the High Court decision of New South Wales & Ors v Commonwealth, delivered on 14 November 2006. Legal contentions =Commonwealth= The Commonwealth argued the WorkChoices legislation was constitutionally valid. It said the corporations power supported any law that directly created, altered, or impaired the rights, powers, duties, liabilities or privileges of a corporation. Furthermore, it was said that the power was validly exercised by any law: * relating to the conduct of those who work for corporations * relating to the business functions, activities or relationships of corporations * protecting corporations from loss or damage, and * otherwise materially affecting a corporation. The principal argument of the Government of Australia is that the legislation is supported by Section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution, commonly known as \\"the corporations power\\", which gives the Parliament of Australia the power to make laws with respect to \\"foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.\\" Some sections of the legislation are also based on other powers in the Constitution, for example the territories power, insofar as the laws apply to territories, and sections relating to employees of the Government of Australia. Generally speaking, those sections were not challenged by the states and the unions.transcript NSW v Commonwealth =States and unions= Shortly put, the plaintiffs argued the WorkChoices legislation was constitutionally invalid. They said that the corporations power did not support the legislative framework. In this regard, the plaintiffs argued there were three alternative limitations on the corporations power: * it was limited to regulation of corporations' external relationships, and/or * it was limited to laws in which the nature of the corporation was significant, and/or * it was limited by the existence of the conciliation and arbitration power. The states and trade unions involved in the case divided the issues between themselves, with the lawyers for each party arguing a particular part of the overall argument. The challengers argued that the legislation was not a valid law under the Constitution of Australia, because it is not supported by any of the heads of power granted to the Parliament of Australia by Section 51 of the Australian Constitution. Their principal argument was that the corporations power did not extend far enough to support the legislation. They distinguished the WorkChoices legislation from other laws which rely on the corporations power (such as the Trade Practices Act 1974) on the basis that those other laws are \\"manifestly laws with respect to... corporations\\" because they have \\"a structure whereby the corporation is a relevant actor and the activities in question are to be in trade or commerce.\\" That is, those other laws were aimed directly at corporations, and more specifically at their trading and commercial activities. They argued that the WorkChoices legislation was really directed at industrial relations, and was only remotely connected with corporations. The challengers argued that the limits of the corporations power had not really been tested, since the vast majority of the case law was focused on determining to which corporations the power applies. The states also argued that since the time of Federation, the industrial relations system in Australia had been largely state run. The Commonwealth's conciliation and arbitration power is specifically limited to interstate disputes, and does not extend to disputes existing entirely within one state. The Judgment The Court ruled 5:2 in favour of the Commonwealth (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Kirby and Callinan JJ dissenting). =Majority Judgment= The majority of the High Court : * rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the corporations power was limited to external relationships. Their Honours said it was inappropriate and unhelpful to draw any distinction between external and internal relationships of a corporation. * did not expressly accept the plaintiffs' argument that the nature of the corporation had to be a significant element in the law. Their Honours said that the corporations power was validly exercised if a law prescribed norms regulating the relationship between corporations and their employees. * rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the corporations power had to be limited by the existence of the conciliation and arbitration power. Their Honours said, amongst other things, this contention was contrary to the Constitution's text and structure and High Court precedent since 1920. Their Honours also rejected other arguments of the plaintiffs that parts of the WorkChoices legislation * which covered employers in Territories were an invalid exercise of the Territories power * which removed State and Territory industrial laws from the new federal workplace relations system were an invalid exercise of the corporations power or curtailed or interfered with the capacity of States to function The majority declared: =Kirby J (Dissenting)= The significant ideas put forward by Kirby J include: * At paragraph 481-3: it is unnecessary for this case to outline or define the scope of the corporations power. The corporations power is restrictions placed on laws regarding industrial disputes by s51(xxxv). What is forbidden is basing a law on one head of power (i.e. corporations power) when it is clearly a law with respect to another head of power (i.e. industrial disputes); * At paragraph 607: laws with respect to industrial disputes must fit within the two safeguards in s51(xxxv) namely interstateness and independent resolution; * At paragraph 609 (titled Preserving Industrial Fairness): the idea of a fair go that was at the heart of federal workplace laws is destroyed which has the potential to affect the core values that shaped the Australian Community and Economy; and * At paragraph 613: the high court should be attentive to the federal character of the Constitution. =Callinan J (Dissenting)= Callinan J summarises his judgment at paragraph 913. Generally, the reasons set down in paragraph 913 include: * The Constitution should be read as a whole; * The substance of the legislation in question is with regards to industrial affairs; * The industrial affairs power includes the two safe guards; * As much as the corporations power may purport to support the legislation, the power is still subject to the restrictions of the industrial affairs power for industrial affairs legislation; * To affirm the validity of the Act would be to trespass on the functions of the states; and * The validation of the Act would result in an unacceptable distortion of the federal balance. Significance and controversy Media coverage and commentary on the case has been significant. The case has been \\"hailed as the most important constitutional case in 80 years\\" (a probable reference to Engineers, heard 86 years prior). It has also been described as potentially one of the most important cases in the history of the Court. The case is also significant because of the politics surrounding it. Underpinning the challenge is a major political rift in Australian politics between the two major political forces: the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal/National Coalition. In 2006 not only did the Coalition hold the Federal Government of Australia but they also held a majority in the Senate allowing them to completely dominate the Federal Parliament. Federal Labor's poor result at the 2004 federal election provided the Coalition with control of the Senate for the first time since 1980. This gave the Coalition complete Federal legislative freedom. Conversely, Labor governments have been elected in all six states and two territories. The Workplace Relations WorkChoices Act is itself politically contentious and perceived by some as an attack on both the Union and Labor movements, and the minimum wage setting system as a whole. The Coalition (inspired by conservative think tank the H. R. Nicholls Society) believe the step to have \\"bravely taken advantage of...new found legislative freedom and have created a substantially different and national industrial relations system\\". The ALP have been aggressive critics of the new laws. On the day the Bill was introduced into the Australian House of Representatives 11 members of the ALP were ejected during heated debate over the Bill. In this context the creation of \\"one national system\\" is seen by some as a sensible step to modernise Australia's industrial relations regime. Others see it as a coup d'√©tat of the Labor Party's power to create union friendly legislative regimes through their respective State Parliaments. The political (and party political) dimension has led commentators to draw comparisons between this case and two others: the Bank Nationalisation Case and the Communist Party Case, because in those cases the High Court was the final arbiter of divisive political issues. The Case is also significant in that it had the most lawyers to ever appear in the High Court at one time, outstripping Wik Peoples v Queensland for the title. A picture of the proceedings has been placed on the High Court of Australia's website for this reason. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has said that if the Commonwealth were successful in the case, it would pave the way for the Commonwealth to use the corporations head of power to move into other areas of law traditionally within the purview of the States, such as transport, education and health. He has stated that this \\"would leave the federation in confusion\\" and has suggested that a Constitutional Convention would be necessary if that situation arose.

The two tigers were tracked down overnight and eventually killed after advancing aggressively towards police and a group of circus performers who were attempting to contain Josephine with a net. There was considerable public outrage at the destruction of the animals particularly as Josephine had already been shot with 2 tranquiliser darts.

Zahara recovered well and will breed again in the future, despite the death of breeding male, Seun, in September 2012. The zoo, now left with Tisa and Zahara, is currently looking to import a new male giraffe, or use artificial insemination on the younger female, Zahara. In September 2012, Wellington Zoo opened a new enclosure for their Malayan sun bears, Sean and Sasa. The zoo is currently awaiting the arrival of a new male sun bear for breeding with Sasa. She is currently on a contraceptive implant to prevent breeding with her father, Sean. In August 2013, 21-year-old Sumatran tiger Cantic died. She was one of the oldest tigers in captivity.http://www.wellingtonzoo.com/net/news/article.aspx?id=361 In June 2014, a 3-year-old Sumatran tigress, Senja, arrived from Mogo Zoo.

Wellington Zoo is committed to the welfare of animals and wildlife both within the zoo and around the world. As well as caring for their own animals, Wellington Zoo participates in breeding programs both locally and internationally, and contributes to conservation and research programs both within the zoo, around the country and even overseas. It works cooperatively with other zoos around the world through studbook keepers, who are responsible for maintaining relevant data on a particular species within a programme to ensure genetic diversity. Wellington Zoo is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA). In addition to breeding programmes, the zoo is also involved in a number of community conservation projects. The Kereru Discovery Project is a cooperative effort with Zealandia: Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, Te Papa and Pukaha (Mount Bruce). This project aims to make Wellington a better place for kereru, the native wood pigeon.

After years of turbulent relations, the popes finally settled down to a peace with the Hauteville kings. In 1156, events transpired to leave the pope alone in opposition to the Normans. The army of Michael Palaeologus had been annihilated, the army of Frederick Barbarossa had returned to Germany, and the internal rebels against royal authority in Apulia, men like Robert II of Capua or Richard II of Aquila, had either reconciled or been imprisoned. In short, the pope had no support to continue hostilities. He was also barred from Rome by the populace. He was staying at Benevento, which had been papal territory for over a century. The Sicilian army approached Benevento and the pope was forced to make terms. The papal chancellor, Roland of Siena, later Pope Alexander III, and the Roman nobleman Oddone Frangipane were sent forth to negotiate. William of Tyre suggests that the city was besieged, but eyewitnesses contradict him. King William I of Sicily sent his own ammiratus ammiratorum, Maio of Bari, and his two primatial ecclesiastics, Hugh of Palermo and Romuald of Salerno. Starting with the upper hand, the Sicilian envoys finalised a deal on 18 June. This deal was the Treaty of Benevento. One of the chief authors of the treaty as it stands was a young notary named Matthew of Ajello, later of much fame in Sicily. The kingship of William was recognised over all Sicily, Apulia, Calabria, and Campania, as well as Capua, the coastal cities of Amalfi, Naples, and Gaeta, and the newly conquered territories in Central Italy: Marche and the Abruzzi, which Roger and Alfonso, William's elder brothers, had claimed before. The tribute to the pope of 600 schifati agreed upon by Roger II in 1139 at Mignano was affirmed and another 400 schifati was added for Marsi. The pope's right to send legates into the peninsular realm was accepted, but the legateship of the king in Sicily was affirmed and the pope had to resign much claimed authority over the island. In the church of S. Marciano, William was invested by the pope with first Sicily, then Apulia, and finally Capua. He received the Kiss of Peace and bestowed on the pope gifts of gold and silver. The original manuscript of the treaty is in the Vatican Apostolic Archive.

He acquired a reputation as a fortune hunter. Early life Beauclerk was the fifth son of the 1st Duke of St Albans and his wife Lady Diana de Vere, daughter and heiress of Aubrey de Vere, 20th and last Earl of Oxford. He was a grandson of King Charles II and Nell Gwyn. In 1718 he was at Eton College. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in 1721 and was awarded MA in 1727 and DCL in 1733. He sought fortunes by paying court to elderly ladies and he was described in 1727 as 'Nell Gwyn in person, with the sex altered'. On 9 December 1736, he married Mary Norris, daughter and heiress of Thomas Norris, MP of Speke, Lancashire. His fortune-hunting eventually brought dividend in 1737 when he was bequeathed the Windsor estates of Richard Topham located in and around Old Windsor. Career Beauclerk stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in a contest at Marlow at a by-election in 1732 on the interest of Edmund Waller. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Windsor at a by-election on 16 May 1733,joining his brother Lord Vere Beauclerk. He was returned unopposed at the 1734 British general election. In March 1739, he presented to Parliament the Georgia Society's petition for a grant, and he was elected at his own request to the common council of the Society. He was active until 1740, when his attendance fell off. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1740, and was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household later that year, being returned again at the consequential by-election. He was returned again at Windsor at the 1741 British general election, but lost his place at Court on the fall of Walpole in 1742. Death and legacy Beauclerk died on 23 November 1744, leaving an only son, Topham Beauclerk who was a friend of Samuel Johnson. He married Diana, Viscountess Bolingbroke and St John (n√©e Spencer) and lived at Speke Hall. They have many surviving descendants among whom are the present Marquises de Valero de Urr√≠a.

It is a steel girder bridge, built in 1983 as part of the Circle Drive freeway system in northeast Saskatoon. At the time of construction, it cost $11.8 million to build. Between its opening in 1983 and the opening of the Chief Mistawasis Bridge in 2018, it was the northernmost vehicular river crossing in the city. As with other bridges in the city, locals use several different names for this bridge. During construction there was an unsuccessful campaign to have it named after recently deceased former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Longtime Saskatonians also refer to it as the 42nd Street Bridge, a reference to a former name of the northern east-west leg of Circle Drive dating back to the 1960s; this name was also commonly applied to the bridge in media coverage and city council references to its planning and construction dating back to the early 1960s. For a brief time in the mid-2010s, it was referred to informally as the Circle Drive North Bridge to differentiate it from the formally-named Circle Drive South Bridge constructed at the opposite end of the city, until the latter bridge was officially renamed the Gordie Howe Bridge. The Circle Drive Bridge is a twin-span bridge; it was designed so that more lanes could be added by filling in the centre. Early published plans for the bridge called for the addition of an observation deck/interpretive centre to the underside of the bridge at that point. However, rather than widening the bridge by filling in the centre gap, it was deemed to be more cost effective to convert the outside pedestrian walkways into driving lanes. In 2006, construction started on adding a third outside lane in both directions to increase capacity and ease congestion during peak traffic times. The lane additions were completed in 2007. A new pedestrian walkway was built below and between the two bridge structures, and opened in July 2007. The walkway was dedicated as the Stew Uzelman Pedway on October 31, 2009. The bridge was the scene of a notable accident on 30 December 2013, when Breanna Pegg lost control of her car after hitting ice on the bridge. Her car went over built-up snow along the guard rail, which launched the vehicle up and over the side of the bridge. It crashed onto the frozen river below and started to sink through the broken ice. Pegg escaped the vehicle by kicking out the windshield, standing on top of the car and swimming to a nearby sheet of ice. She then pulled herself onto the ice before being assisted by police and a bystander. As a result of the accident, the city changed its policy regarding snow removal from bridges. The city was sued by Saskatchewan Government Insurance for the cost of the vehicle and its salvage.

However, he had a strong interest in physics and electronics, and after being briefly detained by the British as an enemy alien at the start of World War II he was recruited to work in a secret microwave vacuum tube research program at the University of Birmingham. While there, Kompfner invented the TWT in 1943. After the war he became a British citizen, continued working for the Admiralty as a scientist, and also studied physics at the University of Oxford, receiving his PhD in 1951. Late that year Kompfner was recruited to Bell Labs in the United States by John R. Pierce, where they together developed the TWT into an important element of the communications age. He received the IEEE Medal of Honor for his invention, and in 1974 received the National Medal of Science. Kompfner died on December 3, 1977, in Stanford, California.

Built in 1939 for the movie Arizona (1940), it has been used for the filming of many movies and television westerns since then, such as Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Rio Bravo (1959), El Dorado (1966), and Little House on the Prairie TV series of the 1970s-1980s. It was opened to the public in 1960, and historical tours were offered about the movies filmed there, along with live cast entertainment featuring stunt shows and shootouts. On September 8, 2020, Pima County, which owns the land on which it stands, announced that it was being shut down for an \\"indefinite\\" period. Early history Old Tucson was originally built in 1939 by Columbia Pictures on a Pima County- owned site as a replica of 1860s‚Äô era Tucson for the movie Arizona (1940), starring William Holden and Jean Arthur. Workers built more than 50 buildings in 40 days. Many of those structures are still standing. After Arizona completed filming, the location lay dormant for several years, until the filming of The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman. Other early movies filmed on this set included The Last Round-Up (1947) with Gene Autry and Winchester '73 (1950) with James Stewart and The Last Outpost (1951) with Ronald Reagan. The 1950s saw the filming of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold (1958), Cimarron (1960) and Rio Bravo (1959) among others. Open to the public The fictional Pima County Bank used in the daily bank robbery show In 1959, entrepreneur Robert Shelton leased the property from Pima County and began to restore the aging facility. Old Tucson re-opened in 1960, as both a film studio and a theme park. The park grew building by building with each movie filmed on its dusty streets. John Wayne starred in four movies at Old Tucson. Rio Bravo (1959) added a saloon, bank building and doctor's office; McLintock! (1963) added the McLintock Hotel; El Dorado (1966) brought a renovation of the storefronts on Front Street; and with Rio Lobo (1970) came a cantina, a granite-lined creek, a jail and a ranch house. In 1968, a 13,000 square foot (1,208 square meter) soundstage was built to give Old Tucson greater movie- making versatility. The first film to use the soundstage was Young Billy Young (1968), starring Robert Mitchum and Angie Dickinson. The park also began adding tours, rides and shows for the entertainment of visitors, most notably gunfights staged in the \\"streets\\" by stunt performers. One of the rides is a narrow gauge railroad powered by two Chance Rides C.P. Huntington train sets, which encircles most of the property. Old Tucson served as an ideal location for shooting scenes for TV series like NBC's The High Chaparral (1967‚Äì1971) with Leif Erickson and Cameron Mitchell where the ranch house survived the 1995 fire: The 1970s‚Äì1980s series Little House on the Prairie with Michael Landon, and later Father Murphy, featuring Merlin Olsen and Petrocelli (1974‚Äì76) used the site. Three Amigos was a popular comedy movie shot there in the 1980s with Steve Martin, utilizing the church set. From 1989 to 1992, the western show The Young Riders filmed here and at the Mescal, Arizona sister site. The main street appears prominently in 1990s westerns such as Tombstone (1993) with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer. A partial mirror set exists at Mescal and is featured in The Quick and the Dead (1995), with Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman which filmed all of the town of Redemption scenes at the studios. Fire Old Tucson buildings in 1984, before the 1995 conflagration On April 24, 1995, a fire destroyed much of Old Tucson Studios. Buildings, costumes and memorabilia were lost in the blaze. Among the memorabilia destroyed was the wardrobe from Little House on the Prairie. Also lost in the blaze was the only copy of a short film about the history of Old Tucson Studios. This film included rare behind the scenes footage of stars, such as William Holden, John Wayne and Angie Dickinson. The Reno, a steam locomotive from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad on static display in the park, was also badly damaged. According to the arson investigation, the fire originated inside building 74, which was a sign shop. This building backed up to an entertainment venue and was located on Kansas Street across from the sound stage. A show had just finished at this venue and the crowd was heading south on Front Street, being escorted by the actors from the show. Within minutes, flames were discovered inside the sign shop and security radioed the front gate. The front gate immediately called 911. In the meantime, someone pulled a fire hose from just north of this location (outside the Rio Bravo Jail building). When it was discovered that the hose was not long enough, it was dropped and another hose was pulled from the area of Chinese Alley. However, the original hose was not turned off, which bled off the pressure to the second hose. 300 guests and employees were forced to evacuate the park. Tucson Estates Fire Department arrived in less than 10 minutes with one truck and two firemen. However, by this time the fire had progressed too quickly to be suppressed by this basic equipment. A multiple alarm call was put out to dispatch as many fire units as possible. This began the deployment of 100 pieces of equipment and over 200 firefighters from every fire department in the Tucson metro area, including Davis Monthan Air Force Base and the Arizona National Guard. By this point, the wind was out of the west, pushing the fire into the sound stage and west along Kansas Street. Approaches to the fire were restricted by three propane tanks that had vented and were burning. The fire quickly turned into a firestorm with vortices of flames carrying burning shingles and wood throughout the park. Fire control efforts were hampered by high winds. Most of the buildings in the studio were classified as \\"Temporary Structures,\\" meaning fire prevention devices such as sprinklers were not required. A large propane tank, stashes of black powder used in staging gunfights, and a diesel fuel tank demanded the attention of firefighters and much of the scarce water supply. So much water was used in the attempt to prevent an explosion that the surrounding areas became flooded, further impeding the firefighters as they attempted to wade through the mud. After four hours of firefighting, the flames were extinguished and hot spots located and put out. The loss included all of Kansas Street and Front street to the wash on the east side, the corner store on the west, and the sound stage. The Mission area was destroyed along with the Mission, the Greer Garson house, and the cantina from Rio Lobo. The south end of town and the Silverlake area were not affected. Damages were estimated to be in excess of $10 million ($15 million in 2013), with 25 buildings destroyed. Fortunately, there were no human casualties. Using eyewitness information, arson investigators narrowed down the location of the fire to the sign shop on Kansas street, just north of the sound stage. This building was used for the staging of a gunfight show and when not attended, the building could be entered by anyone. The remains of the building showed that the exact point of origin was in a trash can located in the building. Samples of items in the trash can and in the immediate area were collected and tested, and the tests were negative for any type of accelerant. There were no electrical lines or other sources of ignition in the immediate area. Also, based on the timeline from the end of the show and the first flames being seen on the outside of the building, it was too short of a time span to have been caused by a discarded cigarette. It was ruled that some person unknown had started the fire in the immediate area of the waste basket, and that the person had intentionally set the fire with some source of open flame (such as a match). The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent in a team of forensic accountants to look into a financial motive for the fire. It was determined that the owners and management of Old Tucson did not stand to get a financial benefit but would lose a considerable amount of money due to the fire. These facts ruled the owners out of any conspiracy to set the fire. The employees were then questioned and their backgrounds checked; however, nothing suspicious was found to implicate any employee in the fire. That left the motive as either revenge for some personal offense, or an amateur thrill arsonist. Because of where the fire started, it was felt that the person starting it must have some knowledge of the layout of Old Tucson. Employment records were checked and one individual was identified as having recently attempted to get a job at Old Tucson, but was turned down. This person became the primary suspect. The subject lived in the nearby area and frequented Old Tucson. In the month following the Old Tucson fire, several other fires were started in the area of Tucson Estates, down the road from Old Tucson; this subject was identified as the primary suspect in those fires. He was located and questioned by detectives, and faced with the evidence from the Tucson Estates fires, at which point he confessed to having started those fires. However, before he could be questioned about the Old Tucson fire, he invoked his Miranda Rights, effectively stopping any further questioning. Not enough evidence could be collected to positively identify this suspect as the arsonist in the Old Tucson fire. No other information pointing to any other individual was ever found, and the case remains open to this day. After 20 months of reconstruction, Old Tucson re-opened its doors on January 2, 1997. The sets that were lost were not recreated; instead, entirely new buildings were constructed, and the streets were widened. The Reno locomotive was cosmetically restored before the filming of Wild Wild West, in which it was featured as Union Pacific 119 in the scene at the driving of the final spike of the First Transcontinental Railroad, but was subsequently used in an explosion in the scene and is in need of additional restoration. The soundstage was not rebuilt. Film production at Old Tucson was seriously affected by the fire. In 2003, Old Tucson reduced its hours of operation, opening from 10am to 4pm. Focusing on seasonal events, Old Tucson hosts the popular Nightfall event for Halloween which runs through the month of October, Wednesday through Sunday nights. Recent history A railroad station building near the Old Tucson Studios entrance In 2011, Old Tucson embarked on a project to build new movie-quality sets that fill out the park, and restore the pre-fire feel of close-together buildings, providing the look and depth of a genuine old west town circa 1865-1900. ‚ÄúAfter the rebuild of Old Tucson following the 1995 fire, the town just didn‚Äôt have the same look and feel,‚Äù says Old Tucson CEO and General Manager Pete Mangelsdorf. ‚ÄúWe started discussions with Bob Shelton several years ago to develop a plan to fill the empty space in Town Square with movie quality sets that bring the magic back.‚Äù The Heritage Square Project, a 5,000-square-foot spread with three new streets lined with 12 new buildings, was completed in November 2011 at an estimated cost of $300,000. The design and construction of the new sets was led by Production Designer Gene Rudolf, credited with creating sets for movies including Young Guns II, The Great Gatsby, The Right Stuff, Raging Bull, Marathon Man, and Three Days of the Condor. The project added dressmaker shops, a general store and a blacksmith, and are part of \\"living history\\" presentations. One of the goals of the Heritage Project was to add \\"more programs that have to do with the different cultural aspects, the Hispanic culture, the Chinese culture, the Native American culture,\\" said Mangelsdorf. Along those lines, another new exhibit now open to the public features a Tohono O'odham village as it would have appeared in the 1860s. It includes traditional houses, a garden and other facets of village life.http://www.kvoa.com/news/heritage-square-project-nearly-complete-at-old- tucson-studios/ On Tuesday, September 8, 2020, Old Tucson, the Western-themed attraction that was the filming location of more than 400 feature-films and TV shows, is closing indefinitely, with its future to be determined by Pima County. The decision to close the Arizona landmark \\"was made with a heavy heart,\\" according to Old Tucson general manager Terry Verhage, who said in a Tuesday news release that the theme park would have remained in business \\"if not for the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" ‚ÄúWe know how important Old Tucson is to our community, guests and employees,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did everything possible to keep our loyal fans safe when we were open, but the ongoing COVID-19 public health protocols and restrictions limited park attendance to the point where Old Tucson could no longer stay in business.‚Äù Pima County will take over responsibility for the theme park on Sept. 14 and \\"will seek ideas from potential operators and lessors about what Old Tucson could be in the future,\\" the news release said.

Brown, Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. . p. 205. Early life Fitzhugh was born on August 22, 1838 in Oswego, New York. He attended Yale University before being appointed a cadet at the United States Military Academy.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 236. Military career Fitzhugh was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1859, but left in September 1861 before finishing to join the Union war effort. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 4th United States Regular Artillery in October 1861, and served as an Aide-de-Camp to major general Don Carlos Buell between 1861 and 1863, including during the April 1862 Shiloh Campaign. Fitzhugh then led the 4th Regular Artillery's Battery C, commanding it in all the Army of the Potomac's 1864 battles and campaigns in Virginia. On December 24, 1864, he was commissioned a Colonel of Volunteers, and was given command of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry on February 18, 1865. His direct role with the unit, though, was nominal; he was promoted specifically to command the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division of Major General Philip Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah. He led the brigade from January 15, 1865 through to the end of the war on May 29, 1865. From May 29 1865, to June 17, 1865, he was given command of Brigade 2, Division 1, Cavalry, XXII Corps, Department of Washington. On June 17, 1865 he was appointed in charge of the 2nd New York Provisional Cavalry (a \\"holding\\" unit for soldiers awaiting muster out) before being mustered out the volunteer service himself on August 6, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Fitzhugh for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers for \\"gallantry, energy and ability\\" to rank from March 13, 1865 and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 745. On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated Fitzhugh for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the U.S. Regular Army for \\"gallant and meritorious services in the field during the war\\" to rank from March 13, 1866 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 733. Reverting to Regular Army rank of lieutenant, he served in the postbellum forces until he resigned on May 21, 1868. He then engaged in steel manufacturing until his retirement. He died at age at 85 in 1923 at Cobourg, Ontario, Canada. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

The celebrations are similar to those of birthdays, but usually the food, the music and the feel is somewhat more traditional, and sometimes even religious.

He has been practicing Buddhism of the S≈çt≈ç Zen and VipassanƒÅ sects since 1975, and is currently teaching the practice of Buddhism in the San Francisco Bay Area. Having been taught by the VipassanƒÅ practitioner Jack Kornfield, Fronsdal is part of the VipassanƒÅ teachers' collective at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. He was ordained as a S≈çt≈ç Zen priest at the San Francisco Zen Center in 1982, and was a TheravƒÅda monk in Burma in 1985. In 1995, he received Dharma transmission from Mel Weitsman, the abbot of the Berkeley Zen Center. He is the guiding teacher of the Insight Meditation Center (IMC) of Redwood City. He has a PhD in Buddhist Studies from Stanford University. His many dharma talks available on line contain basic information on meditation and Buddhism, as well as subtle concepts of Buddhism explained at the level of the lay person. Fronsdal has been credited with identifying \\"what is perhaps the basic formula of success for any Buddhist group in America: 'spiritual' practice (that is, meditation) removed from Asian cultural expressions\\". Fronsdal has also been noted for his \\"analysis of the transformed role of sila (morality) in the western Insight Meditation Movement\\" and his view that the popularity of vipassana meditation in middle-class America is related to its message of \\"orthopraxy\\" (right action) and its lack of cultural and historical \\"baggage\\". His work has also been cited as a means by which First Nations people might \\"change the reality of internalized oppression to the reality of peace\\" while his 2005 translation of the Dhammapada has been included in a suggested reading list for teaching college students about happiness. In a 2011 discussion of the meaning of mindfulness, the American Theravada Buddhist monk Bhikkhu Bodhi cited Fronsdal in the following passage as \\"neatly\\" summarizing the difference between traditional Buddhist practice and that being taught in the West: > Rather than stressing world-renunciation, they [Western lay teachers] stress > engagement with, and freedom within the world. Rather than rejecting the > body, these Western teachers embrace the body as part of the holistic field > of practice. Rather than stressing ultimate spiritual goals such as full > enlightenment, ending the cycles of rebirth, or attaining the various stages > of sainthood, many Western teachers tend to stress the immediate benefits of > mindfulness and untroubled, equanimous presence in the midst of life‚Äôs > vicissitudes. This approach has been described as having traditional forms of Buddhism \\"being expanded upon rather than rejected\\", with Fronsdal cited as calling on Vipassana teachers \\"to study traditional Buddhism, not in order to adopt it wholesale but to be more conscious about what is and is not adopted and to take more responsibility for assumptions and intentions underlying innovation\\". As such, Fronsdal is recognized as presenting meditation as \\"the heart of the Buddhist path\\" with the traditional Buddhist values of loving- kindness, ethics, and generosity as key elements in a mindfulness-based, spiritual life among practitioners who are more likely to describe their involvement as \\"spiritual\\" rather than \\"religious\\". In 2008 Peter Dale Scott, the Canadian-born poet and professor emeritus of English at the University of California, Berkeley, published a poem dedicated to Fronsdal entitled Breathing exercise: a how-to poem.

Its most important members were: Josep Llu√≠s Sert, Antoni Bonet Castellana, Josep Torres Clav√©, Jos√© Manuel Aizpur√∫a, Fernando Garc√≠a Mercadal and Sixte Illescas. The group was formed in the 1930s as a Spanish branch of C.I.A.M. The Eastern (Catalan) and founding section of the group, called GATCPAC (Grup d'Arquitectes i T√®cnics Catalans per al Progr√©s de l'Arquitectura Contempor√†nia) was much more successful than the Central or Northern sections, and carried out government contracts during the Second Republic. GATCPAC also published the magazine A.C., or Actividad Contempor√°nea, which remains an important document for the history of Modern Movement in Spain. Most, but not all GATEPAC members fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War. Torres Clav√© was killed in action. Josep Llu√≠s Sert went into exile in the United States, where he would teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Antoni Bonet established himself in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Having been associated with the Second Republic, GATEPAC was taboo in Francoist Spain and reference to it was often censored until the 1950s, when their works were taken up by a new generation of Spanish modern architects like the Catalan Oriol Bohigas.

National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan The city is headquarter of Layyah District and Layyah Tehsil. It is the 72nd largest city in Pakistan. Geography It lies between 30‚Äì45 to 31‚Äì24 deg north latitudes and 70‚Äì44 to 71‚Äì50 deg east longitudes. The area consists of a semi-rectangular block of sandy land between the Indus River and the Chenab River in Sindh Sagar Doab. The total area covered by the district is 6,291 km2 with a width from east to west of 88 km and a length from north to south of 72 km. History The town was founded around 1550 by Kamal Khan Mirani, a descendant of Ghazi Khan Mirani who laid foundation of Dera Ghazi Khan. Around 1610, the town was taken from the Mirani rulers by the Jaskani Balochs, who held it until 1787. Abdun Nabi Sarai was appointed Governor by Timur Shah Durrani, but three years later it was included in the Governorship of Muhammad Khan Sadozai, who transferred his seat of Government to Mankera. In 1794, Humayun Shah, the rival claimant to the throne of Kabul, was captured near Layyah and brought into the town, where his eyes were put out by order of Zaman Shah. Under the Sikh Government, the town once more became the centre of administration for the neighbouring tract, and after the British occupation in 1849, was for a time the headquarters of a Civil Administrative Division. This administrative status of Layyah was short-lived and the British reduced it to the level of Tehsil headquarters, making it a part of Dera Ismail Khan. In 1901, Layyah was transferred to the new District of Mianwali. Later on, it was made part of the Muzaffargarh District. In 1982, Layyah Tehsil was upgraded to District headquarters comprising three Tehsils: Layyah, Karor and Chaubara. The municipality was created in 1875.History Layyah .

It is endemic to hill and montane rainforest in New Guinea. Description Pesquet's parrot is a large parrot with a total length of approximately and a weight of . Its plumage is black, with greyish scaling to the chest, and a red belly, uppertail coverts and wing-panels. The adult male has a red spot behind the eye, which is not seen in the adult female. Compared to most other parrots it appears unusually small-headed, in part due to the bare black facial skin and the relatively long, hooked bill. This rather vulture-like profile is the reason behind its alternative common name. File:PesquetsParrot03.jpgFemale profile showing vulturine features - taken at Cincinnati Zoo File:Psittrichas fulgidus -Jurong Bird Park-8a.jpgUpper body Behaviour Pesquet's parrot is a highly specialised frugivore, feeding almost exclusively on a few species of figs. Flowers and nectar have also been reported. At least in parts of its range, it is seasonally nomadic in response to the availability of fruits. The bare part of the head is presumably an adaptation to avoid feather-matting from sticky fruits. Little is known about its breeding habits in the wild. Typically it lays two eggs in a nest in a large, hollow tree. It is typically seen in pairs or groups up to 20 individuals. In flight, it alternates between rapid flapping and short glides. Status Its feathers are highly prized. This, combined with high prices in aviculture, has resulted in over hunting. Habitat loss also presents an ongoing problem. For these reasons, it is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Pesquet's parrot is listed on Appendix II of CITES. References * Collar, N. J.

As member, he wrote in 1919 two famous Minutes of Dissent in the Despatches on Indian Constitutional Reforms, pointing out the various defects of British rule in India and suggesting reforms. For an Indian to offer such criticism and make such demands was incredible in those days. The British government accepted most of his recommendations. Nair resigned from the Viceroy's Council in the aftermath of Jalianwalabagh massacre on April 13, 1919. He played an active part in the Indian National movement which was gathering force in those days. In 1897, when the First Provincial Conference met in Madras, he was invited to preside over it. The same year, when the Indian National Congress assembled at Amaravathi, he was chosen its president. In a masterly address, he referred to the highhandedness of foreign administration, called for reforms and asked for self-government for India with Dominion Status. In 1900, he was a member of the Madras Legislative Council. His official life from 1908 to 1921 interrupted his activities as a free political worker. In 1928, he was the President of the Indian Central Committee to co-operate with the Simon Commission. The Committee prepared a well-argued report asking for Dominion Status for India.

Bellows on the 1960s American sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Early life Rorke was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1910. He was the son of screen and stage actress Margaret Rorke (n√©e Hayden),Rorke's obituary in the Los Angeles Times says, \\"His mother ... was a longtime textile industry figure and created colors used in the inaugural ball gowns of both Eleanor Roosevelt and Mamie Eisenhower.\\" and he took his stage forename from her maiden name.\\"'I Dream Of Jeannie' Star Barbara Eden Unbottles Her Tragic Life in Memoir\\", p. 153-154, 173 He attended Brooklyn Preparatory School, a Jesuit school, where he served as president of the Dramatics Society and the Student Government and a member of the Omega Gamma Delta Fraternity. He continued his education at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his stage career in the 1930s with the Hampden Theatrical Company. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army, where he made his film debut in the musical This Is the Army starring Ronald Reagan, for which he was uncredited as the stage manager and as a soldier in the background. Acting career Following the war, he left the Army and worked in small parts on Broadway, returning to Hollywood for the film Lust for Gold (1949), again uncredited. However, it was an opening, and in later films, beginning with Rope of Sand, he is listed in the credits, although he again shows up uncredited in the films Kim (1950) and The Magnificent Yankee (1950), as well as a couple of later films such as the Academy Award-winning An American in Paris (in those days, small roles were often uncredited). He played the role of crooked businessman and murderer Arne Mason in episode 90 \\"Word of Honor\\" of the television series The Lone Ranger in 1952. He also appeared in episode 125 entitled \\"The Perfect Crime\\" of that television series in 1953. He continued to make movies, taking on supporting roles in films. In 1957, Rorke played Steve, the film agent, in the television series Mr. Adams and Eve, starring Howard Duff and Ida Lupino (then married in real life) as a fictitious acting couple residing in Beverly Hills, California. He played several guest roles on television, winning the role of Colonel Farnsworth in the short-lived 1964 sitcom No Time for Sergeants, based on the Andy Griffith film of the same name, but starring Sammy Jackson. He also guest-starred on three episodes of CBS's Perry Mason between 1960 and 1963. In his first role, he played the title character, Jay Holbrook, in \\"The Case of the Flighty Father\\" and as Walter Caffrey in \\"The Case of the Violent Vest\\". Rorke also appeared in television programs such as I Love Lucy, The Twilight Zone, \\" Thriller\\" where he also plays a psychologist, Peter Gunn, The Andy Griffith Show, Barnaby Jones, Mister Ed, Wonder Woman, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, and The Love Boat. Rorke was best known for his role as Dr. Bellows, the NASA medical officer in the television sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Bellows was constantly trying to figure out why Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), an astronaut under Bellows' supervision, often behaves strangely, and to decipher the madcap antics, but he never figures out what is actually going on. Bellows usually winds up making himself look like a fool in front of his own superiors. Rorke's last film was reprising his role in the television reunion movie I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later (1985). In the early 1980s, Rorke returned to the theater, making a number of live stage appearances. In May, 1980, he starred with Joan Caulfield at the old Showboat Dinner Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida, in The Pleasure of His Company. He also acted in Mr. Roberts in St. Louis, Missouri, Personal life and death Rorke's I Dream of Jeannie co-star Barbara Eden described him as a \\"prince\\" who was a good friend to all and always managed to keep up the spirits of the Jeannie cast, even in difficult circumstances. Eden also wrote in her 2011 biography Jeannie Out of the Bottle that Rorke was \\"unashamedly gay\\", and that his partner, director Justus Addiss (of Mister Ed, among others), lived together for many years in Studio City, along with their menagerie of dogs, until his death in 1987. The couple would often invite the cast over for parties. Rorke died of multiple myeloma at his Toluca Lake home in 1987 at age 76. He was survived by two brothers.

It was produced by Niko Bolas, except \\"Afternoon Song\\", which was produced by Riku Mattila. It featured guest musicians, guitarist Adrian Portas and Clive Layton, who played the hammond organ on \\"Fate\\". After the break from EMI, The Love of Hopeless Causes was the band's only album to be released on Epic, prior to the formation of the band's own label, Attack Attack Records. The album saw the band abandoning the folk rock- oriented sound of their previous albums, Thunder and Consolation (1989) and Impurity (1990), going for a more classic straightforward rock sound. The album reached No. 22 on the UK Albums Chart in April 1993. Singles and EPs \\"Here Comes the War\\" (February 1993) was the only single released from the album and is their highest charting single in the UK, peaking at No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Living in the Rose\\" was the title track of The Ballads EP (July 1993). Versions The album was released as a 10-track LP, cassette and CD on 29 March 1993. There are no track differences between the formats.

It is the only stretch of Heritage Coast on the English coastline between the Welsh and Scottish borders, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The sea off the Head is protected as part of the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation Zone. It lies on two long-distance footpaths, the Cumbria Coastal Way and Wainwright Coast to Coast. Both long-distance footpaths follow the edge of the cliffs, which rise to 90 metres above sea level and have views of the Cumbrian mountains and coast. North Head The North Head The true geographical head is the North Head, which is the most westerly point of Northern England and is the site of St Bees Lighthouse. During WW2 a radar station was operated from here, and some of the buildings can still be seen adjacent to the lighthouse. The foghorn building is to the west of the lighthouse, but is now disused. The lighthouse is still operating, but is unmanned. Next to the coastal path north of the lighthouse is Birkhams quarry which is still in use for extracting St Bees sandstone. The rocks on the sea platform at the North Head are now a bouldering area used by climbers, and there are a number of bolted climbing routes on the cliff itself. =Bird reserve= Guillemots on the North Head The RSPB maintains a reserve, which includes kittiwakes, fulmars, guillemots, razorbills, cormorants, puffins, shags and herring gulls. It is the only breeding place in England for black guillemots. Several other birds are known to use this site regularly for breeding and these include the tawny owl, sparrowhawk, peregrine, raven and the rock pipit, which is known to breed in only one other site in Cumbria. There are observation stations on the North Head footpath. South Head The South Head is known locally as \\"Tomlin\\" and dominates the long sandy St Bees Beach. At the top of the footpath from St Bees are the remains of the coastguard lookout. This now has a viewing table in its ruins. Fleswick Bay Between the two headlands is Fleswick Bay. This is accessible only on foot or from the sea, and consists of a shingle beach on a wave cut platform bounded by high sandstone cliffs. The coast to coast walk descends to the bay en route to the North Head. Flora Sea Lavender The rugged cliff face supports diverse flora mainly due to the nature of the rock formations. Species found lower down are sea pink or thrift (Armeria maritima), common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis), sea campion (Silene uniflora), sea spleenwort (Asplenium marinum), rock samphire (Crithmum maritimum) and the rare rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). Near the cliff top is bloody cranesbill (Geranium sanguineum) wood vetch (Vicia sylvatica), orpine (Sedum telephium) and soft shield-fern (Polystichum setiferum). Along the cliff top, there can be found dyer‚Äôs greenweed (Genista tinctoria), western gorse (Ulex gallii), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Physical features The cliffs are composed of a red Permian and Triassic sandstone about 200 Million years old. St Bees sandstone was created by water- borne sand and has a very small grain size, making it a very workable stone still much in demand for building. The mica in the stone gives it a sparkling effect. St Bees sandstone occurs as far north as Brampton, but it is named after its most prominent outcrop here at St Bees. The SSSI citation carries a description of the interesting geological features. On the headland itself is evidence of erosional features, wave cut notch and a wave-cut platform. On St Bees Beach to the south to lessen the effects of longshore drift, a row of nine groynes have been put in place. Further south, St Bees Beach is backed by small mud cliffs which are a common place to study the glacial moraines that formed them. The shingle both at St Bees and Fleswick bay show a huge variety of glacier-borne stones.

He is co-founder and CEO of Within (Virtual Reality) (formerly Vrse), a virtual reality technology company, and co-founder of Here Be Dragons (formerly Vrse.works), a virtual reality production company. Milk began his career directing music videos and commercials for leading artists and brands, and in subsequent years became best known for bridging the gap between emerging technologies and new mediums for storytelling. Milk's work has been exhibited in museums worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, the Barbican Centre in London, Cent Quatre in Paris, and the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. Milk has been honored twice with the Grand Prix Cannes Lions, the D&AD; Black Pencil, the Grand Clio, and SXSW's 'Best of Show' alongside multiple Grammy nominations, MTV Moon Men, and the UK MVA Innovation Award. Milk was named one of WIRED's 100 Most Influential People in 2016, one of The Hollywood Reporter's L.A.'s 25 Most Powerful Digital Players in 2016, Adweeks Creative 100 list in 2015, as one of the 50 Most Creative People by Advertising Age in 2011 and 2015, and one of the \\"100 Most Creative People in Business\\" by Fast Company in 2012. Milk presented at TED in 2015 on the power of virtual reality as a medium to advance humanity, and again in 2016 on the birth of virtual reality as a new art form.  Early life  Milk was born in Glen Cove, New York. After attending Friends Academy High School, Milk studied Music and Film at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then earned a B.F.A. in Film, Photography and Computer Graphics at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, California.  Career  = Music videos, commercials, short films and interactive = Milk began his career directing music videos and commercials for artists and brands including Arcade Fire, U2, Kanye West, Green Day, Johnny Cash, Gnarls Barkley, The Chemical Brothers, John Mellencamp, Courtney Love, Modest Mouse, Nike, O2, Chevy and Nintendo. Milk's collaboration with Kanye West on the single \\"All Falls Down\\" was shot entirely in first person perspective, a technique he utilized again in a commercial for O2's \\"Can Do\\" campaign and his short film \\"The Last Day Dream\\", signaling his future affinity for virtual reality and subjective storytelling. Milk collaborated again with Kanye West on the video for \\"Touch The Sky\\", which was in part an homage to Evel Knievel, a childhood hero of Milk's. Milk's collaboration with Arcade Fire, Aaron Koblin and Google Creative Lab on \\"The Wilderness Downtown\\" in 2010 was one of his first interactive videos that utilized emerging technologies to create new, more personal ways for viewers to connect with digital experiences. The browser based video uses HTML5, satellite imagery and Google Street View to incorporate images from a viewer's childhood home mixed with digital footage and CGI elements. At the end of the video, viewers are encouraged to write a postcard to their younger selves. \\"The Wilderness Downtown\\" was named as one of Times 30 Best Music Videos of all time, saying, \\"It‚Äôs the first video that truly harnesses the digital age ‚Äî and one of the most personal you‚Äôll ever watch.\\" It was also was exhibited at MoMA in New York in 2011. Screen capture from \\"The Johnny Cash Project\\" Also in 2010, Milk created \\"The Johnny Cash Project\\", a collaboration with Aaron Koblin set to the Johnny Cash song \\"Ain't No Grave\\". In the interactive music video, users can submit drawn frames to be curated into an animated short film built upon a myriad of frames submitted by different users. As a result, the video constantly evolves and can be arranged by a set of various criteria. Users can elect to view the highest rated frames, or all frames that are done in a pointillist or abstract style, for example. NPR suggested that the digital experience allowed fans to connect with Cash posthumously. Still Image from \\"3 Dreams of Black\\" In 2011, Milk collaborated again with Aaron Koblin and Google Creative Lab on the interactive short film \\"3 Dreams of Black\\" based on the track of the same name from the Danger Mouse album Rome, which features Daniele Luppi, Jack White and Norah Jones. Here, Milk used WebGL to turn a user's web browser into a canvas for creating 3D objects within an interactive, CGI setting. When viewing the film, which is also told from first person perspective, users can control the vantage point with the use of their mouse. As the user's mouse hovers over the browser window playing the film, 3D objects appear and proliferate within the world of the film. Users can create additional 3D objects to add to the film within the film's website. In 2008, Milk directed Second Unit for \\"A Mother's Promise\\", the film that introduced Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention. = Immersive installations = \\"Summer Into Dust\\" at Coachella 2011 Milk collaborated with Arcade Fire, ESKI and Moment Factory in 2011 to create an interactive experience called \\"Summer Into Dust\\" for concert goers at the closing of the 2011 Coachella Music Festival. During Arcade Fire's final song, \\"Wake Up\\", cascades of beach balls were released onto the crowd. Milk and his team had fit LEDs and IR transmitters into each ball to light paint kaleidoscopic patterns across the audience. The balls physically connected the audience with the band and their performance, and the moment has been widely credited as the highlight of the festival. \\"The Treachery of Sanctuary\\" In 2012, Milk created \\"The Treachery of Sanctuary\\", an interactive immersive art installation currently touring the world with The Creators Project. It is a large-scale interactive installation that utilizes the Microsoft Kinect to project and manipulate a participant's shadow onto a triptych. In the first panel, shadows of birds congregate to form the participant's shadow. In the second panel, the participant's shadow is torn apart by the birds. In the third, the participant's shadow sprouts wings, allowing the shadow to fly out of the frame as the participant flaps their arms. The triptych created a cycle that according to Milk interprets the universal human experience of birth, death and transfiguration. \\"The Treachery of Sanctuary\\" was exhibited at the Onassis Cultural center in Greece, and was selected to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival's New Frontier exhibition in January 2016. Also in 2012, Milk collaborated with Aaron Koblin to create \\"The Exquisite Forest\\", a collaborative online experience that allows participants to create branching animated narratives. In the piece, a series of trees represent a series of narratives, each beginning with the seed of an initial animation. As participants create new animations to add to the narrative, the animated trees branch out, creating a representation of the multiple narratives spawned by user input. The piece was exhibited at the Tate Modern in London between 2012 and 2013. = Virtual reality = Milk's binaural audio recording instrument Beck in \\"Sound and Vision\\" Milk's first virtual reality production was a collaboration with musical artist Beck entitled \\"Sound and Vision\\". The project was initially released online, giving viewers the choice to watch Beck perform from the vantage point of different 360 degree cameras, and further allowed viewers to use their computer's mouse to change their viewing perspective. Milk invented a binaural audio recording instrument in order to capture sound in a 3D environment to mimic real life human experience. The result allows the audio to shift perspective in accordance with what the viewer is seeing, creating a natural virtual experience for the audience member. In the tradition of his work on \\"The Wilderness Downtown\\" and Rome, Milk utilized modern technologies to further expand the viewing experience: viewers could enable their computer's webcam to shift the perspective of the 360 video up, down, left and right with the tilt of their head. In 2014, Milk and Aaron Koblin founded Within (Virtual Reality) (formerly Vrse), a virtual reality technology company and sister company Vrse.works. Within is a leading virtual reality company that builds the technology to create and distribute the most innovative human stories in virtual reality. Sister company Here Be Dragons (formerly Vrse.works) has partnered with top talent in film and television and represents a world class roster of directors for virtual reality content creation. The company has already produced award-winning immersive content including Clouds Over Sidra with the United Nations, and work with The New York Times, Vice, NBC, and Nike. Vrse.farm is working in partnership with Megan Ellison's Annapurna Pictures to develop original cinematic work in virtual reality. The Within app is currently available on iOS and Android, works with Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR, and will be available on the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR and HTC Vive when they are released to the public in 2016. = Virtual reality projects = Through Withinhttps://www.cnet.com/news/virtual-reality-company-vrse-dubs-itself- within-raises-12-million/ and Vrse.works, Milk has explored Virtual Reality as a means to tell documentaries, narratives, and share live experiences. Still Image from \\"Evolution of Verse\\" Still Image from \\"Waves of Grace\\" In December 2014, Milk and Spike Jonze captured the Millions March in New York, which protested police brutality for Vice News. Milk launched the Within app platform at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in addition to \\"Evolution of Verse\\", a photo-realistic CGI-rendered 3-D virtual reality film, and \\"Clouds Over Sidra\\", a virtual reality documentary made in partnership with the United Nations which follows a 12-year-old girl's life in a Syrian refugee camp. After the Sundance launch, Vrse.works captured Saturday Night Live‚Äôs 40th Anniversary special in VR. Milk created \\"Walking New York\\" with Zach Richter, a VR experience made in partnership with The New York Times which follows French artist JR and his making of a 150-foot-tall portrait of a recent immigrant to NYC that was wheat pasted across the Flatiron Building Pedestrian Plaza for less than 24 hours. Vrse.works recently partnered again with the United Nations to create the VR experience Waves of Grace. The film transports viewers to West Point, the most populous slum in the capital of Liberia, and follows the experience of Decontee Davis, an Ebola survivor who uses her immunity to help others affected by the disease. Most recently, Milk and his team have released music videos for U2 and Muse in partnership with Apple Music. In the video for U2‚Äôs \\"Song for Someone,\\" singers from around the world sing alongside U2 within the virtual environment. In Muse‚Äôs \\"Revolt,\\" viewers watch from the point of view of multiple drones as the music spawns a revolution.

These measures may be economy-wide, sector-specific (usually the financial sector), or industry specific (for example, \\"strategic\\" industries). They may apply to all flows, or may differentiate by type or duration of the flow (debt, equity, direct investment; short-term vs. medium- and long-term). Types of capital control include exchange controls that prevent or limit the buying and selling of a national currency at the market rate, caps on the allowed volume for the international sale or purchase of various financial assets, transaction taxes such as the proposed Tobin tax on currency exchanges, minimum stay requirements, requirements for mandatory approval, or even limits on the amount of money a private citizen is allowed to remove from the country. There have been several shifts of opinion on whether capital controls are beneficial and in what circumstances they should be used. Capital controls were an integral part of the Bretton Woods system which emerged after World War II and lasted until the early 1970s. This period was the first time capital controls had been endorsed by mainstream economics. In the 1970s free market economists became increasingly successful in persuading their colleagues that capital controls were in the main harmful. The USA, other western governments, and multilateral financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank began to take a critical view of capital controls and persuaded many countries to abandon them to facilitate financial globalization. The Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s, the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the Russian ruble crisis of 1998‚Äì99, and the global financial crisis of 2008, however, highlighted the risks associated with the volatility of capital flows, and led many countries ‚Äî even those with relatively open capital accounts ‚Äî to make use of capital controls alongside macroeconomic and prudential policies as means to dampen the effects of volatile flows on their economies. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, as capital inflows surged to emerging market economies, a group of economists at the IMF outlined the elements of a policy toolkit to manage the macroeconomic and financial-stability risks associated with capital flow volatility. The proposed toolkit allowed a role for capital controls.Jonathan D. Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, Karl Habermeier, Marcos Chamon, Mahvash S. Qureshi, and Dennis B.S. Reinhardt (2010-02-19). \\"Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls.\\" Staff Position Note 10/04. International Monetary Fund. The study, as well as a successor study focusing on financial-stability concerns stemming from capital flow volatility,Jonathan D. Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, Karl Habermeier, Luc Laeven, Marcos Chamon, Mahvash S.

More widespread use of capital controls, however, raises a host of multilateral coordination issues, as enunciated for example by the G-20, echoing the concerns voiced by John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White more than six decades ago.Jonathan D. Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, and Anton Korinek (2012b) ‚ÄúMultilateral Aspects of Managing the Capital Account,‚Äù SDN/12/10. International Monetary Fund.  History  =Pre World War I= Prior to the 19th century there was generally little need for capital controls due to low levels of international trade and financial integration. In the first age of globalisation which is generally dated from 1870‚Äì1914, capital controls remained largely absent.Some of the few pre WWI capital controls had political rather than economic motivations, e.g. between Germany and France after the 1871 Franco Prussian war, but there were a few controls implemented with economic justifications, although not endorsed by mainstream economists. =World War I to World War II: 1914‚Äì1945= Highly restrictive capital controls were introduced with the outbreak of World War I. In the 1920s they were generally relaxed, only to be strengthened again in the wake of the 1929 Great Crash. This was more an ad hoc response to potentially damaging flows rather than based on a change in normative economic theory. Economic historian Barry Eichengreen has implied that the use of capital controls peaked during World War II, but the more general view is that the most wide-ranging implementation occurred after Bretton Woods. An example of capital control in the interwar period was the Reich Flight Tax, introduced in 1931 by German Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning. The tax was needed to limit the removal of capital from the country by wealthy residents. At the time Germany was suffering economic hardship due to the Great Depression and the harsh war reparations imposed after World War I. Following the ascension of the Nazis to power in 1933, the tax was repurposed to confiscate money and property from Jews fleeing the state-sponsored anti-Semitism. =The Bretton Woods Era: 1945‚Äì1971= Bretton Woods At the end of World War II, international capital was \\"caged\\" by the imposition of strong and wide-ranging capital controls as part of the newly created Bretton Woods system‚Äîit was perceived that this would help protect the interests of ordinary people and the wider economy. These measures were popular as at this time the western public's view of international bankers was generally very low, blaming them for the Great Depression. Keynes, one of the principal architects of the Bretton Woods system, envisaged capital controls as a permanent feature of the international monetary system, though he had agreed current account convertibility should be adopted once international conditions had stabilised sufficiently. This essentially meant that currencies were to be freely convertible for the purposes of international trade in goods and services, but not for capital account transactions. Most industrial economies relaxed their controls around 1958 to allow this to happen. The other leading architect of Bretton Woods, the American Harry Dexter White, and his boss Henry Morgenthau, were somewhat less radical than Keynes, but still agreed on the need for permanent capital controls. In his closing address to the Bretton Woods conference, Morgenthau spoke of how the measures adopted would drive \\"the usurious money lenders from the temple of international finance.\\" Following the Keynesian Revolution, the first two decades after World War II saw little argument against capital controls from economists, though an exception was Milton Friedman. However, from the late 1950s the effectiveness of capital controls began to break down, in part due to innovations such as the Eurodollar market. According to Dani Rodrik it is unclear to what extent this was due to an unwillingness on the part of governments to respond effectively, as compared with an inability to do so. Eric Helleiner has argued that heavy lobbying from Wall Street bankers was a factor in persuading American authorities not to subject the Eurodollar market to capital controls. From the late 1960s the prevailing opinion among economists began to switch to the view that capital controls are on the whole more harmful than beneficial. While many of the capital controls in this era were directed at international financiers and banks, some were directed at individual citizens. For example, in the 1960s, British individuals were at one point restricted from taking more than ¬£50 with them out of the country for their foreign holidays. In their book This Time Is Different, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff suggest that the use of capital controls in this period, even more than its rapid economic growth, was responsible for the very low level of banking crises that occurred in the Bretton Woods era. =post Bretton Woods era: 1971‚Äì2009= By the late 1970s, as part of the displacement of Keynesianism in favour of free market orientated policies and theories, countries began abolishing their capital controls, starting between 1973‚Äì4 with the U.S., Canada, Germany and Switzerland and followed by the United Kingdom in 1979. Most other advanced and emerging economies followed, chiefly in the 1980s and early 1990s. During the period spanning from approximately 1980‚Äì2009, the normative opinion was that capital controls were to be avoided except perhaps in a crisis. It was widely held that the absence of controls allowed capital to freely flow to where it is needed most, helping not only investors to enjoy good returns, but also helping ordinary people to benefit from economic growth.Giovanni Dell‚ÄôAriccia, Julian di Giovanni, Andre Faria, Ayhan Kose, Paolo Mauro, Jonathan D. Ostry, Martin Schindler, and Marco Terrones, 2008, ‚ÄúReaping the Benefits of Financial Globalization,‚Äù IMF Occasional Paper No. 264 (International Monetary Fund). During the 1980s many emerging economies decided or were coerced into following the advanced economies by abandoning their capital controls, though over 50 retained them at least partially. The orthodox view that capital controls are a bad thing was challenged following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Asian nations that had retained their capital controls such as India and China could credit them for allowing them to escape the crisis relatively unscathed.China and India still retain capital controls as late as 2010. Malaysia's prime minister Mahathir bin Mohamad imposed capital controls as an emergency measure in September 1998, both strict exchange controls and limits on outflows from portfolio investments ‚Äì these were found to be effective in containing the damage from the crisis. In the early 1990s even some pro-globalization economists like Jagdish BhagwatiJagdish Bhagwati (2004) In defense of Globalization. Oxford University Press; pp.199‚Äì207 and some writers in publications like The Economist,The Economist (2003) A place for capital controls spoke out in favor of a limited role for capital controls. But while many developing world economies lost faith in the free market consensus, it remained strong among western nations. =After 2008 global crisis: 2009 and later= By 2009, the global financial crisis had caused a resurgence in Keynesian thought which reversed the previously prevailing orthodoxy. During the 2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis, the IMF proposed that capital controls on outflows should be imposed by Iceland, calling them \\"an essential feature of the monetary policy framework, given the scale of potential capital outflows.\\"IMF Completes First Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Iceland, Extends Arrangement, and Approves US$167.5 Million Disbursement, Press Release No. 09/375, October 28, 2009 In the latter half of 2009, as the global economy started to recover from the Global Financial Crisis, capital inflows to emerging market economies‚Äîespecially, in Asia and Latin America‚Äîsurged, raising macroeconomic and financial-stability risks. Several emerging market economies responded to these concerns by adopting capital controls or macroprudential measures; for example, Brazil imposed a tax on the purchase of financial assets by foreigners and Taiwan restricted overseas investors from buying Time deposits. The partial return to favor of capital controls is linked to a wider emerging consensus among policy makers for the greater use of macroprudential policy. According to economics journalist Paul Mason, international agreement for the global adoption of Macro prudential policy was reached at the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit ‚Äì an agreement which Mason said had seemed impossible at the London summit which took place only a few months before. Pro capital control statements by various prominent economists, together with an influential staff position note prepared by IMF economists in February 2010 (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2010), and a follow-up note prepared in April 2011, have been hailed as an \\"end of an era\\" that eventually led to a change in the IMF's long held position that capital controls should be used only in extremis, as a last resort, and on a temporary basis. In June 2010 The Financial Times published several articles on the growing trend towards using capital controls. They noted influential voices from the Asian Development Bank and World Bank had joined the IMF in advising there is a role for capital controls. The FT reported on the recent tightening of controls in Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Russia. In Indonesia recently implemented controls include a one-month minimum holding period for certain securities. In South Korea limits have been placed on currency forward positions. In Taiwan the access that foreigner investors have to certain bank deposits has been restricted. The FT cautioned that imposing controls has a downside including the creation of possible future problems in attracting funds. By September 2010, emerging economies had experienced huge capital inflows resulting from carry trades made attractive to market participants by the expansionary monetary policies several large economies had undertaken over the previous two years as a response to the crisis. This has led to countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, Russia and Poland further reviewing the possibility of increasing their capital controls as a response. In October, with reference to increased concern about capital flows and widespread talk of an imminent Currency war, financier George Soros has suggested that capital controls are going to become much more widely used over the next few years. But several analysts have questioned whether controls will be effective for most countries, with Chile's finance minister saying his country had no plans to use them. In February 2011, citing evidence from new IMF research (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2010) that restricting short-term capital inflows could lower financial-stability risks, over 250 economists headed by Joseph Stiglitz wrote a letter to the Obama administration asking them to remove clauses from various bilateral trade agreements that allow the use of capital controls to be penalized. There was strong counter lobbying by business and so far the US administration has not acted on the call, although some figures such as Treasury secretary Tim Geithner have spoken out in support of capital controls at least in certain circumstances. Econometric analyses undertaken by the IMF,Jonathan D. Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, Marcos Chamon, Mahvash S. Qureshi, 2012a, \\"Tools for Managing Financial-Stability Risks from Capital Inflows,\\" Journal of International Economics, vol. 88(2), pp. 407‚Äì421. and other academic economists found that in general countries which deployed capital controls weathered the 2008 crisis better than comparable countries which did not. In April 2011 the IMF published its first ever set of guidelines for the use of capital controls. At November's 2011 G-20 Cannes summit, the G20 agreed that developing countries should have even greater freedom to use capital controls than the IMF guidelines allow. A few weeks later the Bank of England published a paper where they broadly welcomed the G20's decision in favor of even greater use of capital controls, though they caution that compared to developing countries, advanced economies may find it harder to implement efficient controls. Not all momentum has been in favor of increased use of capital controls however. For example, in December 2011 China partially loosened its controls on inbound capital flows, which the Financial Times described as reflecting an ongoing desire by Chinese authorities for further liberalization. India also lifted some of its controls on inbound capital in early January 2012, drawing criticism from economist Arvind Subramanian who considers relaxing capital controls a good policy for China but not for India considering her different economic circumstances. In September 2012, Michael W. Klein of Tufts University challenged the emergent consensus that short-term capital controls can be beneficial, publishing a preliminary study that found the measures used by countries like Brazil had been ineffective (at least up to 2010). Klein argues it was only countries with long term capital controls, such as China and India, that have enjoyed measurable protection from adverse capital flows.Capital Controls: Gates and Walls by Michael W. Klein (Tufts), September 2012 In the same month, Ila Patnaik and Ajay Shah of NIPFP published an article about the permanent and comprehensive capital controls in India, which seem to have been ineffective in achieving the goals of macroeconomic policy.Did the Indian capital controls work as a tool of macroeconomic policy?, IMF Economic Review, September 2012. However, other studies have found that capital controls may lower financial stability risks, while the controls Brazilian authorities adopted after the 2008 financial crisis did have some beneficial effect on Brazil itself.Navigating Capital Flows in Brazil and Chile by Brittany Baumann and Kevin Gallagher (BU), June 2012 Yet capital controls may have externalities: some empirical studies find that capital flows were diverted to other countries as capital controls were tightened in Brazil.Capital Controls and Spillover Effects: Evidence from Latin-American Countries by Frederic J. Lambert, Julio Ramos-Tallada and Cyril Rebillard (Banque de France), December 2011Bubble Thy Neighbor: Portfolio Effects and Externalities from Capital Controls by Kristin J. Forbes (MIT), April 2012 An IMF staff discussion (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2012) note explores the multilateral consequences of capital controls, and the desirability of international cooperation to achieve globally efficient outcomes. It flags three issues of potential concern. First is the possibility that capital controls may be used as a substitute for warranted external adjustment (for example, when inflow controls are used to sustain an undervalued currency). Second, the imposition of capital controls by one country may deflect some capital towards other recipient countries, exacerbating their inflow problem. Third, policies in source countries (including monetary policy) may exacerbate problems faced by capital-receiving countries if they increase the volume or riskiness of capital flows. The paper argues however that if capital controls are justified from a national standpoint (in terms of reducing domestic distortions), then under a range of circumstances they should be pursued even if they give rise to cross-border spillovers. But if policies in one country exacerbate existing distortions in other countries, and it is costly for other countries to respond, then multilateral coordination of unilateral policies is likely to be beneficial. Coordination may require borrowers to reduce inflow controls or an agreement with lenders to partially internalize the risks from excessively large or risky outflows. On December 2012, the IMF published a staff paper which further expanded on their recent support for the limited use of capital controls. =The impossible trinity trilemma= The history of capital controls is sometimes discussed in relation to the impossible trinity (trilemma, the unholy trinity)‚Äì the finding that its impossible for a nation's economic policy to simultaneously deliver more than two of the following three desirable macroeconomic goals: 1) A fixed exchange rate, 2) an independent monetary policy, 3) free movement for capital (absence of capital controls). In the first age of globalization, governments largely chose to pursue a stable exchange rate while allowing freedom of movement for capital. The sacrifice was that their monetary policy was largely dictated by international conditions, not by the needs of the domestic economy. In the Bretton woods period, governments were free to have both generally stable exchange rates and independent monetary policies at the price of capital controls. The impossible trinity concept was especially influential during this era as a justification for capital controls. In the Washington consensus period, advanced economies generally chose to allow freedom of capital and to continue maintaining an independent monetary policy while accepting a floating or semi-floating exchange rate.  Capital controls in the EU and EFTA  The free flow of capital is one of the Four Freedoms of the European Single Market. Despite the progress that has been made, Europe's capital markets remain fragmented along national lines and European economies remain heavily reliant on the banking sector for their funding needs. Within the building on the Investment Plan for Europe, for a closer integration of capital markets, in 2015, the Commission adopted the Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) setting out a list of key measures to achieve a true single market for capital in Europe, which deepens the existing Banking Union, because this revolves around disintermediated, market-based forms of financing, which should represent an alternative to the traditionally predominant (in Europe) bank-based financing channel. The project is a political signal to strengthen the Single Market as a project of all 28 Member States, instead of just the Eurozone countries, and sent a strong signal to the UK to remain an active part of the EU, before Brexit. However, there have been three instances of capital controls in the EU and EFTA since 2008all of them triggered by banking crises. = Iceland (2008‚Äì2017) = In its 2008 financial crisis, Iceland (which is a member of the European Free Trade Area but not the European Union) imposed capital controls due to the collapse of its banking system. Iceland's government said in June 2015 that it planned to lift them ‚Äì however, since the announced plans included a tax on taking capital out of the country, arguably they still constituted capital controls. The Icelandic government announced that capital controls had been lifted on 12 March 2017. University of California, Berkeley economist J√≥n Steinsson said in 2017 that he had opposed the introduction of capital controls in Iceland during the crisis but that the experience in Iceland had made him change his mind: \\"The government needed to finance very large deficits. The imposition of capital controls locked a considerable amount of foreign capital in the country. It stands to reason that these funds substantially lowered the government‚Äôs financing cost, and it is unlikely that the government could have done nearly as much deficit spending without capital controls.\\" = Republic of Cyprus (2013‚Äì2015) = Cyprus, a Eurozone member state which is closely linked to Greece, imposed the Eurozone's first temporary capital controls in 2013 as part of its response to its 2012 banking crisis. These capital controls were lifted in 2015, with the last controls being removed in April 2015. = Greece (2015‚Äì2019) = Since the Greek debt crisis intensified in the 2010s decade, Greece has implemented capital controls. At the end of August, the Greek government announced that the last capital restrictions would be lifted as of 1 September 2019, about 50 months after they were introduced. Adoption of Prudential Measures The prudential capital controls measure distinguishes itself from the general capital controls as summarized above as it is one of the prudential regulations that aims to mitigate the systemic risk, reduce the business cycle volatility, increase the macroeconomic stability, and enhance the social welfare. It generally regulates inflows only and take ex-ante policy interventions. The \\"prudence\\" requirement says that such regulation should curb and manage the excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethought to prevent an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. The \\"ex-ante\\" timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy. Free movement of capital and payments International Finance Centre in Hong Kong would likely oppose capital controls, and attempt to argue that they would not work. Full freedom of movement for capital and payments has so far only been approached between individual pairings of states which have free trade agreements and relative freedom from capital controls, such as Canada and the U.S., or the complete freedom within regions such as the European Union, with its \\"Four Freedoms\\" and the Eurozone. During the first age of globalization that was brought to an end by World War I, there were very few restrictions on the movement of capital, but all major economies except for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands heavily restricted payments for goods by the use of current account controls such as tariffs and duties. There is no consensus on whether capital control restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments across national borders benefits developing countries. Many economists agree, however, that lifting capital controls while inflationary pressures persist, the country is in debt and foreign currency reserves are low, will not be beneficial. When capital controls were lifted under these conditions in Argentina the peso lost 30 percent of its value relative to the dollar. Most countries will lift capital controls during boom periods. According to a 2016 study, the implementation of capital controls can be beneficial in a two- country situation for the country that implements the capital controls. The effects of capital controls are more ambiguous when both countries implement capital controls. =Arguments in favour of free capital movement= Pro free market economists claim the following advantages for free movement of capital: * It enhances overall economic growth by allowing savings to be channelled to their most productive use. * By encouraging foreign direct investment, it helps developing economies to benefit from foreign expertise. * Allows states to raise funds from external markets to help them mitigate a temporary recession. * Enables both savers and borrowers to secure the best available market rate. * When controls include taxes, funds raised are sometimes siphoned off by corrupt government officials for their personal use. * Hawala- type traders across Asia have always been able to evade currency movement controls * Computer and communications technologies have made unimpeded electronic funds transfer a convenience for increasing numbers of bank customers. =Arguments in favour of capital controls= Pro capital control economists have made the following points. * Capital controls may represent an optimal macroprudential policy that reduces the risk of financial crises and prevents the associated externalities. * Global economic growth was on average considerably higher in the Bretton Woods periods where capital controls were widely in use. Using regression analysis, economists such as Dani Rodrik have found no positive correlation between growth and free capital movement. * Capital controls limiting a nation's residents from owning foreign assets can ensure that domestic credit is available more cheaply than would otherwise be the case. This sort of capital control is still in effect in both India and China. In India the controls encourage residents to provide cheap funds directly to the government, while in China it means that Chinese businesses have an inexpensive source of loans. * Economic crises have been considerably more frequent since the Bretton Woods capital controls were relaxed. Even economic historians who class capital controls as repressive have concluded that capital controls, more than the period's high growth, were responsible for the infrequency of crisis. Large uncontrolled capital inflows have frequently damaged a nation's economic development by causing its currency to appreciate, by contributing to inflation, and by causing unsustainable economic booms which often precede financial crises ‚Äì caused when the inflows sharply reverse and both domestic and foreign capital flee the country. The risk of crisis is especially high in developing economies where the inbound flows become loans denominated in foreign currency, so that the repayments become considerably more expensive as the developing country's currency depreciates. This is known as original sin.

The main role of disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by outbreak, epidemic, and pandemic situations, as well as increase knowledge about which factors contribute to such circumstances. A key part of modern disease surveillance is the practice of disease case reporting. In modern times, reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping, to instant worldwide internet communication. The number of cases could be gathered from hospitals ‚Äì which would be expected to see most of the occurrences ‚Äì collated, and eventually made public. With the advent of modern communication technology, this has changed dramatically. Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now can report cases and deaths from significant diseases within days ‚Äì sometimes within hours ‚Äì of the occurrence. Further, there is considerable public pressure to make this information available quickly and accurately. Mandatory reporting Formal reporting of notifiable infectious diseases is a requirement placed upon health care providers by many regional and national governments, and upon national governments by the World Health Organization to monitor spread as a result of the transmission of infectious agents. Since 1969, WHO has required that all cases of the following diseases be reported to the organization: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In 2005, the list was extended to include polio and SARS. Regional and national governments typically monitor a larger set of (around 80 in the U.S.) communicable diseases that can potentially threaten the general population. Tuberculosis, HIV, botulism, hantavirus, anthrax, and rabies are examples of such diseases. The incidence counts of diseases are often used as health indicators to describe the overall health of a population. World Health Organization The World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead agency for coordinating global response to major diseases. The WHO maintains Web sites for a number of diseases, and has active teams in many countries where these diseases occur. During the SARS outbreak in early 2004, for example, the Beijing staff of the WHO produced updates every few days for the duration of the outbreak. Beginning in January 2004, the WHO has produced similar updates for H5N1. These results are widely reported and closely watched. WHO's Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) to detect, verify rapidly and respond appropriately to epidemic-prone and emerging disease threats covers the following diseases: * Anthrax * Avian influenza * Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever * Dengue hemorrhagic fever * Ebola virus disease * Hepatitis * Influenza * Lassa fever * Marburg hemorrhagic fever * Meningococcal disease * Plague * Rift Valley fever * Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) * Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) * Smallpox * Tularaemia * Yellow fever Political challenges As the lead organization in global public health, the WHO occupies a delicate role in global politics. It must maintain good relationships with each of the many countries in which it is active. As a result, it may only report results within a particular country with the agreement of the country's government. Because some governments regard the release of any information on disease outbreaks as a state secret, this can place the WHO in a difficult position. The WHO coordinated International Outbreak Alert and Response is designed to ensure \\"outbreaks of potential international importance are rapidly verified and information is quickly shared within the Network\\" but not necessarily by the public; integrate and coordinate \\"activities to support national efforts\\" rather than challenge national authority within that nation in order to \\"respect the independence and objectivity of all partners\\". The commitment that \\"All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition\\" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight. Technical challenges Testing for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of antibodies that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1). Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread. There is currently little available data on the spread of H5N1 in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include: * Surveillance of wild bird populations * Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases H5N1 Surveillance of H5N1 in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread. H5N1 in China is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases have excluded China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers. (See Disease surveillance in China.) \\"Only half the world's human bird flu cases are being reported to the World Health Organization within two weeks of being detected, a response time that must be improved to avert a pandemic, a senior WHO official said Saturday. Shigeru Omi, WHO's regional director for the Western Pacific, said it is estimated that countries would have only two to three weeks to stamp out, or at least slow, a pandemic flu strain after it began spreading in humans.\\" David Nabarro, chief avian flu coordinator for the United Nations, says avian flu has too many unanswered questions. CIDRAP reported on 25 August 2006 on a new US government Web site that allows the public to view current information about testing of wild birds for H5N1 avian influenza which is part of a national wild-bird surveillance plan that \\"includes five strategies for early detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Sample numbers from three of these will be available on HEDDS: live wild birds, subsistence hunter-killed birds, and investigations of sick and dead wild birds. The other two strategies involve domestic bird testing and environmental sampling of water and wild-bird droppings. [‚Ä¶] A map on the new USGS site shows that birds from Alaska have been tested so far this year, with only a few from most other states. Last year officials tested just birds from Alaska and none from most other states, another map shows. The goal of the surveillance program for 2006 is to collect to samples from wild birds and environmental samples, officials have said\\".

It is north of Mount St. Patrick and San Josef Bay. On land, it is surrounded by forest, and only accessible by boat or a rough hiking trail. It was named by Captain James Hanna in 1786 after his vessel, the Sea Otter. At the mouth of the cove is a group of small islands called the Helen Islands. As is common on the west coast of Vancouver Island, there is a high annual rainfall. Danish immigrants established settlements in the area in the early 20th century, but the environment and isolation proved to be insurmountable. (A proposed road to connect Sea Otter Cove to the nearest communities was never built.) The last residents left in 1925. According to Don Douglass, among boaters, :Because Sea Otter Cove has a worse reputation than it deserves, it is frequently avoided. Margaret Sharcott wrote this description of her 1954 visit to Sea Otter Cove: :Just above the beach, the dark evergreen forest was almost black in the rain mists that hung over the whole cove. Above the beach, in the shadow of those sombre trees, were the remains of two old boat-houses, their rotting cedar poles and shakes black with the moisture of this wet land. Farther along, a tumble-down house leaned on its ancient foundations. Although the original clearing around the deserted farmhouse was dotted with young fir trees, I could still recognize the fruit trees that had been planted so long ago. Bits of fences and rotted scraps of board from wind-flattened out buildings protruded from the matted tangle of brown, withered grass, wild blackberry vines and encroaching brush.

Plot  The film Harold Van Pelham (Harold Lloyd) is a young, wealthy American businessman who obsesses constantly about his health, believing he is deathly sick while in reality he is perfectly fine. Determined to improve his physical condition with an extended rest in a \\"tropical\\" climate, Harold travels by passenger ship with his valet Mr. Pipps (Wallace Howe) and personal nurse (Jobyna Ralston) from California to \\"Paradiso\\", a small South American island off the coast of Chile.Transcribed intertitles from a televised presentation of Why Worry? broadcast on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), June 10, 2018; Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y. Retrieved June 11, 2018. Once in Paradiso, Harold does not find the peace and seclusion he is desperately seeking; instead, he stumbles into the midst of a revolution against the island's republic. The uprising is being organized and incited by Jim Blake (James Mason), a greedy \\"renegade\\" from the United States, who wants to overthrow Paradiso's government \\"to further his own financial interests\\". After being separated from his valet and nurse, Harold wanders about the island's main town, oblivious at first to the fact that an armed revolt has occurred. Blake soon arranges to have the bewildered hypochondriac thrown into the local prison. There Harold meets Colosso (John Aasen), a gigantic fellow prisoner who is described by the warden as a \\"wild hermit\\" and \\"half crazy with a terrible toothache\\". The cellmates quickly engineer an escape together, and Harold subsequently helps Colosso by pulling out his painful tooth. Much relieved, the huge man is eternally grateful and vows to do Harold's will. Harold now insists that the military conflict and social unrest on the island are \\"bad for my heart\\" and must be stopped, so he and Colosso, along with Harold's nurse, manage by themselves to defeat Blake and his forces and quell the revolution. Those actions finally convince Harold that he is actually quite fit and that he no longer needs to fret daily about his health or take his array of unneeded medications. With a renewed sense of vitality, he now leaves Paradiso with Colosso and his nurse, and the trio board a ship bound for the United States, presumably reuniting on the vessel with Mr. Pipps (who reappears at the end of the film). Upon their return, Harold and his nurse marry; and Colosso finds employment as a very imposing \\"traffic cop\\".

It is often called \\"hackleback\\", \\"sand sturgeon\\", or \\"switchtail.\\" Switchtail refers to the long filament found on the upper lobe of the caudal fin (often broken off as adults). Shovelnose sturgeon are the most abundant sturgeon, found in the Missouri River and Mississippi River systems, and the only commercially fished sturgeon in the United States of America (Pflieger 1997). Description A shovelnose sturgeon. The sturgeons of the family Acipenseridae have bony scutes along the sides and back and four barbels on the underside of the rostrum. A total of 25 extant species of sturgeon are recognized, including 17 within the genus Acipenser. Sturgeon are distributed around the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere (holarctic distribution) and have marine, freshwater, and anadromous members. Sturgeons, including the shovelnose, are highly regarded for their flesh and their roe, from which premium grades of caviar are made (Barton 2007). They can reach 1m (39.4 in) in length and up to 4.8 kg (10.6 lb) in weight but 50‚Äì85 cm (19.7-33.5 in) and 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) is more common. The scientific name Scaphirhynchus, Greek, means \\"spade snout,\\" and platorynchus, Greek, means \\"broad snout.\\" The shovelnose sturgeon is characterized by a long slender filament on the upper lobe of the caudal fin. They have a flattened rostrum (modified snout) that is also shovel shaped. There are four fringed barbels on the ventral side of the rostrum that can be found in a straight line, which is equidistant from the mouth opening to the tip of the snout, unlike pallid sturgeon. The belly of the shovelnose sturgeon is covered with scale-like plates, which is another distinguishing factor from pallid sturgeon who have primarily scaleless bellies. Coloration of the shovelnose sturgeon ranges from a light-brown to buff with a white belly (Pflieger 1997). Distribution, habitat, and reproduction Shovelnose sturgeon The shovelnose sturgeon, as its distribution represents, is impacted very little by turbidity. The Missouri River and the Mississippi River systems tend to carry high sediment loads. Here the sturgeon inhabits the open channel or main channel areas of the large rivers. It lives on the bottom, often in areas with swift current and sand or gravel bottom. As with many riverine fish species, the shovelnose sturgeon does not have a restricted home range and may travel long distances (Pflieger 1997). The shovelnose sturgeon feeds on the bottom, using its highly protrusible mouth to suck up its food. The diet is mainly aquatic insect larvae, consisting principally of mayflies, true flies (Diptera), and caddisflies. The sturgeon also feed on crustaceans, worms, and small fish (Carlson et al. 1985;Held 1969). As a result, to bottom feeding it is a host to the glochidia (larvae) of several species of freshwater mollusc, including Quadrula pustulosa (Pimpleback), Obovaria olivaria (Hickorynut) and Lampsilis teres (Yellow sandshell). It is the only known host to the hickorynut mussel.Shovelnose Sturgeon Brochure. A typical sturgeon's life history includes a migration from feeding grounds to breeding grounds in large rivers. During spawning, behavior changes and swimming near the surface occurs. Females do not spawn every year and spawning chronology is not readily evident. Spawning takes place over gravel in fairly swift water. Eggs hatch after 3 to 5 days, and the larvae‚Äîabout 1 cm long‚Äîdrift downstream to suitable rearing areas in the river (Barton 2007). Carlson et al. (1985) found that the growth of the shovelnose sturgeon is relatively slow, at 21.3 inches (54.1 cm) in five years. Commercial importance The roe of the shovelnose sturgeon is marketed as \\"hackleback\\" caviar. As old world sources of Caspian and Black Sea sturgeon caviar have become endangered, roe from shovelnose sturgeon and paddlefish have recently become commercially important.American Hackleback Caviar The flesh of the sturgeon is widely considered a delicacy, especially smoked sturgeon. Poaching of the shovelnose sturgeon is becoming a problem, as they must be 8‚Äì10 years old before spawning can occur, and females are only gravid once every 3 years. There is some interest in marketing the shovelnose sturgeon as an aquarium species. References * Barton, M. 2007. Bond's Biology of Fishes, 3rd edition.

The Northwest campus has 43 buildings, many built or renovated in the last decade. Northwest's district covers Tate, Desoto, Marshall, Benton, Tunica, Panola, Lafayette, Yalobusha, Quitman, and Calhoun Counties in northwest Mississippi. History Northwest began as Tate County Agricultural High School in 1915. The College began in 1928 with support from Tate and Quitman Counties and the Mississippi Junior College Commission. The first President was Porter Walker Berry. The school changed with the times. Depression era students were allowed to pay for room and board with produce, and World War II male students studied at an accelerated pace to join the war effort. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools gave accreditation to Northwest in 1953. The college serves an eleven county district and gradually expanded its offerings. Today, Internet classes, noncredit classes, and non- traditional offerings for adults round out the modern campus. Campus The main campus sits on in Senatobia, Mississippi. Yalobusha Hall, renovated in 2000, holds several offices, including the Registrar, Admissions, Financial Aid, and Recruiting offices. The James P. McCormick Administration Building, site of the original primary building for the old Tate County Agricultural High School, holds the administrative offices of the president, other officers, and the Business Office. The McCormick Building was named a Mississippi Landmark in 1993. The DeSoto Center campus is situated on a site in Southaven, Mississippi. The site was donated by the W. E. Ross family. The post-modern -story steel frame features a glass-and-steel tower that forms the atrium/commons. The building contains 28 classrooms, four computer labs, a practical nursing lab, and two science labs. DeSoto County is also the home of the Olive Branch, Mississippi career-technical campus, established in 1985. Oxford Campus The Lafayette-Yalobusha Technical Center at Oxford, Mississippi, open in 1983, offers a science lab with internet capable lab stations for viewing dissections. The center also uses Dynamic Human software for health education. Academics Northwest offers classes to prepare students for further academic achievement or for career advancement. Northwest has an \\"open door\\" policy for admissions. The Registrar's Office requires that potential students complete the following steps: *Have completed and turned in an application. *An official copy of SAT or ACT scores‚ÄîACT scores are required for Mississippi students. *An official copy of a transcript from an accredited high school that includes a graduation date; or an official copy of GED scores; or an official copy of college or military transcript(s) from all colleges attended; or if attending another college full-time and attending Northwest part-time, attending an evening class or during a summer semester, a letter of good standing from the full-time college attended. ;Degrees offered * Associate of Arts * Associate of Applied Science * Certificate Student life There are over 30 student organizations that offer diverse experiences and provide opportunities to compete for awards and scholarships. Leisure activities include pep rallies, cookouts, a workout center, swimming, dancing, and free movies and concerts. Student publications The newspaper, the award- winning Ranger Rocket, was the first Mississippi junior college newspaper. Students create the Rocketeer yearbook with guidance from faculty. Students are encouraged to contribute to the student literary publication, the Northwest Review, which is published each spring.

It was first published on a broadside in the middle of the 1640s as a protest against the policies of Parliament relating to the celebration of Christmas. Parliament believed the holiday should be a solemn occasion, and outlawed traditional English Christmas celebrations. There are several versions of the lyrics. It is sung to the tune of another ballad, \\"When the king enjoys his own again\\". Its origin is in the Scripture: \\"But the other Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. (6) And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.\\" Acts 17:5-7 Yorktown According to American legend, the British army band under Lord Cornwallis played this tune when they surrendered after the Siege of Yorktown (1781). Customarily, the British army would have played an American or French tune in tribute to the victors, but General Washington refused them the honours of war and insisted that they play \\"a British or German march.\\" Although American history textbooks continue to propagate the legend, the story may have been apocryphal as it first appears in the historical record a century after the surrender. Lyrics The following is the text found in the Thomason Tracts (669. f. 10 (47)), dated 8 April 1646. The World Turned Upside Down (To the Tune of, When the King enioys his own again.) Listen to me and you shall hear, news hath not been this thousand year: Since Herod, Caesar, and many more, you never heard the like before. Holy-dayes are despis'd, new fashions are devis'd. Old Christmas is kickt out of Town. Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. The wise men did rejoyce to see our Savior Christs Nativity: The Angels did good tidings bring, the Sheepheards did rejoyce and sing. Let all honest men, take example by them. Why should we from good Laws be bound? Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. Command is given, we must obey, and quite forget old Christmas day: Kill a thousand men, or a Town regain, we will give thanks and praise amain. The wine pot shall clinke, we will feast and drinke. And then strange motions will abound. Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. Our Lords and Knights, and Gentry too, doe mean old fashions to forgoe: They set a porter at the gate, that none must enter in thereat. They count it a sin, when poor people come in. Hospitality it selfe is drown'd. Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. The serving men doe sit and whine, and thinke it long ere dinner time: The Butler's still out of the way, or else my Lady keeps the key, The poor old cook, in the larder doth look, Where is no goodnesse to be found, Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. To conclude, I'le tell you news that's right, Christmas was kil'd at Naseby fight: Charity was slain at that same time, Jack Tell troth too, a friend of mine, Likewise then did die, rost beef and shred pie, Pig, Goose and Capon no quarter found. Yet let's be content, and the times lament, you see the world turn'd upside down. Recordings This song was recorded by Maddy Prior with The Carnival Band on their album Hang Up Sorrow and Care. Cultural references A different song with the same title was written by Leon Rosselson, and made popular by Billy Bragg. The song is referenced in the novel Burr by Gore Vidal. This song is referenced in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton in the song \\"Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\\". In 1972 the Marxist historian Christopher Hill published The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution . In a review of this book for the publisher Routledge historians Harman Bhogal and Liam Haydon wrote: In 2019 a sculpture by Mark Wallinger titled \\"The World Turned Upside Down\\" was unveiled on the campus of the London School of Economics.

It was the 20th episode of the fourth season. It aired on March 18, 1993. This episode won Michael Richards his first Emmy of the series. Plot Jerry is unable to remember the name of the woman he is dating (played by Susan Walters). As it would be too awkward given the time they have spent together to simply ask her, he tells her that people made fun of his name in school and asks if kids ever made fun of her name. She affirms that she was relentlessly teased because her name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy. Jerry and George come up with possible candidates, with George suggesting Mulva (for vulva). She presses him to say her name. Jerry guesses Mulva, causing her to storm out of his apartment. Moments after she leaves, in a flash of insight, Jerry runs to the window and yells \\"Dolores!\\" (rhyming with a common pronunciation of clitoris). Elaine goes to visit her ex-boyfriend Roy (Sherman Howard), an artist who she dumped because he was fat‚Äîin the hospital. Noticing that he has slimmed down (due to depression from her breaking up with him), Elaine becomes interested in dating him again. Kramer and Jerry observe the artist's splenectomy in the hospital's operating theater and accidentally drop a Junior Mint from the viewing gallery into his body. When George hears that Roy has developed an infection, he spends $1,900 (which he collected in interest from a bank account from the sixth grade) to buy some of Roy's art, thinking it will appreciate in value when Roy dies. Roy's condition suddenly turns around and he recovers. Although Roy attributes the change to George buying his art, the doctor (Victor Raider-Wexler) attributes the limited effect of the infection to \\"something from above.\\" As Kramer offers the doctor a Junior Mint, Elaine decides to cancel her date with Roy, whom she observes eating enthusiastically again in his hospital room. Production According to the \\"Inside Look\\" from the DVD, the writers had trouble coming up with a name for Jerry's girlfriend, initially settling upon \\"Cloris\\". When filming the episode, a comedian would warm up the studio audience in between filming scenes and, as an exercise, asked audience members to guess Jerry's girlfriend's name; one audience member guessed Dolores, which was deemed a better fit than their first choice. Jerry Seinfeld approved of it in time to add it to the script and the scene was shot with that being the character's name. Afterwards, a producer for the show was amused to overhear the audience member's husband saying \\"you guessed right!\\" Jerry's line concerning Roy, \\"Then we can go watch 'em slice this fat bastard up\\", was improvised by Seinfeld. A York Peppermint Pattie was used for filming the scene in the operating theater, as a Junior Mint was too small for the camera. In popular culture The episode was mentioned on the Family Guy episode \\"E. Peterbus Unum\\". The scene with the Junior Mint falling into the patient is shown on episode five of The Orville. Filmmaker Chris Seaver later used \\"Mulva\\" as the heroine's name in two of his films: Mulva: Zombie Ass Kicker and Mulva 2: Kill Teen Ape. The episode was referenced in the case Mackenzie v. Miller Brewing Co., where the plaintiff, Jerold J. Mackenzie, was fired for \\"poor management judgment\\" after discussing the episode's references to female sexual anatomy.Mackenzie v.

Earth is not shown The Experimental Geodetic Payload is a Japanese satellite sponsored by NASDA, and launched in 1986 on the first flight of the H-I rocket. After launch, the satellite was renamed Ajisai (the Japanese name for the Hydrangea plant), but it is most commonly known by the acronym EGP. Some sources identify the satellite as the Experimental Geodetic Satellite, or EGS. History EGP was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center on August 12, 1986 at 20:45 GMT (August 13, 05:45 local time).NASDA The launch vehicle was the first H-I rocket. After launch, the spacecraft was given the International Designator 1986-061A and Satellite Catalog Number 16908. Structure EGP is entirely passive, and operates by reflecting sunlight or ground-based lasers.Curtis, Anthony R (1989). Space Almanac, Arcsoft Publishers. The satellite is a 685-kg hollow sphere with a diameter of 2.15 meters, and the surface is covered with 318 mirrors for reflecting sunlight and 1436 corner reflectors for reflecting laser beams.International Laser Ranging Service , NASAA plate motion study using Ajisai SLR data (Sengoku 1998), from Earth Planets Space 50, 611-627, 1998, Terrapub The mirrors are 10x10 inches, and the corner reflectors are one inch in diameter and grouped into 120 laser reflection assemblies.Project StarshineEurope and Asia in Space 1993-1994, Kaman Sciences Corp. for USAF Phillips Laboratory. Orbit EGP is in a nearly circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 1488 km, close to the (not firmly defined) boundary between low earth orbit and medium earth orbit. The orbital period is 116 minutes, and the orbital inclination is 50 degrees.NASA Mission EGP's mission is geodesy. The primary objectives were improving Japan's geodetic triangulation network, determining the position of remote islands, and integrating Japan's geodetic network with geodetic systems used in other parts of the world.UN Registry Notes (as republished by Jonathan McDowell) There are two modes of operation. A ground-based laser can be reflected off the satellite, and light's return time measured to determine the round-trip distance. Alternatively, when the satellite is in sunlight, it can be photographed against the background stars. In both cases, since the satellite's orbit is precisely known, information about the ground-based observer's position can be calculated. EGP's orbital altitude is high enough that atmospheric drag has no significant effect on the spacecraft trajectory. This is advantageous for maintaining the stable orbit required for geodesy. Visual Appearance There is a flash produced when the sun's reflection from one of the satellite's mirrors crosses an observer's position on the earth. Due to the satellite's rotation, and the changing geometry as the satellite moves along its orbit, EGP produces several of these flashes per second. EGP can take up to 18 minutes to cross the sky. EGP's flashes are visible in binoculars if the observer is on the nighttime side of the planet, and the satellite is in sunlight while its orbital trajectory takes it above the observer's horizon. These conditions are often met in the hours after sunset, and the hours before sunrise. When EGP enters the Earth's shadow, the stream of flashes abruptly ceases. = View from Earth = The corner reflectors are used to reflect laser beams and are invisible to amateur observers, but the mirrors are spectacular. They are designed to reflect sunlight so the satellite can be photographed by ground stations for precise geodetic surveying measurements. The glints are probably in the third magnitude range but are visible to the naked eye only in very dark skies under good conditions. The brief flashes are too short to be noticed by the naked eye. In binoculars EGP resembles the strobe of an airplane but the flash pattern is more complex than a strobe light. Because of the extremely high orbital altitude of 1,500 kilometers, EGP is often visible closer to midnight than other satellites, and can frequently be seen on as many as four orbits during a single overnight observing session.

The project is headed by Baek Moon-hong () and was unveiled to the public at the Kyoyuk MunHwa HoeKwan hotel in Seoul on May 4, 2003. The EveR name is derived from the combination of the Biblical \\"Eve\\" and the r from robot. EveR-1 EveR-1 () is a direct competitor of Actroid, which is being developed by Sanrio's Kokoro Dreams and Osaka University of Japan, and was unveiled at the International Robot Exhibition in Tokyo in 2003. EveR-1 was built in a year at a cost of 300 million won (US$321,000) in state funds. The creators said the humanoid's face is a composite of two well-known Korean actresses, while the torso is based on a singer, though the names of the celebrities were not revealed. The android weighs 50 kilograms and has a height of 160 centimeters. The creators also said that EveR-1 can mimic the human emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise more naturally than its Japanese rival, while using a hydraulic system for certain movements. EveR-1 contains a total of 35 miniature motors located throughout its upper body, which enables EveR-1 to move its head, arms, and upper body and even move its lips in synchronization with the robot's speech. Its skin is made of synthetic, pliable silicone jelly that feels similar to human skin. The android can recognize 400 Korean and English words, allowing it to respond to questions both verbally and through 15 facial expressions: EveR-1 will show displeasure if you poke her. The android also has motion data process sensors in its artificial eyes, enabling it to follow people with its eyes and head.  EveR-2 (Muse)  The EveR-2 android had the ability to lip-sync to a song. EveR-2, later called EveR-2 Muse () performed at Robot World 2006 in Seoul;Korean Overseas Culture and Information Service news story it has improved vision and ability to express emotions, as well as various other enhancements.Presentation on KITECH's site (via Internet Archive) - includes an annotated photograph of the complete Eve-R2 unit on page 11, and specifications on page 12. Lower resolution versions of these pictures and others may be found on AVING's site . In 2008 EveR-2 could express the facial expressions of happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger, and disgust, along with 100 gestures. Boredom is now an available emotion, along with the usual joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. EveR2-Muse sang the Korean ballad \\"I Will Close My Eyes For You\\" during the opening ceremony at the Robot World 2006 conference in Seoul. The android is about 5'7\\" (170 cm) tall and weighs about 135 pounds (60 kg). Its silicone-covered face has a higher flexibility; 29 motors and dozens of joints provide 23 degrees of freedom for self-expression. In total, EveR-2 has 25 more degrees of freedom than EveR-1. Its improved speech recognition, voice synthesis and gesture expression technology allows for more sophisticated communication and interaction with humans. The small CCD cameras of EveR-1 have been upgraded to Wide range Small CCD cameras (90 degrees) for better vision. While the synthetic pliable silicone jelly only covered the face and hand with soft materials of the EveR-1 (while the rest was covered with hard material), EveR-2 has its whole body covered with the soft artificial skin. Baek Moon- hong envisions educational and entertainment functions for the androids, from providing information in department stores and museums, to reading stories to children. EveR-3 EveR-3 () is the successor of EveR-2, demonstrated in 2009. It is the first model in the EveR series to be mobile, using wheels for locomotion and being dressed in long skirts to hide the wheels. In early 2010 it reportedly appeared in a Korean play called Robot Princess and the Seven Dwarfs which is based on the Snow White story.  EveR-4  EveR-4 (), also called EveR-4M, has a modular design with 64 degrees of freedom including 33 in the head (30 in the face and 3 in the neck), and 5 in the lower body (3 in the legs and 2 in an underlying wheel). It was exhibited at RoboWorld 2011 in Seoul, where experiments showed that some of its facial expressions are more recognisable than others, with correct recognition rate being highest among female participants in the 20-40 age range.

The parish includes the hamlet of Fawler, about west of Kingston Lisle village. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 225. Kingston Lisle was part of Berkshire until the 1974 local government boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire. Geography The village is a spring line settlement at the foot of Blowing Stone Hill, which is part of the escarpment of the Berkshire Downs. The parish measures about north ‚Äì south and about wide at its widest point. The highest point in the parish is Rams Hill, whose top is above sea level. Rams Hill is on the Berkshire Downs escarpment about southwest of the village and on the parish boundary with Uffington. Archaeology The Ridgeway passes through the parish less than south of the village. It is a prehistoric road that is now a long-distance footpath. The Blowing Stone The Blowing Stone, a sarsen with holes in it, is about south of the village. Legend has it that King Alfred the Great blew through it to summon his troops for the Battle of Ashdown in AD 871. Toponym \\"Kingston\\" is a common English toponym. It means simply a t≈´n of the king. T≈´n is Old English for a fence, and hence came to mean an enclosure, farm or manor. An entry for AD 1220 in the Book of Fees records it as Kingeston. The suggestion that it is derived from \\"King's Stone\\", referring to the Blowing Stone, is false etymology. The suffix \\"Lisle\\" was added in the 14th century, when it was the surname of the lord of the manor. 14th-century Charter Rolls record it as Kyngeston Lisle in 1322 and Kingston del Isle in 1336. It distinguishes the village and parish from Kingston Bagpuize, which is to the northeast. Parish church The nave and chancel of the Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist was built in about 1200. The chancel windows are each 14th- century Decorated Gothic. Some 14th-century stained glass survives in a south window of the chancel. Around the east and north windows of the chancel are 14th-century murals of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and the martyrdom of Saint John the Baptist. The church is a Grade II* listed building. St John's parish is part of the Ridgeway Benefice, along with the parishes of Childrey, Letcombe Bassett, Letcombe Regis, Sparsholt and West Challow. Economic and social history cob walls and thatched roof The Domesday Book in 1086 records Kingston Lisle as having 31 households. Kingston Lisle Park is a 17th- century country house on the edge of the village. It was enlarged early the 18th and 19th centuries and is a Grade II* listed building. Between 1805 and 1807 the section of the Wilts & Berks Canal between Longcot and Challow was completed. It passes through the parish at Kingston Common about north of the village. Traffic on the canal had virtually ceased by 1901 and the route was formally abandoned in 1914. The Wilts & Berks Canal Trust is currently restoring the canal. The Great Western Main Line through the Vale of White Horse was opened in 1840. It passes through the northern extremity of Kingston Lisle parish, about north of the village. Sign outside the Blowing Stone Inn Amenities The village has one pub, the Blowing Stone Inn.The Blowing Stone Inn The parish is served by Uffington Primary School just over away, to which there is a free bus service. In literature The village features in Thomas Hughes' novel Tom Brown's School Days.

Brick Expressionism is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in The Netherlands (Amsterdam School). Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of Modern architecture: International Style, Expressionist, and Constructivist architecture. In the 1920s The term \\"Expressionist architecture\\" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.Stallybrass and Bullock, p.301‚Äì392 ‚Äì entry by John Willett Bruno Taut (1910) The style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the German Revolution of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.Jencks, p.59 Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,Sharp, p.68 resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as Bruno Taut's Alpine Architecture and Hermann Finsterlin's Formspiels. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. Scenography for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,Pehnt, p.163 and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate. Important events in Expressionist architecture include; the Werkbund Exhibition (1914) in Cologne, the completion and theatrical running of the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus, Berlin in 1919, the Glass Chain letters, and the activities of the Amsterdam School. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is Erich Mendelsohn's Einstein Tower in Potsdam. By 1925, most of the leading architects such as Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Hans Poelzig, along with other expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably Hans Scharoun, continued to work in an expressionist idiom.Pehnt, p.203 In 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as degenerate. Until the 1970s scholarsMost notably Nikolaus Pevsner commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later International Style, but this has been re- evaluated in recent years. Characteristics Expressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma,Sharp p.166 but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works: #Distortion of form for an emotional effect.Taut, Die Stadtkrone 1919 p.87, quote \\"Architecture is art and ought to be the highest of the arts. It consists exclusively of powerful emotion and addresses itself exclusively to the emotions.\\" #Subordination of realism to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience. #An underlying effort at achieving the new, original, and visionary #Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of concepts more important than pragmatic finished products. #Often hybrid solutions, irreducible to a single concept.Pehnt, p.20 #Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations.Pehnt, p.19, Taut's mention of \\"earth-crust architecture\\" and what Poelzig deemed, \\"Important to remodel the earth's surface sculpturally.\\" As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary Art Nouveau. #Uses creative potential of artisan craftsmanship. #Tendency more towards the Gothic than the Classical architecture. Expressionist architecture also tends more towards the Romanesque and the Rococo than the classical. #Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as eastern as western. It draws as much from Moorish, Islamic, Egyptian, and Indian art and architecture as from Roman or Greek.Sharp p.119 #Conception of architecture as a work of art. Context Centennial Hall in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, 1911‚Äì13 (Max Berg). Early landmark of Expressionist architecture and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Glass Pavilion at the Cologne Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition, 1914 (Bruno Taut) Political, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of Expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of Expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I.Sharp, p.9 The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the deprivations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the Weimar Republic created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar revolution as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.Pehnt, p.16 Artistic movements that preceded Expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the Arts and Crafts movement and Art Nouveau or in Germany, Jugendstil. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into Expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in Art Nouveau, which was also prevalent in Romanticism, continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist Ernst Haeckel was known by FinsterlinPehnt, p.97 and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms. The Futurist and Constructivist architectural movements, and the Dada anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to Expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, Fr√ºlicht included constructivist projects, including Vladimir Tatlins Monument to the Third International.Sharp, p.95 However, Futurism and Constructivism emphasized mechinationSharp, p.110 and urbanismPehnt, p.169 tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit movement. Erich Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on Futurism and Constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Mendelsohn and futurist Antonio Sant'Elia.Pehnt, p.119 The Merzbau by Dada artist Kurt Schwitters, with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics. Influence of individualists such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Antoni Gaud√≠ also provided the surrounding context for Expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle.Pehnt, p.117 Gaud√≠ was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of Art Nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of Art Nouveau than that of, say, Bruno Taut. The group Der Ring did know about Gaud√≠, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence.Pehnt, p.59 Charles Rennie Mackintosh should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding Expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly Arts and Crafts or Art Nouveau, buildings such as the Hill House and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the Vienna Secession exhibition in 1900. Underlying ideas Many writers contributed to the ideology of Expressionist architecture. Sources of philosophy important to expressionist architects were works by Friedrich Nietzsche, S√∏ren Kierkegaard,Sharp, p.3 and Henri Bergson.Pehnt, p.34 Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche,Pehnt, p.41 particularly Thus Spoke Zarathustra, whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation. Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's Alpine Architecture.Pehnt, p.42 Henry van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's Ecce Homo.Sharp, p.5 The author Franz Kafka in his The Metamorphosis, with its shape shifting matched the material instability of Expressionist architectureSharp, p.6 Naturalists such as Charles Darwin, and Ernst Haeckel contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet Paul Scheerbart worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture. 1921, Walter Gropius's \\"Monument to the March Dead\\" in Weimar Emergent psychology from Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung was important to Expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and spacePehnt, p.167 was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that \\"Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures.\\" The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin. 1824, Caspar David Friedrich's \\"Das Eismeer\\" (The Sea of Ice) Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of aesthetics had been developing, particularly through the work of Kant and Schopenhauer and notions of the sublime. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self- forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the \\"science of art\\", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics Max Dessoir founded the Zeitschift f√ºr √Ñsthetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work √Ñsthetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst \\"the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of romanticism.Benson, p118 Artistic theories of Wassily Kandinsky, such as Concerning the Spiritual in Art, and Point and Line to Plane were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.Sharp, p.18 Materials A recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it monolithic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future.Benson p.100 They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart: \\"Coloured glass destroys hatred\\", \\"Without a glass palace life is a burden\\", \\"Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm.\\" Another example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the tower's namesake, Einstein, and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, that is, Ein Stein.Pehnt, p.121 Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin. Brick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. Josef Franke produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the Ruhrgebiet in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin housing estate \\"Legien-Stadt\\". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt \\"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick\\".Pehnt, p.127 With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the International Style. Theatres, films, paintings and magazines The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Europe witnessed a boom in theatrical production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499. Cinema witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas. Many architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for expressionist films. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the performing arts held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor. Built examples of expressionist theatres include Henry van de Velde's construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and Hans Poelzig's grand remodelling of the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a \\"people's theatre\\". Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, Weltbaumeister. Expressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on legends or fairy tales.Pehnt, p.164 Poelzig designed scenographic sets for Paul Wegener's 1920 film Der Golem. Space in Der Golem was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, which was painted on canvas backdrops.Pehnt, p.166 Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in Der Golem was able to create a whole village that \\"spoke with a Jewish accent.\\" Herman Finsterlin approached Fritz Lang with an idea for a film. Fritz Lang's film Metropolis demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers.Pehnt, p.168 Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled Die Galoschen des Gl√ºcks(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from Hans Christian Andersen. On the film, Taut noted, \\"an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another\\".Taut, Die Gl√§serne Kette, p.49 It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain. Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked. File:BlaueReiter.jpgDER BLAUE REITER almanac 1912, cover by Wassily Kandinsky.

Publication of Concerning the Spiritual in Art in 1912 by Wassily Kandinsky, his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in Der Blaue Reiter phase, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture. The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's Point and Line to Plane in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and Expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture. Brick Expressionism Chilehaus in Hamburg, 1923 (Fritz H√∂ger) The term Brick Expressionism () describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses bricks, tiles or clinker bricks as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of Northern Germany and the Ruhr area, but the Amsterdam School belongs to the same category. Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial Scheepvaarthuis (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925. The great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups Die Br√ºcke in Dresden since 1905 (Kirchner, Schmidt-Rottluff, Heckel, Nolde) and Der Blaue Reiter in Munich since 1912 (Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, M√ºnter, Jawlensky). Art Nouveau and Art Deco Art Nouveau and Art Deco share some characteristics with the Expressionist movement and have directly influenced it.James, Kathleen (1997). Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism. Cambridge University Press. Expressionism since the 1950s The influential architectural critic and historian Sigfried Giedion in his book Space, Time and Architecture (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of functionalism. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of Expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of Expressionism, Brutalism, had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of Le Corbusier took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his Notre-Dame du Haut. In Mexico, in 1953, German √©migr√© Mathias Goeritz, published the \\"Arquitectura Emocional\\" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that \\"architecture's principal function is emotion.\\"Mathias Goeritz, \\"El manifiesto de arquitectura emocional\\", in Lily Kassner, Mathias Goeritz, UNAM, 2007, p. 272‚Äì273 Modern Mexican architect Luis Barrag√°n adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project Torres de Sat√©lite (1957‚Äì58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was Eero Saarinen. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as Saarinen's 1962 TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's Formspiels as any other, save J√∏rn Utzon's Sydney Opera House. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of Enric Miralles, most notability his Scottish Parliament building, deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind, as well as Canadian Aboriginal architect Douglas Cardinal.

The destruction of artistically valueless monuments (This was a common reaction of the Avant Garde against the elitist militarism that was perceived as the cause of World War I). *December ‚Äì Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst declares its basic aims in Bruno Tauts Architeckturprogramm. It calls for a new 'total work of art', to be created with active participation of the people. *Bruno Taut publishes Die Stadtkrone. 1919 *Spring manifesto of Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst is published. Art for the masses. Alliance of the arts under the wing of architecture. 50 artists, architects and patrons join led by Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius and Adolf Behne. *April ‚Äì Erich Mendelsohn, Hannes Meyer, Bernard Hoetger, Max Taut and Otto Bartning stage exhibition called 'An Exhibition of Unknown Architects'. Walter Gropius writes the introduction, now considered to be a first draft for the Bauhaus programme published later in the month. Called for a ‚ÄòCathedral of the Future‚Äô, to unify the creative energy of society as in the Middle Ages. *Bauhaus established and begins expressionist phase, to last until 1923. *Adolf Behne publishes Ja! Stimmen des Arbeitsrates f√ºr Kunst in Berlin (Yes! Voices from the art Soviet in Berlin). *Spartacist revolt ends the overt activities of Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst. The group starts the first Utopian letter of the Glass Chain by Bruno Taut. They are joined by previously peripheral architects; Hans Luckhardt, Wassili Luckhardt and Hans Scharoun. The letters demand; 1. Return to medieval integration of the building team. 2. Irregular form. 3. Facetted form. 4. Glass monuments. *Opening of the Grosses Schauspielhaus by Hans Poelzig in Berlin.

He designs sets for The Golem. *Solidarity of the Glass Chain is broken. Final letter written by Hermann Finsterlin. Hans Luckhardt recognises the incompatibility of free unconscious form and rationalist prefabrication and moves to Rationalism. *Taut maintains his Scheerbartian views. He publishes ‚ÄòDie Aufl√∂sung der St√§dt' (The dissolution of the city) in line with Kropotkinian anarchist socialist tendencies. In common with the Soviets, it recommends the breakup of cities and a return to the land. He models agrarian communities and temples in the Alps. There would be 3 separate residential communities. 1. The enlightened. 2. Artists. 3. Children. This authoritarianism is noted in Frampton as although socialist in intent, paradoxically containing the seeds of the later fascism. 1921 Clubhouse in Amsterdam 1923 (Michel de Klerk) Amsterdam, Plan Zuid, PL-Takstraat, 1923.

It is completed in 1922 and inspires the workers' gong in the 1927 film Metropolis by Fritz Lang. *Fr√ºhlicht loses its impetus. *Erich Mendelsohn visits works of the Dutch Wendingen group and tours the Netherlands. He meets the rationalists J.J.P. Oud and W.M. Dudok. He recognises the conflict of visionary and objective approaches to design. *Erich Mendelsohn's Mossehaus opens. Construction is complete on the Einstein Tower. It combines the sculptural forms of Van de Weldes Werkbund Exhibition theatre with the profile of Taut's Glashaus and the formal affinity to vernacular Dutch architecture of Eibink and Snellebrand and Hendrikus Wijdeveld. Einstein himself visits and declares it ‚Äòorganic‚Äô. *Mendelsohn designs a hat factory in Luckenwalde. It shows influences of the Dutch expressionist De Klerk, setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements. This approach is echoed in his Leningrad textile mill of 1925 and anticipates the banding in his department stores in Breslau, Stuttgart, Chemnitz and Berlin from 1927 and 1931. *Hugo H√§ring and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe submit a competition entry for a Friedrichstrasse office building. It reveals an organic approach to structure and is fully made of glass. 1922 *Ludwig Mies van der Rohe publishes a glass skyscraper project in the last issue of Fr√ºhlicht. *Toompea Castle is rebuilt for the Riigikogu in Tallinn, Estonia, as the only expressionist style parliamentary building in the world. *The film Nosferatu by F.W. Murnau is released. 1923 *Bauhaus expressionist phase ends. Standard arguments for the reasons for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. Rampant inflation in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the Zeitgeist. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, Johannes Itten, to be replaced with the, then constructivist, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. *Chilehaus in Hamburg by Fritz H√∂ger. *Walter Gropius abandons expressionism and moves to rationalism. *Bruno and Max Taut begin work on government funded low cost housing projects. *Berlin secession exhibition.

Early expressionism is heavily influenced by Art Nouveau and can be considered part of its legacy, while post 1910 and including Amsterdam School it is considered part of Art Deco legacy. The New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) art movement arose in direct opposition to Expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in Deconstructivism, the work of Santiago Calatrava, and the organic movement of Blobitecture. Another movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is Metaphoric architecture, which includes elements of biomorphism and Zoomorphic architecture. The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design. Perhaps the most prominent voice of the Metaphoric architectural school at present is Dr. Basil Al Bayati whose designs have been inspired by trees and plants, snails, whales, insects, dervishes and even myth and literature. He is also the founder of the International School of Metaphoric Architecture in M√°laga, Spain. Many of the founders and significant players in Expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the International Style and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of Expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.

He was widely known as \\"the Puddler Poet\\", and his work reflected his support of labor unions.Rev. Darren Cushman Wood, \\"Radicals, Revivalists, and Reformers: The Heritage of Labor and Religion in the United States\\", Division of Labor Studies, Indiana University, 4 September 2002. Born in [Castlefield, Williamstown, County Galway], Ireland, McGovern emigrated first to England and then to the United States. He eventually settled in Youngstown, Ohio, along with his wife, the former Anne Murphy, and secured work in the local steel mills. McGovern rose to the position of puddler, a skilled laborer responsible for converting pig iron into wrought iron by removing impurities. In 1899, McGovern secured national celebrity with the publication of Labor Lyrics and Other Poems. He went on to author a popular newspaper column in the Youngstown Daily Vindicator. McGovern's poems fall into three basic categories: rolling mill rhymes, labor growls and miscellaneous trifles, and amorous verses \\"to show that a rolling mill man has a heart as susceptible to the purest motives of love as those who have millions wherewith to purchase a title\\". Some scholars have argued that McGovern's work, which features religious themes, shows the influence of the Social Gospel movement. This intellectual movement drew sharp connections between social justice causes and the teachings of the New Testament.

It was written by Jo Heims, and was the third film directed by Clint Eastwood, who can be briefly seen in an uncredited cameo leaning on a pier wearing a white jacket. Plot The first scene begins with a young couple awakening in bed, after a one-night stand. An older teen, Edith Alice ‚ÄúBreezy‚Äù Breezerman (Kay Lenz) hops out of bed, gets dressed, and steps into the daylight. Breezy lost her parents years before in an auto accident, and lives as a homeless free-spirited hippie in California. That same morning, Frank Harmon (William Holden) is bidding farewell to his overnight guest, a very beautiful blonde that openly shows interest in him. He is only humoring her as she leaves, and the audience gets the first sense of how detached he is emotionally. Middle-aged, divorced and wealthy from his work in real estate, Frank lacks for nothing material. His beautiful post-modern home is the setting for much of the movie. After escaping a bad hitchhiked ride with an unstable stranger, Breezy loiters near Frank's home, and runs to him as he leaves for work. She invites herself into his car and happily insists that he give her a ride to her destination. Again, we see the never-smiling Frank who is now annoyed by the insistence of this young and loquacious girl. Carefree and true to her name, Breezy steals the show with both her charm and her lack of self-awareness. The next scenes develop their friendship, showing Frank's jaded personality as he becomes slowly more loving toward Breezy. He takes a fatherly approach and gives her room/board, but never acts on sexual opportunities. In a separate side story, he is conflicted about love lost: his ex-wife named Betty Tobin (Marj Dusay). There is no formal backstory, but Betty refers to Frank \\"never being late with your checks,\\" implying alimony payments. Betty gently explains she is marrying a man she very much loves, and Frank pensively accepts this news. There are discussions at their business lunch of how she has made certain life realizations, with an unsaid declaration that Frank is stunted emotionally. As Betty puts it, he is ‚Äúlost‚Äù. They part as friends, clearly showing that they have mutual respect. Frank and Breezy's relationship continues to strengthen platonically, and he protects her from trouble. He introduces her to the finer things in life, while Breezy stays true to her humility and charm. On a side note, Frank's friend and workout buddy Bob Henderson (Roger C. Carmel) is grappling with his own mid- life crisis. He is not able to end his devoid marriage, which could be perceived as proof that a constrained life is no life at all. Frank takes this into consideration, while still growing closer to Breezy. They consummate their relationship at his home, which is now the protective fortress that allows them to freely express their relationship. Some of the conflicts in this plot are that Breezy maintains friendships with her own peers who are starkly opposite of Frank; they are hippies and carefree, ‚Äúunwashed‚Äù as referenced by Frank. Frank's friends are established and successful, and while they never seem to question his relationship with her, the imploring question of guilt is rampant in Frank's mind. He cannot abide that he, in his fifties, is in a relationship with a teenager. These conflicts eventually break him, after a sobering discussion with Bob in a sauna. Bob reveals that there is no way he himself could embark on such a relationship, as he might feel like a ‚Äúchild molester‚Äù. He has no intention of being insulting, and is in fact admiring Frank, but Frank's facial expressions convey his own self-loathing. All of his shared joys with Breezy, such as their adopted stray dog and ‚Äúus against the world‚Äù mentality, do not stop them from parting ways. Frank simply cannot cope with the age issue. Time goes on, and the final dramatic twist involves a death. It is this experience that brings Frank to an epiphany: life is short, and his own projected insecurities are his true enemies. He and Breezy are reunited and they begin their new life together. Cast *William Holden as Frank Harmon *Kay Lenz as Edith Alice 'Breezy' Breezerman *Roger C.

Heims had originally intended Eastwood to play the starring role of the realtor Frank Harmon, a bitter divorced man who falls in love with the young Breezy. Although Eastwood confessed to \\"understanding the Frank Harmon character\\" he believed he was too young at that stage to play Harmon.McGilligan (1999), p.229 That part would go to William Holden, 12 years Eastwood's senior, and Eastwood then decided to direct the picture. Eastwood initially wanted to cast Jo Ann Harris, whom he had worked with in The Beguiled. After much auditioning, the role of Breezy went to a young dark- haired actress named Kay Lenz. According to friends of Clint, he became infatuated with Lenz during this period.McGilligan (1999), p.230 Filming for Breezy began in November 1972 in Los Angeles and finished five weeks later. With Bruce Surtees, Eastwood's regular cinematographer, occupied elsewhere, Frank Stanley was brought in to shoot the picture, the first of four films he would shoot for Malpaso. The film was shot very quickly and efficiently and in the end went $1 million under budget and finished three days before schedule. Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, \\"A cloyingly naive resolution mars 'Breezy,' which opened yesterday, an otherwise engrossing drama of an aging man's infatuation with a tender-hearted 17-year-old girl derelict.\\"Thompson, Howard (November 19, 1973). \\"Breezy Breezes In\\". The New York Times. 53. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, \\"Screenwriter Jo Heims has fashioned a formula May‚ÄìSeptember love affair into a surprisingly tender and frequently witty romance in which an older man is realistically transformed by a much younger woman ... 'Breezy' frequently threatens to collapse into a stereotypical characterization, but Holden's refreshing honesty invariably revitalizes the action. In the title role, newcomer Kay Lenz is sincere, often believable, and rarely maudlin.\\"Siskel, Gene (March 27, 1974). \\"Breezy\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 8. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \\"an okay contemporary drama\\" with \\"perhaps too much ironic, wry or broad humor for solid impact.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote of Eastwood that Breezy was \\"a deeply felt, fully realized film that is entirely his own. It's an offbeat love story told with rare delicacy and perception that affords William Holden his most fully dimensioned role in years and introduces a smashing newcomer named Kay Lenz.\\"Thomas, Kevin (November 11, 1973). \\"50-Plus Loves Sweet 17 in Clint's 'Breezy'\\". Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 24. The film opened at the Columbia II theater in New York City on November 18, 1973 and performed badly, grossing only $16,099 in four weeks and 5 days. Early unfavorable reviews and the poor performance caused the studio to shelve the film. It then underwent some minor re-editing and was test released in Utah in 39 theaters on July 3, 1974 on a four wall distribution basis for two weeks. The results were positive, so Universal expanded the four wall distribution policy to the Portland and Seattle areas. During 1974, Variety tracked it grossing $140,289 in 20-24 key cities in the United States and Canada, placing it 301 on the list of their films tracked for the year, which with its gross from New York in 1973, gives it a gross of at least $156,388. Eastwood thought Universal had decided the film was going to fail long before it was released. He said \\"the public stayed away from it because it wasn't promoted enough, and it was sold in an uninteresting fashion\\". Some critics, including Eastwood's biographer Richard Schickel, believed that the sexual content of the film and love scenes were too soft to be memorable for such a potentially scandalous relationship between Harmon and Breezy, commenting that, \\"it is not a sexy movie. Once again, Eastwood was too polite in his eroticism.\\" However, Schickel added that Breezy managed to recoup its low budget.McGilligan (1999), p.231 Home media release Breezy did not reach home video until 1998. Universal Pictures released the film to DVD in 2004 with a running time of 106 minutes (NTSC).OFDB A Blu-ray was released in 2014 by the British branch of Universal, which was issuing all their Clint Eastwood catalogue on HD.Clint Eastwood - The Blu-ray Collection The film is in widescreen and Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.

Plot A traveling show reminiscent of Buffalo Bill's, \\"Bronco Billy's Wild West Show\\" is a rundown traveling circus, the star of which is Bronco Billy McCoy (Clint Eastwood), the \\"fastest gun in the West.\\" For the show's finale, a blindfolded Bronco Billy shoots balloons around a female assistant on a revolving wooden disc, and for the last balloon, he throws a knife. However, the assistant moves her leg and is nicked, so she quits. The show is not making any money, and nobody has been paid for six months. The show moves on to a new town and Bronco Billy goes to city hall to get a permit. He bumps into Antoinette Lily (Sondra Locke) and John Arlington (Geoffrey Lewis), who are there to be married. Antoinette despises her future husband, but has to marry before she is thirty in order to inherit a large fortune. Their car breaks down at the motel opposite the Wild West Show. The next morning, Arlington steals all her money and their repaired car. She is left to fend for herself. Bronco Billy talks Antoinette into becoming his new assistant, \\"Miss Lily,\\" though she only agrees to do one show. Her first performance is unusually successful, although Miss Lily irritates Billy by not sticking to the script. Antoinette discovers that Arlington has been arrested for her murder (framed by Antoinette's stepmother and her scheming lawyer friend, who stand to gain her inheritance). Seizing the chance to get even with Arlington, Antoinette rejoins the Wild West Show. She learns that no one is a real cowboy: they are mostly ex-convicts, or alcoholics, or both. Bronco Billy was a shoe salesman from New Jersey who shot his wife for sleeping with his best friend. Nevertheless, Miss Lily begins to warm to the troupe. Two of the show's performers announce that they are going to have a baby. The crew goes to a bar to celebrate. One gets arrested by police who discover that he is a deserter from the Army. Bronco Billy uses the show's meager savings to bribe the sheriff into letting the man go, swallowing his pride and enduring the sheriff's verbal humiliations for his friend's sake. Then the circus tent burns down. Everyone blames Miss Lily for their bad luck, but Bronco Billy defends her and proposes that they rob a train. They try to do this in the standard Western way (riding alongside and jumping on), but a modern train proves to be resistant to such an approach and they give up. Next, the troupe travels to a mental institution at which they have previously performed pro bono. The head of the institution, who is obsessed with the Wild West, agrees to provide them with accommodation and to supply a new tent, and the inmates sew one out of American flags. Miss Lily and Bronco Billy spend the night together. By chance, one inmate turns out to be Arlington (he had been paid by the crooked lawyer to confess to being mentally disturbed when he \\"murdered\\" Antoinette). When he sees her, he raises a fuss and gets released. Bronco Billy and the show depart without Miss Lily. Antoinette returns to a luxurious lifestyle, but she is bored and misses Billy, who drowns his loneliness with alcohol. When Bronco Billy is about to introduce Lefty as his assistant, Miss Lily appears. The show, now a raving success, runs smoothly and Bronco Billy ends it with a positive message for the children in the audience.

Hackin and Neal Dobrofsky's script and decided to join the film with Sondra Locke.Hughes, p.122 The film was shot in two months in the Boise, Idaho area in the fall of 1979. Additional filming took place in eastern Oregon and New York. Filmed on a low budget of $5 million, it finished two to four weeks ahead of schedule. Critical reception Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as being one of the most affable shoots of his career, and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that the character of Bronco Billy is his most self- referential work. The film was a modest commercial hit, but was appreciated by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times believed the film was \\"the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while,\\" praising Eastwood's directing and the way he intricately juxtaposes the old West and the new. Box office performance Although the film grossed 4-5 times its cost (some $25 million) during its United States theatrical release, Eastwood considered it insufficient.Hughes, p.124 In a French interview, Eastwood spoke about the film's financial reception, \\"It was an old-fashioned theme, probably too old fashioned since the film didn't do as well as we hoped. But if, as a film director, I ever wanted to say something, you'll find it in Bronco Billy.\\" Awards and nominations * 1st Golden Raspberry Award :Nominated: Worst Actress (Sondra Locke) See also * List of American films of 1980 References Bibliography External links  1980 films 1980s action comedy films 1980s Western (genre) comedy films Neo-Western films American films English- language films Films directed by Clint Eastwood Warner Bros. films Films shot in Idaho Films set in Idaho Films shot in Oregon Circus films 1980 comedy films ","title":"Bronco Billy"},{"id":"5016299","text":"Honkytonk Man is a 1982 American musical drama film set in the Great Depression. Clint Eastwood, who produced and directed, stars with his son, Kyle Eastwood. Clancy Carlile's screenplay is based on his 1980 novel of the same name. This was Marty Robbins' last appearance before he died. The story of Clint's character, Red Stovall, is loosely based on the life of Jimmie Rodgers. Plot Itinerant western singer Red Stovall suffers from tuberculosis but has been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. He is accompanied by his young nephew Whit. After a series of adventures which include the nephew's first sexual encounter in a brothel, they finally arrive. While a fit of coughing in his audition ruins his chances, talent scouts for a record company are impressed enough to arrange a recording session, realizing that he has only days to live. The tuberculosis reaches a critical stage in the middle of this session, where Red's lines are filled in by Smokey, a side guitarist (country singer Marty Robbins in his last film role). Red eventually succumbs while Whit vows to tell his uncle's story. Red's vintage Lincoln Model K touring car, prevalent throughout the movie, finally 'dies' at the cemetery where Red is laid to rest. Production Filming took place over five weeks on location.Hughes, p.136 The first part of the movie was filmed in Bird's Landing, California. However, the majority of this feature was filmed in and around Calaveras County, east of Stockton, California. Exterior scenes include Main Street, Mountain Ranch; Main Street, Sheepranch; and the Pioneer Hotel in Sheepranch. The famous jail break scene was filmed in Dayton, Nevada at the corner of Pike Street (the Lincoln Highway) and W Main Street. The vintage brick building the movie-built jail was attached to is the Odeon Hall, where Marilyn Monroe's paddle ball and bar interior scenes were shot in The Misfits (1961). Extras were locally hired and many of the towns residents are seen in the movie.

The New York Post wrote, \\"The pace is slow, very country, but it rises to touching moments...not all perfect by any means, but ultimately a story of occasional awkward truths.\\"Hughes, p.138 The film opened Wednesday, December 15, 1982 in Los Angeles before expanding to 677 screens for the weekend, but only grossed $667,727, the worst opening for an Eastwood film. The film went on to gross $4.5 million at the United States and Canada box office,Hughes, p.137 Eastwood's lowest grosser for more than a decade. The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Original Song for No Sweeter Cheater than You.

Although the road was designed to be a freeway for the full length of the planned 19 kilometre route, plans have instead evolved over time which has resulted in the construction of bypasses for the Melbourne suburbs of Mordialloc, Springvale, and Dandenong. Intended Route Starting at the intersection of Warrigal Road and South Road in Moorabbin, the route travels east, crossing Old Dandenong Road, Clarinda Road, Kingston Road and Boundary Road before intersecting with the proposed northern extension of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway. It then interchanges with Westall Road as the route starts to travel in a south easterly direction. The route then crosses Springvale Road, Cheltenham Road, Chapel Road, Stanley Road, Perry Road and Chandler Road before approaching a diamond interchange with the EastLink tollway. The route then continues east crossing Hammond Road, Dandenong - Frankston Road and the South Gippsland Highway before finishing with a fully grade separated T interchange with the South Gippsland Freeway in Dandenong South. The freeway was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F2 Freeway corridor. The original plan shows the freeway extending down South Road over Nepean Highway heading north through Brighton and Elwood, following the Barkly Street-Punt Road- Hoddle Street corridor up through Merri Creek joining the Craigieburn Bypass to the Hume Freeway. Completed sections =South Road Extension= The South Road Extension runs along the Dingley Freeway route from Warrigal Road in Moorabbin to Old Dandenong Road in Heatherton. This was designed to remove traffic from White Street, Mordialloc as it was experiencing heavy-local traffic congestion, as a result of the most direct route linking the Mornington Peninsula Freeway with the Nepean Highway, along with Boundary and Wells Road. The one kilometre extension commenced construction in September 2006 and was completed by the end of 2007, at a cost of $9.3 million for the South Road extension alone, but cost $24.5 million when combined with the associated projects. The works involved constructing a two lane road to bypass a stretch of Old Dandenong Road which travelled through a residential area to Warrigal Road. A bicycle path was also constructed along the length of the extension. The extension also involved improvements to Old Dandenong Road and surrounding intersections as well as permanently blocking access to Old Dandenong Road north of the extension. The extension has a speed limit of 70 km/h. Despite the road having successfully removed traffic from Old Dandenong Road (between Warrigal Road and the current South Road connection) it had also created a major bottleneck at the intersection of Kingston and Old Dandenong Road, particularly during peak hour. =Westall Road Extension= The Extension runs along the Dingley Arterial route from Heatherton Road to Springvale Road in Springvale South. It commenced construction in 1994 and was finished in 1995. The extension is also known as the Springvale Bypass. The works involved creating a 2.8 km divided four lane (two lanes each way) semi- freeway standard road to bypass the busy and congested centre of Springvale. The extension involves constructing part of the Dingley Freeway to the future site of an interchange with Westall Road before travelling along a temporary alignment to join up with the extended Westall Road south of Heatherton Road. Formerly, a speed limit of 100 km/h applied between Heatherton Road and Rowan Road, while an 80 km/h limit applies on the approaches to Heatherton and Springvale Roads, however both sides have been limited to 80 km/h as a part of the Dingley Bypass construction. A bicycle path was completed along the entire length of the road. =Dandenong Bypass= The Dandenong Bypass was completed along the alignment reserved for the Dingley Arterial corridor. The project was staged in two separate projects over seven years, and has been recently opened to traffic between Springvale Road and South Gippsland Highway in December 2012. The entire bypass has a speed limit of 80 km/h with traffic light controlled intersections and overpasses at Cheltenham Road and EastLink. Perry Road to South Gippsland Highway The bypass commenced construction in late 2005 between Perry Road and South Gippsland Highway as part of the EastLink project, with the $65 million works involving the creation of a four lane divided road with traffic light controlled access at roads which run north‚Äìsouth along the constructed route. The 4.8 km bypass also included an overpass of the Cranbourne railway line as well as a diamond interchange with EastLink. The entire bypass has an 80 km/h speed limit. The project was completed and opened to traffic on 9 December 2007.EastLink tollway to open six months early Herald Sun 10 December 2007. Retrieved on 12 December 2007. Springvale Road to Perry Road The Springvale Road - Perry Road section of the bypass connects Westall Road with the then open Dandenong Bypass at Perry Road, creating an arterial standard highway, with traffic light controlled intersections and an overpass at Cheltenham Road, for 11 km from Westall Road to the South Gippsland Highway. The new section of road, which commenced construction in 2011, is expected to carry between 30,000 and 40,000 vehicles per day as well as a shared path being constructed alongside, linking to existing shared paths which already run along the built sections of the arterial. The construction of this section (at a cost of $74.6 million) was brought forward to commence in 2010 as part of the \\"Nation Building\\" initiatives in the 2009 Victorian State Budget.Gren Light for $74.6 Million Dingley Arterial Project Retrieved on 7 May 2009.

Construction of the Dingley Bypass began in 2014 and was completed in March 2016, 5 months ahead of schedule. The $156 Million, 6.4 kilometre Dingley Bypass was completed five months ahead of schedule and was opened on 11 March 2016 by Minister for Roads, Luke Donnellan. A divided highway with 3 lanes in each direction, it is expected to carry 35,000 vehicles each day. A new 5.2 kilometer bike path also runs beside the Bypass and extends from the existing bike path at Old Dandenong Road and provides vital links to Victoria's greater bicycle network. = Dingley Bypass Traffic Light Removal = In November 2018 the Victorian Liberal party proposed removing all traffic lights on the Dingley Bypass to create a Dingley Freeway. This was expected to cost $600 million.  Future sections  =Dandenong Bypass Extension (South Gippsland Highway to South Gippsland Freeway)= The final section to be built would be an eastern section running from the current Dandenong Bypass intersection with South Gippsland Highway to South Gippsland Freeway. Such a section would be the final link to be built but it would require the construction of a freeway style interchange on the South Gippsland Freeway end. The Victorian government had agreed to start this section by 2020, although this section is still in early planning.

Produced by Thirteen/WNET New York, Wall to Wall Media Limited, and PBS, the show placed fifteen modern day people in the context of 1867 Texas. Show participants attempted to run a ranch for two and a-half months using 19th century tools and techniques. The historian Alwyn Barr, professor emeritus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, was the consultant on the program. Participants =Cooke's= *Bill Cooke ‚Äì Ranch owner, a California businessman, husband of Lisa, father of Vienna, Lacey, and Hannah *Lisa Cooke ‚Äì Ranch owner's wife, homemaker wife of Bill and mother of Vienna, Lacey, and Hannah *Vienna Cooke, 19 ‚Äì eldest daughter of Bill and Lisa *Lacey Cooke, 17 ‚Äì middle daughter of Bill and Lisa *Hannah Cooke, 14 ‚Äì youngest daughter of Bill and Lisa *Maura Finkelstein ‚Äì Girl of All Work.

He is one of the five ranch hands that walked out in Episode 8 after the firing of Jared. *Rob Wright ‚Äì Ranch hand, who arrived at the Ranch right after Mr. Cooke's speech in Episode 5. (episodes 5‚Äì8) *Jared Ficklin ‚Äì Ranch hand, from Texas. He was fired in Episode 8 due to Mr. Cooke insistence that he owned the horse that Jared bought previously that Mr. Cooke paid the Camanche for four horses. Jared is a descendant of Ben Ficklin, general manager of the original Pony Express and namesake of the ghost town of Ben Ficklin, Texas. Episodes # \\"A Home on the Range\\" ‚Äì The series opens with the vaqueros, or cowboys, arriving at their new 1867 living quarters, the bunkhouse, and meeting the ranch family (the Cookes) for the first time. As the vaqueros get acclimated to the taxing manual labor of ranch life, digging postholes and hammering fencing, they meet their foreman, Stan, nicknamed \\"The Colonel,\\" and begin to understand the difficult tasks ahead of them. # \\"The Good, the Bad & the Colonel\\" ‚Äì The cowboys travel farther out on the range and slowly begin to gather cows, while back at the ranch, Mrs. Cooke, her three daughters, and family servant Maura begin to understand the drudgery of domestic life. Rising tensions among the group at large lead to various confrontations, including the firing of foreman Stan, but relief comes with a Fourth of July celebration that brings friends and neighbors to the ranch and gives everyone a chance to blow off some steam. # \\"The Cookie Crumbles\\" ‚Äì The cowboys awake to discover that 10 horses were stolen from the ranch overnight. Although they manage to retrieve five, they're still short five horses‚Äîones that they'll need for the cattle drive. Meals become a focal point of interaction between the vaqueros and the Cookes‚Äîfirst a mysterious stomach ailment brings the ranch to a grinding halt, ranch cook Nacho is fired, and finally, the food shortage reaches a critical point. # \\"The Great Divide\\" ‚Äì Having only claimed one quarter of the required cattle so far, the viability of the Cooke Ranch is in question. The vaqueros' bunkhouse welcomes cowboy Shaun as the new cook, and a freighter finally arrives with food and mail. A visit from U.S. Army soldiers delivers promising news for Mr. Cooke‚Äîthe U.S. Army will be buying cattle in the weeks ahead, providing him with a much- needed buyer. During this episode, Ian receives a letter stating that a close friend had died in a motorcycle accident, and leaves the show as a result. # \\"Showdown at the Cooke Corral\\" ‚Äì Mr. Cooke delivers a surprising midway assessment of the cowboys' performance, while a new cowhand arrives, throwing another personality into the mix. Mr. Cooke also sends \\"girl of all work\\" Maura off to cowboy training, but his revelation that she will be joining the upcoming cattle drive angers the vaqueros. # \\"Lords of the Plains\\" ‚Äì A run-in with a camp of Comanche Native Americans and the spotting of several stolen horses leads to one vaquero being held captive and negotiations between Mr. Cooke and the Comanche leader. The birth of five baby goats excites the Cooke girls, who find themselves nursing the runt rejected by its mother, while Maura and new foreman Robby come to an agreement about her role as a cowhand. # \\"Blazing Trails\\" ‚Äì After a final round-up, 131 head are culled from the herd for the big cattle drive, the rest held back to re-stock the ranch. After spending 12 solid hours in the saddle on their first day of the drive, the cowboys' spirits flag at the prospect of eight more days on the trail. Robby and his men have a confrontation with an ornery steer that teaches them just how dangerous cowboy work can be. Back at the ranch, the Cooke women are dealing with a massive fly infestation that is driving them nearly insane. # \\"The Reckoning\\" ‚Äì It's nearly the end of the drive and Ft. Santiago, the cowboys' destination, is in sight. After nine days on the trail the vaqueros count and deliver their herd to the army, but the buying agent's offer shocks Mr. Cooke. Overall the drive is a success, but tensions finally boil over upon the group's return to the ranch. The episode concludes with the assessment team reviewing the performance of all the participants and answering the ultimate question: would the ranch have survived another year?

More broadly, and in relation to human travel, it refers to 'the first land that is reached or seen at the end of a journey across the sea or through the air, or the fact of arriving there'.Definition of 'Landfall' in Cambridge Dictionary. Hurricane Floyd (1987) was the only hurricane to make landfall in the United States in the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical cyclone A tropical cyclone is classified as making landfall when the center of the storm moves across the coast; in strong tropical cyclones this is when the eye moves over land.National Hurricane Center (2009). Glossary of NHC Terms: Landfall. Retrieved on 2009-02-05. This is where most of the damage occurs within a mature tropical cyclone, such as a typhoon or hurricane, as most of the damaging aspects of these systems are concentrated near the eyewall. Such effects include the peaking of the storm surge, the core of strong winds coming ashore, and heavy flooding rains. These coupled with high surf can cause major beach erosion. In low-lying areas, the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess. When a tropical cyclone makes landfall, the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process, which causes surf to decrease. Maximum sustained winds will naturally decrease as the cyclone moves inland due to frictional differences between water and land with the free atmosphere.Sim Aberson and Chris Landsea (2008). [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C2.html Subject : C2) Doesn't the friction over land kill tropical cyclones?] Retrieved on 2009-02-05. Landfall is distinct from a direct hit. A direct hit is where the core of high winds (or eyewall) comes onshore but the center of the storm may stay offshore. The effects of this are quite similar to a landfall, as this term is used when the radius of maximum wind within a tropical cyclone moves ashore.National Hurricane Center (2009). Glossary of NHC Terms: Direct Hit. Retrieved on 2009-02-05. These effects are high surf, heavy rains that may cause flooding, water buildup along the coast with minor storm surge, coastal beach erosion, high winds, and possibly severe thunderstorms with tornadoes around the periphery. Storms, e.g., hurricanes, can be quite wide. Potentially dangerous winds, rain and flooding may impact an area near the center of the storm even though technically landfall may not have occurred. Accordingly, it may be helpful, to gauge the anticipated impact of such storms, to be aware of their general location, and land masses adjacent to the major thrust of the storm. Tornado or waterspout When a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado,Glossary of Meteorology (2009). Waterspout. Retrieved on 2009-02-05. which can subsequently cause damage to areas inland of the coast. When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it usually dissipates quickly due to friction and a reduction in the amount of warm air supplied to the funnel.Bruce B. Smith (2009). Waterspouts.

It was located along the North Saskatchewan River not far from Duck Lake, Saskatchewan. It was rebuilt by the Saskatchewan government as a feature of a provincial historic park and can be visited today. It is about 65 kilometers north of Saskatoon. History First called Carlton House, there were several historic Fort Carlton posts that operated in different periods and at three different locations. Two posts were established in 1795 and 1805 respectively. A series of forts named Fort Carlton operated at a third location starting in 1810. =Three Locations= * The first Fort Carlton (1795-1801) was built at a safer site near the old French post of Fort de la Corne in 1795 following the destruction of South Branch House. James Bird was in charge; James Sandison (Sanderson) was his assistant; and John Peter Pruden was an apprentice. From 1799 to 1801, Joseph Howse (Howes) was the writer in charge. The NWC had a nearby post called Fort St. Louis. It produced few furs and was closed in 1801. * The second Fort Carlton (1805-1810) was built on the South Saskatchewan River six miles upstream from the former South Branch House. Joseph Howse (Howes) was a trader. There was a nearby NWC post. In 1810 both companies abandoned the South Saskatchewan and moved to the third Fort Carlton. * The third Fort Carlton (1810-1885) was built on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan at the Great Crossing Place, a ford of that river. John Peter Pruden was master (1814-1815), master and trader (1815-1820) and chief trader (1821 - 1837) except for a brief furlough to London in 1824-1825. The area was prairie and not beaver country, but there were plentiful woods nearby and even a supply of limestone. The NWC had its Fort La Mont√©e inside the same stockade as the HBC's Fort Carlton. In 1816 the Nor'Westers moved out and established a second Fort La Mont√©e on the north bank 3 miles upstream. With the union in 1821 La Mont√©e was abandoned and whatever could be salvaged was rafted down to Fort Carlton. In 1824 a group of Natives attacked Fort Carlton but were driven off. By 1835 the buildings were in disrepair and a new hexagonal fort was built 200 yards to the west. This fell into disrepair and a new fort was built a few yards east of the first fort in 1855-58. About this time it was a depot for the winter express mail. Men coming from the upper Saskatchewan and Athabasca would meet and exchange mail with men coming from the Red River country south of Lake Winnipeg. There was a smallpox epidemic in 1869. Steamboats arrived on the Saskatchewan in 1874. The last fort at this location burned down in 1885 after a period of use as a police post (see below). =Commercial= Location of Fort Carlton As a Company post it primarily dealt in provisions, namely pemmican and buffalo robes although other furs were traded as well. Lawrence Clarke served as its last Chief Factor. It was a major base of operations for the Saskatchewan District of the Hudson's Bay Company. Situated on the Carlton Trail, running from the Red River Colony in present-day Manitoba to Fort Edmonton in what is now Alberta, Fort Carlton served as an important centre for travellers. =Police and Military Use 1880-1885= Treaty Six between the Canadian monarch and various Cree and Saulteaux First Nations was initially negotiated and signed near the Fort in 1876. Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa) had used the site in his initial negotiations for Treaty Six in about 1884, and finally, the following year he surrendered here after his engagement at Steele Narrows. The Prince Albert blockhouse was employed by the Royal Northwest Mounted Police on evacuating from Fort Carlton after the first fire. The North-West Mounted Police leased the fort from the HBC in the 1880s, and it was its main base in the Saskatchewan Valley region. Following the Battle of Duck Lake it was abandoned by the police and Prince Albert Volunteers, then it was briefly occupied by Gabriel Dumont's M√©tis forces. The rebels soon chose to withdraw to Batoche. During the 1885 conflict, the fort was destroyed by fire. =Provincial Park and reconstructed fort= Fort Carlton Provincial Park was opened in 1967.

It remains the largest alluvial diamond ever discovered in North America.  Diamond Characteristics  The bluish-white diamond weighed 34.48 carats (6.896 g), measured 5/8 of an inch (15.8 mm) across and possessed 12 diamond-shaped faces.  History of the Diamond  The diamond was discovered by William P. ‚ÄúPunch‚Äù Jones and his father, Grover C. Jones, Sr. while pitching horseshoes in April 1928. Believed to be simply a piece of shiny quartz common to the area, the stone was kept in a wooden cigar box inside a tool shed for fourteen years throughout the Great Depression. In 1942, Punch brought the stone to a geology professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) -- more commonly known as Virginia Tech -- in nearby Blacksburg, Virginia. Holden, shocked at Punch‚Äôs discovery, authenticated the diamond and the diamond was sent to the Smithsonian Institution where it remained for many years for display and safekeeping. In February 1964, the Jones family brought the diamond back and placed it in a safe deposit box in the First Valley National Bank in Rich Creek, Virginia. In 1984, the Joneses auctioned the diamond through Sotheby's auction house in New York to an agent representing a lawyer in an undisclosed east Asian country.

Jane Johnson (c. 1814-1827 - August 2, 1872)[Flynn, Katherine E. \\"Jane Johnson Found! But Is She 'Hannah Crafts'? The Search for the Author of The Bondswoman's Narrative\\"], National Genealogical Society Quarterly, September 2002 was an African-American slave who gained freedom on July 18, 1855 with her two young sons while in Philadelphia with her master and his family. She was aided by William Still and Passmore Williamson, abolitionists of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and its Vigilance Committee. This resulted in precedent-setting legal cases in 19th-century Pennsylvania, as a federal judge applied the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 in a controversial way. He sentenced abolitionist Passmore Williamson to 90 days for contempt of court for failing to produce Johnson and her sons under a writ of habeas corpus, or tell their location. The jailing attracted even wider publicity, and widespread discussion of issues of state and federal laws related to slavery. Pennsylvania had long been a free state and held that slaveholders gave up their property right in slaves if they brought them voluntarily to the state. Johnson returned to Philadelphia from New York in August 1855 and testified in the trial of William Still and five dockworkers, charged by her master John Hill Wheeler with assault. They had aided her escape. She testified at length about having planned to gain freedom in the North, and said she chose of her own free will to leave with Still, and would never go back to slavery. She helped win acquittal for Still and three men, and reduced sentences for two others. State and local officials protected her after testimony, and she and her sons soon moved to Boston, where they settled. She married again there. Her son Isaiah Johnson served in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War. Early life  Jane Johnson is believed to have been born into slavery under the name Jane Williams in or near Washington, D.C. Her parents were John Williams and Jane Williams. Little else is known of her early life. She married a man named Johnson and had children with him.\\"Jane Johnson\\", House Divided: Civil War Research Engine at Dickinson College, accessed 1 March 2014 Domestic slave About 1853, Johnson and her two children had been sold to John Hill Wheeler (1806-1882), a planter from North Carolina and politician then working in Washington, DC. She worked as a domestic slave in his household. Her oldest son had been sold by a previous master to someone in Richmond, Virginia, and she never expected to see him again. In 1855, Johnson and her sons Daniel and Isaiah (one 5 or 6, and 11 or 12, respectively), accompanied their master Wheeler and his family by train from Washington, D.C. en route to New York. There Wheeler planned they would take a ship to Nicaragua, where he had been appointed as the U.S. Minister. They stopped overnight in Philadelphia on the way.Keene, Ann T. \\"Johnson, Jane\\"; American National Biography Online, Feb. 2000. Accessed October, 2006 (subscription required); also available through House Divided, Civil War Research Engine at Dickinson College, accessed 1 March 2014 From there, they would proceed by steamboat to New York City to get the ship to Nicaragua. Pennsylvania was a free state that did not recognize slavery. By its laws, slaves could choose freedom if brought to the state by their masters. At the end of the 18th century, it had made compromises that enabled Southern members of the national government to keep their slaves in the city for up to six months; past that, they could choose freedom. At that time, the national capital was temporarily in Philadelphia. Choosing freedom Johnson emancipates herself and her children by walking away from her former \\"master\\", John Hill Wheeler, into the free city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On July 18, 1855, Johnson passed word to a black porter in Bloodgood's Hotel, where Wheeler had locked her in with her children, that she wanted to escape her master's custody. He got word to William Still, chairman of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, who helped fugitive slaves. Later that day, as the full Wheeler party prepared to board the ferry, Still and abolitionist Passmore Williamson, secretary of the Society, reached the docks. Williamson told Johnson that she could choose freedom according to Pennsylvania law. While Wheeler argued, offered her a promise of freedom, and tried to prevent Johnson from leaving, five black dockworkers restrained him, and Williamson explained the state law to him. William Still quickly escorted Johnson and her children away by a coach, later taking them secretly to his house. He never told Williamson where they were, under the principles of compartmentalization used by the Vigilance Committee. This act became one of the first challenges to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which required citizens and officials even in free states to help slaveowners capture fugitive slaves. But Johnson had chosen freedom in Pennsylvania, which was legal under its laws; she had not reached the state as a fugitive from the South. Williamson was subpoenaed by Pennsylvania US District Court judge John K. Kane, whom Wheeler had appealed to, under a writ of habeas corpus to produce Johnson and her sons. Kane had rejected as \\"immaterial and irrelevant\\" an affidavit from Johnson saying she had not been forcibly abducted. When Williamson refused to tell where Johnson was being hidden (as he did not know since Still had taken her away), Kane charged him with contempt of court and sentenced him to 90 days in jail. They had a history of confrontation over slavery issues. Williamson was held in jail between July 27 and November 3, 1855. His sentence aroused the anti-slavery movement, keeping the national spotlight on the issues, and he essentially \\"held court.\\" He received prominent visitors from the abolitionist movement, including Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, and hundreds of letters, as his case was covered by newspapers across the country. On August 29, 1855, William Still and the five dockworkers were tried in a local court for riot and assault under charges brought by John Hill Wheeler. Jane Johnson returned from New York, where she had been staying, and created a stir by appearing and testifying in court during the trial. She entered it veiled to be hidden, and was accompanied by several women abolitionists. They had also arranged for her protection by local and state officials, who thought Kane had inappropriately gone against state law regarding slavery by his rulings with Williamson. Johnson made a lengthy statement in court, testifying to her plans to gain freedom on that trip and overturning claims made by Wheeler's attorney. She said, > ... I went away [with Still] of my own free will; I always wished to be free > and meant to be free when I came North; I hardly expected it in Philadelphia > but thought I should get free in New York; I have been comfortable and happy > since I left Mr. Wheeler, and so are the children; I don't want to go back > ... ; I had sooner die than go back.William Still, \\"TRIAL OF THE > EMANCIPATORS OF COL.

They were determined to resist what they saw as interference with the integrity of local courts. Johnson and her children were soon helped to get to Boston, where they were safeguarded by northern abolitionists, including Lucretia Mott. They continued to live free, settling in Boston. Johnson married Lawrence Woodford shortly after her arrival there; she was widowed in 1861. She married again, to William Harris in 1864. Johnson sheltered fugitive slaves in Boston on at least two occasions. Her son Isaiah Johnson served in the American Civil War with the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops. Jane Johnson died in 1872 and was buried in Everett, Massachusetts, north of Boston. Relation to 19th-century novel In 2002 The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah Crafts was published, after having been authenticated by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., a Harvard professor of African- American literature and history. He prepared a preface about the manuscript and his efforts to identify the author, believed to have been an escaped slave who wrote the book in the mid-1850s. This may be the first novel written by an African-American woman. It refers to John Hill Wheeler and Johnson's escape in Philadelphia. Learning that Jane Johnson later lived in Boston, Katherine E. Flynn started to research Johnson's life, documenting her time after Philadelphia. She believed that Johnson might have written the novel, and published \\"Jane Johnson Found! But Is She 'Hannah Crafts'? The Search for the Author of The Bondswoman's Narrative\\", in the National Genealogical Society Quarterly, September 2002. In September 2013, Gregg Hecimovich, a professor at Winthrop University, published his research that documents Hannah Bond as Hannah Crafts; she was a slave at Wheeler's North Carolina plantation who escaped about 1857. She ultimately settled in New Jersey. Representation in popular culture *Johnson's life and escape inspired Lorene Cary to write the novel, The Price of a Child (1995). It was featured as a choice in the One Book, One Philadelphia program. *Jane Johnson and William Still are featured in the musical, Stand by the River (2003), which features Still's life and tells of Johnson's rescue from slavery in Philadelphia. *A fictionalized version of Jane Johnson's escape is depicted by Ta-Nehisi Coates in the novel The Water Dancer (2019), in which Johnson is represented by the character Mary Bronson.
