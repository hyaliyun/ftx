His poetry is focused on the experience of people who cross the US- Mexico border and Latin-American people in general. Education Vincent Toro attended Rutgers University where he received an MFA in poetry. Toro is also a contributing editor for the Kweli Literary Journal. Career In addition to writing and directing, Toro is an educator. Since 2001, he has taught in communities of color. He also spent this time writing about issues that are prevalent in these communities. As of 2018 he teaches at Bronx Community College as well as being a writing liaison at The Cooper Union Saturday Program. From 2006-2011, Toro was Theater Arts Director at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center. He is a member of the Macondo Writer‚Äôs Foundation and serves on the board of GlobalWrites, a non-profit dedicated to promoting literacy through integration of technology and performing arts in schools. Throughout the U.S. Toro teaches at CUNY'‚Äôs Bronx Community College and is a poet in the schools for the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Foundation and the Dreamyard Project.  Plays  Vincent Toro's plays have been shown at many theatres in New York including Teatro La Tea, Repertorio Espa√±ol, and INTAR. They have also been shown in Texas at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center and The San Pedro Playhouse.  Latinx Contributions  Motivation Toro‚Äôs experimentation in his poetry draws from afrofuturism, Italian futurism, and the Ultra√≠smo social and literary movements. Toro borrows ideas of liberation and linguistic boldness from these genres, and applies them in a Latinx context to redefine the Latinx identity and experience. Toro's editing process involves actively reimagining his poetry, focusing on intent and soul to keep the original impulse of a poem intact. Publications Toro has written two books, Stereo.Island.Mosaic. and Tertulia. He has been featured in many journals, including Anomaly Literary Journal, BOAAT Journal, Kweli Journal, The Texas Review, The Buenos Aires Review, Paterson Literary Review, and San Antonio Express-News, and Duende Literary Journal. Toro's poems can also be found in the Cream City Review's 39th publication and his work is discussed in the Chiric√∫ Journal: Latina/o Literatures, Arts, and Cultures as well. Additional works in which his poems have been published include Rattapallax, Bordersenses, Really System, Five Quarterly, Codex, and The Waiting Room Reader 2. He has also been published in multiple anthologies, including CHORUS by Saul Williams, Best American Experimental Writing 2015 (Wesleyan University Press, 2016), Coloring Book: An Anthology of Multicultural Poems and Stories (Rattlecat Press, 2004), and Misrepresented People: Poetic Responses to Trump's America (NYQ Books, 2018). Themes In poems like \\"Guan√≠n\\", ‚ÄúDREAMcatcher‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuman Instamatic‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSleep Dealer‚Äù, Toro uses pessimism to critique political thought as well as the limits placed on Latinx communities, whether those be idealogical or physical, through his common themes of separation seen literarily or in his formatting. In ‚ÄúGuan√≠n‚Äù, he reclaims Puerto Rican history of nobility, expressing limitations as the edges of the island. In ‚ÄúDREAMcatcher‚Äù he is critical of the limits that are put on the ‚Äúillegal‚Äù human, especially those involved in the DREAM Act, which come about as rejections of the immigrants body and way of living. In ‚ÄúSleep Dealer‚Äù, Toro focuses on the border crossing itself and the technological component of crossing a bridge between two worlds and the existence within one of those worlds with inspiration from Alex Rivera's Sleep Dealer. ‚ÄúGuan√≠n‚Äù is also consistent with the feelings of a beautiful land now tainted with materialistic and beauty, aesthetic focus that ‚ÄúHuman Instamatic‚Äù expresses in its criticism of the concrete jungle, the slums, and the drug use, a poem inspired by Martin Wong's depictions of the urban setting.  Awards  He received the San Antonio‚Äôs November 2008 artist of the month, was a recipient of an artist residency at The Atlantic Center for the Arts in 2001, and in 2004 was a finalist for the Allen Ginsberg Poetry Prize. Vincent Toro won the 2014 Poet‚Äôs House Emerging Poet‚Äôs Fellowship and the 2014 New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Poetry. For his book Stereo.Island.Mosaic, Toro won the Sawtooth Poetry Prize by Ahsahta Press in 2015, and The Poetry Society of America‚Äôs Norma Farber First Book Award in 2017. In 2018, he also received Naropa University's SWP Amiri Baraka Scholarship. His play ‚Äú21‚Äù won the Met Life Nuestras Voces Playwriting Award in 2018 and was staged at the Spanish Repertory Theater. During his tenure there, he won The San Antonio Theater Councils Golden Globe for Direction of a Drama for his staging of Suzan Lori Park's Topdog/Underdog.

During World War II the yacht served firstly as an accommodation ship for Polish naval forces and later as headquarters ship for Combined Operations. Design and construction Sister Anne was a steel-hulled motor yacht built during 1929. She was constructed at Gosport, Portsmouth Harbour by Camper and Nicholsons as Yard No.364 for Daisy Fellowes, the Singer Manufacturing Company heiress and wife of banker Reginald Ailwyn Fellowes. The yacht had a length overall of and length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a depth of . She measured and . The accommodation included an owner's suite and four guest staterooms. She was powered by a pair of 5-cylinder Gardner engines totalling and driving twin propellers. Sister Anne was launched on 12 June 1929. On completion she was registered at the port of Portsmouth with Official Number 160918, and allocated signal letters GTDQ. Pre-World War II service Sister Anne was based in Monte Carlo and regularly cruised in the Mediterranean. On 1 May 1930, following a visit to Egypt, the yacht caught fire south west of the Balearic Islands in position 38.08N 0.14W; only with the assistance of crew from the Ellerman Lines' passing British steamer City of London responding to an SOS was it extinguished. Sister Anne was able to continue her voyage. Celebrities entertained on board during the 1930s included the American columnist Elsa Maxwell, Cecil Beaton and No√´l Coward. In 1935 the yacht was loaned to the Prince of Wales and it was later rumoured that, following his abdication in December 1936, Wallis Simpson stayed on board during her period in hiding in the south of France. In September 1937 the yacht was fired on by a Greek warship for entering a militarised zone near the island of Aegina, and the captain arrested. Claiming that the zone was not marked on the navigational charts, he was released the following day. A similar occurrence occurred in August 1938. Early in World War II, at the fall of France in 1940, Sister Anne was berthed at Cannes. A Russian ballerina Nina Tarakanova, married to a Scottish businessman and a neighbour of Daisy Fellowes, had sold their own yacht and missed the last ship for England. She commandeered Sister Anne and sailed with other passengers to Gibraltar. There they joined Convoy HGY which sailed for England on 2 July, and arrived at Falmouth about a week later. Royal Navy service In September 1940 Sister Anne was hired by The Admiralty for service as an accommodation ship. She was based at Fowey for the use of the crews of motor gunboats and torpedo boats of the Polish Navy. In May 1941 the yacht was purchased by The Admiralty and served as headquarters ship for the Chief of Combined Operations, Lord Louis Mountbatten between October 1941 and October 1943. Post-war service Portrait of Daisy Fellowes by John Singer Sargent Following the end of the war, Sister Anne was laid up in December 1945 and subsequently reported sold. By 1951, she was back in service as a yacht with Daisy Fellowes, based at Cannes, and again being used by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

She also researched the history of women in chemistry, publishing the book Women Chemists (1995). She served as professor and chair of the chemistry department at American University in Washington, D.C. She received the ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences (1996) and the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (1998).  Early life and education  Roscher was born in 1938 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania and raised in Hershey, Pennsylvania. She received a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Delaware in 1960. She graduated from Purdue University with a doctorate in physical organic chemistry in 1964. While at Purdue, she founded the Iota Sigma Pi chapter of the Honor Society for Women in Chemistry.  Career  After graduating from Purdue in 1964, she taught at the University of Texas at Austin and Rutgers University, then joined the faculty of American University (AU) in Washington, D.C in 1974. At AU, she served in numerous administrative roles including associate dean for graduate affairs and research, vice provost for academic services, and dean for faculty affairs. She was active in the university senate, chaired a budget simplification task force, and served as the school's NCAA faculty representative. In 1991, she was appointed chair of AU's chemistry department, a position she held until her death in 2001. = Chemistry research = At American University, she continued physical organic chemistry research, including research on sunscreens for Johnson and Johnson in the 1980s. Her primary focus was reactions of alcohols with silver and bromine salts, and she supervised numerous graduate students, more than half of whom were women. = Advocacy work = She is better known for her administrative and advocacy work. She worked closely with her AU colleague, mathematician Mary Gray to improve resources for women and minorities in mathematics and science and prevent them from dropping classes. They created an apprenticeship program to help show first year female students an interdisciplinary, people-oriented perspective of scientists. The program, funded by a $95,000 grant from the NSF included a seminar course followed by a two-month apprenticeship working with a scientist engaged in science policy work. From 1976 to 1981, she administered a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded reentry program to retrain women with degrees in chemistry or biology who had previously been discouraged from pursuing careers in those fields. The program involved a year of intensive coursework in chemistry or toxicology at American University for 75 women, with an average age of 40, some of whom had been out of school for 15 years. Five years after the program ended, of the 75 participants, nine had received a Ph.D. in chemistry, 25 had earned master's degrees, and eight were in graduate school. Later analysis showed the program had also succeeded in ensuring them job placement in diverse career paths. In addition to her work at AU, she held a part-time position as program director of science education for the National Science Foundation (NSF) starting in 1986. At the NSF, she worked in the Instructional Laboratory Improvement Program, then became director of the Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement program in the Division of Undergraduate Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (USEME) in 1988. She joined the American Chemical Society (ACS) in 1960 and was very active in the organization. She served on the ACS Women Chemists Committee from 1974 to 1979 (as chair 1976-1978) and was president of ACS' Washington, D.C. section (the Chemical Society of Washington) in 1995. = Historian work = She was interested in the history of women in chemistry, and authored the book Women Chemists for the American Chemical Society in 1995. Much of her extensive research on female chemists is archived in the Archives of Women in Science and Engineering at Iowa State University; these \\"Nina Matheny Roscher Papers\\" are open for research and commonly cited. She also looked to the present and future of women in chemistry, analyzing statistics on disparities in training, retention, and compensation of female scientists. She compiled a 1990 ACS survey evaluating salaries of members and women's perceptions and satisfaction with their employment situation and opportunities for advancement.  Personal life  Roscher's outside interests included landscaping and remodeling of a cabin she owned in Lost River, West Virginia. She died from breast cancer September 19, 2001 at Georgetown University Hospital at the age of 62.  Honors and awards  In 1996 she received the ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences. In 1998, she received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, a yearly award administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) which recognizes up to ten \\"outstanding individual efforts and organizational programs designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics, engineering, and science in kindergarten-12th grade and through the graduate level\\". She was one of six chemists to receive the $10,000 grant award that year, which was presented by President Bill Clinton at a White House ceremony. * Honorary Membership Award, Chemistry, Graduate Women in Science (GWIS),1982 * ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences, 1986 * American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, fellow, 1987 * Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, 1988 * Distinguished Alumna, Purdue University, 1996 * Senior Scholar Special Commendation of Honor, American Association of University Women, 1998 * American Institute of Chemists, fellow  Selected publications   *  External links  * Nina Matheny Roscher Papers  References  2001 deaths 20th-century American chemists American women chemists 1938 births ","title":"Nina Roscher"},{"id":"58298991","text":"George Clifton may refer to: * George Clifton (plant collector) (1823‚Äì1913), English collector of seaweed specimens, active in Australia * George Clifton (footballer) (1865‚Äì1947), English footballer * George Herbert Clifton (1898‚Äì1970), officer in the New Zealand Military Forces ","title":"George Clifton"},{"id":"58299006","title":"Risto Jarva Award"},{"id":"58299015","text":"Sultana Wahn√≥n Bensusan (born 8 May 1960) is a Spanish essayist and literary critic, a professor at the University of Granada specializing in literary theory and comparative literature.

Her doctoral thesis, defended in 1987 and published by Rodopi in 1998, consists of a description of the Spanish fascist aesthetic system and the analysis of its progressive dissolution in postwar literary criticism. Specializing in literary theory, she has written books such as Introducci√≥n a la historia de las teor√≠as literarias (1991) and Teor√≠a de la literatura y de la interpretaci√≥n literaria (2008). In 1995 she began a line of research on the theater of Garc√≠a Lorca, a subject on which she continues to work today. In 1995 her book Lenguaje y literatura was released, in which she talks with the main representatives of the linguistic turn and hermeneutic skepticism. In 2000 she presented her hypothesis on the innocence of Josef K. in The Trial, which she developed extensively in the book Kafka y la tragedia jud√≠a (2003). The hermeneutic discussion contained in this book is continued in more recent publications such as El problema de la interpretaci√≥n literaria. Fuentes y bases te√≥ricas para una hermen√©utica constructiva (2009) and Perspectivas actuales de hermen√©utica literaria. Para otra √©tica de la interpretaci√≥n (2014). In 1992 Wahn√≥n entered the field of Cultural and Jewish Studies with a work on the Hebrew poetics of Moses ibn Ezra, and another on the role of the Wandering Jew in One Hundred Years of Solitude. Beginning in 1995, within the framework of the research project Philosophy After the Holocaust, she began a line of research on thought and literature of the Shoah, for which she authored papers on Hannah Arendt and Elias Canetti, and the monograph that she coordinated with for the journal Anthropos. Her most recent work in this line, from 2010, deals with the images of the Holocaust in post-war Spanish poetry. In this same period she participated in debates on anti-Zionism and antisemitism. From 2006 to 2007 she contributed to the national newspaper ABC with a series of articles on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In recent years she has continued to develop this critical activity in some articles on the current university model. In 2014 she published En fuga irrevocable. Un ensayo de cr√≠tica de la cultura, which deals with textual proliferation in the cultural and university spheres. She has dedicated several articles and reviews to contemporary poets and narrators, including Iris M. Zavala, Luis Garc√≠a Montero, Jos√© Guti√©rrez, , , Gregorio Morales, Francisco D√≠az de Castro, Rosa Reg√†s, and . Professional career In 1977 Wahn√≥n began her studies in Hispanic Philology at the University of Granada, where she has developed most of her professional and teaching activities. In 1990, she obtained a position as professor of the Department of General Linguistics and Literary Theory. In 2003 she directed the Instituto Cervantes of Utrecht. In 2004 she obtained the chair of Literary Theory and Comparative Literature. From 2008 to 2011 she directed Afinidades.

SWU uses community engagement to promote positive change through community education and information transparency in San Antonio, Texas, and the surrounding area. SWU‚Äôs areas of focus are environmental and social issues to perpetuate ‚Äúa community-labor strategy that takes on the many faces of injustice that impact working -class and poor families in South Texas.‚Äù Additionally, SWU participates in international organization events, such as the Border Social Forum, as well as other national social justice work.  History  The SWU was founded in 1988 in Hondo, Texas in the effort to combat environmental racism through community focused activism. The founding members of the union have worked closely with residents, local schools, working class citizens and local politicians to address the disproportionate environmental effects from the nearby air force base as well as other pollutant contributors in the area, such as the Union Pacific Railroad and Port San Antonio. SWU formed the Committee of Environmental Justice Action in 1994 and highlighted the impact of the air force base, which led to the contamination of local water sources, and as a result impaired the health of the residents. Various other grassroots organizations, including the Hondo Empowerment Committee, the Youth Leadership Organization, and Climate Collectiva, have also worked with the SWU to help build leadership with Mexican and Mexican-American working class citizens. For over 30 years, SWU has grown with various projects to ensure a safe space for residents to live, work, and grow, like community urban gardens (Roots of Change Community Garden) and advocating for workers' fair wages through campaigns such as the Living Wage Campaign, which engages with local and national policies to ensure better conditions for low-wage workers.  Environmental justice  = Kelly Air Force Base = Kelly Air Force Base, now known as Kelly Field Annex, was established during World War I and used as an air force training camp and general flying depot. The base is located in San Antonio, Texas, with a predominantly Hispanic population. It is currently used as an aircraft maintenance facility and houses many aircraft, jet engines, and other military machines. In 1983, the community found that the base had been dumping waste into an open pit for 13 years. This included benzene, chlorobenzene, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene, which are all known carcinogens. in 1993, The SWU came to Kelly to assist the North Kelly Garden Committee organize and educate community members on health and safety impacts. The EPA put a red flag on the facility and made it a top priority to clean up. The base initially denied off-site dumping or contamination.Lerner, S. (2007).

SWU advocates for green energy and career pathways for local residents affected by big energy businesses. Their work coincides with Climate Collectiva through strategic partnerships, along with Our Power, to push for public energy efficiency and transition from conventional fossil fuel energy.

University of Kwa Zulu Natal Press, Cape Town. In collaboration with University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, SWU have expressed their concerns through a fact sheet report on the current climate crisis. The report emphasizes the vulnerabilities, assets, and opportunities of various environmental justice factors. = Eagle Ford region = The Eagle Ford Play is a sedimentary rock formation that stretches over much of Texas. Eagle Ford was once one of the most active shale plays in the world, with 200 rigs running in January 2015. Due to this use, third-party groups have expressed concern over the health impacts on locals. In 2013 SWU, Centro por la Justicia and local residents organized meetings to discuss their concerns over fracking in Eagle Ford Shale. Additionally, SWU, Centro Por La Justicia and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill released a report in 2015 in which they describe ‚Äúthe consequences of the climate crisis, present current challenges in light of environmental and economic justice, describe current programs related to climate resiliency, and offers insight into future directions‚Äù.Centro Por La Justicia, & Southwest Workers Union (2015). Climate Resiliency in San Antonio: Moving Towards Justice. These efforts led to the publication of a study in 2016, which found that hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater from the Eagle Ford Shale contained hundreds of substances with the potential to contaminate drinking water of local residents. The study also demonstrated that these issues disproportionately affect people of color and people living in poverty.Johnston, J. E., Werder, E., & Sebastian, D. (2016). Wastewater disposal wells, fracking, and environmental injustice in southern Texas. American Journal of Public Health, 106(3), 550-556. Due to the decline of crude oil prices, the number of active rigs has dropped to 87 as of March 2018. = Union Pacific = Union Pacific is a train company based in the area of San Antonio, Texas. Between 2004 and 2007 there were 21 major derailments, which resulted in six deaths and multiple hospitalizations. One of these crashes led to the release of chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia near San Antonio. The released chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia fanned out to a 10-mile radius which resulted in the hospitalization of over 50 people. SWU was concerned with these accidents, as well as the railway's proximity to schools and families. SWU believes that residents of San Antonio should not be subjugated to any hazardous materials and operations. To try to prevent future accidents, SWU launched Southtown Organizing Project (STOP). Members of SWU attended hall meetings and congressional hearings on railroad safety in order to ensure STOP was successful and the people around the Union Pacific rails were represented. SWU also organized protests in coalition with the Committee for Environmental Justice Action in which they called for the creation of an emergency evacuation plan for those living near tracks, as well as full disclosure of the cargo of the trains. = Keystone XL pipeline = The Southwest Workers Union is against the Keystone XL pipeline that was proposed in 2012 by TransCanada. The pipeline participates in the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions. Large amounts of water and natural gas are required during the mining process, which can contaminate the surrounding water sources for local communities. The EPA suggested they look for alternative or mitigative processes to help combat those emissions. A lot of the land in the region is used to create and hold the pipeline. 95% of the land used is privately owned.Parfomak, P. W., Pirog, R., Luther, L., & Vann, A. (2013). Keystone XL pipeline project: Key issues. There were also visible oil spills in the area. The Southwest Workers Union does not want any of those potential consequences to affect anyone. The SWU was concerned with the health effects of the new infrastructure.https://search.proquest.com/docview/1906330459 They organized a rally, created a health survey, and presented those results on their website for the public. The U.S. State Department has the role of approving or disapproving the pipeline, in the nation‚Äôs best interest. That includes economically and environmentally. Their definition and the SWU definition of \\"environmentally safe\\" are different, which is why SWU opposes the pipeline. The U.S. State Department created an environmental assessment that predicted potential risks of the pipeline. The SWU argued that while the State Department stated possible environmental risks, they did not focus on the effect on the people living in the communities near the pipeline and associated roadways and facilities. The SWU argued that communities of color are wrongfully harmed due to their proximity to those places.  Workers' rights  = Living wage campaign = Workers in school districts in San Antonio, Texas, launched a living wage campaign with the aid of Southwest Workers Union. The San Antonio Alliance of Teachers, and support personnel and other community organizers, like SWU, asked the school board to support the campaign and look into raising the minimum wage to $13 per hour for 2017, and to $15 per hour by 2019. The SWU organized the employees at Edgewood and South San Independent School District meetings in February 2016 to ask their districts for a raise in wages as well.

The site is thought to have formerly borne the name Timnath, distinct from the Tel Batash-Timnah site associated with the biblical story of Samson in the lower foothills of Judea along the Sorek valley. Kh. et-Tibbaneh (Timnah) is perched upon a high mountain ridge rising up from the Elah valley and is where the episode of Judah and Tamar is thought to have taken place. Etymology Orientalists, Clermont-Ganneau and Edward Robinson, have made a point in showing the etymological Hebrew origins of certain Arabic place-names, saying that the Hebrew place-name Timnah was to be recognised in the Arabic corruption, Tibneh or Tibna.Clermont-Ganneau (1896), pp. 67‚Äì68, 214, where he wrote: (p. 214) \\"Tibneh, 'chopped straw', one would swear was Arabic, but it is beyond a doubt that it is the name of the town Timnah, brought into that shape by one of those popular etymologies which are as dear to the peasantry of Palestine as to those of our European countries.\\" On pp. 67‚Äì68 he wrote: \\"One has to beware, however, of these appellations that appear to be of purely Arabic origin, they are often ancient Hebrew names converted by a process of popular etymology into words familiar to the Arabs. In many cases slight phonetic changes assist the process. These , by the bye, are not arbitrary, but are subject to real laws. Thus, for instance, the name of the Bible town of Thimnah has become in fell√¢h speech Tibneh, 'chopped straw'.\\"Robinson, E. (1860), p. 17 John William McGarvey (1829‚Äì1911) who quotes Conder on the linguistic evidence of the name says that, in Arabic, \\"the substitution of B for M is so common (as in Tibneh for Timnah)...\\"McGarvey, 2002, pp. 246-247Palmer, E.H. (1881), p. 330, s.v. Tibna Both names have been preserved in the respective sites. Site and identification In ancient Jewish classical literature, two distinct sites in the land of Judah bore the name Timnath (Timnah).Neubauer, A. (1868), pp. 102‚Äì103; Press, I. (1955), p. 974 (s.v. ◊™◊û◊†◊î ◊ê)Encyclopaedia Judaica (vol. 15), Jerusalem 1971, p. 1147 (s.v. Timnah) The Book of Joshua records the names of two towns, both in the tribal inheritance of Judah and having the identical name of Timnath; the one Timnath (Josh. 15:10) being transcribed alongside the name of Beit Shemesh, while the other Timnath (Josh. 15:57) being transcribed alongside the name of Gibeah (of Judah), a town said to be Jab'a.An opinion expressed by historical geographer Klein, S. (1939), p. 198, and by PEF explorers Conder and Kitchener (SWP, III, 53). Jab'a, southeast of Bayt Nattif, is not far situated from Khirbet et-Tibbaneh. The Jerusalem Talmud (Sotah 1:8) relates the following tradition: \\"Rav has said: There were two Timnaths; one mentioned in connection with Judah, and the other mentioned in connection with Samson.\\"Same quote cited in Midrash Rabba (Genesis Rabba ¬ß 85 and Numbers Rabba 9:24) and in the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 10a). The 14th- century Midrash Hagadol brings down this tradition under a variant name: \\"Rebbe has said,\\" etc., instead of \\"Rav has said.\\" The Talmudic exegetes have explained that Samson, who lived in the hilltop town of Zorah near Beit Shemesh, is said to have 'gone down' to Timnath,Judges 14:1 but Judah is said to have 'gone up' to Timnath.Genesis 38:13 Kh. et-Tibb√¢neh is thought to be the Timnath (Timnah) mentioned in connection with Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38: 13, 14),Kelm & Mazar (1984), p. 58Abel, F.M. (1938), p. 481, s.v. Thimna (1), citing Conder & Kitchener's SWP, III, p. 53.Klein, S. (1922), p. 42 although this view remains inconclusive.Tristram, H.B. (1897), p. 66, who thought that it was one and the same place, where Samson had gone to take his wife, near the Sorek Valley. Khirbet et Tibbaneh (Tibna) was visited by Palestine Exploration Fund explorers, Conder and Kitchener, in the late 19th-century, where they described the ruin as follows: \\"Timnah - A town of Judah (Josh. XV. 57), mentioned with Gibeah. There is a ruin called Tibna near Jeb'a, in the higher hills of  æArk√ªb, distinct from Tibneh (Sheet XVI), which represents the Timnah of Joshua XV.10.\\"Conder & Kitchener (1883), p. 53 Others are unsure of its identification, since the site has yet to be fully excavated.Gibson & Negev (2001), p. 509 [s.v. Timnah (c)]Sch√ºrer, 1891, p. 158‚Äì159, note 438. =Site's description= The ancient ruin sits on a high mountain ridge about 2 kilometers west of Khirbet Sanasin. On its site is found the remnant of a square Iron Age fortress which apparently offered security along the route from the valley of Elah to Betar and to Jerusalem.Meltzer, M. (2000), p. 213 The area of the fortress is 30 x 30 meters (98 x 98 feet), where two walls made of fieldstones and ashlar masonry still remain, whose hollowed spaces were filled-in with smaller stones. Amihai Mazar suggests that the structure served as either a fortress or an administrative center, and most likely manned by a garrison to secure the roads between the major towns of the Shephelah and the string of settlements along the edge of the hill region.Mazar, A. (1993), p. 16 The mound is almost entirely strewn with razed boulders, and ancillary walls, partially standing, are to be seen on the ruin. On its eastern side is a steep declivity, descending down into the valley below, Wadi Tibbaneh (Wadi Tibna), where it joins Etzion Valley (Wady el Jindy) to its south at a drop of about . The valley seemed to have been used for horticulture in ages past. Sherds dot the landscape, with occasional carob trees, oaks and buckthorns. Near the site is a modern-day quarry and two ancient cisterns. In close proximity to Khirbet et-Tibbaneh is the old military patrol road, leading from Tzur Hadassah to Aviezer. History Khirbet et-Tibbaneh (Tibna) is thought to be the \\"Tapuna\\" mentioned in the list of Thothmes III.Tristram, H.B. (1897), p. 83 Israeli archaeologist Avi- Yonah also thinks the site to have been the Timnah (Thamnatha) mentioned in the First Book of MaccabeesI Macc. 9, 50‚Äì52 (and later mentioned by Josephus),Josephus, Antiquities (13.1.3) one of several places fortified by Bacchides in ca. 160 BCE after the death of Judas Maccabeus.Avi-Yonah, M.

Others suggest that the account in Maccabees may refer to another Timna (Thamnatha), that called Kh. Tibne in south-western Samaria, in Mount Ephraim, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) northwest of Bethel.Kallai, Z. (1960), p. 96Freedman, D.N. et al. (2000), p. 1312 It is generally accepted that the Mishnaic scholar, Simeon of Timnah, was born and raised in one of the two Timnahs during the waning years of the Second Temple period, based on the vowels assigned to his name, (). He is noted for saying: \\"A bastard is anyone who is born from an [illegal] union for which his parents are liable to kareth.\\" (Mishnah Yebamot 4:13; Babylonian Talmud, Yebamot 49a), and which teaching comes to exclude a single parent who gave birth to a child outside of wedlock, and whose child is often wrongly called \\"bastard\\" under common law.

Published in the Acha journal \\"Mabat Shelanu\\", No. 17, published by autumn 1994, Page 2, by the journal editor and publisher, the journalist Yoram Bar Yosef. Moshe Shem Tov (; April 30, 1924 ‚Äì December 25, 2005) was the chairman of the Central Committee (\\"the Center\\") of (Acha) from 1972 to 1989. Shem Tov was the first chairman of the Acha, who approved the conducting of the leadership courses for young Deaf people without experience, and trained them in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare in Israel and the Hanns Seidel Foundation, to be the next generation of the leaders in Acha. Shem Tov was born in Bulgaria and immigrated to Israel on July 31, 1948, when he was 24. His deafness did not prevent him from acquiring the Hebrew language, joining the Deaf community in Israel, marrying his wife, and bring two hearing kids. Shem Tov lived in Bat Yam, and worked with his brother in Jaffa in an industry of shutters and windows installation. After his retirement from the Acha leadership, Deaf people continued to reach his workplace, and he helped them willingly, even though these were his working hours.  Shem Tov and the Deaf Community  When Shem Tov was the chairman of Acha, the media options were quite limited. There were no closed captions on the television in Israel, which ran a single channel. Fax and internet were not existing, and the documents were written by a typewriter. The lack of communication options did not delay Shem Tov from being in a continuous communication with the World Organization of Jewish Deaf, and he also represented Acha as a member of the World Federation of the Deaf. Shem Tov had the ability to talk with everyone who was Deaf, hard of hearing or hearing. His personal skill was the quick ability to communicate theatrically and with a sense of humor even with total strangers.

On the right: First floor: Tel Aviv branch; Second floor: The Center; Third floor: Asach. On the left: The main hall, for lectures, parties and for the General Meetings. During March 19‚Äì23, 1973, the in Bat Yam held the Fourth International Conference on Deafness Problems, which was organized by Acha under the sponsorship of the World Federation of the Deaf. The mayor of Bat- Yam, Menachem Rothschild, attended its opening ceremony.The conference was published in the Acha journal \\"Dmama Shelanu\\" (Our silence), No. 103, March‚ÄìApril 1973. At the conference, Shem Tov gave a gift to , the president of the World Federation who attended the conference as well. The Center of Acha operated and worked in the Helen Keller House in Tel Aviv, alongside the Tel Aviv branch of Acha, and Shem Tov knew a lot of Acha members, because he was chosen by them every year as a delegate of Tel Aviv branch in democratic elections, and as Acha chairman in the General Meetings of Acha, which were made by the Israeli law of voluntary associations. Shem Tov knew also the Algerian Jewish Sign Language, because there were Deaf people from Algeria in the Tel Aviv branch. In the Helen Keller House there were also the (Asach) and a dormitory for Deaf pupils. The director of the dormitory was employed by Acha, and Shem Tov knew also the Deaf people from their juvenility. In 1985, during a reorganization of the Helen Keller House, by a request of the Tel Aviv branch, the upper dormitory floor was moved to Asach, which previously made its activity in a small room on the ground floor of the Helen Keller House, next to the dormitory dining room, and the dormitory was moved to Onim. The delegates of the General Meeting were elected as a delegate per a number of paying members in the branch. A larger number of branch members resulted more delegates, which were elected in secret and equal elections under the supervision of the Acha Audit Committee. The largest branch in Israel was the Tel Aviv branch, where deaf people from Gush Dan were registered.Getting Deaf people from the periphery caused disputes with the Municipality of Tel Aviv, which refused to assist Deaf people who were not residents of Tel Aviv. The second branch was the Haifa branch, where Deaf people from Acre and the Krayot were registered. From Ashkelon, Ashdod, Beersheba, Jerusalem and Netanya, there were usually two delegates from each branch. The General Meeting elected a Presidential Committee for the Management of the Meeting, received a summary report for the past year from the Chairman of the Acha, and reviews from the Acha treasurer and the Audit Committee, raised issues on which the chairman responded, approved the annual balance, and elected the chairperson of Acha for the next term. When the chairman was elected, he elected the members of the Center for leading Acha with him. Shem Tov had a liberal approach to the members of the Center, and gave them space in making decisions, while making regular meetings in which the members of the Center presented all their activities and received feedback and control of their actions from all the participants in the meeting. A similar approach was made by Shem Tov with the chairpersons of the branches, and he narrowly intervened in the activities which were carried out at the Acha branches. Once a year, he used to invite the chairpersons of the branches to a meeting in the Center, for getting their assistance with the national fundraising day for the Deaf. The chairpersons of the branches saw these meetings as a chance to improve the conditions in their branches, which some of them were in a bad physical condition, like the Jerusalem branch, which in 2003 received a new place on Ben Yehuda street in Jerusalem, after a decade it had no building and was operated in rented places like Magen David Adom building at Romema. Alongside his liberalism and his openness to the Deaf, Shem Tov inspected the Acha staff, which most of them were hearing, and replaced CEOs when it was needed. Shem Tov also retained the interests of Acha with government offices and in front of the similar Non- governmental organizations which operated in front to Acha. An Organization whose name was Shema operated clubs for Deaf and hard of hearing pupils, and demanded from the Ministry of Education a part of the annual Fundraising, which was established by Shem Tov. After the Ministry of Education had confirmed the participation of Shema and Micha in revenues of the fundraising, Shem Tov initiated an idea to establish the Association of Youth Silence, a nonprofit subsidiary of Acha, for financing activities under the age of eighteen. This idea was not accepted by the General Meeting of Acha, and eventually sank.  Leadership courses for the Deaf  A communities' evening in the leadership course.

Abu married David Cohen, who was also a student of the course, and later was elected as the chairman of Be'er Sheva branch, while Abu served alongside him as the secretary of the branch, and in 1989 Abu was elected to Acha Center. Shem Tov approved the leadership courses for the Deaf people, which lasted for four consecutive cycles, and each cycle lasted a year. Leadership is the ability of a leader or an elected official to lead a public to a vision or a goal. For being a leader, abilities are needed, and the course provided it. The participants learned these abilities to lead their public to its goal, even if it was a party at the club. The class was attended by Deaf young people from all over the country. They were elected in preliminary sortings conducted by the candidates themselves, when veteran activists of Acha observed them and then took part in the final choice, alongside weighing the results of the young people themselves. In the leadership courses, the Deaf participants gathered once a week in Tel Aviv, and acquired knowledge of a club leadership by learning civics, teamwork, initiative and creativity, simulation games, communication, conducting a meeting, making decisions and basic concepts in social work. The Seidel Foundation funded the students' participation in several weekends, during which the students received lectures from professionals in the fields of Interpersonal communication, Land of Israel studies and Otorhinolaryngology, with an interpreting of the Israeli sign language. At the end of each course, the Ministry of Labor and Welfare gave to the students the certificates, which were signed by Shem Tov alongside the Ministry of Labor and Welfare. Shem Tov himself came to the leadership course in 1983, passed from a student to a student, talked to everyone, and got to know each one personally. Later, Shem Tov reviewed the activities at Acha and emphasized the need of a \\"nucleus\\", which was defined as a teamwork. These courses were held for four years, until 1986. In the first three years, the students were elected at the beginning of each year. In the fourth year, outstanding students from the previous years participated, and several veteran activists of Acha joined them, including Shem Tov himself, who took a part in the course as a full-time student. By the request of Acha Jerusalem branch in 1986, Shem Tov approved a leadership course for the members of Jerusalem branch, when they still had a club on Mevo HaMatmid street, before it was destroyed by the Jerusalem Municipality for a road construction. The course was funded by Acha, and taught elected Deaf participants from Jerusalem what a club was, club management, democracy and teamwork with a sign language interpretation. Thanks to the course in Jerusalem, Zamir Levy, who had disputed Shem Tov continuously before the course, was chosen as the chairman of the Jerusalem branch every year. In the fourth leadership course in Tel Aviv in 1986, Yaakov Arnfeld, who lit a torch on the eve of the Independence Day in 2016, chose his project to find Deaf people who did not come to the Deaf club at Helen Keller House in Tel Aviv. He found out that most of them were in Petah Tikva and lived in Amishav (Hadar Ganim). They claimed that going from Amishav to Yad Eliyahu required them to take three buses in each direction, which was not possible from their point of view. Arnfeld talked with Orna Leshem, a social worker in Acha, and she talked with the Director of the department of the social services in Petach Tikva Municipality. In 1987 they established a club for the Deaf people in Petah Tikva. It puzzled the teacher of the course, who said that Arnfeld, like Saul, searched for stray donkeys and found royalty (a new Deaf club). = The reaction of the delegates to the leadership courses = Ilana Saban, who graduated successfully the 1983 course, was elected by Shem Tov to the Center in 1984. The delegates of the General Meeting declined it, and conducted a decision in the General Meeting. By this decision, which was put in the regulations of Acha, a candidate who wanted to be elected to the Center, had to gain a practical experience of an activity at the branch for a given period of time before being elected to the Center.  The band of Sound and Silence  Shem Tov, who had a theatrical background, promoted the Kol Ve'Damaa band,Newspaper Maariv, October 15, 1980, page 21, Historical Jewish Press which was directed by Moshe Efrati, who danced in Batsheva. After the Sound and Silence band, a theater group of Deaf people was established in Acha, whose name was Ten Fingers and the director was the actor Hemed Schulberg. The liaison between Shem Tov and Schulberg was Ilana Saban, after Shem Tov gave her a full freedom of action in her work with the theater, because her husband Shmuel was a dancer in the group of Sound and Silence. One of the plays which was presented by Ten Fingers was The House of Bernarda Alba, which was entirely presented by the Deaf actors without a single word of speech in the 1988 summer while the World Congress of the Deaf was held in Tel Aviv. In July 1987, Ten Fingers went with Saban to Denmark for appearing also there. in the 21st century the dancer Amnon Damti, April 1, 2015 continues to perform with Jill, a dancer who hears.Jill and Amnon website  Deaf and Hard of Hearing people  In 1974, Shema addressed Acha and asked to remove the word \\"mute\\" from the name of Acha. Shem Tov accepted the request, and the association's name was established as the Association of Deaf People in Israel, instead of the Association of the Deaf-mute People in Israel. In the summer of 1981, the World Congress of the Jewish Deaf people was held at the International Convention Center (Jerusalem), where Deaf Jews from the world arrived. The congress lasted four days, during which Edna Cohen collected Deaf people to a new association which was called \\"Keshev: The hard-of-hearing people in Israel\\".\\"Keshev\\" is Awareness in Hebrew. Keshev is also an abbreviation of \\"Kivdei Shmiaa BeIsrael\\": Hard of hearing in Israel. Every deaf person who could talk fluently, joined. The establishment of Keshev made a resentment in the Acha, and Shem Tov constantly tried to speak with Cohen, suggesting her a leadership inside Acha. Keshev's bureau was in a shelter in Tel Aviv, and Shem Tov promised a better place at the Helen Keller house for the hard of hearing people, with a separate day and a dedicated budget. Cohen replied Shem Tov that the hard of hearing people could not observe sign language, because it was a cultural change for them. Hence their need for an organization which was not a part of the Acha. Eventually Keshev was closed when it spent an extra finance upon the international congress for the hearing impaired in the Jerusalem International Convention Center in 1992. In the summer of 1983, a professional conference was held at the Astoria Hotel in Tel Aviv, near the Dolphinarium. The conference was upon professional subjects, but during the meeting, words were said between Deaf and hard of hearing participants. At that time, the Ministry of Education decided to close the Niv school in Haifa,Niv school in Haifa and the school principal came to the conference to tell the closure. The news staff of Channel 1 arrived at the hotel to broadcast the closure of the school. When the staff arrived, a hearing participant made a speech about her hearing-impaired daughter as it was determined on the agenda of the conference, and asked the audience to applaud for the sake of the school in Haifa. The news staff did not understand the situation, and left the conference mainly due to noise and difficulties in recording. It made resentment among the Deaf people from Haifa, until Shem Tov went on the stage and shook hands with Mrs. Ahuva Magen, the CEO of Shema, in order to chill out the atmosphere at the conference, which was a professional conference in every aspect.  The first demonstration of the Deaf people  On February 16, 1984, Shem Tov organized the first demonstration of Deaf people opposite to the Knesset in Jerusalem,Ma'ariv, February 16, 1984, page 17 when the CEO of Acha was Oded Hon. The members of the Acha Jerusalem branch prepared food and drink for the 500 deaf demonstrators which got gathered from Israel. During the demonstration, Shem Tov requested recognition for the Deaf people as disabled people in all aspects, with all the accompanying rights,This recognition exists in the Israeli law of Equal Rights for People with Disabilities, which was not exist in 1984. such as exemption from taxes on hearing aids, Simultaneous translation into sign language in the television,It was accepted in the Television Broadcasting Law (Subtitles and Sign Language), 2005. and appropriate professional training which would make it easier for deaf people to integrate into work. Shem Tov requested also discounts in income tax according to the disability percentage which was determined for each disabled person.  TTY Committee  During 1984, Omer Zak, an electrical engineer from the Technion, promoted a project of the TTY in Israel. Zak made a Hebrew software for the Commodore VIC-20 and then for the Commodore 64. The Acha was neutral, and Shema made barriers in Zack's project due to the professional considerations of its representative David Rubner, who worked at ECI Telecom. As a result, in 1985 the General Meeting of Acha approved establishment of a committee of TTY members to promote the issue. An application was made to the TTY manufacturers for presenting their items to the Deaf public, and an exhibition was held in the large hall at the Helen Keller House, attended by four manufacturers: Tadiran, which introduced the Commodore computers; MicroBee, which introduced a personal computer whose software was Basic; RadioShack, which presented a TTY configuration of a laptop, and Yossi Ofir, which presented a TTY with one line of a Hebrew text and two sockets for the handset. Most of the committee members chose MicroBee because the screen went on by itself when a phone call was received. Commodore did not have an answering machine. Then Zak made an answering machine software for the Commodore by a Cassette tape, when the TTY software was operated by a cartridge, but the committee has already voted MicroBee. Shem Tov approved the distribution of the MicroBee computers to the Acha branches. Some members of Acha borrowed MicroBee by depositing guarantees for the sake of Acha. After distributing the MicroBees, malfunctions were detected when they were activated. MicroBee distributors did everything to fix the malfunctions, but were unsuccessful due to the model's structural weakness. At the same time there was an increase in the IBM Personal Computers, but after Microbee there was little motivation of the Deaf people to use a TTY, even though Zak made a software in Hebrew for the IBM-PC and distributed it on a 5.25 inch disk. Telecommunications relay service had not been exist in Israel due to the lack of legislation, and began only in July 2009.Equal Rights Regulations for Persons with Disabilities (Access to Bezeq Services and Bezeq Facilities), 2009 Ezer Levy, who was also a member of the TTY committee, was elected in 1989 as the chairman of Acha, after Shem Tov chose to resign voluntarily. After Levi's election as chairman, Levy decided to replace the TTY with fax, due to his will to communicate with the government and with the public services, and the TTY project collapsed.  Haifa Branch  The Haifa branch of Acha fought for years to obtain a sport playground like in the Helen Keller house. In 1983, the chairman of the Haifa branch consulted with Shem Tov, and got his approval to make the Burla house, the building of the Haifa branch in HaTzionut Avenue,, March 11, 2013 for renting to a banquet hall, which was called \\"Nof HaCarmel\\", in order to collect funds for the construction of the playground. When the Burla house was under rent, the entrepreneur made a neon illuminated sign on the outer wall of the Burla house. Two Haifa delegates, Ron Giladi and David Suissa, raised the issue at the General Meeting of Acha in the early 1984. Due to the firm tone of their arguments, Shem-Tov informed the General Meeting that during his visit in the Burla house at Hanukkah party, which was held before the General Meeting, he got the impression that the illuminated sign was inappropriate, and ordered to remove it. After the cancellation of the contract, the entrepreneur sued the chairman of the Haifa branch by a civil lawsuit, the Haifa chairman filed a third-party notice against Shem Tov and Acha, and the suit ended with a compromise. Following the lack of confidence in the Acha General Meeting, the Haifa chairman resigned, and during the four years the Haifa branch ran without a chairman, until a new chairman was elected.

Kelez, Oceanographic High-seas Vessel Retrieved August 26, 2018The NOAA history reference, which also has the Navy designation confused with the original Army designation, is contradicted by other sources regarding the Army design vessels.  Service history  =U.S. Army and U.S. Navy= FS-400, was placed in service with the United States Army Transportation Corps during World War II with a United States Coast Guard crew. The ship operated in the Central Pacific Area calling at ports such as Noumea, Guadalcanal, and, after the end of the war, Wake Island. On 1 July 1950, she was transferred from the U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the United States Navy‚Ä≤s Military Sea Transportation Service, entering noncommissioned service in the U.S. Navy as USNS AKL-30 (T-AKL-30). She was stricken from the Naval Register in 1961 and declared excess property at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Mare Island, California, during the summer of 1961. =U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service= In late 1961, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), an agency of the United States Department of the Interior, inspected AKL-30. The USFWS acquired her in 1962 for use as a fisheries research vessel, and in February 1962 towed her from Mare Island to Seattle, Washington, where she underwent conversion into a fisheries research ship over the next four and a half months at a cost of approximately US$100,000. Her USFWS crew did most of the conversion work, purchasing and installing new equipment such as fishing equipment, oceanographic equipment, and specialized electrical and refrigeration systems and modifying the captain's and crew's quarters. When her conversion was complete, the ship ‚Äì now named US FWS George B. Kelez ‚Äì was commissioned in a ceremony at Seattle on 20 July 1962 attended by Kelez's mother and brother. Kelez, a fisheries scientist who was the Assistant Fisheries Administrator for the Territory of Alaska, was one of five Fish and Wildlife Service employees who died on duty in the crash of a Grumman Goose amphibious aircraft in Alaska on 1 September 1954,Wilbanks, William, Forgotten Heroes: Police Officers Killed in Alaska, 1850‚Äì1997, Paducah, Kentucky: Turner Publishing Company, 1999, . pp. 53-55, Retrieved August 27, 2018 and the ship carried a plaque ‚Äì read aloud at the ceremony ‚Äì that read: > United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Motor Ship George B.

Assigned to USFWS's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF), George B. Kelez gave the BCF a new capability to conduct oceanographic and open-ocean salmon studies during the winter; previously, the BCF had relied on chartered vessels for such studies, but they were too small for safe winter operations in the open ocean and were limited to spring and summer operations. George B. Kelez also provided the BCF with adequate on-board laboratory space and storage space for gear and spare parts for the first time. George B. Kelezs first cruise for the BCF ‚Äì a six-week shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Alaska and off the Aleutian Islands ‚Äì began in late July 1962. During the cruise, she conducted experimental salmon gillnetting. During the 1960s, she made several salmon-fishing cruises in Bristol Bay and other waters off Alaska in support of the BCF's Biological Laboratory. During the mid-1960s, she also participated in several experiments designed to determine ocean current flows, using drift bottles in the subarctic Pacific Ocean and oceanographic data- gathering buoys equipped with radio transmitters released in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington. In early 1966, she took part in the first winter oceanographic measurement of the Alaskan Stream ‚Äì a current related closely to the formation of the salmon fishing ground ‚Äì in the western subarctic region of the North Pacific. =NOAA= On 3 October 1970, a major reorganization occurred which formed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the reorganization, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and placed under NOAA,Guinan, John A., and Ralph E. Curtis, \\"A Century Of Conservation,\\" noaa.gov, April 1971 Retrieved August 22, 2018 and ships of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries fleet joined those of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in forming the new NOAA fleet. At first, the major ships that were to constitute the new fleet reported to separate entities, with former Coast and Geodetic Survey ships subordinate to the National Ocean Survey (the Coast and Geodetic Survey's successor organization within NOAA), while former BCF ships like George B. Kelez reported to the BCF's successor within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service. During 1972 and 1973, however, the ships of the National Ocean Survey and National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as those of the Environmental Research Laboratories, integrated to form a consolidated and unified NOAA fleet, operated by the National Ocean Survey's Office of Fleet Operations.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Retrieved August 23, 2018 George B. Kelez officially became part of the new NOAA fleet in 1972. As a NOAA ship, she at first was redesignated NOAAS George B. Kelez (CRS 41), later becoming NOAAS George B. Kelez (R 441). Starboard quarter view of NOAAS George B. Kelez Meanwhile, George B. Kelez continued her operations. In the summer of 1971, she conducted a cruise in the North Pacific to collect salmon and sea trout samples which were later analyzed in genetic and maturity studies. In the autumn of 1971, she made a 21-day cruise off Washington and British Columbia to sample ichthyoplankton and zooplankton populations and conduct tests in the field of fishing gear, including net systems, on-board larvae-holding facilities, a seawater chemical concentration autoanalyzer, and a method of using computers to process salinity and water temperature data. She made a 39-day cruise off Southeast Alaska in early 1972 in which she tagged 2,400 sablefish. In the spring of 1972, she cruised for 22 days near Kodiak, Alaska, examining oceanographic and environmental conditions and testing the operation of shipboard data acquisition devices. Also that spring, she made a cruise in Puget Sound and in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington to determine the suitable structure, towing speeds, and trajectories for zooplankton sampling gear known as a bongo net, which consists of paired plankton nets mounted side-by-side that a vessel tows horizontally through the water.vliz.be Flanders Marine Institute: Bongo net In the summer of 1972, she made a cruise in the Gulf of Alaska to study the distribution and abundance of Pacific salmon. NOAA had limited funding during its first three years of existence between 1970 and 1972, forcing it to reduce ship operations and oceanographic studies. This led NOAA to decommission George B. Kelez near the end of 1972, and she never returned to fisheries research work. However, in March 1973 NOAA recommissioned her and loaned her to the United States Geological Survey for use in Southern California. In late 1974, NOAA moved her to a new home port, NOAA's Atlantic Marine Center at Norfolk, Virginia, and on 6 December 1974 opened bids for repair work to the ship. With her repairs completed, George B. Kelez returned to service, focusing on oceanographic research. She spent the years from 1976 to 1980 primarily operating in connection with the Marine Ecosystems Analysis (MESA) New York Bight Project, which used benthic sampling to monitor and research the short-term ecological effects of ocean dumping. During this time, she was assigned to the support of NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories from 1976 to 1977 and to the support of NOAA's Office of Marine Pollution Assessment from 1978 to 1979. In January 1980, 35 scientists from 13 countries taking part in an intergovernmental project to gather oceanographic data on the effects of common pollutants conducted open-ocean sampling aboard George B. Kelez in the North Atlantic Ocean off Bermuda. NOAA decommissioned her by the end of January 1980 and eventually put her up for sale. =Later career= In April 1982 the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship of Brooklyn, New York, purchased the ship and renamed her MV Earl \\"Bull\\" Shepard. The school, which moved to Piney Point, Maryland, in 1991 and simultaneously renamed itself the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education, used her until February 1994, when it sold her to foreign buyers, who renamed her Moss Point, Mississippi, bearing a port of registry of San Lorenzo, Honduras. In 2006, the Omega Protein Corporation of Reedville, Virginia, acquired her, registered her in the United States, renovated her for use as a menhaden fishing vessel, and renamed her MV Smuggler's Point. As of 2016, Smuggler's Point remained in commercial service.

Kyle designed the bridge, which includes four open spandrel arches supporting a wide roadbed with four lanes of motorized traffic crossing river. Two , cantilevered sidewalks allow for pedestrian traffic. History Boise was established in 1863, soon after the second Fort Boise was constructed, and its location required that Oregon Trail pioneers ford the Boise River. In 1864 John McClellan and William Thompson formed the Ada Ferry Company and received a charter to operate a ferry at the crossing. McClellan and Thompson constructed a toll bridge near the site in 1868. The Ninth Street Bridge replaced McClellan and Thompson's toll bridge in 1911. In 1914 architect Charles Wayland envisioned a grand boulevard approaching the Idaho State Capitol Building, and after the Boise Depot was built in 1925, city planners redesignated 7th Street as Capitol Boulevard, and the Capitol Boulevard Memorial Bridge was constructed and dedicated as a memorial to Oregon Trail pioneers. The bridge was refurbished in 1987 and restored in 2013 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places November 5, 1990.

He also bought a small farm in Northern Mississippi about thirty five miles south of Memphis, Tennessee and was active in local politics. = Testimony for the United States Senate Select Committee = Even during Reconstruction participation in the political system was dangerous for African Americans. Undeterred, Edmonds continued to vote though he was attacked and threatened by white mobs during the Election of 1875, and was witness to violence, intimidation, and murder. In June 1876, Edmonds testified before the United States Senate Select Committee to Inquire into the Mississippi Election of 1875 about his being beaten and intimidated by a mob:‚ÄúMississippi in 1875. : Report of the Select committee to inquire into the Mississippi election of 1875, with the testimony and documentary evidence‚Äù, United States, page 234-7. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c025383545;view=1up;seq=354 Accessed 08/15/2018 > I went around a great deal in the county in the Republican canvass, and I > spoke, I think, a time or two in the last campaign.

In response to death threats against his family, Edmonds left post- Reconstruction Mississippi for Los Angeles around 1890.Bunch, 132. In 1896 he published his first newspaper, the Pasadena Searchlight. He was a political supporter of the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat, when the vast majority of Southern California's African Americans were Republicans. This political difference of opinion with the majority of the Searchlight's readers led his partners to relieve Edmonds of his editorial duties.Bunch, 134. = Participation in Political Parties = In spite of the violence and intimidation Edmonds experienced in the South, he remained politically active after moving to California. At a time when most African Americans were expected to vote for the Republican ‚ÄúParty of Lincoln‚Äù as a matter of course, Jefferson Edmonds advocated political support of candidates who promised to do the most good for the African American community, regardless of party.J. L. Edmonds, ‚ÄúWHY ARE THE COLORED VOTERS SUPPORTING THE UNION TICKET,‚Äù Los Angeles Herald, October 16, 1898, California Digital Newspaper Collection. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Silver Platform‚Äîremoving the United States from the Gold Standard‚Äîwas popular with farmers for its promise of easing agricultural debt. Edmonds supported the Silver Platform through participation in both the Silver Republican PartyR.H.

The Liberator  In approximately 1900 Edmonds started a second paper in Los Angeles. He named it the Liberator in honor of William Lloyd Garrison's famed abolitionist newspaper of the mid- nineteenth-century. Edmonds' Liberator, which operated over a span of about fourteen years from approximately 1900-1906 and 1910-1913, was known for its support of working-class black Angelenos. Edmonds used the Liberator to champion civil rights, and support candidates of any party whom Edmonds believed would support African American community objectives. Edmonds was also a California \\"booster\\" who believed Southern blacks should migrate to Los Angeles both for economic opportunity and political freedom. He wrote that Southern California was ‚Äúripe for advancing the race‚Äù and cited specifically the ability of blacks to own businesses and homes. He viewed home ownership as especially important in the black quest for full citizenship. = The Shenk Rule = A preliminary scan of the Liberator Volume 12, Issue 3 (1913-04-18) made by the Los Angeles Public Library from the Edmonds Family Collection (https://www.jledmondsproject.com) for the 2018 Los Angeles City Hall African American Heritage Month Exhibit \\"Write In America,\\" presented in part by the office of Los Angeles City Council President, Herb Wesson. In 1912, the Los Angeles City Attorney, Shenk, issued a ruling stating that \\"...it was neither extortion or a violation of the Civil Rights Act to charge a negro more for an article than a white man...\\" At the time, the decision was known as the Shenk Rule, and many white business owners used it as a means of enforcing de facto segregation.J.L.

Edmonds attacked the decision in print and used the pages of the Liberator to chronicle discrimination and hardship caused by the Shenk Rule. When John Shenk ran for mayor in 1913, Jefferson L. Edmonds ‚Äúurged all African Americans to vote against him. When Shenk was defeated by a small margin, Edmonds claimed 'another great victory for the Liberator.‚Äô‚ÄùBunch, ‚ÄúThe Greatest State for the Negro: Jefferson L.

Los Angeles Times Special Edition Jefferson L. Edmonds was a featured writer in several citywide newspapers, often tasked with writing about the state of black politics in Los Angeles. In 1909 he was commissioned by the Los Angeles Times to write an eight-page spread on the state of the Black Los Angeles community. The special edition was an effort to commemorate President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs centennial birthday. At the time, Edmonds had been in the publishing business for over a decade. He focused the special edition around his personal slave narrative. He details his account of hearing the news of the Civil War ending and the promise of freedom.J. L.

Defending Civil Rights  = The Los Angeles Forum = A preliminary scan of the Liberator Volume 9, Issue 18, 1911-06-16, p. 02 made by the Los Angeles Public Library from the Edmonds Family Collection (https://www.jledmondsproject.com) for the 2018 Los Angeles City Hall African American Heritage Month Exhibit \\"Write In America\\" presented in part by the office of Los Angeles City Council President, Herb Wesson. In 1903, Edmonds worked with Frederick Roberts and Reverend J.E. Edwards found an organization called the Los Angeles Forum whose primary purpose was to challenge racial discrimination and consolidate black political power in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Forum (known as ‚ÄúThe Forum‚Äù) was a series of Sunday town hall-style meetings to discuss issues in the black community that was established in 1903 by Jefferson Edmonds, the Rev. Jarrett E. Edwards, pastor of the First AME Church, and John Wesley Coleman, a businessman, among others. Meeting weekly, first at the First AME Church and then at the Odd Fellows‚Äô Hall at 7th and Wall Streets to discuss current events, philanthropic causes, and political issues, the Forum was part of the Los Angeles African American community until 1942. In the early 1900s, the group raised money for causes as diverse as the San Francisco earthquake, the 28th Street YMCA, black agricultural homesteading experiments, and sending Ruth Temple (the first black female doctor on the west coast) to medical school. The Forum became more politically active during the 1910s when the Shenk Rule of 1912 caused concern that Southern-style Jim Crow practices were creeping into Los Angeles. By publicizing the hardship caused by the Shenk Rule and urging voters to the polls, the Liberator and the Forum contributed to the defeat of John Shenk in the 1913 race for mayor of Los Angeles. = The Liberator Supported Black Business Owners = Edmonds used the Liberator to highlight black business owners and stressed the importance of supporting black-owned establishments.J.L. Edmonds, ‚ÄúNegroes Who Have Made, and Are Making History,‚Äù The Liberator, January 17, 1913, Los Angeles Public Library preliminary scans of Edmonds Family Collection. He profiled black business owners such as Mary Owens and J.B. Loving, independent realtors; A.J. Jones, hotel owner, V.W. Morris, a restaurant owner, and many more. = J.L. Edmonds Real Estate = When Edmonds brought his family to Los Angeles in 1892, African Americans could freely purchase and inhabit property in many parts of the city. But as more African Americans migrated to Los Angeles, that freedom was eroded by the rise of racially restrictive covenants, contracts which white property owners attached to the deed of a house that barred people of color from purchasing the properties. Though the practice became ubiquitous in Southern California after World War I, the first restrictive covenant that used ‚Äúthe all-inclusive term of ‚Äònon-Caucasians‚Äô to define all who could not purchase property,‚ÄùSanchez, G. J. (2007). The History of Segregation in Los Angeles: A Report on Racial Discrimination and Its Legacy. Scheff & Washington, PC, in legal case American Civil Rights Foundation v. Los Angeles Unified School District. p. 3 was drafted in 1902, and the practice grew quickly thereafter. As racially restrictive covenants became more popular in new housing tracts and subdivisions, Edmonds partnered with Noah Thompson in a 1913 joint real estate venture to sell homes to African Americans in and around Los Angeles, the Noah D. Thompson Realty Company.‚ÄúNoah D Thompson Realty Co.‚Äù (Liberator Publishing Company, 1913), JLE-00038, Los Angeles Public Library preliminary scans of Edmonds Family Collection. Noah Thompson worked with Booker T. Washington at the Tuskegee Institute from 1909 to 1911 before moving to Los Angeles. He later served as the president of the Los Angeles branch of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. He was also a journalist who wrote for the Los Angeles Times, Evening Press, and the Morning Tribune, and worked as an associate editor of the Liberator. = The Crisis = Edmonds covered W.E.B. Du Bois‚Äô historic trips to Los Angeles in 1913 in the pages of the Liberator. Dr. Du Bois was impressed with his visit, proclaiming that ‚ÄúNowhere in the United States is the Negro so well and beautifully housed, nor the average of efficiency and intelligence in the colored population so high.‚ÄùW.E.B. Du Bois, ‚ÄúEditorial,‚Äù The Crisis, July 1913. p. 130  Legacy  = Death = Jefferson Lewis Edmonds died on January 4, 1914. One of his eulogies was read by former Los Angeles Mayor Meredith P. Snyder. While the Liberator did not survive Edmonds‚Äô death, the Forum continued for an additional 28 years, and Edmonds‚Äô legacy of service to Los Angeles survives to this day. In 2001, Lonnie Bunch, now the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, wrote: > As a leader and a visionary in the struggle against racism in Southern > California, Edmonds deserves the scholarly attention and reputation garnered > by his contemporaries William Monroe Trotter, editor of the Boston Guardian, > and Robert Abbott, publisher of the Chicago Defender.Bunch, ‚ÄúThe Greatest > State for the Negro: Jefferson L.

In 2017, the Edmonds family partnered with the Los Angeles Public Library to digitize their holdings of the Liberator through the California Revealed Digitization Program. When complete, digitized copies of the Liberator will be viewable for free online by the people of Los Angeles, and the world.

It is the highest point of the Buckindy Range, or Buckindy Ridge. It is located 19 miles east-northeast of Darrington, Washington, and 15 miles north-northwest of Glacier Peak which is one of the Cascade stratovolcanoes. It is situated in the Glacier Peak Wilderness on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Mount Misch was named by mountaineer and author Fred Beckey for his friend Peter Misch (1909-1987), University of Washington geology professor and mountaineer, who was renowned for his study of the North Cascades. Precipitation runoff from Mount Misch and the unnamed Goat Creek glacier on its east slope drains into tributaries of the Suiattle River and ultimately the Skagit River. Climate Mount Misch from Green Mountain Mount Misch is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Buckindy Range seen from Eldorado Peak with Mount Misch the highest peak on left side The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The rusty reddish color of Mount Misch and the Buckindy Range is due to mineralized breccia pipe.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.

Shortly after, he recruited bassist David Ellefson from Megadeth, guitarist Alex Skolnick from Testament, and drummer Mike Portnoy, formerly of Dream Theater. Though the group does not have an official lead singer, they usually hire guest musicians to contribute vocals and/or guitar parts to their studio recordings and live shows, including Andreas Kisser of Sepultura and Mark Osegueda of Death Angel. To date, Metal Allegiance has released two studio albums and one EP. Background Metal Allegiance was formed by bassist/songwriter/producer Mark Menghi in Long Island in July 2014. Mark shortly after recruited, bassist David Ellefson (Megadeth) and drummer Mike Portnoy (The Winery Dogs, Sons of Apollo, Flying Colors and formerly Dream Theater) to perform on Mot√∂rhead's Mot√∂rboat Cruise for their first ever live appearance as Metal Allegiance, which was described as \\"a celebration of heavy metal, powered by the almost tribal bond shared between the extreme music community's most revered trailblazers, armed with a list of contributors onstage (and off) that read like a Wikipedia entry on the genre itself.\\" All of the band members were longtime friends and had jammed together occasionally, including events such as the Shiprocked Cruise and NAMM; this eventually led to recording an album. It was on the Mot√∂rboat Cruise where they enlisted guitarist Alex Skolnick (Testament) as the final piece to the \\"Core 4.\\" The result, the eponymous Metal Allegiance, was released on September 17, 2015, and included a number of guests, including vocals by Phil Anselmo, Randy Blythe, Troy Sanders, Chuck Billy, Mark Osegueda, Cristina Scabbia, Matt Heafy, Doug Pinnick, Jamey Jasta, Chris Jericho, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, Alissa White-Gluz and Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza, guitar by Heafy, Gary Holt, Phil Demmel, Andreas Kisser, Misha \\"Bulb\\" Mansoor, Ben Weinman, Charlie Benante and Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal, and bass by Rex Brown. It was between a span of 9 months (December 2014 to September 2015) where Menghi, Ellefson, Skolnick and Portnoy wrote, recorded, mixed and mastered their debut album while having over two dozen special guests appear on it plus signing a global record deal with Nuclear Blast Entertainment under the careful eye of AR legend Monte Conner. Metal Allegiance received positive reviews worldwide, and performed well on the charts, entering number 143 on the Billboard 200, and number 27 on the Top Rock Albums chart. The band promoted the album by touring at various venues within the United States along with performing at many festivals and one-off appearances like Loud Park Festival in Japan and Bloodstock Festival in the United Kingdom amongst others. Metal Allegiance's next release was a digital only covers EP entitled Fallen Heroes, released on August 12, 2016, as a tribute to then-recently deceased singers Lemmy, David Bowie and Glenn Frey. The EP includes covers of Mot√∂rhead's \\"Iron Fist\\", Bowie's \\"Suffragette City\\" and the Eagles' \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\", with vocals provided by Troy Sanders, Mark Osegueda and Alissa White-Gluz respectively. In honor of all of music's Fallen Heroes, Metal Allegiance performed a special \\"Fallen Heroes\\" tribute concert at The Grove in Anaheim, California on January 20, 2017 where they exclusively covered music from all of their personal musical heroes whom have passed on.

In contrast to an allopathic or western view of medicine, traditional Alaska Native medicine believes that illness stems from an individual's disharmony with the environment and healing must therefore begin in the person's spirit.  Food = Seal = Seal oil, whale oil, and the meats of these animals are the predominant healing substances used by members of the Inuit culture. These substances are believed to provide warmth which is a condition of health to this culture as warmth is the essence of well-being. Seal is used preventatively by hunters who eat the animal's meat before going on a hunt to increase endurance and ward off weakness, hypothermia, and frostbite. The oils and meat are also used to prevent depression and other diseases of the soul. Medicinally and as a remedy, seal is used as a treatment for ear infections, gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, headache, fractures, lice, skin rashes, and acne. = Wild berries = Alaska Natives traditionally harvest a variety of wild berries as general food consumption, but the berries also play a significant role in health as well. Salmon berries, which are similar to raspberries, have been used for wound healing and as gynecological aids; the leaves and stems of blackberries are used to treat diarrhea and to counter kidney trouble; and highbush and bog blueberries are used topically and orally as medicines. The high antioxidant activity in wild berries also helps to reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline and cancer.  Plants  = Devil's club= The Tlingit culture is known for using devil's club for a variety of ailments. The weed can be turned into tea, mashed into a salves, chewed, and steamed to help with illnesses such as colds, coughs, stomach problems, tuberculosis, hypoglycemia, cancer, depression, broken bones, congestion, and inflammation. The Tlingit consider devil's club to be \\"strong medicine\\" due to its effects on the psycho-pharma-spiritual aspects. = Willow trees = One commonly known medicinal benefit from the willow tree is the use of its bark. Alaska Natives and other Native American tribes have used the bark from the Willow tree as a pain killer. In fact, the bark does contain acetylsalicylic acid which is now called aspirin and has been commercialized as an over the counter pain killer. The willow tree's leaves can also be used in a poultice or bath to ease skin infections or irritations and, when turned into an ash, can be sprinkled on severe burns to prevent cuts from becoming infected. = Dandelions = Each part of the dandelion can and has been used by Native Alaskans and other Native Americans for medicinal use. It is rich in a variety of vitamins (A, B, C, and D) and minerals and helps with liver issues such as hepatitis and jaundice as well as being a natural diuretic and laxative. The root of the weed is also used as a caffeine substitute.  Types of healers  = Shamans = Shamans are religious and spiritual leaders who are considered \\"magico-religious.\\" This is due to their ability to heal severe conditions that border on supernatural origin and cannot be tended to by traditional remedies. Shamans differ from traditional healers in that these individuals possess the ability to travel by trance to other realms in search of answers to a person's illness. They also take on a variety of roles within their community including healers, magicians, politicians, psychologists, predictors of weather and good hunts, priests, social workers, and mystics. = Traditional healers = Traditional healers deal with everyday forms of illness or injury and can include herbalists, surgeons, massage specialists, midwives, or medicine men and women. What sets traditional Alaska Native healers apart from western doctors is both their traditional methods as well as the source of their healing abilities. Both shamans and traditional healers receive their gift of healing from a stronger spiritual source which communicates to them through visions or dreams, consciousness-altering illness, or apprenticeship to another healer.  Organizations  = Southcentral Foundation = Southcentral Foundation is an Alaska Native health care organization that serves Alaska Native and American Indian people who live in Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and 55 rural villages across the state of Alaska. The organization focuses on physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellness and emphasizes the importance of culture as well as provides access to traditional healing services. The organization also has a Traditional Healing Clinic in which tribal doctors take a traditional approach to healing and offer services such as traditional counseling, traditional physical (including healing hands and healing touch), traditional counseling, and a women‚Äôs talking circle. The clinic also has an Alaska Native traditional healing garden in which plants that have been used for medicinal use for generations are grown. = Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium = The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium is a Tribal health organization that serves Alaska Native and American Indian people who live in the state of Alaska. The organization provides a variety of services including comprehensive medical services at the Alaska Native Medical Center, wellness programs, disease research and prevention, rural provider training and rural water and sanitation systems construction.

Also containing a foghorn. It stood from the edge of the water. Its height was and was painted white. It was the first lighthouse in Canada to have an electric light and foghorn run by power produced on site. The building were erected for $3,559 and the gasoline engines and power plant for $3,358. = Current lighthouse = Richard Chapman was hired as the first keeper. In a month he found out the electric equipment didn't work properly was forced to used a fixed while oil light until the issue could be resolved. In 1903 the characteristic of the lighthouse was altered to show a fixed light for 23 seconds followed by an ellipse for 4.5 seconds. The same year a fog horn run by compressed air replaced the electric fog horn. The new horn sounded for 15 seconds separated by 15 seconds of silence. In 1905, a separate fog alarm building was built just south of the lighthouse, forty feet from the water. In 1908 a concrete-lined well was added as well as a dock for receiving coal and other supplies needed for the facility. In 1927, the steam fog alarm plant was replaced by an oil plant. The lighthouse was mostly isolated from the rest of the Bruce Peninsula, besides from boat and walking until Keeper Norman Whetton spent two years building a road. After finishing work, he took his motorboat and cleared the next section of road. One the road was completed he and his family would take the road to arrive in April and Depart in December. John Adams who served from 1968 to 1979 recalls preventing a fire when a lightning bolt hit the fog alarm building. The last keeper was Fredric Jerome Proulx, who left in 1986 after six years of service. In 1975 the residence and the fog alarm were demolished leaving only the concrete lighthouse. In 2007 the Canadian Coast Guard removed the Fresnel lens from the tower as vandalism was threatening its safety. The Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre enter negotiations so it could display the lens at the museum. In 2009 the museum received the lens.

On ‚ÄúThe Light‚Äù Before Christmas ‚ÄòTwas ten days before Christmas and all through the night Snowflakes danced in the rays of Cape Croker‚Äôs big light. Santa jingled his bells up at the North Pole While I scanned the road full of drifts and potholes. The wilderness road that would take us from here Had ruts deep enough to gulp Santa‚Äôs reindeer. December was up to its usual tricks And I thought, with a sigh, ‚ÄúWe are in a fix!‚Äù I sprang from my chair to view Georgian Bay - The Season‚Äôs last freighter was passing our way. There was one thing to do ere the end of the year - Close up the station and get out of here. Then in a flash, while the fog-horn did clatter, I saw just the way to settle the matter. All it would take- now, what was that word? What we needed was a whirly-bird! A ‚Äòchopper to sky-lift us over the bluffs To avoid all the drifts, the potholes and ruts.

It is one of very few examples of the Castellated Gothic Revival style in Oregon, other than local armories. Its first owners, both English immigrants, were locally notable figures: Charles Roper was a professional photographer whose work comprises an important documentary record of central Lincoln County in the 1910s and 1920s. He was elected mayor of Newport in 1922, and maintained a photography studio on the top floor of his house. Theresa Roper was the writer and illustrator of several books of romanticized history, and was a collector of local Native American objects that she used as a basis for her illustrations..

Pataki is an Associate Dean for Research in the College of Science at the University of Utah. She won the James B. Macelwane Medal in 2008 from the American Geophysical Union for her research on coupled water and carbon cycles. The award is given to ‚Äúsignificant contributions to the geophysical sciences by an outstanding early career scientist.‚Äù  Early life and education  Diane E. Pataki was born in New York City, NY. She attended Jamaica High School and was included in the first group of students to participate in the Gateway to Higher Education (program) which started in 1986. The Gateway program allowed for students to receive extra exposure and mentorship in science and math. Pataki has cited this as what inspired her to pursue scientific research. Pataki took extra science, research and writing classes at the City University of New York. Pataki graduated from Barnard College with a major in Environmental Science in 1993. During this time she worked as an intern at the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund assisting the Executive Director, Fred Krupp. Pataki attended the Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment to pursue a M.S. and Ph.D.. While at Duke, she met Professor Ram Oren who became her Ph.D. advisor. Pakati's dissertation is titled \\"Water use of co-occurring species in response to environmental conditions at varying temporal scales\\". Her two post-doctoral mentors were James Coleman at the Desert Research Institute and James Ehleringer at University of Utah.  Career and research  After her doctoral research, Pataki became a professor at the University of California, Irvine in 2004. While at UCI, she was the founding Director of the Center for the Environmental Biology and the Steele Burnard Anza Borrego Desert Research Center in 2011. Pataki then went to the University of Utah in 2012 as an associate professor for the Department of Biology as well as an adjunct in the Department of City & Metropolitan Planning. In 2014, she served as a Program Director of the Division of Environmental Biology at the National Science Foundation. In the same year, Pataki was also a member of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Board of Scientific Counselors. Diane's earlier research under Ram Oren while at the Desert Research Institute looked at the variance of somatic conductance in species. She now specializes in the coupling of biogeochemical cycles in urban environments and how they interact with ecosystem services and she also uses carbon isotopes in ecosystem studies to calculate carbon dioxide fluxes produced. Diane was honored in 2015 by the Leopold Leadership Program to be inducted as a Fellow for her research on the effects of urban ecosystems on local climate, pollution, and water resources in cities. She currently serves on National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Biological Sciences as well as the NSF's Advisory Committee on Environmental Research and Education.

It was built in 1897 and served as the jail for Rockdale County, Georgia from then until a new jail was built in 1968. It was entered into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 26, 1982. It now serves as the headquarters for the Rockdale County Historical Society and is known as the Old Jail Museum. History Rockdale County was created in October 1870 from parts of adjacent counties. The new jurisdiction authorized construction of a stone jail in 1872. By 1897 the county had outgrown the original jail. Construction of this replacement jail was authorized and architects Golucke & Stewart were hired to design it with F.P. Heifner as the builder. The resulting structure is a two-story rectangular building of red brick, with a basement. The building has a hipped roof and iron bars provide security on windows on both levels. The jail entrance at rear The first floor contained offices and living quarters for the sheriff and his family. The second floor contains the jail and consists of three rooms. One contains a four-cell jail block, one is the drunk tank and the last is a jailer's room that could serve as a \\"hanging room\\" when needed. At the southeast corner of the first floor is an outside entrance that leads directly up to the jail. Designed and built to be a county jail, the building therefore reflects the state of the art in jail design at the time. J.W. Golucke was \\"one of the state's foremost courthouse architects\\" who often designed jails as well. For this project he employed jail equipment from Pauly Jail Building and Manufacturing Co. of St. Louis, Missouri. The Old Jail Museum When a new county jail was built in 1968, this building sat vacant for several years. In 1975 it was bought from the county by the Rockdale County Historical Society, which restored it at a cost of $15,000. The building is now called the Old Jail Museum. The first floor is now used as offices and museum space. Exhibits include an old television set from 1930 and petticoats from antebellum era weddings. The upper floor containing the jail looks \\"pretty much as it did ... when prisoners were held there.\\" The cells still contain old graffiti including the names of some incarcerated in the jail.

It was founded in 1874 to serve the area's large German immigrant community. The paper's unique focus on local news contributed to rapid growth, making it one of the largest circulations in the state. It survived demographic and political changes following World War I, in part because the editorial staff had begun offering an English-language supplement in 1922. After a run of 57 years, Der Nordstern ceased publication in 1931 during the height of the Great Depression.  History  By 1870 the rapidly growing Central Minnesota town of St. Cloud already had a large German immigrant population. To meet the demand for news, publishers Peter Brick and Peter Kaiser printed two sample newspapers in December 1874. Copies were freely sent to all the names they could find on the Stearns County tax rolls. Within weeks they had a paid circulation of over 800, nearly 40% of the city's population at the time. The paper was named after the state's official motto, L'√âtoile du Nord, \\"Star of the North\\", which had been adopted in 1861. The first extant issue of Der Nordstern is a four-page, six-column layout dated February 17, 1876. The paper concentrated on local and state news, correspondence, and general agricultural topics. It became a hub for community discussion and political debate, and also included literary features such as critical reviews of German books. This was unusual among German-language papers at the time, which were focusing primarily on national news and news from Germany. Demand for this content steadily increased and Der Nordstern began publishing 12-page issues on September 22, 1898. Eventually it had the largest circulation of any newspaper in the state north of Minneapolis. In the early 1900s, Der Nordstern expanded coverage to nearby towns in Stearns County, including Freeport, Greenwald, and Melrose. Coverage of national and international news began to increase during the years leading up to World War I. After the war, during a time when many German-language papers were being discontinued due to anti-German sentiment, Der Nordstern began offering a 4-page English-language supplement to bridge the language gap between generations and increase interest in German culture. Publishers changed numerous times over the years, but the paper's unique approach and upbeat tone was shaped primarily by editor Gerhard May, who served from 1884 until the paper was discontinued. Der Nordstern was sold to the Times Publishing Company of St. Cloud in 1929. By this time, the paper was being published in a 24-page, 4-column format. With the pressures of the Great Depression and changing demographics, the last issue was published on August 27, 1931. At 57 years, Der Nordstern had one of the longest runs of any German-language newspaper in Minnesota. The Minnesota Historical Society converted the paper to microfilm between 1968 and 1984 and made the archives available to the public.

Biography Born in Hungary to Idel Hertzfeld and to Avraham Zvi Klein, a rabbi of Szilas-Balhas in western Hungary, he initially received a traditional Jewish education (1893‚Äì1897), graduating from the Government Gymnasium at Budapest in 1905. From there he went on to study at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Berlin where he was ordained in the rabbinate. From 1906‚Äì1909, he was enrolled at the Hochschule f√ºr Wissenschaft des Judentums, and in the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin, before advancing to Heidelberg University where he wrote a thesis entitled: Beitr√§ge zur Geographie und Geschichte Galil√§as (Leipzig 1909) (Contributions to the Geography and History of Galilee), his first important contributions to the science of Historical Topography of the Holy Land. (Hebrew) In it, he gave an incisive analysis of the topographical and historical material preserved in the liturgical poems of Kalir, and by which novel work he received in 1909 his PhD. He served as a rabbi in the city of Tuzla in Bosnia from 1909‚Äì1913, during which time, in 1911, the Association for Jewish Studies in Berlin awarded him a research grant of 500 Marks which enabled him to conduct research in Palestine. After he had taken a wife in 1913, he then served as the rabbi of the town of √ârsek√∫jv√°r (Nov√© Z√°mky) (1913-1928). During the First World War, Klein was conscripted in the Austro-Hungarian army as a rabbi, and became the patron and benefactor of some 200 refugees who came to Nov√© Z√°mky in search of a new life. In 1924, Klein became the first professor of the newly opened Institute of Jewish Studies, which was to form part of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1927, Klein was an instructor at the Hebrew Pedagogical Institute in Vienna, an institute involved in training of Hebrew teachers for the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. In 1929 he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine where he began work as Professor of Geography of the Land of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and worked in this capacity until his death.Tam√°s Tur√°n & Carsten Wilke, Modern Jewish Scholarship in Hungary: The 'Science of Judaism' between East and West, Berlin 2016, p. 21 (note 59) While at the Hebrew University, Klein was chairperson of the Historical Topography of Palestine.See p. I in: He is the author of many books and articles, both in Hebrew and in German, mostly treating on the subject of historical geography. Klein's research on the geography of the Land of Israel has helped promote a greater understanding of the map of ancient Israel / Palestine, and whose works have been incorporated in Hebrew schools in the Diaspora and in Israel. Death and legacy In Mandatory Palestine, he became a member of the Hebrew Language Committee, as well as participated in committees on Geography and Archaeology. In his final years, he served as the President of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society, a consortium of British Mandate scholars. He died at the age of 53 in his home in the Bukharim quarter of Jerusalem on the eve of Passover, 1940, and was buried at the cemetery on the Mount of Olives. Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, William F. Albright, and David Yellin wrote moving eulogies of the man upon his death. (Hebrew) (Hebrew) In the words of Albright: \\"Samuel Klein represents Jewish philological research at its best; his erudition was exhaustive, covering Graeco-Roman as well as Hebrew and Aramaic sources; his critical judgment was sound and highly developed; his acumen and insight into complex historical and topographical situations were unsurpassed among specialists in the field.\\" Klein's greatest contribution to scholastic research is his identification of old place names in Palestine during the classical period, drawn principally from the Hebrew Bible, Mishnah, Tosefta, Talmud, and from the writings of Josephus in transliterated Greek-form, as well as from other epigraphic texts of antiquity.

An Industrial Bank building on U Street was designed by Isaiah Hatton a few years later. The bank closed in 1932 but was reorganized and reopened by Howard University alumnus Jesse Mitchell in 1934. By 1947 the bank had $6 million in assets from over 14,000 depositors, more than 20% of whom were white. This made it the largest black-owned bank in the U.S. The bank faced staffing difficulties because trained white bank workers were unwilling to work for a black bank, but DC only had a single bank training institute, and that institute had a whites-only policy. In 2013 the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation invested $1 million in certificates of deposit at the bank to spur lending to the African American community. The number of African American banks fell during the Great Recession and Industrial Bank was the last African American-owned bank in Washington D.C.

Paolo continued the refurbishment. The Silva family had formerly populated the rural castle of Crevoladossola, and this now represented its urban palace.

The camp operated under German control from September to November 1943 and, following that, under the control of the Italian Social Republic from December 1943 to February 1944. Approximately 375 Jews, including Italian nationals, 119 refugees from Poland, and refugees from France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Greece, were held at Borgo San Dalmazzo until deported to Auschwitz and other German camps where all but a few were murdered. Camp history =German period= The camp was established on 18 September 1943, ten days after the surrender of Italy to the Allies, in a former Alpini barracks of the Royal Italian Army near the railway station of Borgo. Up to the Italian surrender, Jews of Italian nationality and refugees from other European nations had lived in relative safety in Italy and the parts of Southern France occupied by Italy. After the Italian surrender, German forces already in the country began an occupation and ordered all non-Italian nationals in the area to present themselves to the occupation authorities. With local assistance, a large number of the Jewish refugees managed to hide, but 349 people (201 men and 148 women) either presented to the authorities or were captured and moved to Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp. Many were caught by the 1st SS Panzer Division while trying to cross the French border into Italy at Ventimiglia. Conditions in the camp were far less severe than in other, similar camps, and medical assistance was available to the inmates at the hospitals of Borgo and, for more severe cases, Cuneo. Despite a number of successful escapes from the camp, conditions did not worsen much for the inmates. On 9 November 1943, most of the Jews of Italian nationality were released for reasons unknown. On 21 November, the 328 non-Italian Jews remaining in the camp were, on orders from the Gestapo office in Nice, taken to the nearby train station, put in freight cars, and taken to either Fossoli di Carpi or Drancy, France. These included the 41 inmates that were, at the time, recovering in the hospital of Borgo. Inmates who were at Cuneo hospital were protected and hidden by the hospital staff and were not removed. Many of those saved from deportation were helped by a local Catholic priest, Don Raimondo Viale, who provided food, shelter and, eventually, an opportunity to escape to Switzerland. His efforts were honored when he was named as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in August 2000. Raimondo Viale ‚Äì his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website In three stages, on 7 December, 17 December and 27 January, the prisoners at Fossoli di Carpi and Drancy were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp. It is estimated that no more than twelve of the people formerly kept at the camp survived to see liberation at the end of the war. Following the deportations of 21 November, the camp was shut down for a short period. =Italian period= The former German camp was taken over by the Cuneo Police Department a few days after its closure. Under German orders, the local authorities continued to arrest Jewish refugees in the area. A total of 26 people were arrested and held at the camp, mostly women. On 13 January 1944, these prisoners were sent to Fossoli di Carpi and were deported from there on 22 February 1944, mostly to Auschwitz. Following this final deportation, the Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp was permanently closed, although Jews continued to be arrested and executed in the area up to the end of the war. Jews captured after the closure were usually held in prison in Turin until deported via Fossoli di Carpi. Six Jews captured in March and April 1945 were executed near Cuneo by soldiers of the Fascist Italian Black Brigades on 25 April 1945, shortly before the town was liberated by partisans. Victims Of the approximately 375 inmates at Borgo, only a small number survived the Holocaust. Most were deported to Auschwitz where they were exterminated. A few were also sent to Buchenwald where they were also killed. The victims were refugees from Poland (119 persons), France, Soviet Union, Germany, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Greece. The Italian nationals held at Borgo were mostly released, although 23 Italians were also deported. The names, ages and nationality of the victims are well documented. There were slightly more male (209) than female (166) inmates. The victims included both the very young and the very old. There were 78 inmates under the age of 21 (with the youngest being less than a year old). There were 76 inmates over the age of 70. It is estimated that only between 12 and 18 of the inmates survived the Holocaust, less than five percent. Aftermath No trace now remains of the former Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp, but two epitaphs were erected to mark the events that took place in Borgo San Dalmazzo. In 2006 a memorial was erected at the Borgo San Dalmazzo railway station to honor the victims of the deportations. The memorial contains the name, age and country of origin of each of the victims as well as those of the few survivors. Freight cars similar to those used in the deportation are preserved nearby.

Early life and background He was born in Barbados into a slave-owning family, the son of Henry Coulthurst, and became joint owner of a plantation in Demerara. One of his brothers was Tempest Coulthurst the physician. His \\"West Indian fortune\\" was later mentioned as one of his characteristics, with \\"learning, character\\" and \\"efficiency in duty\\". Coulthurst was educated in Yorkshire, England at Skipton and Hipperholme. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1771, graduating B.A. in 1775, M.A. in 1778. In mathematics he was second wrangler, behind Samuel Vince. A friend and correspondent was the preacher Bryan Bury Collins, a contemporary at St John's. Academic and cleric Coulthurst was ordained deacon in 1776, and became a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College in 1781. From 1782 to 1790 he was minister at Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge. He graduated B.D. in 1785, D.D. in 1791, and took part in a celebrated Divinity Act (formal theological disputation) with Isaac Milner. As a young Fellow Coulthurst supported the abolitionist cause in Cambridge. He became a friend of William Wilberforce. He is mentioned by Thomas Clarkson as one of those who came forward to help the abolitionist committee in the period from 1788 of agitation against the Atlantic slave trade. After making public his opposition to a 1787 proposal by Thomas Edwards to change Cambridge's religious tests, in 1788 Coulthurst became involved in religious controversy with William Frend, on the orthodox side of the anti-Trinitarian debate. Frend published a leaflet series Mr Coulthurst's blunders exposed. Theophilus Lindsey in December 1788 noted that one of the leaflets was a reply to a sermon by Coulthurst that Frend had attended. The fifth leaflet, dated 18 February 1789, related to the Johannine Comma, and in it Frend cited in support Richard Porson (\\"Cantabrigiensis\\"), from his controversy with George Travis. Lindsey also commented that Coulthurst was \\"one of those that are reckoned Methodists\\" in various Cambridge colleges, which in the language of the time implied an evangelical. Henry Venn, a visitor in 1787, mentioned a Cambridge evangelical group including Coulthurst and Charles Simeon with whom he sat up late talking, five nights in a row, comprising also Charles Farish, and Henry and Joseph Jowett. Vicar of Halifax Coulthurst was appointed vicar of Halifax, Yorkshire in 1790, with the advantage of support from William Pitt the younger. He took John Brathwaite Skeete (born 1775) from Barbados as a pupil, who went on to Sidney Sussex College in 1793. In 1793 Wilberforce arranged for Coulthurst to preach in Somerset, as reported by Hannah More who was then living near Wrington, to Sir Charles Middleton. Describing in 1795 his parish as containing 70,000 people and being as large as Rutland, Coulthurst expressed concern that no magistrate was active there.Clive Emsley, The English Magistracy 1700‚Äì1850, IAHCCJ Bulletin No. 15, Le monde judiciaire / The Judicial World (February 1992), pp. 28‚Äì38 at p. 31. Published by: Librairie Droz. He was appointed a justice of the peace for the West Riding. In 1796 he preached a noted university sermon, backing the measures against subversion taken by the administration of William Pitt, one of a number of evangelicals taking a loyalist line at the time. In a letter of 31 October 1797 he agreed to support the missionary projects of Charles Simeon, a friend. The context was of attacks on Simeon by the \\"Jacobinical\\" Benjamin Flower and Robert Hall. The triennial Halifax music festival was founded in 1796 by Coulthurst, Sir George Armytage, 4th Baronet and Godfrey Wentworth Wentworth as patrons; it continued to 1830.Rachel Cowgill, \\"The Most Musical Spot for Its Size in the Kingdom\\": Music in Georgian Halifax, Early Music Vol. 28, No. 4, Music in Georgian Britain (November 2000), pp. 557‚Äì575, at p. 567. Published by: Oxford University Press. Coulthurst ministered at Halifax Parish Church, and is noted as the first evangelical to do so. The former Holy Trinity Church, Halifax was built for Coulthurst, by an act of Parliament, and completed in 1798. The design was by Thomas Johnson of Leeds. Since 1980 it has been used as offices. That church was built at Coulthurst's own expense, and he also contributed to the upkeep of a number of the chapels in his parish, building one more. At his death there were 14 subordinate chapels in the parish, and in his annual parish tour, Coulthurst preached at all of them. His chaplains preached in them monthly, on a Wednesday. The Church Missionary Society in 1799 nominated Country Members to its committee, and Coulthurst was one of them. In 1807 the Halifax General Dispensary was set up, an initiative of Coulthurst's. Coulthurst was active in 1812 as a magistrate at Halifax, against Luddism. Death Coulthurst died on 11 December 1817, at Heath Hall, near Wakefield, Yorkshire. It was the home of his friend John Smyth (1748‚Äì1811), by then inherited by his son John Henry Smyth, both Members of Parliament. William Willmott, a Halifax curate, preached a memorial sermon in the Parish Church on 21 December. Heath Hall, Wakefield today Works Coulthurst published: *The Citizen and Soldier. The Substance of a Sermon Preached in Halifax Church, on Sunday the Seventeenth of August, 1794, Before the Loyal Corps of Halifax Volunteers (1795) *The Evils of Disobedience and Luxury. a Sermon Preached Before the University of Cambridge, on Tuesday, October 25, 1796 (1796). This sermon in loyalist tone received comment, and was translated into English verse by Alexander Geddes, writing as \\"H. W. Hopkins\\" a \\"Hudibrastic paraphrase\\". *A Sermon, Preached in the Parish Church of Halifax, Before the Volunteer Corps of Infantry: Of the Town and Parish of Halifax, on Sunday, 29 January 1804 (1804) Family In 1793 Coulthurst married Sarah Whitacre, daughter of John Whitacre of Woodhouse, Huddersfield. =Family stake in Holy Trinity Church, Halifax= This church, financed by Coulthurst, was built under agreements that involved his family. Three further nominations were in the hands of family representatives. Coulthurst and his heirs could rent out the pews and galleries, and sell 20% of the land attached as burying ground, at prices regulated by the Archbishop of York. The first incumbent was an evangelical, Samuel Knight (1757‚Äì1827) of Magdalene College, Cambridge, nominated by Coulthurst. He was succeeded in 1817, around the time of Coulthurst's death, by his son James Knight. William Willmott was perpetual curate there from 1818 to 1835. He was succeeded by Frederick Russell, M.A. of St Mary Hall, Oxford, a Caribbean connection being through his wife Ellen Cosens. =Demerara estate= After Henry Coulthurst the elder died in 1792, the bulk of his estate was divided equally between five sons including Henry William (then William Henry). In 1816 Coulthurst's brother Tempest died, leaving him a one-fifth share. H. W. Coulthurst has been identified in as an owner in 1817 of the Grove estate in Demarara. It was not mentioned in Coulthurst's will of 1818. Of the brothers, Conrade (died 1836) was an attorney in London, tenant on Bakers estate in Barbados, and Matthew died in 1833.

The property is owned by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Ottery Mine is a derelict underground tin/arsenic mine located 8 km northeast of Emmaville in far northern New South Wales. It was one of the first underground base metal deposits exploited in the Emmaville district and lies about 2.5 km north of the old mining village of Tent Hill.Toyer and Main 1980: 1-3 The mine was discovered by and named after Alexander Ottery in the late 1870s. It was worked continuously for tin between 1882 and 1905 by the Glen Smelting Company who set up a 15 head stamper battery at near by Tent Hill.Toyer and Main 1980: 3 Extensive mine developments occurred with eight shafts being sunk and 2,500 tonnes of tin concentrate being produced. As the lode became deeper the sulphide content became higher and a smelter was erected on site to calcine the ore. After it was fired the ore was transported to Tent Hill for crushing. After a fatal accident in 1906, operations ceased and did not begin again until 1920 when the mine was acquired by the Sydney based William Cooper and Nephews (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. Their sole purpose was to produce arsenic for sheep and cattle dips and other pesticides. An on site ore processing plant was constructed under the supervision of mine manager A. C. Julius and production of the 99.7% pure arsenic trioxide began in 1921.Godden 1981: 2 The process of arsenic extraction involved feeding the coarse ore into roasting kilns and the fine ore into a mechanical furnace for firing. The resulting arsenic fumes passed into a set of 66 condensation chambers where the gasses were cooled and sublimed onto the interior brickwork as solid crystals of crude arsenic trioxide. The crystals were further refined by being re-fired and the gasses re-sublimed. The concentrated arsenic trioxide was then barrelled and transported to Sydney. From 1925 to 1927 a ten-head stamper battery, grinding pans, concentrating tables, a concrete weir and pump were installed to extract the tin that was also present in the arsenic ores. The plant reworked arsenic tailings as well as some high tin, low arsenic ores.Godden 1981: 3 Operations ceased in late 1929 due to the economic depression and low mineral prices, only to reopen again in 1931. It operated in a limited capacity until 1936 when it was forced to close due to the importation of cheaper arsenic. Burma Malay Tin Ltd. purchased the Ottery and commenced operations in June 1938. The company imported flotation equipment and constructed a freshwater dam for the storage of boiler feed and dressing water.Toyer and Main 1980: 5; Godden 1981: 3 No arsenic production occurred at this time. Prolonged dry weather forced the close of operations in 1940 and the company pulled down the plant buildings and equipment and transferred them to other sites. From 1956-7 the Guardian Trading and Investment Company Pty. Ltd. reconditioned the mill and set up equipment to treat the remains of the old calcine dump. Further minor attempts were made to mine and treat the dumps but no further major mining operations were established. In 1993 Ottery was rehabilitated in a joint project by the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the Department of Mineral Resources. This included: reducing the pollution of contaminated water/sediments in the area; improving fencing around the structures, many of which were unstable; fencing and covering open shafts and erecting walkways and viewing platforms.  Description  The total site covers some 20 hectares, although the PCO curtilage is confined to the area immediately surrounding the main buildings and works. The Ottery mine workings lie on the side of a steep hill at the head of a narrow gully. All drainage from the gully flows into a small, unnamed ephemeral creek. Numerous derelict structures, open mine workings, eroding slimes dams, spoil heaps and pieces of machinery are scattered across the site. These include the primary kilns, the secondary kilns, the rotary kiln, refinery, cooperage and two twin banks of condensers leading up the hill to a common flue and chimney. The chimney stack still in excellent condition, dominates the crest of the hill. The burnt-out timber framework and concrete foundations of the tin processing plant can still be seen below the main shaft. Many bricks have been removed from every structure on the site except the chimney. The kilns are also relatively complete. The main shaft, which is open, has been built up with an extensive timber retaining wall and a large mullock dump on the down hill side. The mine workings extend up the gully to the southwest of the main shaft and numerous adits, small shafts, holes and collapsed stones are scattered throughout the bush. Several large circular open cuts, thought to be relics from the earliest tin producing days, occur towards the top of the hill. Two freshwater storage dams occur to the northeast and southwest of the mine workings.Toyer and Main 1981: 11 Two large waste dumps block the drainage line below the arsenic chambers. A five-head stamper and engine stands nearby. Much of the area is covered with scrubby regrowth.Toyer and Main 1980: 13 The gradient of the site falls steeply from south to north.Steding, 2003:3 Most of the structures on the site are in ruins although stabilisation works have recently been undertaken. The archaeological potential of the site has been assessed as high. = Modifications and dates = * 1882 - smelter constructed * 1920-22 - arsenic extraction plant constructed * 1927 - tin extraction plant constructed, including a ten-head battery, dam and concentrating tables * 1939 - flotation tanks and freshwater dam constructed * 1940 - much equipment removed and structures dismantled * 1993 - Ottery was rehabilitated in a joint project by the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the Department of Mineral Resources * 2003 - Additional rehabilitation works due to continuing safety hazards and pollution problems on the site (signage, fencing, erosion and drainage control)  Heritage listing  The Ottery Mine is the only arsenic refinery plant remaining in any condition in New South Wales. It is the oldest principal ore refinery in Australia. It was one of the first underground mines in the Emmaville area and largely responsible for the economic and social development of the town. The design of the Ottery arsenic plant is unique in Australia. It is the most complete and complex of the arsenic refinery sites. It is an excellent example of a traditional method of industrial processing. The site has a unique potential to provide information about the mining and extraction of arsenic, for students of geology, archaeology and industrial process. No detailed plans of the site or individual structures are known to exist. The site can therefore provide information not available from any other source.Godden 1981: 7-9 Ottery Mine was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Ottery Mine is the only arsenic refinery plant remaining in any condition in New South Wales. It is the oldest principal ore refinery in Australia. Ore from the site was smelted at Australia's first tin smelter. It was one of the first underground mines in the Emmaville area and largely responsible for the economic and social development of the town. The tin dressing plant represents the fluctuating fortunes of the tin mining industry. The Ottery also has historical links to the wool industry, as arsenic was the principal ingredient in sheep dip.Godden 1981: 7-8 With production commencing in 1882, the Ottery Mine is one of the oldest underground mines in the Emmaville District. Emmaville, Torrington and neighbouring towns developed from the mining industry. As such, the Ottery mine is an integral part of the history of the area. It represents the fluctuating fortunes of those who mined the Ottery tin lodes in the late nineteenth century and those who produced arsenic in the early twentieth century. Both tin and arsenic were extracted after 1927.Steding 2003: 20 The Ottery arsenic refinery is the oldest principal ore refinery in Australia. Arsenic mining ceased in Australia in 1952 and in New South Wales in 1936, as the Ottery Mine ended production. As Godden suggests, it is unlikely that the mining of this resource will take place again, since the Bolidan copper mine in Sweden produces enough arsenic as a by-product to satisfy world demand. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Ottery Mine is associated with Tent Hill, location of the first tin mine in Australia. The tin ore was concentrated initially and later smelted, at Tent Hill, the site of Australia's first tin smelter. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site is an integral part of the Emmaville mining landscape.Godden 1981: 6 Substantial structural remains from the arsenic treatment plant and the intricately constructed brick checker-work condensation chambers, afford this site aesthetic and architectural significance. The Ottery arsenic treatment plant is particularly unique in Australia for its design, thought to be Portuguese.Steding 2003: 20-1 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Emmaville owes its existence to the discovery of alluvial and lode tin. Ottery, as one of the first and largest underground mining operations in the area, holds an important place for the local community in the history of their economic and social development. The Ottery Mine is an integral part of Australia's mining history in the northern NSW region. It was once a major place of employment for many people, the descendants of whom still live in neighbouring towns. The Ottery Mine is also important to local organisations as a tourist site. Such groups include the Glen Innes Historical Society, the Gem and Mineral Club and Emmaville Tourism & Progress Association. While its relative isolation may limit the number of visitors, the site is actively promoted through literature, signage and community support.Steding 2003: 21 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

As Godden suggests, it is unlikely that the mining of this resource will take place again, since the Bolidan copper mine in Sweden produces enough arsenic as a by-product to satisfy world demand. The Ottery Mine is one of only four arsenic mines in Australia. These are the Ottery and Mole River mines in New South Wales and two mines in Queensland. Only the Ottery and Mole River mines were equipped with on-site refining plants capable of producing the final product. The arsenic refinery is the best preserved of the sublimation type arsenic refineries. It is believed to be one of the last arsenic refinery relics of this type anywhere in the world. As such, it has international as well as national significance.

It was designed by NSW Government Architect's Office under Walter Liberty Vernon. and built from 1895 to 1896 by Sandbrook Brothers. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  In 1828 the first post offices outside Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opening as settlement spread. The advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW from the 1860s. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period were designed in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The 1890s witnessed a building boom in the town of Glen Innes with many of the grand public and commercial buildings along the main street being erected. In 1896 a new post office was constructed on the site of the former office which had been demolished to make way for it. The building was designed by the Office of the Colonial Architect under the direction of Walter Liberty Vernon, with the building tender being awarded to the Sandbrook Brothers for ¬£2505. The office was opened for business on 7 December 1896. A gable-ended addition to the east fronting Meade Street was constructed between 1913-14. Major sympathetic additions to the east also appear to have occurred during a s.  Description  Glen Innes Post Office is a two-storey building designed in the Federation Arts and Crafts Style, constructed of predominantly tan- coloured face brickwork, rubbed red brick banding and sandstone detailing. The exterior of the building appears largely intact to its original construction. The original two-storey section of the building, built in 1895, is constructed in English bond brickwork on a sandstone ashlar block base course, with later single-storey sections to the rear being of stretcher bond brickwork. The building has a complex, predominantly hipped slate roof with decorative terracotta ridge-capping, bracketed eaves and boarded soffits. There is a bracketed gable end to the southern facade with a later-phase addition. The roof is punctuated by five corbelled face brick chimneys, four to the two- storey section and one over the existing kitchen to the rear. Large arches dominate the main building facade with rubbed red-brick trim at the ground- floor level. There are two arched entries complemented by small, multi-pane arched windows with sandstone sills set into brickwork arches. The main entry, with a later tiled porch and steps, later doors and board and batten soffit, is located on the corner, the residential entry and porch, with bullnose slate steps, earlier hexagonal pavers and corrugated iron soffit, is at the centre of the western facade. Glen Innes Post Office and residence was reported to generally in very good condition as at 22 June 2000. There is some archaeological potential to the remaining open areas of the site, including the residence yard and rear concrete yard for evidence of former structures and uses. The Glen Innes Post Office appears largely intact structurally, and retains the features which make it culturally significant including architectural features such as the large round arches, hipped slate roof, arcaded porches at street level, along with the prominence of the building in the streetscape and its overall form, scale and style.  Heritage listing  Glen Innes Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, strong aesthetic qualities and social value. Glen Innes Post and Telegraph Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Glen Innes Post Office is historically significant because it is associated with the development of communications services in the New England district during the second half of the nineteenth century. Through its links with the earlier post offices in the town, the current post office is also associated with the historical evolution of Glen Innes. The scale, form and architectural style of Glen Innes reflect the building boom in the mid-1890s in the main street of Glen Innes. Glen Innes Post Office also provides evidence of the changing nature of postal and telecommunications practices in NSW. Glen Innes Post Office is historically significant because it is associated with the NSW Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, and it is part of an important group of works by Vernon, a key practitioner of the Federation Arts and Crafts Style. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Glen Innes Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a particularly fine example of the Federation Arts and Crafts Style, designed by Vernon, with strong visual appeal. It has such distinctive characteristics as the prominent roof forms, large arched openings and the arcaded porches. The architectural style and prominent location of the post office also make it a focal point of the Glen Innes civic precinct, endowing it with landmark qualities. The and 1980 additions have been carried out appropriately and are sympathetic to the aesthetic values of the original building. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a prominent civic building, Glen Innes Post Office is considered to be significant to the community of Glen Innes' sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The bridge was designed by John Whitton in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built in 1886. It is also known as Beardy River Railway Viaduct. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  When John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for Railways 1856-1890, extended the Main North Railway from Muswellbrook to Glen Innes between 1870-1884 it climbed through the highest parts of the Great Dividing Range into the New England Region. Gradients were steep, curves were sharp, there was heavy earthworks and some major iron lattice bridges. It was expensive railway construction. When the section from Glen Innes to Tenterfield was planned, economies were made, particularly with bridges. They had to be timber, mostly ballast top timber beam bridges but at three locations larger bridges were required, over Beardy Waters, and the Severn River and Bluff River. Whitton, a successful railway engineer from England, chose the design of one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's timber bridge viaducts built in Cornwall during the 1850s. The model chosen was the St Germans Viaduct composed of composite deck Queen post trusses, with the bottom chords being large iron rods. Whitton's staff redesigned the trusses to be all timber and the viaducts were built during construction of the Glen Innes to Tenterfield section 1884-86. The final section to Wallangarra (1888) was mostly easier over plateau country but the crossing of Tenterfield Creek required a large bridge and a timber Queen post truss viaduct was built there also, the fourth between Glen Innes and the Queensland border. Only two other such timber viaducts were built in this period, the Ingalara Creek railway bridge and the Bredbo River railway bridge on the Bombala railway line.  Description  The bridge is a nine-span timber truss viaduct. Each span is , centre-to-centre, of timber trestles. The trusses are deck Queen post copied from one of Brunel's Cornish timber bridges (St Germans), built about 30 years earlier. The condition was assessed as fair as at 5 April 2006, having declined due to lack of maintenance since rail services were suspended. As with the other four viaducts on this section of line, it retains its original fabric.  Heritage listing  Yarraford rail bridge over Beardy River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Glen Innes to Wallangarra Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s was ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Despite a degree of inaccessibility, the timber viaducts over the Beardy, Severn and Bluff Rivers are impressive structures within their rural landscapes. At Tenterfield, the adjacent New England Highway provides easy viewing of the 4th such viaduct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Main North Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the New England Region from the time of its construction 1882-88, and the four timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The viaducts were technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. These four viaducts and the two on the Cooma Line are the only ones of their type built. They are a unique class of railway bridge.

The club's colours are yellow and blue and play in the Central Highlands Football League.  History  The Learmonth FC was founded at the turn of the 19th century and began its first years of existence by playing social matches against the neighbouring towns of Burrumbeet, Coghill's Creek and Waubra. These games extended further out to Lexton and Ballarat even before the foundation of the Learmonth & District Football Association in 1912 with Burrumbeet and Coghill's Creek winning the first premierships. Football in the LDFA was suspended from 1914 to 1918 due to World War I but the sport resumed in 1919 and the Lakies won their first flag the following year in 1920. They won two more flags during the 1920s, being the runner up five times and winning four senior flags during the 1930s. After the 1933 season, the LDFA disbanded and the Lakies played in the Burrumbeet & District Football Association for six years before making another move to the Clunes Football League after the war. Upon joining the Clunes league, Learmonth's existing red and blue colours clashed with the Hepburn Football Club who were another new entrant and joined the league at an earlier date. Learmonth decided to change the strip to a royal blue background with a gold sash and changed again to a gold V in the late 1960s. Learmonth FC won their first Clunes FL premiership in 1952 and they won again in 1955. But the 1960s and 1970s saw a major downfall in performance, despite managing to make the Finals in 1977 finishing fifth and making the Grand Final and losing to new club Wendouree by 3 points. The Lakies made another Grand Final in 1994 and coming from a lower spot from the final four but lost to the undefeated Dunnstown Football Club. In 1979, the Clunes Football League and the Ballarat Bacchus Marsh Football League amalgamated to form the current Central Highlands Football League where Learmonth is currently playing. Beaufort and Daylesford joined the CHFL in 1994 and 2006 and Rokewood-Corindhap, Skipton, Carngham-Linton and Illabarook (now Smythesdale) joined in 2011 from the former Lexton Plains Football League. The Learmonth Lakies FC still are a founding member of the CHFL and the club still continues to field junior and senior football and netball teams.

It was designed by various architects, including Thompson and Holmes, J. P. O'Connor, Rowland Bros and Madigan and Cusick. It was built from 1873 by various builders, including A. W. Lane, G. Cooper and H. A. Tutt and Son. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 September 2015.  History  =Indigenous and early colonial use= Pre European settlement, the area around Glen Innes was the traditional land of the Ngarabal people, whose totem was the koala. Their land extended to include current towns of Glencoe, Kingsplains, Wellingrove, Strathbogie, Bolivia and Beardy Plains. Due to the severity of the winters in the area and the consequent reduction in food resources, the people migrated away from the high tableland area during the coldest months to the warmer regions along tributaries to the Clarence River in the south and east and the Mole district in the west. The population again swelled during the summer months as the Ngarabal returned to feast on wallaby, bandicoots, possum, lizards, birds and many other creatures. Wild berries including the local wild raspberry, peach heath, wattle, roots of the bracken fern, native yam and native asparagus, were among other plants that augmented their diet and provided medicinal treatment. Those too old or to weak to undertake the migration stayed on the high tablelands and protected themselves from the cold by wearing Possum or Kangaroo skin cloaks and tending large camp fires established close to their bark huts. While tribal boundaries were clearly drawn and incursion of these often provoked fierce battles, there was also movement of neighbouring Clarence River/Macleay River Aboriginal tribes and those of the western districts up to theNgarabal tribal lands near Glen Innes for corroborees, to trade goods information and also for marriage and initiation purposes. Goods traded included ochre, sourced near Dundee in the Glen Innes area and stone from creeks in tribal lands to the south.Glen Innes Severn Council, 2010. Glen Innes Severn Aboriginal Heritage Study In 1818, during his journey from Bathurst to the Macquarie Marshes, thence to the Liverpool Plains and Port Macquarie, John Oxley first reported sighting Aboriginal people in the New England area. While Oxley met with some Aboriginal men, women and children were kept hidden. Similarly in 1827 while making his journey of exploration through to the Darling Downs region, Richard Cunningham noted signs of indigenous habitation but rarely saw or met with Aboriginal people. After coming upon cattle and a European hut Cunningham surmised that Aboriginal people may have had a bad experience of some white men and chose to avoid them. Avoiding White settlers became increasingly difficult for the Aboriginal people of the area after 1830. At this time the Australian Agricultural Company took up vast estates north of the Hunter Valley on the Liverpool Plains. With the large agricultural company in possession of this land, new squatters were forced to seek seeking new lands further north, including in the New England area. In 1838 Thomas Hewitt took up Stonehenge located south of present Glen Innes, for Archibald Boyd. In 1839 a New England Pastoral district was formed with Commissioner MacDonald based at Armidale. The early years of settlement in the Glen Innes area was marked by mixed relations between Aboriginal people and the new colonists. Inevitably, as the Aboriginal people were increasingly locked out of their traditional hunting grounds, there were many incidents of conflict between Aboriginals and whites farmers. Aboriginal people on occasion took stock as compensation for the decimation of their traditional food resources. On other occasions they would attempt to drive stock off their traditional lands and in some cases European shepherds were killed. Settlers in return chased Aboriginal people from their farms and in a number of cases between 1839 and 1842 killed Aboriginal people en masse. This happened on the Beardy Plains, at Deepwater Station and at Bluff Rock in the vicinity of Glen Innes. In the 1840s towns were established along the Tablelands and initially a government town was established at Wellingrove. Unlike the village of Glen Innes, Wellingrove did not thrive and in January 1858 the Court of Petty Sessions was moved to Glen Innes. Other businesses then followed. It was in December 1851 that Surveyor J. J. Galloway surveyed a town sites at Glen Innes and Stonehenge. In the early 1870s, Glen Innes developed rapidly following the discovery of tin in the district. New stores and hotels were constructed in the town and a number of social and professional organisations were established in Glen Innes including the Pastoral and Agricultural Association which was initially established in conjunction with Inverell. =Showground= Pastoralism was an essential element in the development of the local, regional and national economies. Livestock production influenced the development of pastoral stations and modified the landscape in Glen Innes as elsewhere in NSW and Australia. The successful development of pastoralism in the area led the establishment of the Inverell-Glen Innes Pastoral and Agricultural Association which worked hard to establish a local Show where stock could be displayed and judged. The first show to be held in the Glen Innes district was in 1869 at Inverell and the 1870 show was held at Glen Innes, near the Glen Innes Primary School. The first show to be held on the current showground site was in 1874. This date indicates that Glen Innes was one of the earliest shows to be established and continuously operating on its site outside metropolitan Sydney. Other early regional showgrounds in continuous use are Maitland which held its first show at its current site in 1873, Singleton, which held its first show on its current site in 1868, Bathurst, which held the first show on site in 1878, and Armidale show began on its current site in 1877. The joint Inverell-Glen Innes Pastoral and Agricultural Association remained operational until 1876 when, after a less successful show which went into debt to the tune of 144 pounds, Glen Innes members decided to establish an independent Association. The Government of New South Wales formally gazetted the present showground site in 1877. This site became an important part of the Town Plan. The first president of the Glen Innes Pastoral and Agricultural was William Alexander Dumaresq, the son of the well-known, and at times notorious colonial figure and brother-in-law to Governor Darling, Captain William John Dumaresq. William John Dumaresq was made provisional civil engineer and inspector of roads and bridges by Governor Darling and at one stage was acting colonial Treasurer. He and his brother Henry amassed large, profitable land holdings in both the Hunter and the New England tablelands, Saumarez and Tilbuster being those in the New England. His son William Alexander Dumaresq served as an Australian Army Officer in India, married the sister-in-law of Governor Somerset Lowry-Corry, 4th Earl Belmore and was a wealthy grazier in the Glen Innes district. Another important association for the Glen Innes Pastoral and Agricultural Association was with W. T. Cadell and Deepwater Station. Deepwater Station was initially taken up by noted landowner and pastoralist Archibald Windeyer junior in 1839 and rapidly developed into a prosperous station which made a large contribution to NSW fine merino wool exports. On his demise in 1870 the station was purchased by a family company representing the union of several NSW and Queensland pastoral dynasties, the Windmyers, the Macansh family and W. T. Cadell who had married into the Macansh family. It was Cadell who was the hands-on sheep and cattle breeder and he successfully improved the Deepwater herd and flock to such an extent that Deepwater wool was regarded as the finest in the NSW market and regularly fetched top price. Cadell became official patron and sponsor of the Glen Innes Show in 1903. In this role he worked tirelessly to \\"advance the Glen Innes Pastoral and Agricultural Society to a leading place in NSW\\".Deepwater Wool Festival - a history of Deepwater The first buildings to be built at Glen Innes Showground were a Grandstand and an Exhibition Hall for the 1874 Show. As the annual show continued to grow in terms of both attendance and exhibition these initial buildings were extended and stock yards built. A mark of the popular success of the show was the organisation of excursion trains from Tamworth and Tenterfield to ferry eager show goers to the Glen Innes Show. In 1888 a grand new entrance to the showgrounds was opened on Torrington Street. Main exhibition pavilion Main Exhibition Pavilion interior By 1892 the original Exhibition Hall had seen its best years and was replaced by the existing, attractive Victorian free classical style Main Exhibition Pavilion. Similarly in 1896 the original grandstand was removed and replaced by the Federation Carpenter style grandstand which eventually opened for use in 1899 and is still in situ. The timber from the original grandstand was used to construct the caretakers cottage. In 1897, to celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee, a program of tree planting began and the grounds were lit for the first time. The tree planting program was continued over the years, funded by financial and in-kind donations and by the takings of the annual show. The planting program has resulted in the well maintained park-like showground. As a marker of the progress of the show and of its reputation through NSW, by the end of the 19th century is the fact that on several occasions the annual Glen Innes Show was opened or attended by various dignitaries. Show openings were officiated by Premier of New South Wales Sir George Dibbs in 1893; the Governor of NSW, Admiral Sir Harry Rawson in 1903; the NSW Premier, Joseph Carruthers in 1904; and NSW Premier Charles Wade in 1909. The prestige of the show and its success reached its zenith in 1922 when it was widely recognised as the leading annual show in NSW with buildings and exhibition facilities rivalling those at other showgrounds through NSW. During the middle decades of the 20th century it became something of a \\"tradition\\" for dignitaries to open the Glen Innes show with NSW Premier, Bertram Stevens opening the 1934 Show; Earle Page opening the 1939 Glen Innes Show and veteran politician Hubert Lawrence Anthony opened the 1941 Show. Cattle pavilion Stables The early years of the 20th century also saw a spate of building projects with Rowland Bros architects designing an additional pavilion for the showground in 1905, extensive stables buildings in 1906 and J. F. O'Connor, architect, preparing plans and supervising construction of the cattle pavilion between 1909 and 1910. New entrance gates were erected in 1911. In 1922 a major addition to the Main Exhibition Pavilion was designed by architect F. J. Madigan, a widely noted architect and mentor for his son, Colin Madigan. In that same year the sheep pavilion was completed and a new piggery and a new refreshment room was constructed. The new buildings at the showground used designs sympathetic to the buildings already established on the grounds. This dedication to creating a cohesive suite of architect-designed buildings has extended to the design and construction of buildings at Glen Innes Showground through the history of the showgrounds. Late in 1922, after officially opening the show seated in his car as he could not stand, W. T. Cadell died. His dedication to the establishing the best show in NSW was memorialised in the erection of the Cadell Memorial sheep rotunda which was opened in 1927 by Michael Bruxner MLA. During the 1930s the showgrounds were extended with the purchase of two extra acres of land. The Caged Bird Pavilion was erected and a public address system installed. Further developments were cut short by the onset of World War II during which the showground was occupied by the Army. While the 1941 show went ahead, by 1942 the grounds were in Army control and there was no show. The next show to be held was in 1946. In preparation 1944 and 1945 were spent restoring the grounds and facilities after the military use. Entry gates The 1950s saw a further 2 acre purchase of land to enlarge the showgrounds and also the installation of a Ringside Broadcast Box, horse and cattle stalls and further plantings. By this time the suite of buildings that now characterises the Glen Innes Showground were in place. The exception was the 1991 bar and barbeque, designed to complement the neighbouring grandstand, and the new entrance gates on Bourke Street. The 1960s and 1970s saw the continued care and interest in tree planting in the grounds, the establishment of the Industrial pavilion in 1974 and then in the 2000s the Men's Shed was erected near the Torrington St entrance. The changing nature of pastoralism and related agricultural activities in the Glen Innes area was reflected at the annual show. Initially sheep, beef cattle and horses were paraded and judged. As small farming developed maize, wheat and other cash crops were exhibited as well as dairy herds, pig farms and poultry farms. In time related secondary industries were developed in the town and appeared at the show. Wheat growing led to the development of Flour Mills in Glen Innes; dairy herds led to the development of butter and cheese factories; horses led to the development of blacksmiths, coach companies and coach manufacturing businesses. The development of these industries explains the construction of the Hall of Industries in 1922 and the Industrial Pavilion in 1974. Such an evolution of activities was repeated all over NSW in the context of the local agricultural endeavours. Unfortunately, unlike the Glen Innes showground which has retained the full suite of show buildings, many other NSW showgrounds have not retained the built evidence of this evolution. The showground at Glen Innes is one of the few showgrounds with intact buildings and facilities reflecting its regional agricultural and industrial development.  Description  Park-like setting In 2006 the buildings and facilities included a grandstand; old timber pavilion; Trade pavilion; Yarraford Hall; stud cattle pavilions; bar and barbecue facilities; 167 horse stalls; tea room seating 100; a new pavilion for basketball; four stand shearing complex; prime cattle yards; caged birds pavilion; show secretary's office; showring and camping ground, park-like landscaped grounds. ;Main Exhibition Pavilion The Main Exhibition pavilion was built in 1892. The one storey Main Exhiobition Pavilions timber pavilions are clad framed, four joined sections with domed tower, round headed windows, iron roof gabled and domed, timber walls with rear and side walls constructed of corrugated iron; quoins timber routed; timber footings; iron columns; ceiling King post trussed, walls horizontal; tongued and grooved timber, timber floors; windows one and four paned; doors tongued and grooved panels; fanlight; gas lamp side door: domed porch front entrance. ;Grandstand The main timber grandstand was completed and opened at the 1899 Armidale-Glen Innes Combined District Show. Built of hardwood and covered with corrugated iron, the main building had a ground surface of 58 by 30 feet; a height of 24 feet from plate to plate, giving a roof projection of five feet, with an ornamental front gable. The stand provided seating for 350 people. Designed by Sydney architects, Thompson and Holmes, the work was supervised by Glen Innes builder A. W. Lane.Glen Innes Examiner, 3 March 1899 ;Industrial Pavilion A new building, the Industrial Pavilion 84 feet long and 35 feet wide, was erected on the northern side alongside the older pavilion and opened in March 1922. The wall between the pavilions was removed to provide additional space. Tallowood was used for the floor to also enable it to be used as a dance floor. The pavilion was designed by F. J. Madigan, of the Glen Innes firm Madigan and Cusick, and constructed by G. Cooper. Its primary purpose was to provide facilities for trade displays on a generous scale.Glen Innes Examiner, 9 March 1922 ;View to refreshment rooms and show society officeRefreshment room and piggery Other improvements in 1921 included the construction of a refreshment room and a new piggery with fourteen stalls. ;Sheep pavilion and rotundaCadell Memorial Rotunda The ornate Cadell Memorial sheep-judging stand (1928) is of octagonal shape with a 27 feet measurement between the most distant corners. The stand is erected of hardwood posts built into a concrete foundation. It is a timber structure with terra cotta tiled roof. The design makes maximum use of light with a domed ceiling, lantern roof and glass louvres converging to a central flag-staff. The contractors were H. A. Tutt and Son of Glen Innes. ;Landscape setting The show buildings and central arena are set in a 7-acre planned and maintained park-like setting. Plantings include a large number of trees, eucalypts, elms and pines planted in 1897 in preparation for Queen Victoria's Jubilee celebrations. A large number of trees were donated by the Department for Mines and Agriculture for planting at the showground in 1898. These early plantings formed the skeleton of the landscape grounds with were maintained and added to over the years. In 1910 a local man, George Black donated 20 pine trees which were planted along the George Street boundary of the ground and can be clearly seen in early showground photographs. By 1950s the grounds were well developed and while a plantation of elms was established behind the sheep pavilion, a nest of blackberry bushes was eradicated in the north eastern corner of the grounds and the pine trees growing to the west of the Main Exhibition pavilion were cut down. In 1958 a big tree planting program was carried out and blackberries were once again becoming a problem to be dealt with. By 1962 they were no longer a problem and the fence line at the north east corner of the grounds was extended out to enclose the area where the blackberries had been. In 1964 and 1966 another planting program provided a large number of ring side trees. By 1969 it was reported that there were 250 trees were growing in the showground in addition to a number of yellow box and white gum. In 1974 the George Street pine trees were cut down and then in 1977 more pine trees were removed from behind the fat cattle pavilion . In this year the arena was regrassed with kiluyu grass donated and maintained by the local high school. In 1897 several old white gums were removed. Today the showground landscaping is characterised by copses of elms, eucalypts, including yellow box and white gum and other trees. Elms shade the Main Exhibition Pavilion and ring the arena. = Condition and integrity = As at December 2014, a number of the structures had been assessed as needing urgent conservation work, including the pavilions and the Cadell Memorial sheep judging stand. These structures have archaeological value as they provide an insight into early bushcraft skills as well as the skills of note country architects. Glen Innes showground has a high degree of intactness. = Modifications and dates = The original grandstand was removed in 1896 and the timber used in constructing a caretaker's residence. Additions were made to the present grandstand in 1907. A picket fence was once installed in front of the grandstand but is now removed. A Hall of Industries was completed on the northern side of the 1890s pavilion in 1922. The Tea Room Drill Hall was demolished in the 1950s. Remodelling of the main entrances took place in 1988. Columns and whole entry complex was remodelled in 1990 following damage to the overhead sign and pillars by heavy and high trucks.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Glen Innes Showground is of state heritage significance as one of the earliest regional shows to be established in NSW. The showground has been used continuously for 140 years for the annual Glen Innes Show. For many years in the late 19th and early 20th century, the Glen Innes Show and Showground was widely regarded as one of the leading shows in NSW due to both attendance, the quality and number of exhibits and also the quality of exhibition, stock handling and spectator facilities provided. Its state heritage significance is enhanced through its association with the Dumaresq family, noted colonial politicians and pastoral holders. It is also associated with W. T. Cadell, a noted pastoralist who further developed the early pastoral station, Deepwater Station which was important to the fine wool export industry in the colony of NSW. It is of aesthetic heritage significance at a state level as an outstanding picturesque and stylistically cohesive and complementary suite of Federation style buildings sited in a park-like setting. The group of buildings is one of NSW's most comprehensive array of show buildings sited on a single showground and arranged in an aesthetically pleasing and distinctive way around the central arena making it a landmark in the town. The Glen Innes Showground is likely to have research values at a state level for its potential to demonstrate the full variety of exhibit, spectator and stock handling facilities required by a successful agricultural show It is rare in NSW as one of the few remaining showgrounds in the state retaining a full suite of architect-designed, Federation style show buildings clustered around its central arena and demonstrating the breadth of activities undertaken by the Show and the development of the show over 140 years. The Glen Innes Showgrounds is of state heritage significance as a fine example of a regional showground retaining its full suite of buildings. Its intactness and aesthetic qualities make this showground illustrative of an \\"ideal\\" regional showground. Glen Innes Showground was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 September 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Glen Innes Showground is of state heritage significance as one of the earliest regional shows and showgrounds to be established in NSW. The first Glen Innes Show was held in 1869 and the first show held at the current showground was in 1874. The showground has been in continual use for the annual show since that time. The first agricultural shows were established in metropolitan Sydney. The first regional show held was at Maitland in 1844 with its current showground being opened in the early 1880s. Singleton Showground was first held in 1865 and the first show at its current site was held in 1868. Bathurst show began in 1863, moving to its permanent site in 1878 and Armidale show commenced on its current site in 1877. The showground is also historically significant as one of the most successful in NSW late nineteenth and early twentieth century both in terms of attendance and entry takings and also the number and quality of exhibits. Its historical significance also lies in the ability of its intact collection of buildings to demonstrate th evolution of agricultural and industrial activities in rural NSW and also by the fact that it has retained its original use as a showground since its establishment over 140 year ago. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The state heritage significance of the Glen Innes Show and Showground may be enhanced through its association with the Dumaresq family. The first president of the show was William Alexander Dumaresq, son of the well-known and at times notorious colonial figure William John Dumaresq who along with this brother amassed large and profitable landholdings in NSW including Saumarez and Tilbuster in the New England region. William John was a wealthy property owner in the area and married the sister in law of NSW Governor Belmore. The Show and Showground also have a close and significant association with Deepwater Station and its owner WT Cadell who developed the station and its flock of merinos to the extent that it became one of the leading sheep station in NSW. Deepwater Station make an enormous contribution to the fine wool export industry in NSW. W. T. Cadell was financial and social patron of the Glen Innes Show from 1903 until his death in 1922. His work with the show led to it being recognised as one of the most successful shows in NSW in both levels of attendance and entry takings and also in the number and quality of exhibits at the annual show. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Glen Innes Showground is of state heritage significance as an outstanding, picturesque and stylistically cohesive and complementary suite of showground buildings sited in a park like landscape setting. Most of the buildings date from the 1890s and 1920s and are all architect-designed by Sydney-based or local and regional architects. The group of Federation style timber buildings display classical decorative elements. The collection also includes vernacular elements such as post and beam shed, post and rail gates and fences, stables and yards. The group of buildings at Glen Innes showground are one of the most comprehensive array of show buildings gathered at one showground in NSW and are arranged in an aesthetically pleasing and distinctive way around the central arena. The iconic aesthetic qualities of the built and landscape elements of the showground make it a landmark feature of the town, more so than many other showgrounds in NSW. Its distinctive landmark aesthetic qualities have been recognised and used in promotional material produced by the Department of Lands which highlight the values of Crown Reserves across the state. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Glen Innes Showground with its comprehensive collection of pavilions, grandstand, sheep and cattle pavilions and stock holding yards, stables and other ancillary structures holds research potential as one of the most intact and diverse group of showground buildings in the state. The buildings have important technical and research potential because of their age, architectural and construction merit. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Glen Innes Showground is likely to be of state heritage significance as a rare example of a showground with a full complement of showground buildings demonstrating the breadth of activities associated with a regional show and the development of the show as the agricultural economy of the region developed. The collection of buildings in their landscape setting is also rare as they are still intact and unaltered. Many other NSW showgrounds have retained their grandstands and in some cases, other pavilions but many of the historic pavilions are either demolished or in a state of dilapidation. Along with Singleton, Maitland, and Bathurst, Glen Innes retains a diverse collection of buildings and has strived to ensure new buildings are largely sympathetic with the historic buildings. Glen Innes is a rare example of an aesthetically cohesive group of showground buildings in a carefully planned and maintained landscape setting. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Glen Innes Showgrounds is likely to be of state heritage significance as fine representative example of a regional showground retaining the diversity of its exhibition, hospitality and spectator facilities in its landscaped setting. Its intactness and aesthetic qualities including the stylistic cohesion of the buildings and its layout clustered around the central arena make this showground illustrative of an \\"ideal\\" regional showground in NSW.

The website places an emphasis upon Web 2.0 technologies to teach an interactive learning style which is designed to replicate the use of a personal tutor as to \\"address the balance between teacher-led instruction and independent, student-driven learning\\". Mathletics operates through a subscription-based system, offering access at an individual level as well as collectively as a school. Online users, acknowledged by the website as 'Mathletes', have access to math quizzes and challenges, and can participate in a real-time networked competition known as 'Live Mathletics'.Nansen, Bjorn & Chakraborty, Kabita & Gibbs, Lisa & Vetere, Frank & MacDougall, Colin. (2012). ‚ÄòYou do the math‚Äô: Mathletics and the play of online learning. New Media & Society. 14. 1216-1235. 10.1177/1461444812442926. Mathletics provides a customisable avatar for each individual user, which visually represents the player in the 'Live Mathletics' competitions. Alongside these learning interfaces, Mathletics grants individual users with the capacity to customise their avatar's clothing and general aesthetics are fuelled by credits awarded to the user through the completion of quizzes and tasks. As of 2018, Mathletics caters to 4.1 million users worldwide and 17,000 schools.  History  Mathletics was established as a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) application in 2005 by 3P Learning, catering for Australian schools. The website is structured to facilitate an engagement with students from K-12 educational level, and offers various visual resources in their interactive and online Web 2.0 appropriation of the Australian Curriculum. Though initially based around this curriculum, Mathletics broadened its offices as well as its student and teacher audiences to various other countries residing in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, adapting to those regions' various school curricula. The US and Canadian version of the website aligns with state-based educational standards including the Common Core and Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) from high school into kindergarten. The UK version of the website follows the various National Curricula within Britain, comprising Foundation Stage to Key Stage 5. Both the Middle Eastern and Asian versions of the website adopt and reflect International Curricula, and offer an entire translation of the English course. Mathletics is one of numerous projects created by 3P Learning, and is a sister website to Spelladrome, Reading Eggs and IntoScience.  Content  = Web 2.0 Interface = Mathletics draws from the Web 2.0 technologies to foster their website as an \\"interactive e-learning resource, for schools, parents and children\\". Mathletics accredits the interactive aesthetic and function of their website to Web 2.0 format, which is typically characterised by its fluid accessibility to user-content creation and editing without prior knowledge of HTML programming language. With this, Mathletics takes from the features of Web 2.0 and implements them into their interface to assure that the website content can remain dynamic and regularly updated, and provides users with the option to edit and personalise their online profiles within the site without programming skills, as well as facilitate online competitions with other profiles.  Primary Students  Mathletics functions via an emphasis upon the bilateral capabilities of Web 2.0, which concerns interface and user interactivity. Mathletics heavily anchors their teaching styles within the \\"Primary\\" section of their website through the lens of 'visual learning'; employing a vast array of colours combined with cartoon imagery to create a \\"captivating\\" website aesthetic in an effort to appease the juvenile temperament of students under twelve years old. The site offers animated tutorials and learning support that display animated adolescent characters offering mathematic tips and answers to questions. The website currently offers 1200 unique questions, that have been individually tailored to suit each user's mathematic comprehension. Students are encouraged to participate in Mathematic activities which host up to 20 questions related to a certain topic. Once a student answers a question, the website recognises its completion and then adapts to the \\"student's progress in understanding\\", leading to questions that may be more complex in difficulty. At the completion of each topic, students are offered the opportunity to take a 'Topic Test' which summates the hardest questions in the past activities. A certificate award is presented to a student once they have earned 1000 points within a week. 10 points are awarded per correct activity answer in a regular activity. 20 points are awarded per correct answer in a 'Topic Test'. The 'Primary Section' of the website is accessible via Tablet device, and is available for offline use if the user doesn't have sufficient Wi-Fi. All points garnered whilst on offline will be synchronised onto online servers once the individuals access the website online.  Secondary Students  Mathletics believes that \\"secondary school is a whole new world and a new school demands an older, more study-focused interface for new students\\". As a result, the \\"Secondary\\" section of the website available to students doesn't reflect the juvenile decor that saturates the \\"Primary\\" section of the website, replacing it with a \\"more study-based\\" interface. Further, this \\"Secondary\\" area of the website exclusively promotes the use of a student progress system through use of a 'Traffic Light System', which categorises a user's understanding of a mathematical topic into three, colour-based, identifiable sections: # Green = 85% to 100% correct marks. # Orange = 50% to 84% correct marks. # Red = 0% to 49% correct marks. Alongside this colour-coded progress guide secondary students have access to \\"adaptive practice activities with animated support, plus interactive and video content\\" as well as a library of various printable eBooks. Secondary Students also are offered the option to personally customise the website's interface from a range of differing backgrounds, in an effort to suit their \\"learning needs\\". The collection of backgrounds encompass pictures of natural environments, sporting fields, pictures of live animals and vibrant pattens of colours. Alike to the \\"Primary' section, accumulative points are awarded for the completion of questions in activities. Secondary Students also have access to 'Topic Tests' which summate the most difficult questions of the topic. The \\"Secondary Students\\" section of the website is also reachable on a Tablet device, and can be accessed for offline use. The same process of offline synchronisation to the online profile is also applied in the 'Secondary Students\\" section of the website.  Early Learners  The 'Early Learners Numeracy' section of the site offers a series of multimedia resources that are designed to support students aged from four to seven. The section's mascot feature animated 'Numbeanies', drawn and designed to appeal to infants. These 'Numbeanies' present younger users with a series of flash cards that represent numbers as \\"collections, numerals and words\\". The overall purpose of the Early Learners section is to be entertaining, and provide the basic foundations of mathematics through the guise of interactive games and videos.  Baby Mathletics  'Baby Mathletics' caters to users 6‚Äì24 months old, and is independent to the Mathletics website. 'Baby Mathletics' is an iOS based application is designed to \\"help build confidence for when they start learning Mathematics at school\\". The application is a video tour of a fictional story that includes animated animals and shapes, which \\"poses questions, stimulate reactions and spark new interests in learning\\". The purpose of the application is ultimately to foster a sense of confidence in regards to numerical learning in young toddlers.  Teachers  Users that identify as teachers have access to a 'Mathletics Teacher Console' which manages their classroom's collective progress, as well as providing insight into each individual student's progress also. The teacher console delineates live data analysis of each student's progress, represented via colour-coded visuals, in an attempt to provide teachers greater agency in assigning \\"targeted and personalised learning pathways\\" for the class. The teacher console provides teachers with tools and instruments to manage classes, create custom mathematical learning courses to suit different and various learning groups, and bestow students with multimedia sources that will assist them answer the questions assigned. Teachers have the option to select mandatory assignments and activities to be completed by their students. These assignments must be completed before a student participate in games of Live Mathletics or other activities. The teacher console is multi-platformed and available on various media devices including Tablet and Mobile.  Avatar  Each individual subscriber of Mathletics must create an identifiable Avatar. The customisable Avatar template provided by Mathletics is a portrait- view shot of a head and face in the foreground, combined with an animated environment in the background. This online persona is known as the user's 'Mathlete'. The avatar does not have to represent a user's actual facial features, however the avatar's design will represent the user against others in competitions of 'Live Mathletics'. The Avatar can be updated/altered through the 'Face Maker' interface via purchasing upgrades with credits that have been earned from completing tasks and competitions of 'Live Mathletics'. Mathletics operates via a credits-based incentive system, awarding students who have completed quizzes or competitions of 'Live Mathletics' with in-app online credits that replicate virtual currency, and can be used to purchase aesthetic upgrades to their 'Mathlete'. The Mathletics website will award an obligatory 10 credits to user for participation in a quiz or competition, as an added bonus to their base gained score.  Live Mathletics  The option to participate in real-time, live networked mathematic competitions known as 'Live Mathletics' are offered to users on the Mathletics Website. The primary objective to win is for users to complete as many addition, subtraction and multiplication problems as possible before the one-minute timer ends. Users must select which difficulty level they wish to compete in, which vary on a difficulty scale from 1-10 (1 being the easiest, 10 being the hardest) that dictates the complexity of the questions asked by the website. The user who answers the most correctly, wins. It is possible for a user to 'strike-out' and forfeit their position in the game if they incorrectly answer more than two problems. A total of 5 credits are awarded to users for winning a game of Live Mathletics, and a total of 10 credits are awarded to any user who beats their previous score on any difficulty level. 'Live Mathletics' incorporates a \\"Who's Online\\" panel which allows users to read a live feed of other students in their class that are currently online and engaged with 'Live Mathletics'. Each student listing is accompanied by a high score rating, and an option that directly requests and challenges said student to a game of 'Live Mathletics'. In addition, there is a panel that displays the students that are offline, whom can also be challenged to games of 'Live Mathletics'. Offline students who are challenged are replaced by a computer that emulates the offline individual's average game completion speed. Students are also assigned an individual 'ability' ranking that operates on a scale from \\"Raging Rookie to Human Calculator\\". Mathletics determines this ranking based upon the student's overall high score.  Reception  The overall reception of Mathletics as an educational software has been generally positive. Technology- based reviewer TeachWire appraised Mathletics, calling it an \\"intuitive and engaging resource; one that's bound to improve the learners' skills, knowledge and ability in maths, especially in numerical skills and speed\\". EducationWorld named Mathletics a \\"tremendous resource\\" and an educational website that \\"injected(ed) a little competitions into lessons\\". Critically, Macquarie University's leading mathematic education expert, Dr Michael Cavanagh described Mathletics to SMH as a \\"drill and practise\\" learning software. He believes that \\"this type of program needs to be complemented - and this is when the teacher comes in, to develop a deeper and broader understanding\\". He then substantiates his belief that Mathletics is only \\"one piece of the puzzle\\" in regards to mathematical informative learning with \\"If all students do is stuff on Mathletics then that's a pretty shallow approach\\".

Center for Study of the American Jewish Experience, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began his career as a documentary photographer. After serving in the Navy, he obtained a bachelor's degree at Bard College, a master's degree in social work at Columbia University and a doctorate at Union Graduate School and returned to Cincinnati to pursue a dual career as a social worker for Family Service of the Cincinnati area, the Community Chest, and the United Way (United Appeal) and as an associate professor of community planning at the University of Cincinnati. Photographer Ransohoff created a photographic record, now housed in the Cincinnati Museum, that spanned 30 years and documents Cincinnati‚Äôs disadvantaged in neighborhoods across the city, including the West End. He left a collection of more than 25,000 prints and negatives of urban housing, economic, social, and health conditions, children, the elderly, families, and the agencies which try to alleviate the conditions.Ransohoff, D. J. (1955). Today's Housing Program, the Community, and Social Casework. Marriage and Family Living, 17(2), 156-161. One example of such imagery was included in 1955 by Edward Steichen in the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, seen by 9 million viewers and perpetuated in a catalogue that has never been out of print. Ransohoff‚Äôs contribution demonstrates his respect for the dignity of his subjects; it is classically and sympathetically composed to show both the interior of an old tenement and its occupant, a resolute old woman in a worn floral dress, top lit and standing next to her rocking chair which is silhouetted against the cheaply curtained window. Author Bill Miller wrote of him in Cincinnati Magazine in May 1968 that, ‚Äú‚Ä¶his photos have become classics that live on and on, stirring human conscience wherever they are seen.‚Äù Many of his photographs appeared in Time, Life, The New Yorker, and on national televisionEditorial, Cincinnati Magazine, May 1971, Vol. 4, No. 8, page 2, ISSN 0746-8210, Emmis Communications Promoter of social work Aside from documenting substandard living conditions of the clients of Family Service, for which he was appointed Community Relations Director, he also photographed to show what social work was and the vital roles that social workers performed in the community. With World War II over, there was a new generation of families who needed the assistance of a clinically trained social worker for marital problems, alcoholism, parent-child relationships, and emotional problems, during a time of tremendous change for American families when men were returning from the military services to the workforce, and women who had worked during the war were back at home; together they were producing babies in record numbers. Ransohoff‚Äôs specialty was public relations through photography to help families become aware of the ways Family Service could help. In the early 1960s, the New York-based Family Service Association of America published a pamphlet Their Career: Helping People Help Themselves which used Ransohoff‚Äôs imagery to recruit young adults into social work.Linda Vaccariello ‚ÄòFamily Matters: Fifty Years Ago, Danny Ransohoff‚Äôs Photographs Defined Social Work in Black and White‚Äô Cincinnati Magazine, Nov 2004, Vol. 38, No. 2, ISSN 0746-8210 pps 102-109 Later career Ransohoff went on to work for Community Chest, where he continued to capture images of life in the Cincinnati community. His two official jobs were teaching community planning at the University of Cincinnati and directing special projects for the United Way and Community Chest, but in his unofficial role, he conducted hundreds of tours of the city for residents and visitors and for companies who used him to help recruit workers who may have had negative feelings about the city.Mary Gustafson ‚ÄòTour de Force‚Äô Cincinnati Magazine, Mar 1977, Vol. 10, No. 6, ISSN 0746-8210 He co- founded Cincinnati's classical music public radio station WGUCDoug Bolton (2010) WGUC gets blog mention Cincinnati Business Courier (online) and was chairman of the Friends of Judaic Studies.The Cincinnati Jewish Jubilee Yearbook, 1957 Ransohoff died of pancreatic cancer in a hospital in Cincinnati, on May 29, 1993 and was survived by two daughters, Sallie Ransohoff Kreines and Lela Ransohoff-Englert, both of Cincinnati; two brothers, Jerry and William, both of Cincinnati; a stepson, Charles Fleischmann, of Unionville, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Melanie Fleischmann of North Salem, N.Y., and two grandchildren.Daniel Ransohoff, 71, Booster for Cincinnati.(Obituary).

The resulting scandal has been described as one of the biggest scandals in South Korea. Background Daewoo was a major South Korean conglomerate. Prior to the Asian financial crisis, Daewoo was the second largest conglomerate in Korea. By 1999, Daewoo went bankrupt, with debts of about US$50-80 billion. Corruption scandal Soon after the demise, South Korean prosecutors filed charges against over 40 top executives, in what BBC described as the Daewoo corruption scandal. This was related to the discovery that company's auditors concealed the amount of debt, and that bribes of about 470 billion won were involved (close to US$400 million). Loss from bribery and corruption has been estimated to over US$1 billion. Daewoo Chairman Kim Woo-Jung fled to Vietnam, and former Daewoo factory workers put up \\"Wanted\\" posters with his picture. Kim returned to Korea in June 2005 and was promptly arrested. He was charged with masterminding accounting fraud of 41 trillion won (US$43.4 billion), illegally borrowing 9.8 trillion won (US$10.3 billion), and smuggling US$3.2 billion out of the country. On 30 May 2006, Kim was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement. On the last day of the trial, Kim tearfully addressed the court, \\"I cannot dodge my responsibility of wrongly buttoning up the final button of fate.\\" On 30 December 2007, Kim was granted amnesty by President Roh Moo-hyun.

The resulting scandal and trial of the first half of 1997 has been described as one of the largest ever scandals in South Korea. History Hanbo Steel received illegal preferential treatment from the government of Korean president Kim Young-sam, primarily through loans issued by banks under pressure from bribed high ranking politicians and bankers. Losses from corruption and bribes are estimated at US$6 billion. Following a trial, by early June 1997 the company's founder, , was sentenced to be jailed 15 years. His son, Chung Bo Keun, was jailed for three years. Eight other prominent figures, including former Home Minister Kim Woo Suk, several presidential aides and parliament members, and two former presidents of Korea First Bank were also handed sentences. The son of the president, , was arrested in a related investigation and sentenced to three years in October 1997. Impact The scandal is seen as having contributed to the Korean economic troubles of that time (see also Asian financial crisis of 1997), exposing South Korean's economy weaknesses and corruption problems to the international financial community. Hanbo was also one of the first in a series of at least ten large South Korean conglomerate bankruptcies that occurred shortly afterward (involving major companies like Kia Motors and Daewoo; the latter also part of a major corruption scandal). The domino effect of collapsing large South Korean companies drove up interest rates and drove away international investors.

It was designed by John Whitton in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built in 1886. It is also known as Severn River Railway Viaduct. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  When John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for Railways 1856-1890, extended the Main North Railway from Muswellbrook to Glen Innes, 1870-1884 it climbed through the highest parts of the Great Dividing Range into the New England Region. Gradients were steep, curves were sharp, there was heavy earthworks and some major iron lattice bridges. It was expensive railway construction. When the section from Glen Innes to Tenterfield was planned, economies were made, particularly with bridges. They had to be timber, mostly ballast top timber beam bridges but at three locations larger bridges were required, over the Beardy River, Severn River and Bluff River. Whitton, a successful railway engineer from England, chose one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's timber bridge viaducts built in Cornwall during the 1850s. The model chosen was the St Germans Viaduct, composed of composite deck Queen post trusses, with the bottom chords being large iron rods. Whitton's staff redesigned the trusses to be all timber and the viaducts were built during construction of the Glen Innes to Tenterfield section 1884-86. The final section to Wallangarra (1888) was mostly easier over plateau country but the crossing of Tenterfield Creek required a large bridge and a timber Queen post truss viaduct was built there also, the fourth between Glen Innes and the Queensland border. Only two other such timber viaducts were built in this period, the Ingalara Creek railway bridge and the Bredbo River railway bridge on the Bombala railway line.  Description  Located from Central station, the Severn River bridge is a 13-span timber truss viaduct; each span is centre-to-centre of timber trestles. The trusses are deck Queen post copied from one of Brunel's Cornish timber bridges (St Germans), built about 30 years earlier. The condition of the bridge was assessed as fair as at 16 March 2006 due to lack of maintenance since rail services were suspended. All four viaducts retain their original fabric.  Heritage listing  The Severn River railway bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Glen Innes to Wallangarra Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s was ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Despite a degree of inaccessibility, the timber viaducts over the Beardy, Severn and Bluff Rivers are impressive structures within their rural landscapes. At Tenterfield, the adjacent New England Highway provides easy viewing of the fourth such viaduct. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Main North Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the New England Region from the time of its construction 1882-88, and the four timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The viaducts were technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. These four viaducts and the two on the Cooma Line are the only ones of their type built. They are a unique class of railway bridge.

It is also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase, citvac, proteinase B, hemoglobinase, PRSC1 gene product or LGMN (Homo sapiens), vicilin peptidohydrolase and bean endopeptidase. In humans it is encoded by the LGMN gene (previous symbol PRSC1). It hydrolyzes substrates at the C-terminus of asparagine residues. Discovered in 1996 in beans, its homologues have been identified in plants, protozoa, vertebrates, and helminths. The enzyme has been implicated in several human diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and inflammation . It can be detected in spleen, liver, brain, testis tissue and heart and the protein is mostly localised to lysosomes and endosomes. It is also interesting that AEP is activated in age- dependent manner.  Distribution  This enzyme was originally identified in the vacuoles of legume seeds, and was subsequently identified the lysosomes of mammals and Schistosoma mansoni. They are now known to be present in a range of plants and animals.  Activity  = Reaction and specificity = This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction: : Hydrolysis of proteins and small molecule substrates at -Asn-Xaa- bonds Both plant and animal legumains are most active in acidic environments. = Prodomain processing = Legmains are produced as inactive precursor zymogens. their C-terminal domain binds over their active site (where a substrate would normally bind), inhibiting activity. Once in the acidic environment of the vacuole or lysosome, the prodomain is cleaved off to reveal the active enzyme. = Mechanism = Legumain is a cysteine protease from the C13 family of the CD clan of proteases (MEROPS). It uses a catalytic triad of Cysteine-Histidine-Asparagine in its active site to perform covalent proteolysis of its substrate. = Activation = Asparagine endopeptidase is synthesized as an inactive zymogen. AEP and other cysteine peptidase are activated when pH changes from neutral to acidic. It undergoes autoproteolytic maturation for catalytic activation. It appears to be autocatalytically cleaved after asparagine or aspartate residue. Activation begins at pH 4.5. The chemical structure at this point shows that breaks which occurs at pH 4.5 can be healed under the basic crystallization conditions. C-terminal fragments (‚àº13 kDa) generated during autoproteolysis can gradually re-ligated to form the proenzyme when the pH is increased towards pH 7.5, which means that proteolytic activation of AEP can be reversible.  Biological roles  = Plants = = Antimicrobial activity = In plant Oldenlandia affinis it generates antimicrobial cyclic peptides which are important for defence against pathogens in plants. The herb has been used in native African medicine to accelerate childbirth. = Animals =  Innate immune system  There are many regulators which affect immune system and help to keep it balanced. If the immune system is too active there is a danger of developing an autoimmune disease, while passive immune system will lead to infections or cancer. Antigen presenting is a key role in activation of immune system. It has been discovered that AEP plays role in this critical moment. AEP is involved is presenting of foreign and self proteins using MHCII protein complex. The role of AEP in immunity is not clear, but it seems that it is connected with checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1, which downregulates AEP which is key to shifting the balance between cancer fighting cells and regulatory T cells. In the absence of AEP, inhibitory checkpoints may not have a beneficial response. Measuring of this enzyme in patients could predict which one of them may provide better response to treatment.  Signalling  In innate immunity TLRs play an important role. These TLRs (mainly TLR7 and TLR9) can be proteolytically activated by AEP. The reduction of proinflammatory cytokines by stimulating TLR9 was found in myeloid cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells which lacked AEP. Enzyme is also important in processing of influenza virus and immune response using TLR7. AEP plays a critical role in TLR processing. and AEP can initiate removal of invariant chain in MHC-II complex, which can critically influence peptide generation and activity of MHCII.  Disease  =Neurodegenerative diseases = AEP is activated during brain ischemia or brain acidosis and epilepsia seizure. It digests SET protein, which is an inhibitor of DNase, leading to DNA damage and causing damage of the brain. Increased activity of AEP in brain is also observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). AEP cleaves tau protein and amyloid precursor protein. In patients with PD, alpha synuclein is cut by AEP into toxic chunks. Alzheimer's disease  Active AEP was found at increased levels and translocated to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells of AD patients. In AD the plaques are composed of amyloid beta, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and tau protein. The dysfunction of APP proteolysis and the abnormal phosphorylation of tau lead to the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively, causing neuronal degeneration and dementia It also play a crucial role in behavior disorders connected with AD such as anxiety and depression. It also plays a role in stroke. Since stroke elicits acidity in the brain AEP become active due to low pH level. Then it cleaves SET which causes death of brain cells. Targeting of AEP might help to prevent onset of AD symptoms. Development of AEP-selective inhibitors (such as Cbz-L-Ala-L-Ala-AzaAsnchloromethylketone and aza-peptidyl AEP inhibitors) is crucial for helping with diseases.

Related to and overlapping with state capitalism, a system in which the state undertakes commercial activity, authoritarian capitalism combines private property and the functioning of market forces with repression of dissent, restrictions on freedom of speech and either a lack of elections or an electoral system with a single dominant political party. Countries commonly referred to as being current authoritarian capitalist states include China since the economic reforms, Hungary under Viktor Orb√°n, Russia under Vladimir Putin and Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Historically, it has also been considered that Chile under Augusto Pinochet, Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew and Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek as well as fascist regimes and military dictatorships during the Cold War such as Francoist Spain and the Third Republic of South Korea under Park Chung-hee as authoritarian capitalist. The state of Nazi Germany has also been described as one that practiced an extreme form of authoritarianism and capitalism. Political scientists disagree on the long-run sustainability of authoritarian capitalism, with arguments both for and against the long-term viability of political repression alongside a free-market capitalist economic system.  History  = Early development = As a political economic model, authoritarian capitalism is not a recent phenomenon. Throughout history, examples of authoritarian capitalism include Manuel Estrada Cabrera's and Jorge Ubico's respective reigns in Guatemala, Augusto Pinochet's reign in Chile, Suharto's New Order in Indonesia and the People's Action Party's early administration in Singapore. During World War I, the ideological divide between authoritarian and liberal regimes was significantly less pronounced as both were aligned to capitalist economic models. Moreover, the Axis powers of World War II have been described as possessing totalitarian capitalist economic systems, acting as examples of the early developments of authoritarian capitalism. From the end of World War II, various authoritarian capitalism regimes emerged, developed and transitioned into a liberal capitalist model through East Asia, Southern Europe and Latin America. It has been argued that the change of these early regimes was predominately due to the dominance of liberal capitalist countries such as the United States as opposed to a natural transition, suggesting that modern authoritarian capitalist regimes may further develop the system. = Recent prominence = Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, both prominent recent figures for authoritarian capitalism While having been a relatively unknown system due to the failure of authoritarianism within the First World during the Cold War, with the transition of authoritarian countries such as China and Russia to capitalist economic models, authoritarian capitalism has recently rose into prominence. While it was initially thought that changing to a capitalist model would lead to the formation of a liberal democracy within authoritarian countries, the continued persistence of an authoritarian capitalist models has led to this view decreasing in popularity. Furthermore, some have argued that by utilising capitalist economic models authoritarian governments have improved the stability of their regimes through improving the quality of life of their citizenship. Highlighting this appeal, Robert Kagan stated: \\"There's no question that China is an attractive model for autocrats who would like to be able to pursue economic growth without losing control of the levers of power\\". Moreover, authoritarian capitalist regimes have experienced notable growth in their economic production, with the International Monetary Fund stating that authoritarian capitalist countries experienced an average 6.28% GDP growth rate compared to the 2.62% of liberal capitalist countries. In addition, many have argued the inability of liberal capitalism, with the global financial crisis and the slow response of the United States government, to quickly respond to crisis compared to more authoritarian systems has been bought into prominence. In fact, many argue that authoritarian capitalism and liberal capitalism have or will compete on the global stage.  State capitalism  = Overlap = Authoritarian governments often seek to establish control within their borders and as such will utilize state-owned corporations, therefore state capitalism will emerge to some extent within countries that practice authoritarian capitalism, manifesting from the ruling authorities desire to exercise control. The prominent utilization of state owned corporations and sovereign wealth funds within authoritarian capitalist regimes demonstrates such a tendency, with Russia decreasing its private ownership of oil from 90% to 50% while transitioning to a more authoritarian model under the leadership of Vladimir Putin. It has also been noted by individuals such as Richard W. Carney that authoritarian regimes have a strong tendency to utilise their economies as a method to increase their influence heavily investing in their economies through state owned enterprises. Carney describes the intervention of authoritarian states occurring through means he describes as extra-shareholder tactics, including regulations, government contracts and protectionist policies alongside the state engaging in shareholder activism. Moreover, he focuses on the use of state owned funds to engage in take-overs of key assets in other countries such as Khazanah Nasional's takeover of Parkway Pantai in 2010. = Differences = Within countries that practice authoritarian capitalism, state capitalism is generally also present to some extent and vice versa. As such, there is a widespread confusion between the terms with them at times being treated as synonymous by individuals such as former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. However, there remains a fundamental difference with state capitalism being a system in which government owned entities engage in for-profit activities while authoritarian capitalism is a system where an authoritarian regime co- exists with, or at least attempts to adopt aspects of, a market economy, highlighted in countries such as Hungary by the Transnational Institute.  Examples  = China = It is generally agreed that China is an authoritarian regime, with the Fraser Institute ranking them 136th for personal freedom and the Human Right Watch's 2018 report describing a \\"broad and sustained offensive on human rights\\" within China due to the treatment of activists, restrictions to freedom of information, political expression, religious freedom and minority rights as their core reasons. Moreover, while recognising the limited scope and reducing pace of capitalism within China, with The Heritage Foundation ranking them 110th for economic freedom in 2018, Michael Witt argues that China broadly displays capitalist traits with a significant number of companies either being private or shared between private and public owners alongside a strong entrepreneurial presence despite a continued predominance of indirect state control. Observers wonder whether authoritarian capitalist regimes can endure. Reporter Joseph Kurlantzick and political scientist Yuen Yuen Ang state that China is unable to fully utilise the entrepreneurial elements needed to drive future growth if it maintains authoritarian control. As Ang writes in Foreign Affairs, \\"[t]o achieve this kind of growth, the government must release and channel the immense creative potential of civil society, which would necessitate greater freedom of expression, more public participation, and less state intervention\\". As stated by Joseph Kurlantzick, \\"China's growth 'model' has shown impressive resilience in recent years\\", with an ability to rapidly respond to crises, confidence around economic success and growing soft power being used to explain it. = Hungary = While controversial among experts, some have claimed that after the election of Viktor Orb√°n in 2010 in Hungary has experienced democratic backsliding from its former position as a leading example of liberal democracy in Eastern Europe and become an example of an authoritarian capitalist regime. Exemplifying this claim of an autocratic transformation, Orb√°n has been described as severely limiting freedom of press and balances of power alongside engaging in reworking the democratic process in his favour through processes such as gerrymandering. In addition to increasing authoritarianism, Hungary has maintained its capitalist elements, being ranked 59th globally by the Fraser Institute for economic freedom in 2016, leading to the Transnational Institute using Hungary as an example of a highly authoritarian capitalist regime. The rise of authoritarian capitalism has been depicted as emerging from Orb√°n utilising a disillusionment at liberal capitalism due to slow wage growth, increasing unemployment and high debt to implement policy reform. These reforms have been described as involving both obtaining the support of businesses through low corporate tax rates alongside preventing opposition from entities such as trade unions or low income workers through the use of authoritarian measures. = Russia = Putin and Boris Yeltsin, both prominent figures of the development of authoritarian capitalism in Russia Gat Azar describes Russia along with China as a prominent example of a modern authoritarian capitalist nation, describing the nation as becoming increasingly authoritarian while maintaining a predominately capitalist economic model. Aaron L. Friedberg simplifies the evolution of the Russian model in the following statement: \\"The Russian system has also evolved from communist totalitarianism to a form of nationalist authoritarian capitalism that appears for the moment at least to be relatively stable\\". Friedberg also describes the 1996 presidential election as the point where authoritarian capitalism began forming within Russia, depicting an increasingly powerful majority party backed by media controlled by oligarchies and lead by Boris Yeltsin and later Vladimir Putin. From 1999 until today under Putin, Friedberg describes the Russian regime as solidifying its power through a re-obtaining state control of natural resources, obtaining control of media and limiting dissidence through measures such as restricting non-governmental organization operations. = Singapore = Lee Kuan Yew, a major figure in the development of Singapore's economic model The city-state of Singapore has been described by some critics as a country that lacks full liberal democracy. Although elections are free with a fair judiciary and strong rule of law, the United States‚Äìbased Human Rights Watch considers its freedom of speech limitations and capital punishment for murder, drug-related and firearm-related crimes as causing the country to run contrary to human rights. Moreover, the country under the leadership of Lee Hsien Loong has been described as embracing the core aspects of capitalism, with the Index of Economic Freedom ranking it the world's freest economy as of 2020. Singapore has also been consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world and the least in Asia itself. However, there is contention around the continued viability of Singapore's rapid economic success which has increased its GDP per capita from US$427.88 in 1960 to US$65,233 in 2019, one of the highest in the world. Some economists argue that Singapore has severely restricted its ability to obtain future growth through its restraint of individual freedom of expression and thought. Regardless of this, Singapore is considered as an exception in regards to its location, size and stability, with Daniel W. Drezner stating that \\"with the unique exception of Singapore, this model has never worked over the long run\\".  Contention  Authoritarian capitalism is a political- economic model that has faced a variety of criticism to various facets of its nature, both around the ability of capitalism to coexist effectively with authoritarian; and more general criticisms towards authoritarian modes of government. Some experts agree that the authoritarian capitalist model is unstable and will eventually transition into that of liberal capitalism, with Daniel W. Drezner stating: \\"The conventional wisdom in comparative politics is that as societies get richer [...] they also start demanding more political accountability\\". In opposition, others argue that the increased wealth of capitalist regimes allows authoritarian regimes to more adequately utilize technology to assist in maintaining their regimes. = Criticism = It is widely believed that through pursuing capitalist economic models a country is able to increase the quality of life of its citizens through higher levels of economic growth. This increase in quality of life is viewed as inherently detrimental to the continuation of an authoritarian regime. It is widely believed that individuals will increasingly seek to reduce restrictions upon their human rights as their quality of life and access to communication resources increase. As such, it is commonly thought by experts that the increasing implementation of capitalism will inevitably lead to citizens revolting against authoritarian governments. In addition, it is also widely thought that the restrictions to freedom of expression found in authoritarian regimes is harmful to the ability of citizens to innovate and engage in entrepreneurship, leading to a reduction in the economic growth of the country. As some experts have claimed that authoritarian capitalist regimes primarily obtain their legitimacy through their ability to deliver economic growth, this inherent restriction upon it would eventually lead to the collapse of the regime. Moreover, authoritarian capitalist regimes are viewed as having to face civil disobedience towards their authoritarian characteristics, exhibited by countries such as China experiencing 87,000 instances of mass unrest in 2005. = Defense = It has been argued that authoritarian capitalism is a potential competitor with liberal capitalism, with the recent success of authoritarian capitalist regimes such as China being used as the core of their argument. It has been further stated that through utilizing elements of capitalism, regimes may more effectively employ modern technologies to suppress dissidence towards government such as the Great Firewall utilized within China. In addition, individuals such as Niv Horesh argue that authoritarian capitalist model offered by China is a viable alternative to liberal capitalism, with more effective decision making processes. In addition, it is argued by others that capitalist free-market policies lead to an increase in authoritarian policies such as those pursued by Margaret Thatcher. The core of this argument lies in the view that citizens will support whichever regime provides material comforts which increasing economic inequality and automation in liberal capitalist nations undermine. Moreover, challenges to liberal capitalism from an inability to adequately cope with advances of technology have also been raised, summarised in the statement by former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd: \\"Democracies, like corporations, can now be hacked\\". Alongside technological challenges, a seeming failure to address structural issues such as gerrymandering have also been raised. In addition, the expansion of China has been described as a compelling argument for the success of its authoritarian capitalist regime. Aaron Friedberg of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation has also noted that authoritarian capitalist nations have utilised an exploitation of the Western world, the reshaping of the international order and exclusion of international actors in an attempt to establish their systems of governance. He has also stated that unlike in the Cold War contemporary authoritarian powers will likely to be driven towards cooperation in their attempts to consolidate their regimes.

In 1986, when he was 18 years old, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for killing 43-year-old officer Kim Chan-il. After his release, he was again arrested for theft and sentenced to six months in prison. In the following 10 months, he committed 16 robberies, killing 9 people in Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongnam and Chungham.  Life  Jeong Du-yeong was born in 1968 as the youngest child with three brothers and one sister. His father died when he was two and his mother remarried, leaving Jeong to be cared for by his uncle. He had a serious complex due to his appearance, and said that the reason for the 1986 murder was simply because he thought the officer ignored him. Jeong, who spent most of his unfortunate childhood in an orphanage, stated in his post-arrest statement that he wanted to have an ordinary family like everyone else. Until then, money was not collected by theft and robbery, but by a bankbook, reaching a total amount of 130 million won. He said that he had planned to arrange marriages to a total of one billion people, and that he was going to build an apartment and PC room. On September 28, 2016, while imprisoned in Daejeon Prison, he was caught trying to escape using a ladder that he had secretly built while working in the workshop. He escaped over two of three prison walls, but failed to cross the last wall. Jeong Du-yeong's brother-in-law was an accomplice. His brother was not aware that Jeong murdered people.  Crimes  * On June 2, 1999, Lee Young-ja, a housekeeper who lived alone in a wealthy residential area in Busan, died after having parts of her face brutally pierced. At the time, the fact that the victim's house was next door to the inspection office of the Busan High Public Prosecutors' Office was a topic of discussion, but it turned out to be a coincidence. * On September 15, 1999, while stealing money from the high-end villas of Seo-gu in Busan, Jeong cruelly killed the housemaid. * On October 21, 1999, a 53-year-old mother and her 24-year-old son were killed in a luxury housing complex in Ulsan. In this case, the police paid attention to the 'overdrive' which was not seen in the other robberies, but no connection was established to the previous events in Busan. * On March 11, 2000, a couple of women were attacked in a high-end residence in Seo-gu by a man with a baseball bat. One of the women said that she had a baby, and the killer let her live. Based on the survivor's statement, the police described the attacker as tall and in his 20s or 30s, sending this to the national police. * On April 8, 2000, in Dongbu-ku, Busan, Jeong killed 76-year-old Chung Jin-tae and his housekeeper with a knife, also hitting Chung's grandmother. He stole a check worth 24.3 million won. While the grandmother was passing the emergency service in the hospital, she came by a police officer dispatched to the hospital and then saw Jeong Du-yeong, who was caught in Cheonan, pointing out that he was responsible for the murders. Jeong subsequently confessed to his crimes.  Trial  = First trial = On July 21, 2000, the Busan District Court sentenced Jeong Du-yeong, who was charged with robbery, to death, and also sentenced his brother-in-law, Kim Jong-young, to one year and six months imprisonment. The defendants objected and submitted an appeal to the Busan District Court. = Second trial = On November 30, 2000, the Busan Appellate Court dismissed all the appeals and maintained Jeong's death sentence and Kim's one year and six months sentence. Jeong abandoned his appeals towards the Supreme Court, confirming his death penalty. He is now serving his sentence in Daejeon prison.

It was built in 1917. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Like most settlements on Brisbane Water, Saratoga had been subdivided as a holiday resort after the coming of the railway. This particular subdivision, New Brighton Estate made provision not only for the usual small allotments on the waterfront but, mindful of the nature of the soil and the interest of an adjoining landowner, several orchard and farm blocks. John Bourke had settled in the area in the area in 1863 and became a pioneer of commercial citrus- growing on the Central Coast. Most if not all of the orchard and farm blocks were purchased by the Bourke family to extend their citrus activities. Rosemount was built in about 1917 on a 16-acre (6.5 hectare) parcel of land owned by Martin and Mary Bourke (n√©e Callen) which was part of the New Brighton Estate. The material for the house was supplied by Mary Bourke's father Peter Callen as a wedding present to his daughter. Peter Callen left the Saratoga area as a young man and settled in the Stockton area of Newcastle where he established a very successful boat building business. Most of the tradesman who built Rosemount were employees of his. MMartin Bourke gave a portion of his land to the Council for use as a road (now known as Steyne Road East) and also donated an area of land on the corner of High Street and Brooklyn Road for the erection of a Catholic church. Unfortunately due to a lack of parking facilities the land was deemed unsuitable and was subsequently sold. The money was then used to purchase a site in Davistown Road where the Catholic Church now stands. In March 1983, the owner of Rosemount (and Peter Callen's granddaughter), Molly Broad, applied for a Permanent Conservation Order. At the time Rosemount was under considerable pressure for subdivision because of its zoning and consequent local rates and State land taxes incumbent upon it. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 2 December 1983 and it was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Rosemount is an imposing late Federation style residence located on a corner block of approximately 0.5 hectares in area at Saratoga. Set in landscaped grounds it has features of Californian bungalow style including its weatherboard construction, single gables and squat brick columns in its verandah. Part of Rosemount's landscaping consists of small sandstone block walls. The stone were originally hewn by convicts to build a house for the officer-in-charge of the area and were later moved to this site. Some citrus trees survive on the property. The building was reported to be in good condition as at 4 December 2007.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Rosemount was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria: The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.

Although several orbital rail schemes have been proposed and some constructed throughout Melbourne's history, the SRL received significant new attention in 2018 when the Labor government of Victoria led by Premier Daniel Andrews announced it as a policy in the lead up to the state election of that November. Construction of the SRL would take more than 25 years and cost over $AUD50 billion. A substantial portion of the route would be built underground along entirely new rail alignments, although the western half would be shared with or formed by the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link and the existing Deer Park‚ÄìWest Werribee railway line. Four distinct sections have been identified for the staging of construction and operation. Initial planning for the SRL was carried out in secret prior to its announcement, and, when the plans were released, publicity was widespread. The SRL plan was praised for its long-term vision and ambition, as well as being an innovative solution to the difficulties faced by Melbourne's transport network, but criticised for its obvious political motives and enormous cost.  Background  446x446px The Melbourne transport network was substantially developed in the late 19th century, when the newly available technology of the railway enabled population growth away from the city centre. The result was the development of a largely radial network, which, over the following century, reinforced a model of urban development focused on heavy daily commuter flows into and out of the CBD. Furthermore, a program of freeway construction in the wake of the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan reinforced the structure of the suburbs and introduced car dependence to new regions of development not served by the legacy rail network. As a consequence, Melbourne, unlike many cities of comparable size, did not develop any major centres of employment or dense population in its outlying regions over the course of the 20th century. A number of orbital lines were constructed at the peak of railway development, but most failed to attract the necessary traffic of passengers and goods to remain sustainable into the late 20th century. The Outer Circle, which ran from Oakleigh on the Dandenong line to Fairfield on the Hurstbridge line via the Glen Waverley and Lilydale lines, was constructed between 1888 and 1891 but closed by 1897, though it was partly reopened as the Alamein branch line. The Inner Circle linking the modern-day Upfield and Mernda lines, was opened in 1888 but closed to passengers in 1941. The Albion-Jacana line and Newport-Sunshine line in the city's west, though performing a similar purpose, were never intended to carry passenger traffic. In the late 20th century, interest grew in enabling orbital journeys between Melbourne suburbs. Included in the 1969 Plan were a number of orbital freeways, virtually all of which were constructed over the following decades. The M80 Ring Road through the outer western and northern suburbs was constructed in stages between 1989 and 1999, and, by the time of its completion, was claimed by its advocates to have been partly responsible for a massive economic boom in the western suburbs, centred on its points of intersection with existing radial routes. EastLink, a similar orbital freeway through the eastern suburbs, opened in 2008, but was less successful, failing to reduce traffic meaningfully on parallel arterials such as Springvale Road. Detailed plans for the North East Link, connecting the Ring Road and EastLink to complete the orbital route, were released in 2018, with construction expected to start in 2020 for an anticipated completion date of 2027. Despite the investment in orbital road transport from 1990, little changed in the structure of the public transport network. No new suburban railway lines after 1930, and trams were increasingly delayed by traffic congestion on key routes. From 2002, the SmartBus program introduced three orbital bus routes in an attempt to meet the city's burgeoning need for outer suburban public transport. In addition to serving new corridors previously without mass transit, the buses were operated at a relatively high frequency and along direct routes, in contrast to the existing network of infrequent and circuitous routes. As a result, the SmartBus routes became the most heavily used in Melbourne, and were widely praised as a model for recasting the future public transport network.  History  = Proposal = In August 2018, three months prior to the 2018 Victorian election, incumbent Premier Daniel Andrews promised that a re-elected Labor government would undertake \\"the biggest public transport building program in Australian history\\", in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. The comments were interpreted as a hint that as-yet-unannounced projects would be revealed closer to the election, although Andrews provided no detail in his speech. On 27 August, Andrews revealed plans for the Suburban Rail Loop for the first time: a orbital line for Melbourne's rail network, connecting 11 of the city's existing rail lines and serving new regions of the middle and outer suburbs at an estimated cost of $50 billion. The government committed $300 million to complete a business case and feasibility study should it be re-elected, noting that the project would take several terms of government to complete. In the days following the proposal, the government revealed that its plan had been under consideration within Development Victoria, a planning agency under the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning for 12 months. Controversially, neither Infrastructure Victoria nor Transport for Victoria, both established by the Andrews government, had been involved in the SRL's planning stages; furthermore, neither agency had identified the need for a similar project in their long-term plans for the transport network. Andrews defended the decision to develop the SRL independently of infrastructure authorities, arguing that while Infrastructure Victoria \\"have lots of good ideas, they don't have every good idea\\". The tender process for the Melbourne Airport rail link project was launched in mid-September, and the state government confirmed that it anticipated the airport link would form the north-western section of the SRL, with construction beginning in 2022 In mid- October, Labor federal Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten announced support for the SRL, including a commitment for $300 million in initial federal funding should the Labor Party be elected. The state government also indicated that it would be prepared to add additional stops to the loop to those included in the original announcement, particularly in the western suburbs. Days later, a leaked document from Transport for Victoria showed that the SRL had not been included in the transport authority's long-term plan for the rail network. = Early works = $300 million was allocated to planning works for the SRL in the 2019 state budget. Rail Projects Victoria announced registrations of interest for potential contractors were open in June, and the first geotechnical investigations began in July in Box Hill. The state government announced the formation of a Suburban Rail Loop Authority in September, at the same time as confirming station precincts for the south- eastern section. In November 2019, the government announced that the loop would be an operationally independent, standalone line using different rail technology from the existing suburban rail network. The system would use new, smaller metro rollingstock that is four to five carriages long, allowing shorter platforms. The Premier announced an intention to use private investment to help fund the line, but did not indicate whether the line would be driverless.  Proposed route  The SRL Strategic Assessment produced by Development Victoria in 2018 identifies four distinct sections of the route, some of which mirror parts of other projects or existing rail corridors. The overall corridor selected was originally identified as a \\"middle\\" corridor, and was assessed against other routes closer to and further from the CBD before being prioritised for further investigation. = South-eastern = The south-eastern section between Cheltenham station on the Frankston line and Box Hill station on the Lilydale railway line would be the first constructed, and be entirely underground along a new alignment. From south to north, the south- eastern section would also include stations at Clayton on the Dandenong rail corridor; Monash University's Clayton campus; Glen Waverley station, the terminus of the line by the same name; and Burwood, near the main campus of Deakin University. Government press releases identify Clayton as the location of a \\"super-hub\\", allowing interchange between SRL services, frequent Dandenong corridor services, and regional Gippsland line services. = North- eastern = The north-eastern section between Box Hill station and Melbourne Airport would be constructed after the south-eastern section, and include stops at Doncaster, a middle suburb long proposed for the terminus of a new radial rail line; Heidelberg station on the Hurstbridge line; Reservoir station on the Mernda line; Bundoora, home to the main campus of La Trobe University; Broadmeadows station on the Craigieburn line; and the airport itself. This section of the SRL would also be constructed entirely underground, and Broadmeadows would function as a \\"super-hub\\" for the Seymour and North East regional lines. = North-western = The north-western section would parallel the route of the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link between the airport and Sunshine station, with no intermediate stations proposed by the Strategic Assessment. This section would be mostly constructed along the existing railway corridor at surface level, and could be completed as part of the airport link project, commencing with the south-eastern section in 2022. = South-western = Apart from the termini at Sunshine and Werribee, the Strategic Assessment did not identify specific routes, intermediate stations or connections to other lines for the south-western section, and suggested it would be the final section constructed. The Western Rail Plan published by Transport for Victoria in October 2018 suggested that the role of the south- western section could be undertaken by electrifying the Deer Park - West Werribee line to Wyndham Vale station as an extension of the radial suburban network, and extending the Werribee line to meet it at Wyndham Vale. Later documents released by the government confirmed that Wyndham Vale would become an interchange station.  Reception  = Political = Federal Infrastructure Minister Alan Tudge said that the Suburban Rail Loop's \\"big vision is great\\" but said the federal government would withhold its support until further details and costings of the plan were provided. Following the plan's original announcement, federal Labor leader Bill Shorten said that he \\"liked the principle\\" of the SRL, but would not immediately commit to supporting it with federal funding. He announced federal Labor's official support in mid-October 2018, committing $300 million in business case funding and saying the project responded to an \\"old map of Melbourne... [that] simply doesn't work any more\\". His infrastructure spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said that \\"this project here in Melbourne is the most transformative project for any capital city in Australia\\". Shorten later called the project the \\"Holy Grail\\" of public transport projects. State opposition treasury spokesman Michael O'Brien said that the SRL was a \\"plan for the next election rather than a plan for the next generation\\", and called on the government to send its plans to Infrastructure Victoria for independent costings and analysis. The plan was embraced by influential former Liberal premier Jeff Kennett, who called for bipartisan support for the project immediately after it was announced, despite expressing doubts about the accuracy of the $50 billion costing. At the election of November 2018, the traditionally Liberal-held seats of Mount Waverley, Burwood and Box Hill ‚Äì all falling along the path of the SRL proposal ‚Äì were claimed by the Labor Party after large swings, leading to speculation among Labor MPs and electoral commentators that the SRL announcement had contributed significantly to the government being returned with an increased majority. The phenomenon was also replicated in a number of safe Labor seats which would benefit from the line. = Media = Local media outlets were generally supportive of the project, although cautious in their optimism given the heavily politicised planning process and lack of detail in the announcement. The Age, in its editorial the day following the announcement, wrote that \\"there are so many reasons to endorse this proposal that it‚Äôs easy to get carried away\\", but observed that \\"good government is ultimately about more than just vision. It‚Äôs about having the inventiveness, discipline and fiscal capacity to make that vision reality\\", and suggested that the true test for the SRL would be the government's ability to complete it. Herald Sun political editor Matt Johnston was less supportive of what he called a \\"highly political\\" project, arguing that the comparisons to other major global cities ignored the fact that \\"Australia is fairly remote, has a relatively small population and has higher labour costs\\". However, Johnston also noted that \\"the route of the suburban rail loop... would go near to, or through, Liberal-held state seats such as Mount Waverley and Burwood [and] near to, or through, federal Liberal seats such as Chisholm and Deakin\\". = Experts and lobby groups = The SRL was warmly received by the Public Transport Users Association, with spokesman Daniel Bowen describing it as \\"Big City thinking\\" in an opinion piece. Prominent public transport advocate Graham Currie also supported the plan for its potential to induce new development in the outer suburbs, although he admitted being stunned by the government's secretive planning process. The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria also offered in-principle support, saying that \\"it makes sense for the state to protect a rail corridor through what is now 'middle Melbourne'\\", although it also argued that the SRL should not overshadow other improvements to the network such as Melbourne Metro 2. The SRL plan was criticised by rail lobby group the Rail Futures Institute, who argued that its benefits could be produced by a substantially cheaper network of orbital light rail routes. Marion Terill of the Grattan Institute was also critical, saying that travel demand did not warrant the investment required for the SRL. = Public = Media outlets reported massive levels of public support after the initial announcement of the plan. An impromptu competition organised by The Age to redesign the Melbourne rail network map to incorporate the SRL received entries from leading cartographers and attracted thousands of public votes in the days after the announcement.  Criticism  = Cost = Both the plausibility and practicality of the government's headline $50 billion construction cost for the project were the subject of significant commentary at the time of the SRL's original announcement. Political opponents suggested that the government had wildly understated the cost of the project, with former premier Jeff Kennett calling the figure \\"irresponsibly and fraudulently inaccurate\\", state opposition spokesmen suggesting the cost could be between $50 and $100 billion, and federal infrastructure minister Alan Tudge later saying he believed $100‚Äì150 billion was a more likely range. Independent experts agreed that the project was likely to ultimately cost more than the government's claim. Prominent transport commentator Daniel Bowen, in a \\"back of the envelope\\" analysis, concluded that the government was \\"close to the mark\\" but expressed reservations about the accuracy of his estimate. All these estimates suggest the tunnel will be more expensive than the $16 billion Gotthard Base Tunnel through the Alps in Europe Separately, transport planners criticised the promises made by state and federal Labor for a total of $600 million in planning funding. The Age published comments from an engineer arguing that a \\"competent\\" business case could be completed for only $5 million. Some commentary also questioned the capacity of the state to fund the project without severe impacts on its fiscal policy, irrespective of its actual cost. = Patronage = The Strategic Analysis released by the government in 2018 projects total daily trips on the SRL of 400,000 by 2051, making the line the busiest in Melbourne. It suggests that morning peak would have a 60:40 ratio of clockwise to counter-clockwise travel, with the balance reversed in the afternoon peak; by comparison, Melbourne's radial lines operate at a 90:10 ratio. Independent analysis of the plan by SGS Economics in the weeks following its release broadly supported the Strategic Assessment, noting that if the SRL had been in operation in 2018, a catchment around each station would have captured \\"roughly: 270,600 jobs, 416,100 residents, 212,300 workers, and 112,600 higher education students\\". It argued that the South-East section, consequently, would have served 30,000‚Äì50,000 daily trips if in operation in 2018, with the qualification that the level of service provided would need to make travel time competitive with car journeys. However, it concluded that the benefits and potential patronage of the North-East and two western sections were more nebulous, as their impact would depend on the efficiency with which the project was leveraged to create new development.

Life and career  Almeda Eliza Hitchcock was born on December 5, 1863, in Hilo, on the island of Hawaii, into a missionary family. Her paternal grandparents Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (1800‚Äì1855) and Rebecca Howard (1808‚Äì1890) were American Protestant missionaries who settled in the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1832. Her parents were David Howard Hitchcock (1831‚Äì1899), a lawyer and legislator in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and Almeda Eliza Widger (1828‚Äì1895). Her older brother was Volcano School painter D. Howard Hitchcock. To family and friends, she was known as Alme. She was educated at home and possibly the local private schools for children of foreign descent until the age of fifteen and attended the Oahu College (present day Punahou School) from 1879 to 1881 with her sister Cora Etta. She began studying law under her father in 1884 and decided to attend law school after meeting American lawyer Cora Agnes Benneson. From 1886 to 1888, Hitchcock studied law at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor and graduated with honor as class prophet. She was admitted to the Michigan bar on December 27, 1887 before her graduation. She was the only woman in the 143 graduates of her law class. After her graduation, she and her mother traveled to the Eastern United States to visit family before returning to Hawaii via San Francisco. On her return home while waiting in Honolulu for an interisland steamer to take her to Hilo, she applied to the Hawaiian bar on October 29, 1888. The decision was controversial since no women had been admitted to the bar before in the Kingdom but her father and King KalƒÅkaua‚Äòs Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonathan Austin recommended her. She was admitted by the Hawaii Supreme Court after she presented her Michigan license to Chief Justice Albert Francis Judd. Around the same time, she also applied to be a notary public which was approved by Minister of the Interior Lorrin A. Thurston. She became the first female lawyer and notary public in Hawaii. She joined as a partner in her father‚Äôs law firm in Hilo and continued her law practice. She assisted with office work and represented clients in local cases in Hilo while her father was off conducting his circuit in other parts of the island. The cases the firm was involved with included burglary, divorce, desertion, bankruptcy, and other areas of law. On May 24, 1892, Hitchcock married American physician William Levi Moore whom she had met while he was studying medicine at the University of Michigan. They moved to Kohala, on Hawaii, and K≈çloa, on Kauai, where Moore temporarily worked as governmental doctor. They returned to Hilo in June 1894. Prone to chronic health problems, her illness prevented her from continuing to work for her father. She died at her family home on May 9, 1895, of digestive problems, and was buried at the family plot at Homelani Cemetery in Hilo. It would not be until 1915 that the second female lawyer would appear in Hawaii, Marguerite Kamehaokalani Ashford, who was also an alumnus of the University of Michigan. In 1924, Carrick Hume Buck became the third female lawyer in Hawaii.

History  Frederick Augustus Hely was Principal Superintendent of convicts from 1823 until his death in 1836. As head of the Convict Department he was stationed in Sydney but hoped to settle in Brisbane Waters where he obtained a large land grant. By 1825 he established a farm called Wyoming in the Narara valley. Hely was one of the first land owners in the district and by far the largest.

Pacific Highway, Wyoming, Central Coast, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by John Verge and built with convict labour. The suburb Wyoming is named for the Cottage and the original farm. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Frederick Augustus Hely was Principal Superintendent of Convicts from 1823 until his death in 1836. He was appointed by the Earl of Bathurst in January 1823 and arrived in the Colony of New South Wales later that year with his wife and three children. As head of the Convict Department he was stationed in Sydney but hoped to settle at Brisbane Water where he obtained a large grant of land. By 1825 he had established a farm called Wyoming in the Narara Valley. It is possible that Hely named his property after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, from a famous poem, Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell, dated 1809. This name predates the use of Wyoming for the U.S. state, which was officially named in 1865. Hely was one of the first land owners in the district and by far the largest. With the advantages of wealth and position, his life style and work provide an important contrast to that of the small settler of which the district abounded. Hely engaged Architect John Verge to design Wyoming Cottage and in his ledger for June 1832, Verge listed his design for a large cottage at Brisbane Water, noting on 25 June that he had finished the plan and three elevations, as well as specifications for iron work, glass and working plans for the same. The house itself was not completed until after Hely's death in 1837 with construction finished in 1843. Frederick‚Äôs body was buried in a family vault on the estate at Wyoming, approximately 100m from the house. The Verge designed vault survives, but is no longer part of the property. Wyoming remained the residence of Hely family members, including Hovendon Hely, until January 1869. Except for a brief period as a private hospital and nursing home (1957-1969) it has been used as a residence since that time. In 1979 the Gosford Historical Research Association nominated Wyoming for protection under the Heritage Act. Although there was no immediate threat to the cottage the Association was concerned that future subdivision of the property for residential purposes would impact upon Wyoming Cottage. An Interim Heritage Order was placed over Wyoming Cottage on 1 August 1980. On 27 August 1982 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Wyoming Cottage. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Wyoming Cottage The original section of this Colonial bungalow is of sandstock bricks finished with stucco. The house has a simple plan, typical of cottages of this period, with a central hallway, with pairs of rooms on either side, and a verandah wrapping around the front and side elevations. The four main rooms have fireplaces with either timber or marble surrounds. The three bedrooms have glazed French doors to the verandahs. These are likely to be original as evidenced by the very fine profile of the mullions. The front door seems to be original with finely detailed side lights and fanlight. Timber extensions () have pressed metal ceilings and incorporate a side entrance with barrel vaulted roof in corrugated iron. A stone entrance at the rear is of more recent date but the stone extension blocks are from demolished building(s) on the Hely property. At the rear of the site, and linked to the main house is a sandstone service wing. This structure may be original, though some reports indicate that it was constructed using recycled blocks from buildings on the estate. This building is linked to the main house by a lightweight timber and glazed infill structure, and the whole rear wing has been incorporated under a continuation of the original roof. A galvanised roof has replaced the original shingles however early shingles are still extant under the metal sheets. The original section has an impressive archway in the entrance hall. An enclosure on the western side verandah is unsympathetic. The house stands on a corner site on the Pacific Highway, it is enhanced by a large number of mature trees, including several large pines of the species Bunya (Araucaria bidwillii), Hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Norfolk Island (Araucaria heterophylla). The garden also features mature Jacarandas, Moreton Bay figs, English Oak, Magnolia and Cabbage Tree Palms. These are mostly in front of the house and along the Wyoming Road boundary. The scale of these mature trees, and the distinctive forms of the various pines identify this site as an early settlement in the area and contribute to its landmark status.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 2/11/1981  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Wyoming Cottage is one of the relatively few remaining buildings known to have been designed by the eminent architect, John Verge.

It was built in 1852 by Greentree Brothers. The property is owned by the Dharug and Lower Hawkesbury Historical Society. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  By 1818, Wesleyan Methodism had spread along the Hawkesbury River, with many local settlers being from Sussex, Kent and Cornwall. Worship was originally held in private houses, and ministerial care was directed from Windsor. George Everingham was the first Australian born Wesleyan preacher. A son of First Fleet member Matthew Everingham and Elizabeth Rimes George, he married Keturah Stubbs and in 1832 bought the property known as \\"Greens\\" at Lower Hawkesbury. Everingham always walked or rowed a boat to his religious appointments, sometimes taking three days to get there. Part of \\"Greens\\" was leased to George William Douglass. From 1841 local meetings were organised at \\"Greens\\" by George Everingham, John Laughton and George Douglass. In 1838 George Douglass converted to Methodism. By 1852 the congregation was too large for private homes and George Everingham donated half an acre of \\"Greens\\" property to the church for a Chapel and school. The sandstone Chapel was built by Greentree brothers for 300 pounds. A tea-party had raised 200 pounds before work started and on 9 June 1859 another tea-meeting raised 61 pounds to clear the debt The first service was held on 22 April 1855. The congregation had arrived on Sunday but the Minister John Watkin had got lost and didn't arrive until Monday. Congregations mostly came by boat. Methodism thrived into the nineteenth century and many local men became preachers. By the 1950s attendances were well down and the last Methodist service was conducted at the Chapel in 1963. The Divine Word Missionaries leased \\"Greens\\" and the Chapel at a peppercorn rent for 10 years. The first Mass was celebrated on Sunday June 25, 1965. The lease was not renewed and the Chapel was unused for many years. The Dharug and Lower Hawkesbury Historic Society leased the premises from the Uniting Church in Australia in 1984 for a peppercorn rent. In 1986 they received a Bicentennial Grant, which together with substantial fundraising allowed for the purchase of the property. The Chapel and grounds are used for meetings, social events and are part of historic tours conducted in the area. The Chapel has also had services conducted on request.  Description  The sandstone chapel is built on half an acre of the property \\"Greens\\" donated by George Everingham. The shingle roof has been replaced by a corrugated steel roof and the windows have recently been replaced as per the original ones. The inside has a number of pews and a holy table. The grounds also have a small building complete with toilets that serve as a meeting area and amenities block for tours. The physical condition is good, as the Society has replaced the roof and windows, which were termite affected. There is subsidence in the front corner and a major drainage problem as the building has no drainage underneath and no space for air to circulate. Work on Wisemans Ferry Road raised the road level and this has increased the problem. The chapel remains as constructed with the exception of the roof, which has been replaced in tin along the original roof line. The windows were replaced with glass matching the originals.Korfron, 2002 A small amenities block has been built further up the property.  Heritage listing  The Lower Hawkesbury Wesleyan Chapel site is of rare local significance. It is significant for its association with the development and practice of Wesleyan Methodism in the Lower Hawkesbury area. It is also significant for its association with early European settlement in the Lower Hawkesbury. Through its use by the community for social, historical, tourist and educational events it maintains this significance. The Lower Hawkesbury Wesleyan Chapel is therefore a rare example of places of worship for the Wesleyans in the Lower Hawkesbury area in the 19th century. As the oldest intact usable stone chapel of this era in the area, it is a rare example of its purpose. It is associated within settlement in the area and has been almost continuously used by the community from 1855 to the present day. Lower Hawkesbury Wesleyan Chapel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site on which the lower Wesleyan Chapel stands has been involved in the history of the Lower Hawkesbury area from the early nineteenth century. It was initially the home of Richard Woodbury, the first police constable for the area and subsequently the home of George Everingham who as a local preacher was intimately involved with the development of Wesleyanism in the Lower Hawkesbury. The Lower Hawkesbury Wesleyan Chapel built in 1855 on land given by George Everingham is an integral part of the history of the early settlement, of the local community and of the development of Wesleyanism in the Lower Hawkesbury. There have been a number of prominent figures associated with the Chapel either as preachers or as attendees of the Chapel but of particular note are the lay preachers George Everingham and his wife Keturah (n√©e Stubbs), John Laughton and his wife Charlotte, and George Douglas and his wife Elizabeth. The local Wesleyans raised all the funds for the construction of the Chapel as a place of worship and it was the principal religious and social centre for the community from 1855 to 1963. The present owners the D&LHHSI; raised considerable funding (plus a grant) to purchase the Chapel in 1986. A number of the earliest members of the D&LHHSI;, in particular Louise Prince and Freda Deas, now in her mid-nineties, grew up in the Lower Hawkesbury area and vividly recall attending church services and tea parties at the Wesleyan Chapel. Since purchasing the property the Historical Society has carried out much restoration work of the Chapel and improvement of the surrounding grounds. The society continues to fund the maintenance and upkeep of the chapel. The site is the only remaining intact stone church built in the mid-nineteenth century in the Lower Hawkesbury. It is therefore of local historical significance.Cox 2003:15 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. It has a strong association with the early pioneering European families of the lower Hawkesbury Valley. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Chapel was a visibly prominent landmark in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century prior to the road construction. The Chapel is oriented to the Hawkesbury River as this was the point of arrival and departure for the members of the early congregations. The descent on the left hand side through bush to a natural rock landing and the iron rings driven into the rocks would have been used by the Churchgoers particularly after George Everingham acquired the Woodbury property. The Chapel itself is set on the eminence on which the Woodbury house itself would have been located in 1827. The worn steps show evidence of constant use for over 130 years. As the oldest usable intact stone chapel in the Lower Hawkesbury, it significantly contributes to the nineteenth and twentieth century aesthetics of the area. Although it now appears to be set down from the current road it is still a prominent landmark which can be seen from both the road and the Hawkesbury River. It is therefore of local aesthetic significance.Cox 2003:17 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Chapel was used as a principal venue for the religious and social activities of the Wesleyan community from 1855 to 1963. From 1965 to 1973 the Divine Word Missionaries, a Roman Catholic order, used it for religious purposes. From 1984, it has been the home of the Dharug and Lower Hawkesbury Historical Society Incorporated. This culminated in their purchase of the Chapel in 1986. Since then it has been used regularly for historical activities and it houses the Society's archives which document the history of the Lower Hawkesbury in written and pictorial form. It is therefore of local social significance.Cox 2003:18 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site would contain archaeological evidence of its operation as a Wesleyan Chapel. A Gosford Heritage Review conducted in 1997 records the two sandstone finials and the circular motif head and vent on the front facade as being unusual details. They could be of future research value. There is a large, single stone lintel and carved stone with date above the door also with research value. The Chapel also contains the archives of the D&LHHSI; which incorporate Wesleyan history as well as tapes and original research of the Lower Hawkesbury area including research into the pioneer families of the region. It is therefore of local research significance. As previously noted the adjacent amenities block has been assessed as of no historical, aesthetic, social or research significance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Gosford Heritage Review of 1997 in Evaluation of Significance adjudged the Chapel to be rare in terms of Historic, Aesthetic, and Social as far as the local area is concerned. Of particular note are the two stone finials and the stone block and date carved above the door. The Lower Hawkesbury Wesleyan Chapel is therefore a rare example of places of worship for the Wesleyans in the Lower Hawkesbury area in the nineteenth century. As the oldest intact usable stone chapel of this era in the area it is a rare example of its purpose. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It demonstrates the main characteristics of a religious chapel of its time.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The property known as Mulholland's Farm is situated in an area of two Crown land grants made in the late 1830s. The history of the land tenure is therefore complex, but does provide clear evidence for the forming of Mulholland's farm. =Henry Smyth's 640 acres= The first and larger of these is the 640 acres (Portion 174 of the Parish of Kincumber) granted to Major Henry Smyth on 13 September 1839. Smyth was a former Commandant of the penal colony of Port Macquarie. Smyth's grant had a substantial water frontage to Brisbane Water on its western boundary. Traversing Smyth's grant was the main public road between Gosford and Kincumber. This parish road (established at the request and maintenance of the inhabitants of the district) was surveyed in 1858. Smyth retained ownership of the grant until July 1847 when it was sold to Herbert Solway. Solway's ownership was relatively short; selling the property in October 1852 to John Stirling. Stirling mortgaged the property and in defaulting on his repayments the property was sold by his mortgagor, W. D. Nunn, to Richard Albert Watson in January 1881. Watson sold the property to Carl Ludwig Sahl and John Nobbs in October 1881. Green Point Estate Smyth's grant (and an additional area of 50 acres to the north granted to John Roby Hatfield) was subdivided by Carl Ludwig Sahl and John Nobbs in 1882 to form 67 allotments known as the \\"Green Point Estate\\" . John Nobbs (1845-1921) was the son of a noted early colonial gardener. Nobbs' background was as a conveyancer building up a lucrative practice in the Parramatta region, becoming the first mayor of the newly incorporated council of Granville in 1885. He was the founder and president of the Fruitgrowers' Union of New South Wales. The estate, surveyed and laid out by Dawson and Stephen, licensed surveyors, of 139 Pitt Street, Sydney, offered a range of allotments varying in size from 2 to 32 acres. All allotments had access to a reserved road of 100' width. A government wharf reserve was also established (adjacent Lot 6 of the estate) together with associated road access (now known as Lexington Parade). The reservation of all land within 100' of the high-water mark of Brisbane Water (probably established at the issue of the original Crown grants), was retained by the Crown. The estate was offered for sale on 20 June 1882 in the rooms of auctioneers Batt Rodd & Purves, 88 Pitt Street, Sydney. The auctioneer's description of the estate was as follows: > Gosford, Brisbane Water The Auctioneers confidently recommend this Estate to > Gentlemen in search of Blocks for Waterside Country Residences. The Scenery > is simply magnificent, and the nicely wooded hills, sloping gently down to > the placid Lake-like Broadwater of Gosford, afford unrivalled sites for > Building purposes. To those seeking Sporting Retreats no better opportunity > can offer, Fish and Game abundant. The Green Point Estate, in an area over > 1,000 acres, has been subdivided by Messrs, Dawson & Stephen in their usual > masterly style into large Blocks (not allotments) of from 2 to 32 aces each, > as per plan herein. Situate in the heart of the growing and fast improving > district of Brisbane Water (called with good reason the Rhine of New South > Wales), the inducements to buy are tempting. That the soil is rich is proved > by the fact that magnificent Tree ferns, Longalous Cabbage Trees, and every > variety of Mountain Bush Timber grow on the Estate in the utmost profusion, > while the land is splendidly timbered. As soon as the Great Northern Railway > between Sydney and Newcastle is finished, the value of this Property will > enormously enhanced. Steamers ply to and from Sydney daily, doing the trip > in little more than Three Hours. Water frontage lots, eminently adapted for > gentlemen with leisure time in search of healthful recreation. The Waters > abound with Fish and the Woods teem with Game. Farm lots. The soil being > rich, loamy, and well watered, Timber getters will find Forests of > Magnificent Trees admittedly suited for the requirements of the market, > either for Railway Sleepers or Sawn Planks.\\" Terms offered were 10% to be payable in 3 months with the balance payable in equal instalments at 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months from the day of sale at 6% interest. Looking north-west toward Brisbane Water Mulholland's farm house is located on Lot 1 (area of 3 acres 6 roods 1/2 perch) located at the south-west corner of the Smyth's grant. Lot 1 had a water frontage to Brisbane Water, set back by the foreshore reservation of 100', and was bounded by reserved roads on the north (now Elfin Hill Road) and east. While some lots were sold at the time of the auction in 1882, Lot 1 was purchased from Sahl and Nobbs in November 1891 by Charles Thomas Sandon and William Hume for ¬£96/8/11. Sandon later in the same month brought out Hume's interest and at the same time purchased the 100' reservation of land which separated Lot 1 from Brisbane Water. This area had been granted by purchase to Sahl and Nobbs in October 1890 after lobbying the government for rescission of the usual 100' high-water mark reservation. That reservation land became a functional part of the subsequent farm, and the boat shed, wharf, well, road and water pipeline were built on it. Sandon was a resident of Sydney, and a stationer by profession. The purchase was probably a speculative venture for in July, 1892, the property was sold to Eliza Sophia Winton, a widow residing in North Sydney, for ¬£150.20. Winton's ownership again appears to have been primarily as an investment, although in this instance the wisdom of her action may be open to question given that she sold the allotment for only ¬£50 in 1907 to Herbert Henry Thompson, a farmer, who was probably residing on the adjacent property to the south. =Henry Linden's 60 acres= The other Crown land grant was made to Henry Linden on 17 June 1840. Linden was a Sydney publican operating in the 1840s the Woolpack Inn in Sussex Street. This grant (Portion 75 of the Parish of Kincumber) comprised an area of 60 acres located to the south of Smyth's 640 acres. Linden's grant also had a water frontage, and included a frontage to the mouth of Egan Creek. An early name for Linden's grant was 'Linden's Flat'. Linden retained ownership of the grant throughout his life; it eventually being sold by his trustees in August 1878 to Francis McDonald, a Sydney grocer. A substantial portion (53a 3r Op) of Linden's 60 acre grant was retained until the late 1880s by Francis McDonald. McDonald' s interest or use of this property, if any, is not known to the authors. McDonald was a victim of the financial downturn of the 1890s, and in 1897 his real and personal estate was sequestrated.22 In July, 1900, McDonald's property at Green Point was sold by the official assignee, Lancelot Hadfield Lloyd, to Rosa Ellen Jane Mobbs, the wife of the Parramatta auctioneer George Henry Mobbs. Mobbs subsequently subdivided the 53 acres, with one allotment of 16 acres, bounded on the west by Brisbane Water, on the east by Egan Creek and on the north by the Green Point Estate, being purchased by Herbert Henry Thompson in December 1902. =Thompson's Ownership 1902-1909= Herbert Henry Thompson was described in the aforementioned title deed of 1902 as a farmer of Green Point. The 1903 edition of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll listed Thompson (born 1873 at Parramatta) as a resident of Green Point and an orchardist by profession. He lived with his wife Louisa (n√©e Phillips, married 1897 at Granville), but there were no children. The location of Thompson's residence within the 16 acres of Linden's grant during this period is not known to the authors. Thompson subsequently purchased in 1907 Lot 1 of the Green Point Estate. In so doing he created the parcel of land which became Mulholland's farm. In fact the existing farm house was built straddling both allotments, and so must date from after 1907. Both of these properties were consequently mortgaged to Mary Amelia Davies. Davies was probably from the prominent Gosford family which had settled in the area in the early l830s, and had undertaken shipbuilding on Brisbane Water for a number of years. In May 1909 Thompson sold both properties to George James Mulholland. =Mulholland's Farm 1909-1958= It is presently unclear as to whether Thompson constructed the farmhouse in the years 1907 to 1909 (from which time the two properties were under the same ownership) or if it was Mulholland. In the land title deed of May 1909 George J. Mulholland was described as being a resident of Woy Woy, but by the time of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll of 1909 (month of issue unfortunately not recorded) he was residing at Green Point with his (second) wife Cassie (or Cassy) Wilson. At the time of the 1909 purchase Mulholland was a relative newcomer to the Gosford area having come to the area from Wagga Wagga. In Wagga Wagga he had married Mary Macentyre in 1876 and the couple had the following children: William Thomas R (b. 1877), Cecilia Jane (b. 1879), John A. (b.1881), Mary A. (born 1887), and George J.V. (born 1884). The MacEntyre family were quite prominent in the development of the Wagga Wagga region as the wheat growing area it is today. William Macentyre, Mary's father, was an Irish emigrant who settled in Wagga Wagga in the mid 1850s. He and his sons were considered to have been industrious, progressive and successful farmers. During the 1870s William was also a justice of the peace and member of the local hospital committee, a director of the Wagga Wagga Sugar Co., and prominent in the Free Selectors' Association. The Mulholland family, who were also Irish emigrants, were from the same wheat growing area of Wagga Wagga as the Macentyres. George J. Mulholland's first wife died in Wagga Wagga in March 1906, and in the following year he remarried in Sydney to Cassie Wilson Boyle. Mulholland's stay at Green Point however was short lived, dying in December 1912. His widow however continued to reside at and farm the property until her death in 1952. By 1941 the farm consisted of house, cleared paddocks, wharf and shed, an irrigation system for orcharding (the feeder pipe, pump and holding tank for which survive) and a trolley track for loading produce (only fragments survive). In 1948 an oyster farm lease was issued under the Fisheries and Oyster Farms Act 1935. This is likely to have been a renewal. This legislation was administered by the Office of the Chief Secretary who was charged with protecting, developing and regulating the fisheries of the State within territorial waters. The lease was initially issued to Cassie Mulholland, but continually renewed through to 1964 and possibly later, by successive owners of the property. Oysters had been cultivated in the region for a considerable number of years. The Erina Shire Holiday and Touring Guide of 1928 noted that Brisbane Water was very prominent in this regard, with a well known reputation and steady sales of large volumes. A sign saying oyster lease survived on the wharf up to the 1980s (Hazelton). In July 1958 the properties (for they remained under different titles) were transferred to the benefactor under the will of Casey Wilson Mulholland, the Australasian Conference Association Ltd., which promptly disposed of the properties by sale in August 1958 to Gerald Robert and Lillian Bruce of Leura. Gerald was described in the land title deed as a Torres Strait Pilot. The Bruces appear not to have resided at the farm on a full-time basis, and may have used the premises as a weekender. =1960s Suburban Subdivision= In 1961 the Bruces subdivided and sold off a substantial part of the farm, reducing the area of the house to 1 acre 2 roods 10 3/4 perches which included the water frontage to Brisbane Water. A new reserved road, Pixie Avenue, was established as part of this subdivision. Shortly after the subdivision the property was sold to Ellen Jones in March, 1963. Jones retained ownership of the property until 1988 at which time it was sold to the current owners, Judith Ellen and John Ross Hazelton. Again it is not clear if Jones, at least initially, resided at the house on a full-time basis, or if the premises were used as a weekender. From this time the property was no longer farmed, and garden shrubs were planted in the cleared area. By 1970 the house was in a decayed state, and its internal linings and many doors were replaced as part of a major renovation. In the interim (1975) the high-water reservation of 100' depth was resumed by Gosford City Council and dedicated, together with other areas on Brisbane Water, as a public reserve. This reduced the land area associated with the house to 3154m2, and divorced the wharf and boatshed from the same land title as the house. This reduced area was placed under a Permanent Conservation Order in March 1984 under section 36 of the Heritage Act, 1977.  Description  The dwelling house is a single storey timber framed and weatherboard clad structure. The roof is a gable form clad in colorbond corrugated sheeting. The roof extends over an open verandah on the north, west and south elevations. There are two brick chimneys. At the rear of the house is an attached bathroom and kitchen wing. The verandah has a timber balustrade. The planning of the interior of the house comprises a wide central corridor flanked by the main living and sleeping rooms, with the aforementioned bathroom and kitchen wing located in the south-east corner. A motor vehicle garage is attached to this wing on the north side. At the front of the house is a concrete holding tank for water. This was used as part of an irrigation system. The sloping ground surrounding the house is mostly cleared of vegetation with plantings being mainly located along the boundary to Pixie Avenue and to the north of the house. Built within the grounds includes a water tank, Hills hoist, bird bath, septic tank and concrete entrance drive. None of these features are older than about thirty years. Landscaping in the form of plantings include Araucaria, Cedar, Citrus, Conifers, Cotoneaster, Elm, Eucalyptus, Frangipani, Hibiscus, Jacaranda, Loquat, Macadamia, Maple, Oleander and Privet the majority of which were planted in the 1960s.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Mulholland's Farm is the most intact surviving farm on Brisbane Water from the farm subdivision era of the 1880s to 1945. It includes a house (built ), wharf and boatshed, and possibly well, related to its farm use, and uniquely retains its historic setting on the foreshore of Brisbane Water.Clive Lucas Stapleton 1999: 31 Mulholland's Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The former farm, albeit subdivided, with its house and foreshore farm structures, is one of a small number of farms established from subdivisions of the 1880s to survive in the local area. In this instance it is Green Point Estate subdivision of 1885. The Place appears to retain, more than any other on Brisbane Water, its full visual setting and physical relationship with the water, farm structures, and a meaningful rural setting with key historic elements. The farm is one of a number of former farming properties in the local area associated with a pioneering family. In this instance it is the Mulholland family who owned the property from 1907 through to 1958. The house is one of two comparable examples identified in the Central Coast Heritage Study as an early farm residence associated with a coastal setting and wharf structure (the other is at Riley's Bay).Clive Lucas Stapleton 1999 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house is a good example of a large but very simple early twentieth century rural house. Its verandahed form and construction entirely conform to the tradition of rural house construction for the period such as in the use of weatherboard sheeting, gable form roof, and brick chimneys. The planning of the house is distinctive for its wide living hall, a particularly favoured feature of the Edwardian period. It is also well sited on a natural promontory. The place is probably unique for its age in the local area for the combination of its setting on the foreshore of Brisbane Water, age of construction, and integrity of fabric, external form and planning. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The house is one of a small number of former semi-rural residences that have been identified by the local community and council as being significant in illustrating the history of the Gosford/Wyong area. The place is one of a small number of properties in the local area which have been accorded a Permanent Conservation Order [now SHR-listing] by the NSW Heritage Council, and therefore recognised as being of State significance to the community of New South Wales. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The built fabric of the house and jetty/boatshed area may, upon archaeological investigation, reveal details about the former uses of the farm, which are not otherwise available through the historical record. In particular, substantial evidence of the irrigation system for the orchard and house is a source of information about farm technology. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The interior of the house including the verandahs, but excluding the garage; the setting of the house on the foreshore of Brisbane Water and orientation of the principal front elevation to the foreshore and jetty; and the boatshed and remnants of the former hardwood framed jetty which are a tangible association between the house and the use of Brisbane Water as a means of either transport, and/or economic activity such as oyster farming.

It was designed by John Verge. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Grange was built as part of the Wyoming farm complex of Frederick Hely, principal Superintendent of Convicts in the colony of New South Wales from 1825 to 1836. It was originally built as the estate's stables, but was later converted into a residence. The Grange is a long sandstone block structure built in 1836 with a short timber frame extension of recent vintage. The sandstone section was designed by John Verge in 1832. The stone construction is dry and the pit sawn cedar is mortised. The building was originally 100 meters long with four rooms and 7-10 stables of which only 3 survive. It is believed that dungeons were built below. The plan of the farmyard is extant and held by the Mitchell Library. Four rooms of the Grange correspond exactly to the plan, as does the stables area. The farmyard complex was never completed, perhaps due to the death of Hely in the year it was commenced. Frederick Hely was stationed in Sydney but hoped to retire to Brisbane Water (Gosford) where he secured a number of portions of land. By 1825 he had established a farm called Wyoming (Wyoming Cottage) on 340 acres later known as Portion 200, Parish of Gosford, County of Northumberland. With the advantages of wealth and position, Hely was able to engage John Verge to design a house and farmyard. He was also able to select as his assigned servants, two professional stonemasons to assist with the building. The foundation stone of the Grange carries the date 1836 and the names of the two masons, W. and A. Sidebottom. It is located within the building, having been repositioned when a porch was added to the northern side in 1944 by the then owner Harry Rolph. The name The Grange was given by yet another owner, Catherine Granger, who had title to the property between 1925 and 1939. The building is at present used as a house and has undergone substantial modification. Significance The former Stable on Renwick Street at Wyoming has significance for its association with Frederick Augustus Hely, the colony's Principal Superintendent of Convicts and early landowner in the north Gosford region, after whose farm \\"Wyoming\\" the area was named. It has rare regional historic and social significance as one of the first buildings on the Central Coast, associated with the early settlement of the region. It has rare state historic aesthetic significance as a design by the architect John Verge, and as an early convict-built structure. It is the second oldest building in the Central Coast. Although modified, its significance has not been reduced and is an important streetscape element.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Grange was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It was also added to the former Register of the National Estate on 22 June 1993.

He also attempted to rape and kill another high school student, but the attempt was halted.Ïñ¥Ïù¥ÏóÜÍ≥† Ìï¥Í¥¥Ìïú Î≤îÏ£Ñ \`ÏÇ¨Ïù¥ÏΩîÌå®Ïãú\`Ï°±Îì§!  Crimes  On October 25, 2000, the first victim was found by her best friend. Jung Hye-in, aged eleven, was found dead on a mountain about 150 meters away from the road on which she was last seen alive. A few days later, the autopsy confirmed that she had been strangled. Semen was found on the victim's body. On December 19, Kim, who was drunkenly hanging around, noticed a high school girl who was returning home alone, but she had a strange feeling and ran away. That same day, two siblings, a middle and a high school student who were returning home, went missing. After the two disappeared, the brother, 12-year-old Park Hong-sun, who was in the first grade of middle school, was found dead the next morning about 300 meters away from his house. His body was covered with a shawl, and a yellow item was wrapped around his neck. Five meters away, a woman's bra and panties, which were cut up with sharp tools, were found. The sister, 15-year-old Park Eun-mi was found on a mountain 500 meters away from her brother's body. Her skirt had been turned upside down over the chest, covering the face, and both hands and legs were strapped to a tree with a string and stockings. The left foot had all the stockings peeled off, and her right foot was buried in the ground, her uniform wide open, and she had gloves in her mouth. In addition, she had been stabbed with a knife in her neck, legs, chest and vagina, with 15cm and 20cm cuts on her thighs. Cut off parts were later found in a ditch right in front of Kim Hae-sun's house, parts of which he testified had been eaten. Fifty-six days after the first murder, the investigation team arrested Kim Hae-sun after the Park siblings were found dead.ÍΩÉÎã§Ïö¥ ÏÜåÎÖÄ ÌóàÎ≤ÖÏßÄ Î≤†Ïñ¥ Î®πÏùÄ 'Ïù∏Í∞Ñ Ìè¨ÏãùÏûê'  Trial and Sentence  On July 11, 2000, the Jeonju District Court sentenced Kim Hae-sun to death after he was convicted of rape and murder. Kim immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, but on September 27, 2001, the appeal was dismissed.  Profiling  Professor Pyo Chang-won classified him in his book \\"Korea's murders\\" as a \\"criminal psychopath\\". He also expressed regret that the police would have been able to prevent the other murders if they has been quick enough. The investigation was hard, as Kim refused to take a blood type test, and he was drunk immediately after the arrest, with the interrogating detective even having to wake him up. Also, to the detectives' surprise, he was able to remember the contents of a talk show he had watched on the day of the murder. According to Kim, he murdered the Parks not because they were children, but because the former crime was not reported to the media. = Kim's upbringing = He helped his father with farming, but did not know how to work properly due to mental illness and drinking alcohol from time to time. As a child, Kim Hae-sun was habitually hit by his father, being stripped of his clothes and hit with a belt. At one point, he was expelled from the house. Kim also said that he had never visited a public bath due to his wounds. As stress relief, he tortured cats and dogs. He began to have extremely violent tendencies, such as sickening his neighbor's cattle and killing them. At the age of 16, he was sent to a family court for a stolen item. At the age of 24, he was sentenced to one year in prison and two years probation for a violent crime. At the age of 26, he was sentenced to four years in prison and three years probation for raping a female pen pal. At the age of 27, he went to Busan and worked as a restaurant employee at the Yeonang fishing boats, where he learned how to use seamen's knots and was able to work with knives. Then, he gathered money working as a tea house employee in Busan before returning to his hometown in July 2000, three months before the murders.[ÌïúÍµ≠Ïùò Í≥ºÌïôÏàòÏÇ¨Í≥†Ï∞Ω Ïó∞ÏáÑÏÇ¥Ïù∏ ÏÇ¨Í±¥ -ÏùºÎ™Ö ÍπÄÌï¥ÏÑ† ÏÇ¨Í±¥]  See also  * Yoo Young-chul * Kang Ho-sun * Chijon family  References  1969 births Living people Male serial killers People from Gochang County South Korean cannibals South Korean criminals South Korean serial killers ","title":"Kim Hae-sun"},{"id":"58302995","text":"Kampong Limau Manis is a village in Pengkalan Batu, a mukim in Brunei-Muara District, Brunei.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History In 1917, number of prominent Flint business people formed the Civic Building Association to promote the construction of new housing in the crowded city. The Association purchased 400 acres of land, hired Boston landscape architect William Pitkin to lay out a neighborhood, and retained the New York firm of Davis, McGrath & Kiessling to develop house plans for the site. However, the Association's plans collapsed, due in part to shortages created by World War I. After the conclusion of the war, though, the housing shortage in Flint became even more acute as workers flocked to the booming automobile plants, primarily those of General Motors. recognizing that a shortage in housing limited their opportunity to grow, in February 1919 GM established the Modern Housing Corporation to provide housing for its workers. The Corporation purchased the land already set aside by the Civic Building Association, and almost immediately announced plans for development. They used the plans originally developed by Pitkin and the house designs by Davis, McGrath & Kiessling, and by April 1919 construction began. In five months, an entire neighborhood of over 600 homes were constructed. General Motors promoted the neighborhood to its employees, offering incentives for purchasing a pre-built home or for constructing a custom one. By January 1920, 950 homes were built within the neighborhood, and the houses were nearly completely filled by early spring. The economic downturn of 1920, and the cost overruns experienced in the construction of Civic Park, dissuaded GM from continuing with its home construction. However, in 1923, Modern Housing Corporation constructed a community center in the neighborhood as part of a deal worked out with the city of Flint. After that time development in the neighborhood was slow with only about 60 structures built over the next few decades, including the Civic Park Community School and two small commercial areas. Description The Civic Park Historic District contains about 1010 structures, of which 950 are original to the 1919-1920 construction period. The lots are generally 50 feet by 100 feet, and the houses are 1-1/2 and two-story bungalows of four to seven rooms in size. The exteriors of the houses are clad in brick, stucco, or wood. The original homes are primarily of 28 types designed by Davis, McGrath & Kiessling. About 80 of the original homes were constructed by GM employees using their own plans. These houses complement the others in size, color, texture, and overall appearance. Also included in the neighborhood is the 1923 Haskell Community Center, the Civic Park Community School, and two churches.

Most of the buildings in the area have an off- white or cream stucco exterior coating, with a small amount of brick houses. The Gloucester Arms, a Grade II listed pub, is at the centre of the area, along with various shops.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and removed from the list in 2020. History In 1896, William Willdanger, Robert Wisler, and Adam Ketterman established the Flint Brewing Company. They constructed this utilitarian building on Saginaw Street as a brewery and began an aggressive advertising campaign that won them a share of the local market. The brewery remained successful until 1915, when Genesee County voted to go dry. The Flint Brewing Company went bankrupt and the building closed. Later in 1915, a group of Methodists purchased the building and turned it into the Lakeside Methodist Episcopal Church, as a way of demonstrating religion's victory over alcohol. Within a few years the church moved out, and a trucking firm began using the building as warehouse space. By the mid-1920s, the Acetylene Welding Company and the Boyd Sign Factory were also using the building, and in 1928 the Flint Casket and Woodwork Company moved in. In the early 1930s, Genesee County repealed its prohibition ordinance, and in 1933 the Flint Hill Brewing Company purchased the building and refitted it to restart brewing beer. The company was successful, and in 1939, it was purchased by the White Seal Brewing Company. In 1949 White Seal was absorbed by Valley Brewing, who used the building until 1953, when larger conglomerates began taking over the local the beer market. The brewery remained vacant until 1965, when the Flint Automation company Machinery Manufacturers moved in. They left in 1971, and the brewery was again vacant until purchased by local developers in 1980. The building eventually burned, and what remained was demolished in 1992. Description The Flint Brewing Company Building was a brick structure, constructed in three distinct segments ranging from two to four stories in height. The northernmost segment was four stories in height and three bays wide on the side facade, with bowed-arch windows at the first floor, rectangular windows at the second, full arch windows at the third, and a pair of ocular windows on the top floor. The facade was detailed with brick and stone bandcourses above the first and third level, and an elaborate brick corniceline at the top of the building. The street-side facade was two bays wide with similar windows. The center section was three stories high and two bays wide, with bowed-arch windows on the first and second floors and rounded-arch windows on the third floor. The first section's brick and stone bandcourse above the first floor continued in this section, and the corniceline detailing was similar. The third section of the brewery was a two stories high and one bay wide with rectangular windows on each floor. This section also had a continuation of the first floor bandcourse and the ornamental corniceline. Three more additions, lower in height than the 1898 building, were constructed in 1928, 1934, and 1944.

It was designed by Francis Greenway, Standish Lawrence Harris, and James Barnet and built from 1820 to 1828. It is also known as Sydney Supreme Court House (Old Court House) and Old Court House. The property is owned by the Department of Justice and Attorney General, departments of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original Old Supreme Court House was designed by the colonial architect Francis Greenway under Governor Macquarie. Designed in 1819 and building began in 1820, Greenway was dismissed before the building was completed in 1828. The building was occupied by the Supreme Court in 1827. Additions were designed by Barnet in the 1860s. This building forms part of the centre axial group designed by Greenway with the Hyde Park Barracks and St James' Church that cover a historical period from 1801 to 1826, and 1851 to 1875.  Description  The Old Supreme Court building is a two-storey rectangular building which consists of the original Georgian building with an additional loggia and cornice added in 1868 which gives the building a Victorian Italianate appearance evident in the arched colonnade and raised parapet concealing the roof. Original Greenway elements include windows, fine detail, recessed wall panels, arches, cedar joinery, staircase and cupola.

The building has aesthetic significance as a design of Australia's first trained architect, Francis Greenway, and as a fine rare and largely intact, if modified, example of the Old Colonial Georgian style as used in a judicial building. The building as historic and social significance as part of the early colonial legal system and as part of Macquarie's vision for Sydney. The site is significant as the location chosen for Macquarie's first Georgian public School which was apparently modified during construction to accommodate the Supreme Court.

The process is aimed at filtering out non- jurisdictional cases and getting other formal defects such as computation of Court fees and stamping of instruments, annexing spot map to the Plaint etc, rectified before the case is taken up for final hearing. In a Judgment the Bombay High court has held that the trial court shall place such suits in objection category until the requirements of Order VII, rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure are complied. Similar direction have been imparted by Delhi High Court in its court rule file procedure. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana has also prescribed procedure and rules for examination of Plaint in part C of its \\"Practice in the Trial of Civil Suits\\".  Introduction  The process of Civil litigation, in Indian context, is regularized by the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure (India). The code is silent about any comprehensive procedure to be adopted for Plaint checking. However, there are various circulars issued by the High Courts concerned to regulate intervention of office in fault-finding process at different stages of the suit. The newly introduced e-courts filing process, at the entry point, devises a check list to make the scrutiny easier as well as uniform. Rule 22(b) of THE ANDHDRA PRADESH CIVIL RULES OF PRACTICE AND CIRCULAR ORDERS, 1990 of Andhra Pradesh High Court specifically states that upon presentation, the plaint shall be checked by the Chief Ministerial Officer of the court and it is registered only after the officer concerned finds it correct. The High Court of Delhi and Himachal Pradesha also display in their respective websites certain common objection points in each category of cases to facilitate timely removal of such defects. Even in matters of main cases filed in the Supreme Court of India, the case passes through the scrutiny assistant to ensure that the case is in conformity with the rules and procedure of the court and is not defective. The procedure further mandates that the petitions should be prepared as per the check list available on the Court website so that it does not linger as a defective one.  Points for Scrutiny  There being no hard and fast rule on the matter, the basic criteria regarding jurisdiction, subject wise maintainability, basics of drafting regarding Court-language, paper size and essential ingredients of pleading, limitation etc are some of the points for scrutiny. = Jurisdiction =  Territorial Jurisdiction  Territorial jurisdiction of the court divides the court on vertical basis. The suit/case must come under the territorial jurisdiction of the court trying the suit/case. The territorial jurisdiction of a court will be determined by the territory in which the subject matter related to the suit is situated in and the subject matter can be any property, immovable as well as movable.The place of suing is well defined in the chapter ‚ÄúPlace of suing‚Äù i.e. section 15 to 20 of CPC. Place of suing in other statues like the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act is governed under the relevant provisions of the Act.  Pecuniary Jurisdiction  Pecuniary jurisdiction of the court divides the court on vertical basis. The monetary limit i.e. the suit value which is triable by a particular class of civil court has been provided under the Orissa civil courts act. At present the pecuniary limit of suit value triable in the courts of Civil judge is limited to Rs.50,000/- whereas the courts of senior civil judge can try suits involving valuation exceeding Rs.50,000/- In respect of the appellate forum also the appeals arising out of the judgments of civil judge are filed before the Senior civil judge and the first appeal arising out of judgments of senior civil judge are filed before the District Judge.  Subject Jurisdiction  Original jurisdiction decides whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit/case of that nature on the basis of the statues. For example; suits under Hindu marriage act, irrespective of the suit value are triable in the Court of Senior civil Judge whereas suits under special marriage act are triable in the court of District Judge. = Valuation of suit & Computation of Court fee = Calculating the court fee payable in a suit/petition requires basic understanding of the court fees act and suits valuation act. The office note must verify the calculation of court fees payable keeping in view the Court fees (Orissa amendment) act and stamp duty payable on the documents in terms of the Indian Stamp(Orissa amendment) act. Applicability of Ad valorem/Fixed Court fee in a particular suit is to be assessed from the averement in the Plaint. = Limitation for filing suit/case = Limitation act prescribes the period of limitation for filing of a suit/case and procedure for computation of the period of limitation. As such, the office note should examine that whether the suit/case has been filed within the period of limitation as prescribed by the Limitation Act or other laws relevant for the purpose. = Insufficiently stamped/unstamped instruments = A duty is cast upon the Courts to scrutinize in order to ascertain whether the documents produced in connection with the proceeding are duly stamped, even if the defendant does not raise the objection.  Key Points in legal Drafting  Order VII of the CPC deals with plaint. The rules under this chapter define essential points for drafting a plaint in line with the provisions of CPC as well as other statutes under Indian law. The chapter deals with the essential points that a plaint ought to bear. In addition, some Courts devise their own check list to be followed by the litigants. The format of the pleading, as sometimes prescribed under relevant rules, is another aspect of scrutiny.  Limitations of Plaint Checking  Plaint checking is essentially a pre-admission scrutiny regarding defects visible from the drafting of the plaint. Although limitations of plaint checking is nowhere defined under the procedural law like Civil Procedure Code, the process being technical in nature, ought not creep into the legal issues involved in the suit. In other words plaint checking should not be doing the jobs of the defendant who is expected to bring out all such legal defects in the plaint and challenge the pleadings therein.

Mandates and functions The Interim Climate Change Committee is modeled after the United Kingdom's Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body that advises the UK Government on whether it is meeting its climate change mitigation goals. The purpose of the ICCC is to provide independent analysis on issues identified in the Government's \\"Terms of Reference\\" that will be passed to the Climate Change Commission. The Terms of Reference for the ICCC are: *How surrender obligations could best be arranged if agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions enter into the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, and *Planning for the transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2035. In addition, the ICCC will explore issues such as how to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity generation by 2035 and reducing New Zealand's carbon emissions under the terms of the Paris Agreement. It will consult with key stakeholders and hand over its research and analysis to an independent Climate Change Commission under the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill in May 2019. History and membership On 17 April 2018, the Minister for Climate Change Issues James Shaw announced the membership of the ICCC. The ICCC's Chair is Dr David Prentice, the CEO and Managing Director of Opus International Consultants Limited. Other members include: *Lisa Tumahai, Deputy Chair of the ICCC and Kaiwhakahaere of Te R≈´nanga o NgƒÅi Tahu *Dr Harry Clark, an agricultural greenhouse gas expert *Dr Keith Turner, formerly CEO of Meridian Energy *Dr Jan Wright, who used to be Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment *Dr Suzi Kerr, knows about economics of climate change policy and emissions trading. The ICCC officially came into existence on 1 May 2018. While the ICCC shares the same facilities as the Ministry for the Environment, it operates independently of the Ministry and has its own information management system. The opposition National Party's climate change spokesperson Todd Muller expressed support for the Committee but criticised Minister Shaw's position to look into agriculture when the science to reduce ruminant emissions had not yet been refined. He also expressed unease about increased taxation of farmers and regional New Zealand. The business lobby group Business New Zealand welcomed the formation of the ICCC. Meanwhile, the agricultural lobby groups DairyNZ and Federated Farmers also welcomed the establishment of the ICCC but stressed that the agricultural sector should not bear the full burden of any increased taxation or regulations.

The left hand side details the current layout and the right hand side the proposed layout as at November 2018. New sections of track are shown in red and sections of track to be dismantled are shown in green Werrington Dive Under (also known as the Werrington Grade Separation) is a replacement dual track grade separated railway junction at Werrington Junction north of railway station in Cambridgeshire, England. The junction leads to the Great Northern/Great Eastern Joint line (GN/GE) which goes through to and beyond. Due to be completed in 2021, the dive under will allow trains on the west side of the East Coast Main Line (ECML) to access the GN/GE line without conflicting with the faster passenger services on the ECML. The dive under will be constructed by a jacked deck on slide paths installed in access tunnels, a curved 'jack deck is pushed into place beneath the main running lines on the ECML. It will be the first use of a curved 'jack deck ' structure in the United Kingdom.The installation uses a patented method Current junction When the line closed between and Spalding in 1982,, freight traffic, instead of cutting across the western edge of the Fens, was diverted through Peterborough station. Trains therefore now have to use Werrington Junction for access to/from the GN/GE line. The junction is located north of Peterborough railway station. In order to use the junction, trains have to cross the lines used by the fast ECML passenger services on the level and in the case of trains to Spalding, also use the Up Fast line for 3 miles between Peterborough station and the junction. This can cause delay to fast passenger trains. Railtrack, Network Rail's predecessor, recognised that the ECML was congested and so upgraded the GN/GE line to accommodate the heavy container trains to and from the east coast ports. However Werrington Junction was still a significant bottleneck. Proposed junction In 2016, Network Rail submitted a Transport and Works Act Order (TWAO) to the Secretary of State for Transport to build either a flyover or a dive-under the fast lines north of Peterborough to allow passenger and freight trains to access all lines without impacting upon other faster services. In summer 2018, Chris Grayling approved the order after a public inquiry favoured the dive-under option over the flyover. Initially, costings were estimated to be in the region of ¬£100 million; but the agreed cost on approval was ¬£200 million. The project will see the construction of of new line that will run underneath the fast lines, culverting works on Marholm Brook and the movement of the lines westwards over the culverted brook. This will mean that trains for the GN/GE line no longer need to cross the fast lines on the level, nor use the Up Fast line between Peterborough station and the junction. The project, coupled with other ECML improvement schemes (such as the four tracking from to Woodwalton) will improve capacity on the line through Peterborough by 33% according to Network Rail. This equates to two extra train paths an hour by 2021, when the work is scheduled to be completed. In turn, this will remove 21 minutes from the fastest to service, and 13 minutes from the fastest King's Cross to service. It will also see an increase of 1,050 'intercity' seats per hour on express trains through Peterborough. The Spalding and Peterborough Transport Forum claimed that increasing the number of freight trains operating through Spalding would cause the level crossing barriers in the town to be down for 24 minutes of every hour. The Campaign for Better Transport praised the works and stated The construction will involve use of the UKs first curved box jack, which will consist of ten sections joined together, creating a curved box. The contractors expect to remove of earth and the box will weigh .

The original commercial center was south of the Shiawassee River, but after the Civil War, a building boom in the town established a new center at this location. By the 1880s, a number of new brick commercial buildings had been constructed along LeRoy Street. By the 1960s, however, shopping in downtown Fenton had dropped as consumers moved to nearby malls. In 1966, it was planned to demolish the downtown in the name of urban renewal. Some of the town instead advocated for historic preservation. After much debate, the buildings were demolished in 1975.

He began his murder series connected with thefts and rapes in Tehran in 1992. He was arrested, but escaped, before being arrested again in 1997 and executed for 9 murders. In court, he only confessed to a single case of car theft and stolen property, considering the murders to be personal work.  Biography  On December 1, 1965, Kurdieh was born in Faruj.The World's Most Deadly Killers - The Night Bats He got married in Tehran, but following a disturbance, separated from his wife and returned to North Khorasan. He was arrested in 1982 on robbery charges in Nishapur, and was subsequently detained for allegedly spying for Russia. Kurdieh eventually returned to Tehran, and this time he began his crimes. He was wearing a black dress and stole a taxi. After picking up young girls and women, he would drag them into the wilderness, where he would rape, assault and eventually kill them, burning the bodies afterwards. He was arrested several times, but repeatedly deceived the authorities by giving them different names. In 1992, after several young girls complained that two men had stolen their money and raped them, the police initiated extensive investigations, and after several days of pursuit, they arrested the two men after an armed conflict. The two men, Ali Karimi and Gholamreza Kurdieh, who at the time identified himself as \\"Murad Naderi\\", confessed to several cases of rape and armed robbery in interrogations.Great rallies in Iran Gholamreza Kurdieh fled the same year he went to court, but his friend Ali Karimi was hanged in March of that year.  Murders  * On April 13, 1997, with the discovery of a 54-year-old woman in front of Chitgar Park in Tehran, the police began their criminal investigation to discover the killer. * On April 16, 1997, a burning corpse was discovered in a garden in Karaj. The coroner diagnosed the cause of death as knife blows to the neck and chest, and that the burning was caused after death. The body belonged to a woman named A'diah. * On April 31, 1997, the burning body of a 43-year-old woman was discovered on the road in the construction site of Tehran's Farahzad. Forensics established the death as a result of a neck rupture. * On June 2, 1997, a burnt body was discovered in Tehran's Evin District. The cause of death according to the coroners were knife blows to the chest and neck. The victim was 24-year-old Elaha Hematinejad, who went to a hospital in Chamran to see her sister, and died the same night she returned home. * In May 1997, Tehran policemen discovered two burned bodies on the Bakeri Expressway. According to the coroner, the victims were killed prior to being burned. The older victim, Azam Sabtnzhad, was stabbed 27 times, while the younger, her daughter Munira Qhvhchy, had been strangled. * On June 14, 1997, the burned corpse of a female student was discovered in West Tehran. The hands and feet of the victim were broken and the cause of death was burning.

After his transfer, it was revealed that he had killed the girls and young women. At first, the real identity of Kurdieh was not clear, and because of this, he referred to by his nickname in the press. The police chief of Tehran announced on a Tehran TV broadcast that, according to him, the killer was an Afghani citizen, due to the large number of Afghani thugs who tortured victims in Iran.The Night Bat; the terrible summer of 1997 However, when Kurdieh's picture was published in the newspapers, a relative of his, Gholamreza Khosro, provided a birth certificate to the Iranian newspaper, identifying his relative as the Night Bat. Kurdieh never confessed to the murders, and emphasized at all stages of interrogation, trial and even television interviews that his accomplice, Hamid Rasuli, killed the women. Meanwhile, Hamid Rasuli, the Interior Ministry's intelligence chief, was sentenced to death for serial murder and issuing orders for two executions of Mr. Dariush Forouhar and Ms. Majdas Kandari. It is likely that Rasuli might have been the Night Bat's accomplice.  Trial  He was tried by the Tehran General Court in two trial sessions at Imam Khomeini's Judiciary Complex. His trial was one of the most controversial lawsuits in Iran's history, which severely affected the people. He was charged with 9 murders, attempted murder of his youngest niece by placing him in the drawer, escape from the authorities, theft and rape. All stages of the trial, except for the consideration of his actions, were held publicly.  Execution  On August 22, 1997, he walked down the canopy while writing on the paper: \\"I am not indebted to anyone, and I am not a creditor and I ask forgiveness for all.\\" And when he received 214 lashes, Kurdieh was hanged in a warehouse near the Azadi Stadium.

The old castle stood on a natural rise overlooking the Lugar Water, built and held for many years by the Craufurd family. For consistency the spelling Craufurd will be used throughout and Lefnoreis for the castle. History Lefnoreis is recorded as being the most important of the three castles in the parish of Old Cumnock, the other two being Borland Castle and Terringzean Castle. One recorded suggestion in regard of the occupied castle or fortified mansion is that two castles existed, one near the present day stables that was occupied until Dumfries House was built with its foundations still evident in 1885 and another that stood elsewhere on the estate that was abandoned before 1635 and of which no remains survive. =The spelling of the placename= The name of the fortification is commonly recorded as variations of both Lefnoreis and Lochnorris with the former version more widely used on maps and many other variations in spelling and title, such as the Ward of Lefnorris, Tower of Lefnoreis, Lefnoreise, Ward of Lochnoris, Lochnoreis, Tower of Leifnorris, Liffnoris, Leifnoreis and Lefnoryis. It is recorded on old maps as Lesno in the mid 17th century, Castle of Lesno in 1654, Lesnoris in 1685 and finally as Lissnorris in 1747-1755. It is also recorded as Craufurdstoun as is the near by Terringzean Castle. Considerable confusion has arisen in the writing of the castle's name arising from the use of the Long s to represent a lower case s in documents until around 1800 in printed documents and well into the 19th century for written documents. The convention previously being to use a letter similar to an elongated f, leading to a lower case s being easily and often confused and interpreted as an f. On the above mentioned maps this led to Lissnorris for example apparently having the spelling Liffnorris. An actual f had a short horizontal stroke to differentiate it. The intended pronunciation of the name might therefore be closer to Lesnories. =Ward= It is unusual for the term Ward to be applied to a fortification's name. In Scottish Law a Ward is \\"..the oldest form of feudal land tenure, viz. by military service, with various attendant rights and obligations, esp. that of the superior to uphold and draw the rents of the lands of a deceased vassal while the heir was uninfeft or remained a minor, as an equivalent for the loss of military services during such period, the usage being termed simple ward. Later commutation was admitted for a monetary payment in lieu of the drawing of rents.\\" This implies that the use of the name Ward only applied to periods in which the male heir was a minor, etc. Description of the castle and lands The 1671 Lefnoreis dovecote on the estate pre-dates Dumfries House. Paterson records that Lefnoreis was a tower known as the 'Ward'. Lord Bute in 1897 carried out extensive excavations at the castle's site and discovered part of the walls of a fortification of considerable strength and also a causeway composed using water-worn stones. In 1885 the foundations had still been visible above ground, the building being demolished circa 1759. The old Lefnoreis walled garden stood near the recently restored Lady's Well (2018) that drains into the Lugar Water. The 1671 dated dovecote at Dumfries House (NS 53951 20350) is the oldest dated building on the estate and is contemporary with Lefnoreis Castle. Another date of 1851 implies a restoration date. The armorial panel above the doorway is of the McDoualls of Freugh who in 1720 married into the Crichton family. To the west of the castle site and close to the site of the old Lefnoreis walled garden lies the recently restored Lady's Well (2018) that drains into the Lugar Water. 1756 is the first date recorded for the well although the well's name suggests a pre- reformation date that would make it contemporary with Leifnorris Castle. Until 1944 the well designed by Robert Adam stood as a small square structure with four arched openings and a pyramidal roof. The Craufurds also held lands in Ochiltree and Dalmellington. The lands of Blackettle and Beauch were part of the lands of Lefnoreis. The Lairds of Lefnoreis The site of the Lefnoreis Tower from near Dumfries House stables. Arms of the Craufurds of Lefnoreis:Gules, a fess ermine, in chief two stars or. The first recorded lairds of Lefnoreis were the Craufurds in 1440, a branch of the Craufurd family of Loudoun Castle near Galston. The estate belonged to the family until 1635 when it was purchased by William, 2nd Earl of Dumfries. His heiress, Penelope, married the second son of the 1st Earl of Stair and the Dumfries title passed into the Dalrymple family. The Crichton-Stuarts, Marquesses of Bute inherited Dumfries House and estate. The coat of arms of the Craufurds of Lefnoreis was \\"Gules, a Fess Ermine, and in Chief, two Stars. Or.\\" This translates from heraldic terminology as a shield with a red background with a band of ermine running horizontally across and two gold stars above the horizontal band. Historical incidents William Craufurd in 1510 was involved in the taking back of Loch Doon Castle from the Kennedy Clan. In 1512 the same William was involved in the murder of the laird of Corsintoune (sic) at Cumnock Church. This may refer to Coursington near Motherwell. In 1527 George Craufurd accompanied the Campbells of Loudoun in the ambush that led to the death of the Earl of Cassillis at Prestwick. In 1544 John Knox records that George Craufurd of Lefnoreis opposed the Scottish Protestant Reformation and joined the Bishop of Glasgow in attempting to prevent George Wishart, later a Protestant martyr, from preaching in Ayr. In doing so he stood against the Earl of Glencairn's and his supporters. In 1566 Knox records that the new Craufurd laird was a supporter of Protestantism. In 1550 Agnes Craufurd, the Lady of Lefnoreis, was abducted and carried away for some time by fellow Craufurds. It seems that her husband had died without an heir and following the abduction a George Craufurd inherited the lands and castle. Loch Doon Castle was taken from the Kennedy Clan by William Craufurd of Lefnoreis. In 1578 George Craufurd of Lefnoreis was fined ¬£2000 for allowing James Elliot, an infamous border's reiver, to escape from his custody at the castle. In 1609 another George Craufurd of Lefnoreis was imprisoned in Blackness Castle for bearing arms and assisting fugitives. In 1560 and 1572 George Craufurd sat in the Scottish parliament and in 1589 William Craufurd was appointed as a commissioner to ensure that all Jesuits were to leave the country for a month. In 1606 two servants of George Craufurd of Lefnoreis, George and Andrew McCubene, claimed that John and George Hervie of Skellingtoun Mill attacked them at the Cumnock Market, putting them in fear of their lives. The court took the view that the McCubenes were the aggressors even though the McCubenes had suffered physical injuries during the affray. In 1608 the Privy Council of Scotland issued an order that the Cunninghames of Caprington, Dalkeith and Auchincors were not to meet at Cumnock Church as violence was foreseen. The families were in dispute and elsewhere murders had taken place on the sabbath at churches. William Cunninghame of Caprington and his son and the laird of Lefnoreis and his son were to refrain from meeting with their men at the church or suffer a large fine, the order remaining in force until 1 April 1609. Dumfries House William Dalrymple, 5th Earl of Dumfries, was responsible for commissioning John, Robert and James Adam to design and build Dumfries House between 1754‚Äì59, the old castle then being abandoned and the stone removed.

The mill is on an island in the River Gade, which forms part of the Grand Union Canal. It is the oldest mechanical paper mill in the world. History There are no surviving records documenting when a mill was first built on the current site, but it is recorded as being a corn mill in 1086 in the Domesday Book. In 1289, the mill was used for fulling, removing oil and other impurities from cloth and textiles. It then became a fulling mill once more, then finally it become a paper mill by 1774. The world's first mechanised paper machine was installed at Frogmore Mill in 1803 funded by Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier and engineered by Bryan Donkin, based upon the idea by Louis Nicholas Robert. This machine allowed continuous automated production of paper rolls. Unfortunately the ¬£60,000 costs of the paper machine meant that the Fourdrinier brothers were bankrupted by 1810. For most of the 19th century, the mill was owned by the Grand Junction Canal, predecessor of the Grand Union Canal. In 1851, the chemical production of paper from wood (now known as soda pulp), used in newspapers, began at the mill. From 1853 to 1887 the mill was linked to Two Waters Mill, also near Hemel Hempstead. In 1890, the British Paper Company was founded and took over operations at the mill; it fully purchased the premises in 1929. The mill is now run by The Apsley Paper Trail, a charitable organisation, and operated as a visitor, education and community use centre. Eleven full-time staff are employed at the mill. It has been used for various theatrical productions, including the rock musical Rent.

On the morning of 10 August 1998, 11-year-old Nicky Verstappen disappeared from a summer camp he was attending in Brunssum, Limburg. His body was found on the evening of 11 August, away in Landgraaf, and a murder investigation was subsequently launched. Despite extensive investigation, the case remained unsolved for over twenty years. Joseph Theresia Johannes \\"Jos\\" Brech (born 29 October 1962) is currently standing trial for the killing of Verstappen, with the verdict expected in November 2020. He was arrested on 26 August 2018 in Spain after DNA from his belongings and relatives matched samples taken from Verstappen's clothing, following the largest DNA-harvesting operation in Dutch history.  Disappearance and body discovery  On Saturday, 8 August 1998, Verstappen and 36 other children took the bus from Heibloem to Brunssum to take part in a children's summer camp being held on the De Heikop camping grounds on the Brunssummerheide. Verstappen was last seen alive around 5:30 a.m. on 10 August by a tentmate; later that morning, he was no longer in his sleeping bag; only his shoes were still in the tent. On 11 August, police and volunteers conducted a search for the boy; at 9 p.m., his body, naked from the waist up, was found in a pine grove on the Schinvelderweg in Landgraaf, from the camp. The body showed signs of possible sexual abuse, but the post-mortem did not determine the cause of death, and an initial examination for foreign DNA yielded nothing. A tissue and cigarette with human DNA were found near where the body was discovered; from this DNA a complete profile was compiled.  Investigation  Joos Barten, the founder of the camp Verstappen disappeared from, was questioned extensively by police in the days following. A former headmaster of the local primary school in Heibloem, Barten had had convictions for child sexual abuse and admitted to being near the tent Verstappen slept in at 6 a.m. on 10 August. During the search for Verstappen, he pointed several times in the direction where the body was eventually discovered. A 15-year-old girl who had attended the teenagers' camp on De Heikop a few days earlier suspected that she had been sexually abused by Barten in her sleep. None of the camp staff were officially held as suspects. A reward of 25,000 guilders was offered by the Openbaar Ministerie in Maastricht for information on the identity of the perpetrator; this offer was doubled in 1999 with money raised by crime reporter Peter R. de Vries, who became a spokesperson for Verstappen's family. Following a lack of leads, the investigation team was dissolved in November 1998, with a new team of investigators taking over the case between November 2000 and July 2001. Between 2001 and 2007, a sex offender from Kerkrade was in and out of police custody while a number of witnesses claimed to have seen him in and around the camp around 10 August 1998; the sex offender died in August 2007. The case has also been linked to German serial killer Martin Ney, who killed three boys between 1992 and 2001. Seven or eight letters written by an anonymous author suggesting they had killed Verstappen were found on a monument for the boy on the Brunssummerheide between 2005 and July 2006. In January 2007, a 36-year- old man from Landgraaf was arrested on suspicion of having written the letters. He was released two weeks later, before being re-arrested in December for vandalising the monument. One month later, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for the vandalism. The monument was vandalised again in April 2008, August 2013 and April 2019. = DNA profiling = Between December 1999 and January 2000, 35 men took part in a DNA test, but none of the samples matched those found at the crime scene. In 2010, with foreign DNA having been found on Verstappen's body, police took DNA samples from 80 men, but still did not find a matching sample. In November of that year, the remains of Joos Barten, the camp founder, who died in 2003, were exhumed for a DNA test. His DNA also did not match that found on Verstappen's body. In January 2018, it was announced that 21,500 men in the Limburg province would be asked to give samples of their DNA in an attempt to trace Verstappen's killer. The DNA- screening program took place between February and June, with a total of over 15,000 samples collected‚Äîthe largest number in Dutch history, almost twice the number of samples collected in the program that successfully traced the man who was convicted of Marianne Vaatstra's murder. On 22 August 2018, it was announced that DNA samples from the belongings and relatives of a 55-year-old man originally from Simpelveld, Joseph Theresia Johannes \\"Jos\\" Brech, matched DNA found on Verstappen's clothing. Brech, who had been missing from his Vosges home since April of that year, had not responded to requests for a sample of his DNA and his immediate family also refused to cooperate in the DNA-screening program. A police team managed to retrieve a sample of Brech's DNA from his personal items after he was reported missing. Brech has a history of sexually abusing children and is known to have been near the scene of the crime around the time it took place, though he was believed at the time to just be a passer-by. Police located and arrested him in Spain, near Castellter√ßol, on 26 August, and he was extradited to the Netherlands on 6 September.  Trial  The trial began on 28 September 2020 and lasted three weeks. Brech pleaded not guilty on all of the accusations. In a pre-recorded video message played in court, Brech said that on 11 August 1998‚Äîhours before Verstappen's body was found by the search party‚Äîhe was walking close to the edge of a forest when he \\"saw something in the distance\\" and went to look out of curiosity, finding the body. He said that his DNA was found on the body because he had checked for signs of life, brushed leaves off the body and then left without any other action because of his previous convictions. In total, 27 traces of Brech's DNA had been found on the body, including on the boy's underwear; Brech said he had \\"no idea\\" how his DNA ended up on the underwear. The prosecution contested Brech's assertions, referencing a photograph taken of the location of where the body was found in a pine grove and a screenshot from a video of the location Brech said he was standing when he \\"saw something\\". According to the prosecution, it would not have been possible for Brech to have seen Verstappen's body lying behind a chain-link fence and obscured from view by trees. Brech's lawyer argued that Brech had said in his video message that he \\"saw something\\"‚Äînot clarifying whether it was the body‚Äîfrom where he was standing that drew his attention to the pine grove. A forensic pathologist who had reviewed the post-mortem could not ascertain whether the injury to Verstappen's body was caused by sexual abuse, due to the poor quality of the photographs and the fact that the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem had since died. The prosecution deemed Brech's assertions to be \\"wafer-thin and unbelievable\\", saying that they believed him to be guilty of the kidnapping, sexual abuse and aggravated manslaughter of Verstappen, and that although the medical cause of death was not determined, the boy's death could not have been the result of anything other than a criminal act, as he was healthy and had no genetic disorder. According to them, evidence at the crime scene indicated Verstappen died at the same location his body was found. On 8 October, the prosecution requested a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment and compulsory treatment (or 18 years' imprisonment if the court decides not to impose compulsory treatment) for Brech for the kidnapping, sexual abuse and manslaughter of Verstappen, as well as for possession of child pornography. The verdict is expected on 20 November.  Aftermath  In 2003, folk band Rowwen H√®ze released a song about the case, titled \\"Vlinder\\" (). Author Simon Vuyk published a book about the case titled De mysterieuze dood van Nicky Verstappen () in 2010.

In 1857, Count Pierre de Lavalette bought the hotel and with architect Jules Gros transformed it into a Baroque Italo-Spanish pastiche, doubling the size of the right wing with sculpted decoration. At the end of 1872, rue de Turenne, some priests from the Oratory began to educate youth. However, it was only from 10 October 1877 that the √©cole Massillon began.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built from 1895 to 1896. It is also known as Sydney Supreme Court House (Banco Court), St James Law Courts and King Street Courts. The property is owned by the Department of Justice, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The historic Banco Court building is not the current Banco Court (i.e. the large courtroom where the judges of the court can sit en banc) of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Since the construction of the Law Courts Building on Queen's Square nearby, the Banco Court has been located on level 13 of that building. The modern Banco Court is used for full court sittings, as well as ceremonies.  History  The Banco Court building now forms part of the Supreme Court House group. It was designed by the Government Architect W. L. Vernon and built in 1895‚Äì96. The building was awarded the 2004 Energy Australia National Trust Heritage Award.  Description  The Banco Court is a Federation Free Classical building with Baroque influenced decoration evident in the intricate sandstone carving around the window and building entrances. Interiors feature intact elaborate plasterwork and cedar joinery. This building relates well in design and siting to the neighbouring St James' Church. The Banco Court is constructed in face red brick which has contrasting sandstone detailing and trim. Interior materials include cedar joinery and plastework.r The building is in good condition.  Heritage listing  As at 11 January 2001, the Sydney Supreme Court building (Banco Court) located at the rear of the Old Registry building facing St James Road has historic significance as part of the Supreme Court complex. The building has aesthetic significance as a fine and largely intact example of an early twentieth century building in the Federation Free Style, and as the only courthouse in the city constructed in this style. The building makes an important contribution to the character of the immediate area, and with its small town scale blends well with the older buildings in the complex. The building has historic and social significance as part of the site. The site is significant as the location chosen for Macquarie's first Georgian Public School which was modified during construction to accommodate the first New South Wales Supreme Court building. Representative of the style as used in a courthouse building and the quality of the interior detailing is representative of the importance given to judicial buildings at the turn of the century.Peddle Thorp & Walker Pty Ltd, January 1998 The Banco Court, Sydney Supreme Court House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Purpose  The system was designed to warn soldiers and civilians of airborne threats, such as chemical attacks or toxic spills. The purpose of L-REAC was to provide wind monitoring and modeling, which acted as a decision aid for soldiers facing environmental hazards.  History  A research meteorologist at ARL developed the first L-REAC prototype. After conducting a survey of commercially available technology from 2003‚Äì2007, ARL identified a need for a local atmospheric assessment system. Three studies conducted at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, in the early 2000s revealed a requirement for emergency first responders to have up-to-date atmospheric information on local conditions. During the mid 2000s, it was also reported that U.S. Army soldiers stationed in Iraq were experiencing toxic fumes while working near burn pits. The L-REAC concept was produced from 2009-2011 at White Sands Missile Range as part of a study investigating the airflow around an urban building and small building clusters. In June 2017, ARL licensed the technology to Diamond B Technology Solutions in Billings, Montana. Rebranded as LR-x, the system assisted in tracking environmental emergencies, such as wildfire smoke during fire suppression efforts.  Operation  The L-REAC provided 3D weather models that generated wind field and plume outputs, displaying near real-time meteorological data on a map background. The models included terrain and buildings, and displayed danger zones and weather conditions (i.e. wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and relative humidity).

Subsequently, the father of the girl came to his house and began to fight him, and because of this incident a police report was written. The girl's family refused to move forward with charges, however. After this incident, Esmail's first wife decided to separate from him.  Previous murders  Esmail confessed to three murders. In 2012, a woman went missing, and he was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and spent two weeks in custody, but since no reason for the murder could be obtained, he was freed; however, Esmail confessed to killing the woman after his final arrest. In 2014, a corpse was discovered whose killer was not found. After the murder of Atena and subsequent investigation, Esmail's car was inspected, with him confessing to the murder.Atena's killer is also the killer of two other women  Murder of Atena Aslani  Atena Aslani was a 7-year-old Iranian girl from Parsabad who was killed by Esmail Jafarzadeh on June 28, 2017. The Attorney General of Parsabad said: \\"Atena went away from her father's dyeing shop to a nearby shop. The shopkeeper was a 42-year-old man who had known Atena and her father for a long time.\\" Also, according to the Ardabil prosecutor, his motive was sexual harassment. Esmail Jafarzadeh said in his confession: \\"For two or three days I was tempted to see Atena. On the day of the incident I came to my shop to take water and because nobody was there, I went to her. I wanted her to help me out, but she began to shout. So I put my hand on her mouth, and when I came to my senses she did not breathe anymore. I was scared and took the body to the parking lot, where I hid it in a barrel. I fled to my room, but a few days later I was arrested as a suspect and my secret was revealed.\\"  Arrest and disclosure of murders  By examining CCTV footage it was determined that Atena's killer disappeared in the range of the shops, but the moment of his arrival was not registered on any camera. At that time, Esmail was arrested as a suspect and sent to prison for interrogation. His house was inspected, but the police were not aware of the body hidden in the parking lot. According to the killer's brother, Jafarzadeh called his wife while he was in prison and asked her to go to the parking lot and find the barrel.

According to The Secret History of the Mongols, his was physically weak when he was born and his father Inanch Bilge did not believe his son would survive to adulthood, therefore he was also called Torluq Tayang (Weak Tayang).The Secret History of the Mongols, ¬ß188  Reign  He succeeded his father sometime around 1200. He married to his own stepmother G√ºrbesu in a levirate marriage. His elder brother was Buyruq khan. His horde was living around the shores of the Black Irtysh. In 1200, he helped a brother of Toghrul, a Kerait prince Jaqa Gambu (also known as Kereyidei), who fled to Tayang khan. After a defeat in 1203 by Genghis khan, Toghrul escaped to Naiman territories. A Naiman patrol named Qori S√ºbeƒçi did not recognize him and executed him on the spot. When Tayang was presented with the head of Toghrul, he stepped on it, crushing it. Seeing the once powerful Toghrul's defeat, he decided to act against Genghis first against council of his khatun G√ºrbesu and general Sabraq. In 1203, he tried to reach Alaqush Tegin of Ongud, a fellow Nestorian lord ruling north of Shanxi to march on Genghis together. However Alaqush informed Genghis beforehand of Tayang's march. The armies first met on 17 May 1204 in the Khangai Mountains. Naiman patrols defeated a vanguard of Genghis' army. Genghis with a much lesser army, ordered all of his men to light five campfires per men around the tent. Naiman patrols investigated the large number of fires and informed Tayang. Tayang consulted his son Kuchlug about the next step, advising a retreat and a guerrilla war. Kuchlug however spoke arrogantly, insulted Tayang and accused him of being a coward. An angered Tayang marched and crossed the Orkhon river the next day, where he was joined by the forces of Jamukha, Toktoqa (chief of Merkids) and Quduqa (chief of Oirats). However, he soon retreated again upon seeing Jebe, Subutai, Khubilai and Jelme. Seeing his hesitation, Jamukha left the Naimans. Later the Naimans with fewer numbers were ambushed at night by Genghis. Tayang himself was killed whilst attempting to escape.  Aftermath  His wife Juerbiesu was captured by Genghis and made to be Genghis' wife, while his son Kuchlug escaped to Buyruq khan, Tayang's brother.

In the late 1400s ‚Äî early 1500s, the Principality of Odoyev was torn between the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Moscow. Odoyev went through multiple attacks from the Tatars: 1422, 1423, 1512, and 1562. In 1494, under the treaty between Moscow and Lithuania, the Principality of Odoyev became vassal to Moscow. In the early 1500s, Vasily III of Russia freed Odoyev of the Crimean tribute. Since that time the Princes of Odoyev served at the Moscow court as boyars. Odoyev started to decline. A view of the Anastasovo Monastery In the 16th century Odoyev was a typical stronghold on the southern frontier of Muscovy, when Ivan the Terrible took the town over from the House of Odoyev.http://www.odoev-museum.ru/cat/odoevskiy_kray/odoev/ But as early as in 1645, Odoyev was neglected, the towers of the fortress lost their roofs, the bridge had decayed, while the water well was empty. In the first half of the 18th century Odoyev was part of the Kiev, Smoleynsk and Moscow Governorates, up until 1777, when it ended up in Tula Governorate. In 1777 Catherine the Great confirmed a coat-of-arms for the town, which was based on the coat-of- arms of Chernigov. In 1779 Catherine the Great confirmed the general city plan for Odoyev. By the early 1800s, the population of Odoyev was two thousand; the town had seven churches, seven taverns, and six plants, while in 1838 the first girls' boarding school in Tula Governorate was opened here. During the 1800s Odoyev was a trading town using the navigation on the Upa river. Then Odoyev had a racetrack holding regular horse races. Odoyev was famed for its gardens; almost every resident of the town owned one and it was covered in vegetation. The legend has it that the pastila from Antonovka apples from Odoyev was served at the dinner of Ivan the Terrible. The Church of the Holy Trinity In the early 16th century Princes of Vorotynsk built the Monastery of the Nativity of the Holy Mother, closed down in the 1700s and ruined in the Soviet times. Now its successor is the Anastasovo Monastery, located in the village of Anastasovo, near Odoyev. By the late 1800s, Odoyev had had six churches, but now only one is surviving, i.e. the Church of the Holy Trinity. In 1842 the local gentry initiated the opening of an amateur philanthropy theater. In 1912 there was founded an amateur wind band that still exists. In 1919 a musical school was founded in the town. In 1926 Odoyev was made a rural settlement, and in 1959 ‚Äî a 'workers' settlement' (radochiy posyolok).–ú–∞–∫–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –¢. –ê. –≠–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º—É–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–ø–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –û–¥–æ–µ–≤ // –ù–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–ö–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ç¬ª. ‚Äì 2016. ‚Äì –¢. 6. ‚Äì –°. 176‚Äì180. ‚Äì URL: http://e-koncept.ru/2016/56071.htm Now Odoyev is listed with the heritage settlements of Russia.

It was designed by Government Architect Alexander Dawson and James Barnet and built from 1859 to 1862. It is also known as Sydney Supreme Court House. The property is owned by the Department of Justice, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  This building which now forms part of the Supreme Court House was originally designed by the Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson in 1859 for use as a Registry Office. It was occupied in 1860 by the Registrar General. Janes Barnet, the following Colonial Architect, designed two additions in 1875 and 1886 including a matching wing on the southeast corner. The building was completed from 1851 - 1875, and 1876 - 1900.  Description  This building which now forms part of the Supreme Court House Group is symmetrically designed in the Victorian Tudor style. Typical stylistic features include banded chimneys, narrow grouped windows set under projecting gable bays, a castellated parapet at the roofline and quoin detailing. There were two later SE wing additions constructed in brick and staircase. The later wing is of lesser architectural merit though sympathetic in design. The original building is constructed in smooth dressed sandstone blocks with a slate hipped and gabled roof. The boundary iron palisade fence sits on a stone plinth. = Condition = As at 30 October 2000, the building was in a good condition. Modifications and additions were completed to the southeast wing in 1875 and 1886. World War II bomb shelters and twentieth-century additions were also made.  Heritage listing  As at 18 September 2007, the Sydney Supreme Court House (Old Registry Office) located at the corner of Elizabeth Street and St James Road has historic significance as part of the Supreme Court complex. The building has aesthetic significance as a design of the Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson and is one of only two Government buildings which were designed in the Victorian Free Gothic style, the other is the Lands Titles Office in Prince Albert Road. Externally the Old Registry office is a fine, rare, largely intact, if modified, example of the style as used in a Government building. The building makes an important contribution to the character of the immediate area with its small scale and simple facade treatment. The building has historic and social significance as part of the Government administrative and legal systems.

As a militia leader he helped defeat the indigenous Caribs and established full French control over the island. Family Fran√ßois Rolle de Laubi√®re was born around 1617, His parents were Jean Rolle, Sieur De Goursolas (died 3 July 1636), deputy prosecutor of the jurisdiction of Firbeix, and Marie de Lafon. His father became a king's judge at Courbefy, Haute-Vienne. His mother was the daughter of a notary. One of his brothers was M√©deric Rolle de Gourselas (‚Äì1664). He married Marie Elisabeth Beaujeu De La Haye, then married Fran√ßoise Dyel Du Parquet. Martinique =Du Parquet Property= Fran√ßois and M√©deric Rolle (Laubi√®re and Gourselas) arrived in Martinique in 1644 with Constant d'Aubign√©. The governor of Martinique, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, appointed Gourselas Lieutenant General of the island on 22 November 1653. Du Parquet died in Saint-Pierre on 3 January 1658 aged 52. After his death his wife Marie Bonnard du Parquet took charge of the island as regent in the name of her oldest son, Dyel d'Esnambuc. Laubi√®re, who had married du Parquet's cousin, was appointed guardian of his children. A struggle began between two factions on the island, the Parisians led by Maubray and the Normans led by Plainville. Plainville was named procureur-syndic on 22 July 1658. While Maubray was absent in Antigua, Plainville arrested and imprisoned Mme du Parquet. After Mme du Parquet agreed to renounce the government, she was freed and restored to her property. Gourselas became in effect governor. In September 1658 Gourselas formed a force of 600 militiamen to eliminate the last Island Caribs from the northern Capesterre region of the island. 200 were carried by sea in five ships under Laubi√®re, 200 advanced by land around Mount Pel√©e and 200 by Morne des Gommiers. The Caribs were soon defeated by the overwhelming French forces and fled towards Dominica and Saint Vincent. Their villages were burned, and Laubi√®re built a small fort on the north coats of Martinique to block their return. Many of the soldiers received land in return for their services and went on to found sugarcane plantation dynasties. The campaign was a decisive event in establishing full French control over the island. On 15 September 1658 the King appointed du Parquet's infant son Governor and Lieutenant General of Martinique and Saint Lucia, with his uncle Adrien Dyel de Vaudroques to act in his place until he reached the age of 20. Vaudroques died on 24 October 1662, and Gourselas served as interim governor until 1663. Laubi√®re led militia forces on Martinique when Gourselas was acting governor. The colonists proposed to the government that Vaudroques should be replaced either by one of the Rolle brothers, Gourselas or Laubi√®re, or else by de la Forge or de Valmenieres. However, the king accepted the wish of the guardians of the du Parquet minors and appointed another relative, Jean Dyel de Clermont. =French West Indies Company= The French West Indies Company was formed in May 1664, and acquired the islands from the du Parquet heirs. Robert de Clodor√© was named governor of Martinique on 11 October 1664 by the newly formed French West India Company (Compagnie des Indes Occidentales). Clodor√© arrived in Martinique and took formal possession of the island on 19 February 1665. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War, on 11 August 1666 Captain de Laubi√®re arrived in Martinique with 120 reinforcements from France on the Saint Christophe. Laubi√®re led a force of 400 men on four ships and two barks that reached Guadeloupe on 17 August 1666. In the afternoon they attacked a fleet of eight smaller English vessels under Henry Willoughby. Willoughby managed to escape with five of the English vessels, but the three largest ships and 200 Englishmen were captured. Next year the English admiral John Harman attacked the ships sheltering below the fortification of Saint- Pierre, Martinique on 29 June 1667, and would make repeated attacks over the days that followed, eventually sinking almost all the French ships before leaving on 11 July 1667. Laubiere directed the shore batteries under the command of Clodor√©. The Treaty of Breda was signed in July 1667, and Clodor√© left the island in December of that year. He was succeeded in Martinique by Laubi√®re as interim governor. The lieutenant general of the Antilles, Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre, was replaced on 4 February 1669 by Jean-Charles de Baas as governor-general of the islands, based on Martinique. For three years Laubi√®re governed under de Baas. Laubi√®re died in Fort-Royal, Martinique in February 1672. He was succeeded as governor in December 1672 by Antoine Andr√© de Sainte-Marthe.

In 2010, he placed second in a multi-way race, receiving 208,270 votes, equaling 35.9%, narrowly losing to Republican Paul LePage. In 2014 he garnered only 8.4%, placing third behind both the Democratic candidate as well as LePage, who was re-elected with 48.2% of the vote. Both times, he was claimed to be a spoiler for the Democratic candidate. Maine has since become the first state to use instant- runoff voting in its statewide elections. Cutler had previously served in the Carter Administration as part of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.  Early life and career  Eliot was born and raised in Bangor, Maine, the eldest son of Lawrence and Catherine Cutler. His father was a physician and his mother was an economist. Eliot received his primary education at Deerfield Academy. He then proceeded to graduate from Harvard College and later earned a degree from Georgetown Law. Cutler began his career as a legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, helping craft the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. He served as associate director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science in the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter administration, and was the principal White House official for energy. He then worked from 1980 to 1988 for the law firm Webster & Sheffield, focusing mostly on environmental and land use issues. He was a founding partner of Cutler & Stanfield LLP, with fellow Webster & Sheffield associate Jeffrey Stanfield, which became the second-largest environmental law firm in the country, eventually merging that practice with international firm Akin Gump in 2000. In 1990, Cutler purchased property on Shore Road in Cape Elizabeth. In an interview with Portland Magazine, Cutler recounted the purchase, \\"It took two years to find this property. Once we saw it and bought it, we wanted to build a house that sat well on land and was not overly imposing, from the road or the water. We needed lots of room for us and our family, a growing family along the course of time, where we could gather family and friends to enjoy the Maine Coast with us.\\" Cutler resided in Cape Elizabeth with his wife, Melanie Stewart Cutler during his gubernatorial campaigns. They have two adult children. In 2006, Cutler moved to Beijing, where he acquired a collection of Chinese vernacular furniture and antiques. When he moved back to his home in Cape Elizabeth, he integrated the Far East influence with the Maine mystique of the residence. In May 2017, Cutler put his oceanfront home in Cape Elizabeth for sale for $11 million, citing his intention to move to a condominium in nearby Portland.  2010 gubernatorial campaign  On December 9, 2009, Cutler officially launched his campaign for governor of Maine. Had he been elected, he would have been Maine's third independent governor. He was endorsed by Maine's second Independent governor, Angus King. In a close election night race, Cutler took an early lead.John Richardson Cutler takes early lead in governor's race Maine Today November 2, 2010 As the results came in from Maine's smaller and more rural communities, Cutler's lead shrank, and eventually opponent Paul LePage took the lead. Based on early, unofficial results, the Bangor Daily News projected that LePage would win, and Cutler conceded on the morning after the election.  2014 gubernatorial campaign  On June 6, 2013, Cutler announced on radio station WGAN's morning show that he would again run for governor, with a formal announcement coming after Labor Day. He dismissed the suggestion that his candidacy would result in another LePage victory, stating that he wouldn't run if he didn't think he could win. While he was again endorsed by Angus King on August 18, 2014 King withdrew his endorsement on October 29, 2014 in favor of the Democratic Party candidate, Mike Michaud.\\"Angus King switches endorsement from Cutler to Michaud\\" The Portland Press Herald October 28, 2014 Cutler finished a distant third, with LePage winning reelection. Though many Democrats believe that Cutler was a two-time spoiler, it is a label he and his supporters reject.  Other political involvement  He served on the board of directors of Americans Elect, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) corporation which sought to gain ballot access for a presidential ticket, to be chosen through an online national primary, in every state in the 2012 Presidential Election. Cutler endorsed Angus King in the U.S. Senate election to succeed the retiring Olympia Snowe. King won the election. Cutler announced on April 2, 2015 that he would not run for governor again, stating that he was taking a \\"vow of abstinence\\" from doing so. He also announced his appointment by the University of Maine System to lead the creation of a new graduate center unifying existing graduate programs at the University of Southern Maine, University of Maine, and the University of Maine School of Law. In May 2017, Cutler announced that he would work with the political organization Maine Independents to recruit candidates for the 2018 elections. The organization was founded by supporters of Cutler's gubernatorial campaigns. He also announced his support for State Treasurer Terry Hayes for governor in the following year's gubernatorial election. References External links * 2014 campaign site * Who Stole Election Day?

It received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb grossing just 8.66 crore against its 20 crore budget. Plot The film starts off by showing the reality of Indian Education System and how children are pressurised by their parents to become a doctor or an engineer. The scene cuts off to Kota, where a boy named Satyendra \\"Sattu\\" Dubey lives in a rented house and is doing his coaching to crack the engineering entrance exam. After his coaching, he returns to his house in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh where he lives with his parents, elder sister Nupur Dubey, and his grandmother. The day of the entrance exam comes and Sattu writes his paper well. When the results are out, Sattu ranks 287. While at a theatre, Sattu and his friends are told to move to the lower seats by some corrupt politicians but when Rakesh Singh is asked to do the same, he refuses, fights with the goons and gets them arrested by the police. Rakesh visits Sattu's house and takes him to a tea stall where he gives his contact number to him. The next day, Sattu calls him at a restaurant and Rakesh gives him an offer. If he gives the exams of some rich candidates who want admissions in colleges, he will be rewarded ‚Çπ50,000 per student. Sattu agrees and starts taking exams, earning a lot of money for his family. Whenever he goes for higher-level exams to places like Kolkata and Mumbai, he has sex with prostitutes. Meanwhile, Rakesh goes to his house where his sister is getting married, and it is revealed that Rakesh is married. Sattu is later rusticated from his college because he was caught with drugs, he is arrested and still addicted to drugs. After he recovers, Rakesh hands him the latter's degree certificate and asks him to go to Qatar for work. After a few years, Rakesh reunites with Sattu's elder sister Nupur. They spend a good time until a twist takes place in their lives. One day, Nupur tells him that she wants to do an MBA in order to get promoted to a higher post. Rakesh gets the MBA paper solved by some of his students and calls Nupur to her office's parking area. When Rakesh reaches there and tells Nupur that he has got the paper leaked, cameras flashe on his face, all the vehicle's headlights turn on and the police inspector arrests him for leaking the paper. The movie goes into a flashback showing that Sattu is fired off from his job as his degree was just a Photoshop certificate with just his name (created by Rakesh to get him out of the exams and rustication load). Sattu commits suicide. The scene returns to the present time showing that Nupur had taken revenge for her brother's suicide. After being bailed from jail, Rakesh builds an engineering college on his father's name which runs successfully.

Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express says \\" Why Cheat India is disjointed and disappointing, never quite knowing which side it is on, even as it spends time showing us how good students can be ruined by greed, and how parents can put killing pressure on their children in their struggle to break the vicious gap between present debt and potential income.\\" she further says \\"The material is slender and too stretched over two hours, as it goes from engineering-medicine into management, the holy grail.\\" She concludes her review with \\"Finally, the villain is outed: it is the confused, contrived writing.

This style originally came from the Rawa Belong area, which is now part of the Kebon Jeruk subdistrict, West Jakarta, Indonesia. This style was created by Ki Maing (Ismail bin Muayad) around the 1920s. Cingkrik Silat has now been spread to various places in Jakarta through many silat schools opened by its practitioners. Etymology The name Cingkrik itself is believed to be taken from the Betawi word jingkrak-jingkrik or cingrak- cingkrik, meaning agile, which describes the agile movements of a monkey. History According to interviews with Cingkrik Silat elders, this style was created by Ki Maing around the 1920s. Ki Maing was told to previously had studied silat in the Kulon (meaning \\"western\\" region, which could mean in Meruya or even Banten), but he was inspired to create his own silat school after paying attention to a monkey's movements. It was mentioned that there was a monkey that attempted to steal Ki Maing's stick, which evaded when attacked and quickly counterattacked back. The fast and agile attack movements become the well-known feature of the Cingkrik Silat forms or moves (Betawi: jurus). The three main students of Ki Maing were Ki Saari, Ki Ajid, and Ki Ali. From them, the style then spread out from Rawa Belong area to various other places in Jakarta through the next generation of students. Each of the Cingkrik Silat styles currently being taught from these three main students have slightly different forms, which are continued to be developed further by their many students. However, in general Cingkrik Silat has 12 basic forms and 3 pair up forms (Betawi: sambut), while the differences occur only in steps and movements. For instance, steps and movements in Cingkrik Goning (in stances and hand movements) are wider, while in Cingkrik Sinan are short and not too wide. Forms =Basic forms= Twelve Cingkrik Silat basic forms (jurus) are as follows: # Keset Bacok # Keset Gedor # Cingkrik # Langkah Tiga # Langkah Empat # Buka Satu # Saup # Macan # Tiktuk # Singa # Lokbe # Longok A combination movement of the twelve forms is called Bongbang, which is often shown in martial arts performances. =Pair up forms= Pair up forms (sambut) are paired fight exercises, the three pair up forms are as follows: # Sambut Tujuh Muka # Sambut Gulung # Sambut Habis, or Sambut Detik These forms aim to train reflexes when dealing with repeated attacks.

He was revered by his people in Abeokuta who conferred on him the titles of Balogun of Owu and Ekerin of Egbaland.  Early Life  He was born in 1909 in Ago-Owu, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Education Adegbenro D.S attended African School, Owowo for his primary education before proceeding to Baptist Boys High School, Abeokuta and Abeokuta Grammar School for his secondary education.  Career  He began his career with the Nigerian Railway Corporation as a clerk. After that, he worked as a storekeeper with the United African Company.  Politics  Adegbenro did not join active politics until the 1940s. It was then that he joined the rank of Awolowo, Akintola and others in launching the Action Group party in April 1951. The party contested the 1951 elections to the Western Region House of Assembly but lost most of the seats to the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) that was led in the Region by Adegoke Adelabu. Though the election results favoured the NCNC, post-elections defections gave the AG the majority. Adegbenro, notwithstanding, was easily elected because of his popularity in local Egba politics. Not quite long, He was selected by the Regional Assembly as one of its representatives in the Federal House of Representatives in Lagos. He returned to the Western Region House of Assembly in 1954 to serve as Parliamentary Secre to the Minister of Justice and later as Minister of Land and Labour and then Minister of Local Government. He was an able, trusted and articulate administrator. He built an intimate partnership with his party and government leaders, particularly Chief Awolowo who was then Premier of the Region. He was to remain a devoted collaborator of the Chief even when the latter moved unto national plane as Opposition Leader in the Federal House of Representatives. Following the Action Group Crisis that plunged the Western Nigeria into deep political crisis which subsequently engulfed the whole county, Adegbenro was suspended from office in the ensuing military coup of 1966.

Dorothea Hoffman conducted her own business independently from her spouse, despite the fact that she as a married woman who was formally under the guardianship of her husband. As with other married businesswomen, her activity is not very visible in the documents, but she was sued in 1678 by the hatmaker's guild in K√∂ping for having imported 92 of her own hats to K√∂ping for sale. When she was widowed in 1702, she was formally noted as a businesswoman of her own business as well as inheriting the hatmaker's guild privilege and workshop of her late spouse. Hoffman was the most successful hatmaker in Stockholm: she is listed with a larger staff and more journeyman's than any other of her profession in the capital, and her workshop and business was noted to have been the largest within her trade. She imported from L√ºbeck and Copenhagen, and her goods were known for their high quality. She died during the Great Northern War plague outbreak. Her business was inherited by her son Elias Hoffman (1690‚Äì1719), who had to defend it against the rest of the members of the hatmaker's guild of Stockholm, who wished to have it divided among the guild members due to its disproportionate size.

The original 17 districts established at the beginning of the 18th century were maintained throughout that century, and were the equivalent of the pedan√≠as (municipal districts) in other areas. This administrative structure was put in place in response to population increase in that era, and because the municipality was becoming less tractable.  Cartagena Casco  = Population = Bay of Cartagena. Cartagena Casco is the municipality's capital, historically its main locality, and its most populated area. In 2017, it had a population of 57,570. Cartagena Casco encompasses several localities, with a population distribution as follows in 2018: Cartagena (43,266); Ensanche-Almarjal (6,028); Barriada Virgen de La Caridad (2,923); and San Gin√©s (4,949). = History = Cartagena Casco was first settled by the Iberians. The area later gained in significance, with the arrival of the Carthaginians in 227 BC. Their city, Qart Hadasht, assumed the role of capital and had a number of high status buildings and structures. Between 211 and 209 BC, during the Second Punic War, a series of battles took place in Qart Hadasht. In 209 BC, Roman armies lead by Scipio Africanus conquered the city, which was known from that time as Carthago Nova and Carthago Spartaria. Scipio made the city the centre of diplomatic relations between the Roman authorities and the Iberians and Celtiberians. Carthago Nova was awarded the status of Roman colonia in the 1st century BC. During this period the city became completely Romanized, attaining the peak of its wealth and importance between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. Both the Roman Theatre of Cartagena and its amphitheatre were built in the final years of the first century BC. During the decline of the Western Roman Empire and resulting Migration Period in Roman Hispania, Carthago Nova attracted the attention of the Vandals. The Vandals arrived in the city in 425 on their way to Africa and attacked, but did not cause serious damage. Shortly afterwards, the Roman emperor Majorian gathered a large fleet to evict them. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, during the era of Visigothic control over almost all of the Iberian Peninsula, there was a period of political uncertainty in Carthago Nova. This came to an end when the Byzantine emperor Justinian I sent two armies to Hispania, the first in 552 AD and the second a year later. Justinian I secured a coastal strip the exact extent of which is unknown, although it may have been bounded in the west by the Strait of Gibraltar and in the east by Cap de la Nau (Valencia). The conquered territory also encompassed the Balearic Islands. This area became a province of the Byzantine Empire, of which Cartagena was the capital due to its strategic location and its port. In 612 AD, the Visigothic king carried out a successful offensive against the territories still belonging to Byzantium. He did not succeed in conquering Carthago Spartaria, which would fall to his successor, Suintila, in 621-624. Attempts to win back the town were unsuccessful. From the 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom was debilitated, impoverished and in a state of civil war. North African invaders, whose political and religious cohesion gave them an advantage over the disunited Visigoths, moved in. In 711 the head of the army in Africa sent Musa ibn Nusayr to fight the Visigoth king, Roderic. With Roderic defeated, there was no serious obstacle to Muslim rule. The caliph's sovereignty over the new province of the Islamic empire was proclaimed in 713, without resistance from Cartagena. From the 8th to the 11th centuries, Cartagena could not be considered a town. At the time of the Islamic invasion, it had a population of only a few hundred of people, inhabiting the ruins near the port. In the 12th century, the political and economic rise of Murcia and decline of Almer√≠a boosted Cartagena's relevance. The town's importance peaked at the beginning of the 13th century. Between 1238 and 1243, the Muslim kingdom of Murcia came under increasing pressure from the powerful kingdoms of Castile, Aragon and Granada. There was also considerable internal instability. King Ibn Hud decided to make Castile a vassal state. In April 1243 the Treaty of Alcaraz, recognizing the sovereignty of Castile, was signed. The treaty covered the entire kingdom, and any town refusing to comply, such as Cartagena, was considered to be rebelling. The Castilian prince accordingly determined to conquer Cartagena, but initially left the town in peace because time and resources were short and he had first to subdue Orihuela and other localities. In 1245, the Castilian army encircled Cartagena with the help of a fleet in the Cantabrian Sea. Cartagena surrendered unconditionally the same year. A Castilian garrison was established shortly afterwards, and the inhabitants of Cartagena were expelled. Several decades later, king Alfonso X of Castile decided to use the port of Cartagena as a base, both for increasing Castile's trade with the West Mediterranean and for his project of expanding the kingdom in North Africa. In the early modern period, Cartagena became increasingly prominent in the documentary record. After a troubled and uncertain period in which Cartagena's population declined, the town experienced a recovery, although its population never exceeded 1,500 during the 15th century. The number of inhabitants increased further during the 16th century, during which period Cartagena was protected by a wall and castle. Both structures were in a state of precarious repair. Later, the military defences of the port and the ancient coastal lagoon, Mandarache, were strengthened. Defensive works were undertaken in the port during the 1750s, with the addition of several batteries and forts. In 1765, there was a project to enclose the town that also envisaged the building of castles on the surrounding hills. Construction of Cartagena's arsenal was completed in 1782. The prosperity of mining activities in La Uni√≥n in Murcia led to the construction of lavish villas by the mine owners and the development of housing in what was regarded as Cartagena's town centre. New artistic movements such Art Nouveau were evident in some of the town's new architecture. This architectural sophistication extended beyond private housing, and also characterized public buildings such as the Palacio Consistorial, the Cartagena's railway station, and the Basilica of La Caridad. Landmark buildings the Casa Pedre√±o, Casa Aguirre and Casa Cervantes were built at the end of the 19th century, and the Casa Dorda and Casa Zapata were built in the first decade of the 20th century.  San Antonio Abad  Ancient prision of San Ant√≥n neighbourhood built in the first half of 20th century. San Antonio Abad wraps around the northern and eastern boundaries of Cartagena Casco and, with a population of 44,661, is the municipality's second most populated district. In 2018, the population distribution was as follows in the district's localities: San Antonio Abad (24,115); Barrio de Peral (15,570); Urbanizaci√≥n Mediterr√°neo (5,685); Barrio de la Concepci√≥n (4,952); Urbanizaci√≥n Nueva Cartagena (3,461); Urbanizaci√≥n Media Sala (1,636); and Barriada de Villalba (949). The first documented references to the district date back to 1530. In the 18th century, military construction work in Cartagena was a significant source of employment, with the building of the arsenal and other defensive structures. This led to a population increase in the city and municipality. Waves of immigrants settled in neighbourhoods outside the walled city of Cartagena itself, among them La Concepci√≥n and San Ant√≥n in the district of San Antonio Abad. San Ant√≥n had been settled since the 17th century because of its cultivated agricultural land. In contrast, La Concepci√≥n was established as a result of this population influx triggered by military construction activity in the port. During the Peninsular War (1808‚Äì1814) a French army entered Murcia from Andalusia with the aim of defeating the Spanish army in the region and conquering Cartagena. Cartagena's authorities reacted by destroying buildings to prevent the French army from using them as cover. The neighbourhood of La Concepci√≥n was almost completely razed, with 488 buildings demolished. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, new housing was built to accommodate new inhabitants. The neighbourhoods of La Concepci√≥n and San Ant√≥n were expanded, and the new neighbourhood of Los Molinos sprang up.  El Plan  El Plan, with a population of 36,018, is the third most populated district in the municipality of Cartagena . The population is distributed across the following localities: Los Dolores (7,672); El Plan (7,497); Pol√≠gono de Santa Ana (7,162); Los Barreros (6,927); La Ba√±a (5,628); Los Gatos (5,581); Barriada Hispanoam√©rica (3,872); Barriada Cuatro Santos (2,598); Castillitos (1,482); and La Gu√≠a (115). The name El Plan comes from the Catalan pla (plain). The first documented reference to this district dates back to 1683.  Rinc√≥n de San Gin√©s  Calblanque Regional Park. Rinc√≥n de San Gin√©s is located in the south-east of the municipality of Cartagena, and borders the Mediterranean Sea and the coastal saltwater lagoon Mar Menor. The Calblanque Regional Park is located in Rinc√≥n de San Gin√©s. The district has a population of 9891, living in the following localities: Los Belones (2,304); La Manga del Mar Menor (2,087); Cabo de Palos (1051); Los Nietos (959); Playa Honda (933); Cala Reona (701); Cala Flores (689); Atamar√≠a (360); Los Nietos Viejos (201); Barracas (176); Islas Menores (106); and Cobaticas (45). There is paleontological evidence that the area was inhabited during the Lower Paleolithic. Some remains have been found in the Cueva de Los Mejillones cave. In the mid-16th century, there was a defensive tower equipped with artillery in Cape Palos, located in this district. Cape Palos was uninhabited before 1865, when its lighthouse was built. Fishermen from Alicante, Mazarr√≥n, and Almer√≠a had begun to spend long periods in the area, and settled and built dwellings there during the last quarter of the 19th century. In 1900, there was a spa, with rooms, a restaurant, halls with a piano, and other facilities in Los Nietos alongside the fishermen's housing. The spa was frequented by wealthy families from Cartagena, La Uni√≥n and Murcia. Numerous festive and cultural ceremonies were held at the beach there in summer. During the 1960s, the municipality of Cartagena experienced a State-promoted boom in tourism. Tourist resorts were established in Playa Honda and La Manga, from 1966 to 1969.

The district has a population of 7,847 inhabitants, living in the following localities: El Algar (5,505); Las Lomas (1,484); Los Urrutias (802); Los Ruices (13); and Los Rizos (5). The area was first inhabited by the Iberians, and later by the Romans, as attested by archaeological remains in the district. Historical research on the municipality of Cartagena shows the presence of farmsteads during the Islamic period of Al-Andalus (711‚Äì1492). The name El Algar comes from Arabic, and means 'hollow' or 'cave'.  Santa Luc√≠a  Cala Cortina, a beach in Santa Luc√≠a district Santa Luc√≠a borders Cartagena Casco to the south-east, and adjoins the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The district has a population of 6,874, living in the following localities: Santa Luc√≠a (3,335); Los Mateos (2,097); and Lo Campano (1,448). The main population centre, itself named Santa Luc√≠a, was established during the era of Roman Hispania. It had a cemetery, and a sanctuary dedicated to Jupiter. The town was abandoned after destruction by the Vandals. In the 17th century, the battery of Trincabotijas was built. The 18th century saw an influx of immigrants to the Cartagena, attracted by the military construction work being undertaken in the town during that period. Due to a lack of space within the town walls, new arrivals settled in the surrounding neighbourhoods, including Santa Luc√≠a. Statue of the apostle James the Greater, patron saint of Spain, in Santa Luc√≠a's harbour. Doing the 18th century, music and dance shows were put on by Spanish and foreign companies, and theatrical performances both professional and amateur. In 1834, the Valarino family built a glass factory in this district. During the second quarter of the 19th century, lead deposits were found in the Sierra Almagrera mountains in the Province of Almer√≠a. As the export of raw minerals was forbidden, lead processing factories were established in the municipality of Cartagena, including the Franco-Espa√±ola foundry built in Santa Luc√≠a in 1842.

The district has a population of 5,697, living in the following population centres: La Palma (3,655); La Aparecida (1,122); Fuente Amarga (246); Los Balanzas, (191); Los Salazares (142); Los Carriones (118); Los Conesus (103); Los Palma de Arriba (69); and Lo Campero (51). The first documented references to this area recount the arrival of ranchers at a well surrounded by palm trees. There are also sources mentioning the presence of thirteen houses in 1561, and in 1580 the existence of a small sanctuary. The parish of La Palma was established at the end of the 17th century.  Pozo Estrecho  Pozo Estrecho is located in the north of the municipality of Cartagena, and borders La Aljorra to the east, and La Palma to the west. The district has a population of 5,042, living in the following localities: Pozo Estrecho (4,527); La Rambla (152); Las Lomas (150); Los S√°nchez (141); and Los Roses (72). The first documentary source for this area dates back to 1515, and concerns a distribution of public lands. The Spanish economic crisis of the 17th century led to a decline in urban economic activity and an exodus of people from the city of Cartagena to the surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon underlies the appearance of villages throughout the dispersed urban nucleus, of which Pozo Estrecho and La Palma are examples. The parish of Pozo Estrecho was established in 1699, and the district's first theatre was inaugurated in Pozo Estrecho in 1860.  La Aljorra  La Aljorra is located at the north-western end of the municipality of Cartagena. The district has a population of 4,970 inhabitants, living in the following localities: La Aljorra (4,434); Los Navarro (98); Los Nicolas (89); Los Carrascosas (72); Los Nietos (61); R√≠o Seco (50); Torre Cal√≠n (38); and Los Nietos (23). The name of this area comes from the Arabic al-Hurra (the free woman; born to good social standing; not a slave). It is likely to have been the given name of a farmstead owner. Archaeological remains of the Argaric culture have been found in the district. There was little Roman presence in this area in the era of Roman Hispania, although some artefacts have been found near a ravine called the Rambla del Saudillo. These include Roman ceramic lamps, potsherds, and coins.  La Magdalena  La Magdalena has a population of 3,877, living in the following localities: Molinos Marfagones (2,702); Los Segados (308); Pozo Los Palos (200); Cuesta Blanca de Abajo (140); La Magdalena (130); El Palmero (125); Los Carriones (118); San Isidro (116); Los Castillejos (94); and Los Simonetta (26).

Iberian peoples were this region, settling there to take advantage of resources such as esparto glass. The district also has archaeological remains of Roman inhabitation during the period of Roman Hispania between 207 BC and 476 AD. The village was established in the early years of the 16th century, and developed in the 17th century. On June 1558 eighteen Turks sailing in eight galiots disembarked on Cape Palos and entered Alumbres, plundering the hamlet and taking all of its inhabitants. The settlement and its development were closely tied to the mining of alum, the Spanish word alumbre giving the area its name. The 1560 population of 250 diminished rapidly when alum mining declined, the locality having become dangerous because of attacks by plunderers. By 1587, Alumbres had 150 inhabitants. The parish of Los Alumbres was established at the end of the 17th century.  Albuj√≥n  Main square of El Albuj√≥n. Albuj√≥n is in the north-east of the municipality of Cartagena, and borders La Aljorra to the east.

The most accepted theory concerning the district's name is that it comes from the Arab 'al-box' (small tower; small fort). There are documented references to rights to use water from the Rambla of Albuj√≥n. In 1509, several farmers used the water. During the Spanish War of Succession, on 8 September 1706 there was fighting between Bourbon soldiers and the soldiers of Archduke Charles. .  San F√©lix  San F√©lix has a population of 2,698, living in the following population centres: La Vereda (2,307); Los Camachos (173); Lo Baturno (117); La Asomada (68); La Piqueta (33); and Molinos Gallegos (26).

The district has a population of 2,280, living in the following localities: Llano de Beal (1288); Estrecho de San Gin√©s (662); Beal (328); and San Gin√©s de la Jara (2). In the 19th century, success and prosperity brought by mining activities in the Sierra Minera de Cartagena-La Uni√≥n mountains led to the establishment of villages such as El Estrecho and El Llano. From 1910, Cartagena went into prolonged economic crisis as a result of a fall in the price of mining products such as lead, zinc, and iron. This crisis, aggravated by World War I (1914‚Äì1918), continued after the war. As a consequence, the population of El Beal declined. The district had a population of 6,140 in 1920, falling to 4,417 by 1930.  Lentiscar  Lentiscar is located at the north-eastern end of the municipality of Cartagena, and borders the Mar Menor to the east.

The name of the district derives from the plant Pistacia lentiscus (lentisk or mastic, lentisco in Spanish), which grew abundantly in the area in the past.  Per√≠n  View of La Azoh√≠a. Per√≠n is located in the south of the municipality of Cartagena, bordering Canteras to the east, Los Puertos de Santa B√°rbara to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

Miranda  Miranda has a population of 1,365 inhabitants, living in the following localities: Miranda (1,090); Las Casicas (129); Los Vidales (91); and Los Gallos (55). The first documented references to this district date back to the final years of the 16th century. thumb  El Hond√≥n  El Hond√≥n has a population of 1,080, living in the following localities: Torreciega (606); Media Legua (238); and Los Jorqueras (236). The name Hond√≥n comes from Arabic al-fundun, and has its origin in the Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula, (Al-Andalus) during the Middle Ages. The word may be a phonetic adaptation of the Latin fundum (dip, or hollow). Another possible etymology of this toponym derives from 11th century texts in which the word al-fundun appears refer to the fertility of the soils of Lorca.  Campo Nubla  Campo Nubla has a population of 273, living in the following localities: Los Navarros Bajos (42); La Manchica; Rinc√≥n de Tallante; Casas de Tallante; Escabeas; Los Arroyos; and Casas del Molino. There are archaeological remains of the Argaric culture near the hamlet of Tallante. In the 16th century, there was a legal dispute between Cartagena, Murcia and Lorca over possession of the territory of the current district which, in that era, was uninhabited pastureland. The area was also known for cochineal, an insect producing a red dye valuable to the textile industry of the time.  Los M√©dicos  Los M√©dicos has a population of 126 inhabitants, living in the following localities: Los M√©dicos (70); La Vereda (49); and Los Vidales (7). The first documented references to this territory date back to 1703.  Escombreras  Escombreras, which became an industrial area, has just 8 inhabitants. There are few historical documentary sources concerning this area. The name of this district comes from the Latin Scomber, the Atlantic mackerel, used to describe the ancient Roman fermented fish sauce, garum. During the era of Roman Hispania, there was some salt production in the area. During the period of Islamic Hispania (al-Andalus 711‚Äì1492) some sluices, irrigation canals and ponds were built. There was probably a pirate base in this district from the last years of the IX century. There are historical documentary references to Berbers taking refuge here in the 16th century, at a time when the Iberian Peninsula had already been reconquered. There is evidence of the existence of simplified almadraba tuna- fishing traps, called tunairas, in the 15th century. In the following century these structures were more completely developed. In 1942 there were plans to establish Spain's first oil refinery in the valley of Escombreras, for strategic and security reasons.

After graduating in Information Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid, she joined the newspaper ' in Bilbao. From there she jumped to writing for national media such as the magazine √âpoca and the newspaper ABC, where she began to write the political column \\"El contrapunto\\", and where she remained from 1989 to 2000. Her first contacts with the world of television were due to Jes√∫s Hermida, who brought her into the political tertulia of the programs he presented and hosted on Antena 3: ' (1995) and ' (1996‚Äì1997). In the 1995‚Äì1996 season she also worked for Cadena SER, both on ' and Hoy por hoy. =1997‚Äì1998= In 1997, she went into public media at the request of the new RTVE director, .

At the same time, she started working at Onda Cero, contributing to the programs A toda radio with Marta Robles and ' with . In 2002 she was dismissed as the head of the program and relieved by . The exit was framed in the context of a tough confrontation between Pedro J. Ram√≠rez, director of the newspaper El Mundo and C√©sar Alierta, president of Telef√≥nica, majority shareholder of the network at that time. According to the journalist herself, who worked in both media (she had joined the editorial staff of El Mundo in March 2000), she was pressured to leave the newspaper. Faced with her refusal, Antena 3 acted, in her words, \\"repressing her.\\" =2002‚Äì2006= At that moment, Luis Herrero on Cadena COPE and Mar√≠a Teresa Campos on television, both critics of the way in which the journalist was fired, offered her a spot on their respective political tertulias.

At the beginning of November of the same year, it was Isabel San Sebasti√°n who left the set of 59 segundos due to the allegations that Calleja had leveled at her, accusing her of \\"having fattened ETA\\". Due to this she filed a legal claim for protection of honor. In July 2010, the Court of First Instance ordered Calleja to pay ‚Ç¨12,000 to San Sebasti√°n. The ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court in November 2014, which \\"placed the conflict in the field of freedom of expression and the right to honor, and concluded that this was prevalent in this case inasmuch as the accused journalist limited himself to making a criticism regarding a subject of interest and in a context of previous confrontation.\\" From 2007 to 2010, San Sebasti√°n also appeared on La Tarde con Cristina for COPE, led by , and presented the program La noche de on .

The site belongs to the Soldier Battlelab and was primarily used for live, virtual and constructive experimentation on soldier systems, weapons, and equipment. The McKenna MOUT site was approximately 200 meters square, and included 15 buildings resembling a European village. There was a church, small houses, domestic residences and office-style buildings.  Virtual MOUT  A replica of the existing military base in Fort Benning, Georgia was designed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), called virtual McKenna MOUT. The software representation was modeled on the real training site at Fort Benning, Georgia. The software was developed in the early 2000s, for use as a training aid and simulation tool to collect soldier data through sensors. Data collected included individual or team performance and decision-making capabilities. ARL began the program in June 2002 and the software was released publicly in April 2005. = History = In 1998, the MOUT Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) commissioned ARL to develop a realistic method to assess infantry situational awareness. The software created a virtual world intended to simulate variables effecting cognitive performance of individuals and teams of soldiers, including situational awareness, mission planning, navigation, advanced sensors, and team interaction. MOUT was a custom environment complete with precise depictions of buildings, terrain, vegetation, enemy units and real training scenarios. MOUT was also developed for savings associated with collection of virtual performance data in lieu of costly field experiments, which were estimated to be up to $50,000 per day at the Fort Benning site. The first virtual representation of the McKenna MOUT site was based on the shooter PC game, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield1, which focused on small unit warfare in urban environments. = Design = The layout of the replica was based on a satellite photo of Fort Benning, along with photographs of interior building plans. The locations of buildings and roads within the virtual McKenna MOUT site were collected using survey data taken at the site. = Operation = ARL utilized a free-play approach using freeze frames and knowledge assessment questionnaires to assess infantry situational awareness. Two sets of questionnaires were tailored based on the scenario being used, with embedded events included to elicit specific situational awareness responses in the users. Day and night scenarios included the soldiers using their current equipment and then scenarios using new technology. The same scenario was then rerun with different opposing forces and obstacles. The percentage of correct questions for each freeze frame was computed for the two conditions.

She played an important role in the guild conflict between the hat makers and hat ornament makers of Stockholm, and was the cause of an important reform. She was married to the Elder Dockvil of the hatmaker's guild in Stockholm. When she was widowed, she inherited the guild privilege of her late spouse and continued his profession. In August 1673, she was one of the four members of the Hat maker's Guild elected as spokesperson when the National Board of Trade summoned representatives of the two guilds of hatmaker's (hatmakare) and milliners (hattstofferare), which had long been involved in a conflict as their trades was similar: the hatmakare made the hats themselves, but the hattstofferare provided the materials, manufactured the ornaments of the hats, and had the privilege of selling parts of hats. Margareta Dockvil played a big role in this conflict, when she complained to the National Board of Trade that the hattstofferare had impended her business by refusing to provide her with materials; she was granted dispensation to have her own workshop established to manufacture and apply ornaments to her hats and sell them, which was until then the privilege of the guild of the hattstofferare. This was a caused for conflict which led the National Board of Trade to summon the two guilds in August of that year. The conflict ended with a reform that allowed the hat makers to manufacture ornaments of hats for their own hats and to sell parts of hats, with reference to the Precedent of Dockvil. It was a severe blow to the Guild of Hattstofferare.

This is also seen in the coverart for each, which, when combined, form a triptych spelling Uni. The music is more rhythmic and dancefloor-oriented. Noto explains that the compositions sonically represent an underwater dive. Reception Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times wrote \\"Nicolai‚Äôs music is inspired by science and data, a sound world of patterns and randomness, such as Unitxt‚Äôs conversion of Word and Excel files into sonic form. Patterns win out over randomness on Unieqav. Its 12 tracks are locked into intense geometric patterns, embroidered by the wonderfully detailed digital tones and textures that Nicolai conjures from his software. Sparse techno beats are imprinted in grid-like repetitions. The effect is austere but the degree of action taking place alongside ensures it does not become too severe. Track names advertise the play of difference and similarity\\". Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor stated \\"Nicolai does a lot with very little. He can reduce his sound down to bundles of frequencies and pulses of noise in ways that can encompass techno, ambient and drone. He can endow the barest sounds with personality, turning them into music that sounds like little else. That's why Unieqav's simple formula is so thrilling: this is dance music with masterful sound design, like techno with an operating system upgrade. The album channels Alva Noto's trademark sounds into jittery, funky music that loses none of the complexity of his more challenging work.

He was a member of the team that won the multi-million dollar International 2018 and 2019 tournaments.  History  While initially playing Dota 2 in Australia, ana made the decision to move from his city, Melbourne to Shanghai in December 2015 to continue his pursuit in becoming a professional Dota player, where he joined the CDEC in-house league allowing him to compete against highly-rated Chinese players. The invitation to play in China saw him drop out of his high school, where his mother was half-supportive at first, however with Anathan's brother convincing her. Ana began his professional Dota 2 career by joining Invictus Gaming in March 2016 as a substitute for Ferrari_430. His most notable accomplishment with the team was defeating Newbee in the grand finals of NEA 2016. Following The International 2016, ana left the team to join OG. In November, he won his first ever tournament with OG at Elimination Mode Season 2 and later won his first major event by defeating Ad Finem 3-1 in the grand finals of Boston Major. The team's performance continued to stay consistent with additional top 4 performances at Dota Pit League Season 5, StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, and Dota 2 Asia Championships 2017. Ana would then take his second major at Kiev Major, and the team was invited for The International 2017. OG's had a rough series of tournaments leading up to the International with early eliminations at The Manila Masters and EPICENTER 2017, however, they did finish fourth at Mars Dota 2 League 2017. During The International 2017, the team failed to make it to the upper bracket, and finished 7-8th, falling at the hands of LGD Gaming. Following their loss, ana announced that he would be taking a break from the professional scene. Months later, he later joined Echo International in early 2018, but had returned to OG in early June 2018 following the departure of Fly and s4. Despite a bad start at The International 2018's group stage, OG finished fourth and were seeded into the upper bracket of the main event. Considered underdogs during their entire time at the event, OG and ana advanced to the grand finals and won the tournament by defeating PSG.LGD in the best-of-five series 3‚Äì2. Following that, he decided to take a break from professional Dota, but returned to the team in March 2019.

The group is composed of vocalist Molly Sides, guitarist Whitney Petty, bassist Leah Julius, and drummer Lindsey Elias. The band draws inspiration from the sound of 1970s rock. Their debut EP, Greatest Tits, was released digitally on February 23, 2018. Thunderpussy released their eponymous debut studio album, Thunderpussy, on May 25, 2018. The album was produced by Sylvia Massy. Thunderpussy began a tour in support of the album on May 11, 2018. History =Formation and early years= Thunderpussy at Treefort Music Fest in 2015 The band was founded by Whitney Petty and Molly Sides in 2014 in Seattle. Petty had moved to Seattle to work on a boat, and began her musical career playing guitar for Deerhunter and playing drums in The Grizzled Mighty. Sides moved to Seattle to study Dance at the Cornish College of the Arts. Seeing Sides sing backup for the band This Bitch Don't Fall Off inspired Petty to form Thunderpussy two years later. Lena Simon, Sides' best friend from Cornish College of the Arts, later joined the band as drummer. Leah Julius, drummer of classic rock cover band Sundries, met Sides and Petty in the Seattle music community and joined the band as bassist. Simon left the band to focus upon playing bass for La Luz, leaving the band without a drummer for a while. She was replaced by Ruby Dunphy, who moved from Chicago to Seattle in 2014 to study Jazz at the Cornish College of the Arts. Within 2 weeks she was introduced to the band, and in her words, \\"I didn't really have a choice in joining, they kind of just kidnapped me. It's the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.\\" Thunderpussy announced on the band's official Facebook and Instagram pages in January 2019 that Ruby Dunphy left to pursue other projects. =Breakthrough= The band met and befriended Pearl Jam's lead guitarist Mike McCready at Sasquatch! Music Festival. McCready was an immediate fan of the band, and Thunderpussy's first single, \\"Velvet Noose\\", was released on McCready's HockeyTalkter Records. McCready contributes a guitar solo to the track. The song was featured in the 2017 crime drama Molly's Game. In May 2017, the band supported benefit shows by Flight to Mars, McCready's UFO tribute band. In November 2017, Thunderpussy were signed to Stardog Records. The band chose four songs for their EP Greatest Tits, which they described as \\"a taste tester for the album\\". The EP was released on February 23, 2018. =Thunderpussy= The band recorded their full-length debut, Thunderpussy, at Sylvia Massy's home studio in Ashland, Oregon, with Massy and engineer Josh Evans. The album was released on May 25, 2018. The band performed at SXSW on March 13, 2018. =Milk It= The band released their second EP, Milk It, on October 25, 2019. It was their first recording effort with drummer Lindsey Elias. Influences The band have cited diverse musical influences, including Led Zeppelin, Heart, Laura Jane Grace, The Marshall Tucker Band, and Kathleen Hanna. Petty has described their live show as \\"Beyonc√© meets Led Zeppelin.\\" All of the band's members date women, and Petty has stated that she and Sides are a couple. It's suggested that their relationship influenced their songwriting, with \\"Speed Queen\\" being described by bassist Julius as \\"vaguely a love story about Molly and Whitney\\". The band have expressed disdain for journalists who may brand them \\"as an all-female, feminist rock group\\" instead of focusing on their music. Remarking upon being an all-female band in a male-dominated music genre, Julius told an interviewer: \\"All four of us women do things that have historically been male- dominated. We play music, ride motorcycles, date girls, and lift heavy shit for a living. And we don't do them as a 'fuck you' to the male-dominated society, or in an attempt to advance women's rights, we do them because we can and want to.\\" Legal issues In May 2015, the band applied to register their name as a trademark. In August 2015, the Patent and Trademark Office denied their request, citing Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, which denies registrations to trademarks that could be deemed \\"scandalous, immoral, or disparaging.\\" Despite the disparagement provision of the law being struck down in 2017 with Matal v. Tam (also known as The Slants case) and the remainder of the law declared unconstitutional in Iancu v. Brunetti, the Trademark Office did not issue a registration to Thunderpussy's trademark until April 2020.

Biography First educated by a Jew from Perigord, Albalia went on to the academy in Lucena, where he struck up a close friendship with Me'ir ibn Migash, father of Joseph ibn Migash, and then settled in Granada. When barely thirty years old Albalia began to write Kupat ha-Rokhlim (\\"The Store of the Merchant\\"), a commentary on the Talmud. He was a close friend of Samuel ha-Nagid, whose son Jehoseph ha-Nagid became Albalia's patron, to whom he dedicated his 1065 astronomical work Ma·∏•beret Sod ha-Ibbur (\\"The Secret of Intercalation\\"), on the principles of the Jewish calendar. According to Moses ibn Ezra, Albalia was also a poet and rhetorician. After the murder of Jehoseph ha-Nagid in the 1066 Granada massacre, Albalia fled to Cordova, where he became acquainted with then-prince Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. When he ascended the throne of Seville in May 1069, Al-Mu'tamid appointed Albalia court astronomer and astrologer. At the age of thirty-one, just three years after he arrived in Seville, he was appointed leader (nasi) of the kingdom's Jewish community. Continuing as a palace official for twenty years, Albalia used his influence at court to improve the status of the Jews of the kingdom. When in 1089 the recently arrived Almoravids imposed a purge of Jewish civil servants at the court of Seville, Albalia moved to Granada, where he spent the last five years of his life. Although he had strong disagreements with Isaac Alfasi, before his death he asked his son Baruch to go to Lucena and study with him. Alfasi adopted Baruch who eventually became a well-known scholar. Isaac Albalia was also the maternal grandfather of Abraham ibn Daud.

Banta (March 29, 1870 - November 30, 1903) was an American pianist and recording artist active in the 1890s and 1900s. Banta was born in New York City to John William Banta and Frances Green Banta (Darrow). He learned to play piano while working as a piano tuner, and by 1893 was the house pianist for the New York Phonograph Company (a subsidiary of the North American Phonograph Company). By December of the same year, he was leading \\"Banta's Parlor Orchestra\\" for the North American Phonograph Company. He recorded as a piano accompanist and as leader of \\"Banta's Orchestra\\" for Walcutt and Leeds by 1896, and may have done the same for Walcutt, Miller & Co., its predecessor, in the intervening years. Banta's Orchestra recorded 15 cylinders for the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1896. The Chicago Talking Machine Company also marketed recordings by Banta's Orchestra, though it's unclear whether they recorded them or duplicated records taken by another company. The bulk of Frank P. Banta's recording activity was as the house pianist of Edison's National Phonograph Company. His death notice in the company's trade paper Edison Phonograph Monthly, noted \\"His were the hands that played the piano accompaniments to more than half of the records in the Edison catalogue\\". He also recorded for Edison one solo of his own composition, \\"Violets\\" (Edison Gold Moulded no. 8394). He recorded three sides for Victor in September 1903, one piano solo (Hello! Ma Baby) and two accompaniments for cornetist Herbert L. Clarke. Banta was an early adopter and proponent of ragtime and his accompaniments are some of the earliest recorded examples of the style. He was also regarded as a reliable powerhouse, who could play the same pieces many times over before mass-duplication of records was reliably available. In addition to his recording work, Banta composed at least 14 pieces between 1895 and 1903, primarily ragtime piano solos or popular songs, and arranged the famous \\"Laughing Song\\" popularized by George W. Johnson. Frank P. Banta was the father of the somewhat more famous pianist Frank E. Banta, who recorded prolifically between 1916 and 1939, especially for Victor. Frank P. Banta died in New York aged 33 after an extended period of poor health.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Fenton Hotel: History In 1855, the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway opened a line running from Pontiac to what is now Fenton. To service the influx of rail passengers, two local businessmen, Messrs. Seed and Flint, began construction of a hotel just north of the rail tracks. The Vermont House opened to the public in the middle of 1856. Seed and Flint managed the establishment until 1868, when local restaurateur Abner Roberts purchased it. Roberts renamed it the Hotel Fenton and managed it until 1876. Over the next decade, the hotel changed ownership multiple times until 1887, when Major L. L. Andress purchased it. It was sold again in 1892 and 1898, when Henry Hurd purchased it. In 1905, Mrs. L. R. Peer bought the hotel, then it was purchased in 1915 by Arthur Domanois, in 1945 by Mr. and Mrs. O'Rielly, in the early 1970s by Kurt Hartman and John Laffrey, and in 1977 by Harvey Gammage. It was purchased by a series of owners over the next two decades, until 1997 when Nick and Peggy Sorise purchased it. During the Fenton Hotel's history, it served the travelling public and the local community, with space for wedding receptions and other celebrations. Although the upper guest rooms have been closed to the public since the mid-twentieth century, the restaurant in the building still operates. As of 2018, the restaurant operates as the Fenton Hotel Tavern & Grille. Fenton Grain Elevator: History In 1865, J. R. Mason constructed the Fenton Grain Elevator on a site opposite the hotel. The elevator was successful, but Mason sold it to D. G. Colwell and E. M. Adams in 1867. By the 1880s, the elevator was handling about 20% of all the wheat produced in Genesee County. The elevator was sold to Mssrs. Smith and Stoner in the 1880s, and to Burdick Potter in the 1890s. Potter used the elevator for storage well into the twentieth century. The facility was used later by the Michigan Bean Company and the Big Acre Lumber Store, divisions of Wickes Corporation. By 1980, the elevator was used by the Michigan Craft and Artisan Foundation. In 2015, the building was sold to SkyPoint Ventures, who redeveloped it; Red Fox Outfitters moved into the building later that year. Fenton Hotel: Description Fenton Hotel The original section of the Fenton Hotel is a rectangular, three-story brick structure on a rubble foundation with a float roof. It is located directly on the sidewalk line. The windows are simple rectangular units with stone lintels, placed symmetrically. A simple brick corniceline encircles the building. A two-story wood-framed, gable roofed addition, constructed in 1882, is attached on one side. A single story brick kitchen is attached at the rear. The interior contains a foyer, bar and dining room on the first floor, with meeting and guest rooms on the upper floors. Fenton Grain Elevator: Description Fenton grain elevator The Fenton grain elevator is located across the street from the Fenton Hotel. It is a wood frame structure covered with board-and-batten or clapboard siding, sitting on a rubble foundation. It is basically rectangular, with portions ranging from two to 3-1/2 stories in height. It has an irregular floorplan and asymmetric massing. The roof is a combination of gable and shed styles. The street facade has a business entrance with a door on the first floor and four windows on the second. On the side are three sets of huge double doors originally for cartloads of grain.

Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club gave the show a B grade, and calls it \\"a mischievous cousin of 3rd Rock from the Sun\\" while saying it doesn't stray too far from the template Roiland set with Rick and Morty. McLevy feels the show is still finding its feet, but \\"Luckily, the humor is so reliably strong, the pacing so breakneck as it races from one plot to the next, that it's hard not to be won over by Solar Opposites' avalanche of charm.\\" Dan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote; \\"The early episodes have certain limited windows of continuity or running gags... but the show becomes increasingly serialized; things that seem like they might be throw-away become unexpectedly important.\\" Daniel Kurland of Bubbleblabber gave the show's first season a 9/10, stating, \\"Solar Opposites doesn't hit the same sweeping places of nuance and reflection that Rick and Morty does, but it still respects its characters and takes their problems seriously. It's just easy to get lost in all of the free-floating chaos that never really gets a chance to slow down. Solar Opposites delivers an exceptional first season that's as good, if not even better than Rick and Morty in some ways. It's definitely a crazier series, which is a very good thing for the nature of animated comedies on television.

Plot Colonel Billy is an ex-dance hall girl who has now gained a reputation as a gunfighter. She lives on the outskirts of Rattlesnake Gulch, where the women look down on her due to her past, while the men respect her due to her gun. She is in love with Faro Bill, a prospector who has promised to wed Billy once he strikes enough gold. One day the stage brings a preacher, Albert Atherton, and an destitute actor and his wife, Gerald and Mabel Morton, and their infant daughter to town. As a joke on Billy, they send Atherton to her house, saying that she has a room to board. Morton, in order to support his wife and child, files a claim and begins prospecting. Morton strikes gold, and when word of his strike reaches San Francisco, the gambler Arbuthnot devises a plot to take his claim away from him. He arrives in Rattlesnake Gulch, and forms a team with a local ne'er-do-well, Pizen Ike, and gets him to agree to help in his plan to cheat Morton out of his claim. Arbuthnot has brought fake love letters from Mabel, and when he reveals them, Ike insults her in front of everyone. Feeling the need to protect his wife's reputation, Morton challenges Ike to a duel. This is falling into place as Arbuthnot had predicted. Once Ike kills Morton in the duel, they'll be able to take over the claim. However, Billy learns of the duel and insists she step into the duel and take the place of Morton, many in the town support her, especially Faro Bill. Resistant at first, Ike agrees. But when he has the opportunity, he sneaks up behind Bill and strikes him over the head. Thinking him dead, he casts him into a crevice. Bill wakes up and begins to dig his way out of the crevice. In the process, he strikes a gold vein. He gets back to town just in time for the duel between Billy and Ike. His presence jars Ike, and Billy wounds him, and he begins to run away. Bill follows him and shoots him again in the shoulder, but the impact causes him to stumble and fall off a cliff. Exposed, Arbuthnot admits that the letters were forged, and Mabel's name is no longer besmirched. In the aftermath of the duel and Ike's death, it is revealed that Bill is Atherton's long lost brother, and Atherton performs the marriage of Billy and Bill.

Starring an ensemble cast led by Sean Bean, Ike Bennett, Adam Brody, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Phoebe Fox, Thaddea Graham, Guz Khan, Malachi Kirby, Adrian Lester, Andi Osho, Miranda Richardson, Jessye Romeo, Elijah Rowen, Jason Thorpe, Rose Williams, and Billy Zane, the series premiered on 22 February 2019 on Sky One in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United States, the entire series was released on 24 June 2019 by Spectrum as part of their Spectrum Originals video on demand branding initiative. Premise In the near future, Earth is overwhelmed by an unstoppable virus of unknown origin. To protect the population from the virus sweeping across the United Kingdom, a totalitarian government impose a curfew in which anyone caught out between 7pm to 7am will be put into quarantine, if not worse. Curfew focuses on a few lucky groups that are offered the opportunity to compete in an illegal street race where the finish line ends in the ultimate prize: sanctuary.  The Virus The initial outbreak of a virus in Scotland is followed by its spread to the rest of the world. Those infected by the virus are mutated into fast, savage and feral creatures (referred to as 'mooks') that attack non-infected humans. Mooks have high endurance and speed, and can only be taken down by heavy arms fire or head shots. They have a severe sensitivity to ultraviolet light; they burn when exposed to it, so they hide during the day and come out to hunt at night. When the virus and the appearance of 'mooks' started to impact everyday life, the curfew was introduced to keep people safe from the infected. In addition to the curfew, major cities, notably London and Manchester, have built walls and implemented checkpoints to control the public and limit the spread of the virus. Bridges across the Thames are also closed during curfew hours. Because 'mooks' can seemingly respond to certain subsonic frequencies, these are used to lure them away from populated areas. The virus is transmitted by biting alone; being scratched by a 'mook' does not result in infection, nor is the virus airborne. While a scratch is harmless, it does cause discomfort and mild nausea that is known to pass within a few hours. However, once bitten, an individual will quickly and painfully mutate. It is considered a mercy to kill the infected before they fully turn. Unbeknownst to the public, the virus is not a natural phenomenon but, actually, a man-made agent originally designed for medical research into cellular regeneration. Unfortunately, the virus mutated unexpectedly during the first human trials in Scotland, and the outbreak occurred as a result of failed containment measures. Cast =Main= =Guest= Joss Carter, Fionn Cox-Davies and Danny Collins portray the creatures.

The formation comprises black shales, mudstones, siltstones, dolomite beds, gypsum and halite layers and a layer of tuff within the formation. With a thickness between and present in an area of , the formation is considered the primary target for shale gas potential in the Southern Karoo. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) values average 4.5% with a range from 0.5 to 14.7%, placing the formation in the same range as the well- known Barnett Shale and Marcellus Formation of the United States. The Whitehill Formation of the Karoo and Nama or Kalahari Basin is contemporaneous with the Huab Formation of the Huab Basin and is correlated with a series of formations in the Pelotas and Paran√° Basins in southeastern Brazil, deposited in a larger basinal area, 150 million years before the break-up of Pangea. The abundance of Glossopteris and Mesosaurus fossils are characteristic of the Gondwanan correlation across present-day South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia. The Whitehill Formation has provided fossil reptiles, insects, fish and flora.  Description  The Whitehill Formation is an extensive Lower Permian unit, cropping out in a thin band stretching from the Western Cape in South Africa through southeastern Namibia and the Northern Cape in the north to the Eastern Cape of South Africa in the east.Cole, 2014, p.4 The formation is found at the edge of the Karoo Basin at distances of north to south and east to west.Cole, 2014, p.15 The formation is part of the Karoo Supergroup, more precisely the Ecca Group, where it overlies the Prince Albert Formation and is overlain by the Collingham Formation,Evans & Bender, 1999, p.175 and in the southern Karoo by the Tierberg Formation.Cole, 2014, p.28 Single zircon U-Pb SHRIMP dating yielded an age of 279.1 ¬± 1.5 Ma for the Uhabis River Tuff present in the upper strata of the underlying Prince Albert Formation.Werner, 2006, p.207 The Khabus Tuff within the Whitehill Formation provided a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 280.5 ¬± 2.1 Ma.Werner, 2006, p.362 Other authors use an estimated age for the whole formation of around 275 Ma.Geel et al., 2013, p.259 In the central part of the Karoo Basin, the formation ranges in thickness from and is highly organic with up to 14 weight percent of Total Organic Carbon (TOC).Branch et al., 2007, p.465 The formation is highly conductive and can be traced in seismic profiles across nearly the whole basin.Branch et al., 2007, p.475 = Lithologies = The Whitehill Formation has been subdivided into two major subunits according to their weathering color in outcrops. The lower and thicker part consists mainly of bluish- to greenish-grey shales and mudstones, which grade upward into more light brownish, buff weathering, slightly coarser grained siltstones. This zone is conformably overlain by white weathering shales, with intermittent chert lenses and pyritic stringers; the latter rarely exceeding in thickness. The sedimentary structure is generally massive, however laminations do occur that resemble algal lamellae. The formation appears white due to weathering of pyrite (sulfide) at surface to sulfate (gypsum).Branch et al., 2007, p.467 This section is grading upward into dark carbonaceous, bluish-grey weathering shales. From a lithological point of view only the upper part of the succession consists of the Whitehill-characteristic carbonaceous black shales.Werner, 2006, p.80 A tuffaceous zone occurs within the Whitehill Formation a few metres below the stratigraphic interval, which contains several dolomitic limestones. This limestone interval forms a mappable unit in all outcrops of the Whitehill Formation in central southern Namibia.Werner, 2006, p.221 In the Northern Cape, the formation is intruded by dolerite sills.Cole, 2014, p.22 The sediments are considered to be deposited in an anoxic environment. Besides pyrite, the shales contain dolomite lenses near the base. The rocks are highly folded and faulted by the Cape orogeny forming the Cape Fold Belt, and thus, interpreted as \\"decollement\\".Geel et al., 2013, p.258 = Depositional environments = The Whitehill Formation was deposited in a shallow inland sea with little to no connection to the open ocean. This sea, stretching from the Paran√° Basin in current southeastern Brazil to the Karasberg and Karoo Basins of southwestern Africa, probably represents the transition from marine to brackish or freshwater conditions, in sediment- starved, stratified and anoxic embayments. From outcrops in southernmost Namibia (Aussenkjer-Noordoewer area) it became evident that the boundary between the Prince Albert and the Whitehill Formation represents the turning point from a progradational to a retrogradational succession.Werner, 2006, p.99 The tuffs within the Whitehill Formation, as well as other tuffaceous beds found in the underlying and overlying formations, were possibly sourced by volcanoes located in present-day South America,Werner, 2006, p.383 although other interpretations of the tuffs of the Dwyka and Ecca Groups propose a general source along the southern Panthalassian margin of current southern Africa.Werner, 2006, p.377 = Correlations = The Whitehill Formation is time equivalent with the Pietermaritzburg Formation of the Waterberg Basin of southern Namibia.Werner, 2006, p.373 To the north in the Karoo Basin, the shales of the Whitehill Formation are laterally equivalent with the Vryheid Formation.Cole, 2014, p.7 The upper part of the formation is correlated with the Irati Formation of the Paran√° and Pelotas Basins in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, the Black Rock Member of the Falkland Islands,Werner, 2006, p.373 and with the Huab Formation in the Huab Basin of northwestern Namibia. The lower section correlates with the Palermo and Rio Bonito Formations of the Paran√° Basin and the Prince Albert Formation of the Karoo.Horsthemke et al., 1990, p.74 The Permian sequence in the Huab Basin is much thinner than those of the Paran√° and Karoo Basins.Holzf√∂rster et al., 2000, p.255 The fossil assemblages of Glossopteris and Mesosaurus are known from other parts of Gondwana; the Vryheid Formation of South Africa and coal deposits of the Lower Permian in Australia.Horsthemke et al., 1990, p.69 = Fossil content = Interpretation of Stereosternum Interpretation of Lepidodendron The Whitehill Formation has provided a variety of fossil insects, rare flora and Mesosaurus fossils, typical for the Permian of Gondwana. The mesosaurids are preserved as molds filled with gypsum crystals; they are commonly disarticulated. More rarely, casts of mesosaurids are found. Plant stems are similarly rare, and most commonly occur as chloritized fragments floating in the pink lower, more massive mudstone succession of the Whitehill Formation, while coprolites containing either palaeoniscoid scales or fragmentary crustacean carapaces are preserved on bedding planes.Evans & Bender, 1999, p.177 The following fossils have been reported from the Whitehill Formation:Khabus; Hill of the Captain's House at Fossilworks.orgModderdrift farm at Fossilworks.orgBrandhoek (Bra 111) at Fossilworks.orgKrantz Poort farm at Fossilworks.orgKenmoore Farm at Fossilworks.orgVictoria West District at Fossilworks.orgBurghersdorp at Fossilworks.orgDistrict of Albania, Griqualand West at Fossilworks.org ;Reptiles * Mesosaurus tenuidens * Noteosaurus africanus * Stereosternum tumidum ;Fish * Palaeoniscum capensis * Watsonichthys lotziEvans & Bender, 1999, p.176 ;Insects * Afrochoristella maclachlani * Afrocupes firmae * Sharovia permiafricana ;Flora * Lepidodendron whitehillianum  Economic geology  The high concentration of organic matter in the black shales of the Whitehill Formation make it an interesting target for shale gas exploration. The formation is considered the prime focus for potential shale gas prospects in the Southern Karoo.Geel et al., 2013, p.263 TOC levels average at 4.5% TOC,Geel et al., 2013, p.260 and range from 0.5 to 14.7%, comparable to known shale gas producing formations as the Marcellus Formation and the Barnett Shale.Cole, 2014, p.5 The formation is considered to have economic potential in an area around Beaufort West to Graaff-Reinet.Cole, 2014, p.31 Results from Rock-Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance measurements, open pyrolysis and thermovaporization analyses carried out on core samples drilled through the formation show that organic matter has reached an advanced stage of kerogen development. These rocks can therefore be classified as overmature, likely because of the thermotectonic processes related to the Cape orogeny forming the Cape Fold Belt overprint on lower Karoo rocks in the study area. It is possible that the maturity of the shales decreases farther north in the Karoo basin.Geel et al., 2013, p.264  See also  * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Namibia * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in South Africa * Geology of Namibia * Geology of South Africa * Ganigobis Formation * Gondwanide orogeny  References  = Bibliography =    Further reading  * J.

His company, C. B. Hansens Etablissement, was based in the Erichsen Mansion at Kongens Nytorv. Early life and education Hansen was born on 4 February 1806, the son of carpenter Christopher Bagn√¶s and Anne Stephensen (c. 1775-1854). He grew up in poverty after the early death of his father. He had to care for himself from the age of 8, working first in J. C. Modeweg's textile factory and then as a cobble-Layer at Nyboder. His situation improved moderately when his mother remarried Peter Antoni, a laborer, enabling him to attend Holmen's School until beginning a chair-maker's apprentice at 14. At the age of 20, when he completed his apprenticeship, he changed his name to Hansen for reasons that remain unknown. Career C.B. Hansen advertisement In 1830, after completing his masterpiece, Hansen established his own business. He established C. B. Hansens Etablissement un 1838 when he was licensed to \\"manufacture and sell veneer and intarsia furniture of fine imported as well as local types of wood\\". His business prospered to a degree that in 1943 enabled him to purchase the imposing Erichsen Mansion at Kongens Nytorv. He opened a large furniture store in the building, which exhibited his own works as well as those of his peers. He destinuished himself at The Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and was the only representative of Danish furniture at the 1885 Exposition Universelle in Paris. Later that same year he received an invitation to become a member of the Jouner's Guild in Copenhagen. C. B. H.s Etablissement developed into one of the leading furniture manufacturing businesses in the country. In the mid-1860s, he began to struggle with poor health and retired from the company 1867. The company was then continued by his son Charles Habseb (1836‚Äì95) and son-in-law L. Larsen (1821-1902). Hansen was active in the management of Industriforeningen. He was a board member of the Association of Craftsmen in Copenhagen from 1857 to 1867 and was involved in the establishment of the Alderstr√∏st housing estate. Personal life Hansen married Claudine Henriette Olsen (25 February 1803 - 31 March 1857) on 16 February 1827 in the Garrison Church in Copenhagen but this marriage was later dissolved. He married for a second time, Jacobine Marie Charlotte Krause (14 April1819 - 11 January 1892) on 19 November 1843 in Damsholte Church. She was the daughter of Johan Diderik Conrad Krause (1770-1846), the gardener at Marienborg Manor, and Anne Charlotte Hedevig Krause b√©e Keilow (1783-1860).

Early life and family Lilla Minnie Perry was born Lilla Minnie Bagwell on 10 June 1888 at Marlfield House, Clonmel, County Tipperary. She was the youngest child of Richard and Harriet Bagwell (n√©e Newton). She was raised at Marlfield House, living there until she married a captain in the merchant navy, John Perry (1875-1965) on 4 October 1915. They went on to have three sons and one daughter, Mary Lilla. They lived at the Perry estate, Newcastle, County Tipperary until it was burnt by republicans in June 1921. After this they lived at a property neighbouring Marlfield, Birdhill. Perry died at Marlfield on 30 August 1974. Artistic career It has been assumed that Perry received some amount of formal art training, and she spent a few months in Italy as a young woman, but largely she appears to have been self-taught. She worked almost exclusively in watercolours, and exhibited regularly with the Water Colour Society of Ireland (WCSI) from 1908 to 1970. She showed over 100 works with the WCSI, initially as Lilla Bagwell, and later under her married name. In 1909 she exhibited with the London Salon for the first time, and was included in exhibitions at the Society of Women Artists, London in 1911/1912. She painted all her life, put her most prolific period was in the 1920s and 1930s. From 1927 to 1930, Perry exhibited five works at the Royal Hibernian Academy. She also showed with the Munster Fine Art Club in 1933 and the Ulster Academy of Arts, Belfast in 1937. Her subjects were consistently gardens, trees and rivers, mostly scenes from her home at Birdhill, but also from around Clonmel. Over time her style developed, from muted colours and attention to close detail in her early work, to looser brushwork and a brighter palette. Her Kilmanahan castle near Clonmel was included at the centenary exhibition of the WCSI in 1970. The majority of her work is held in private collections, with the South Tipperary County Museum, Clonmel holding Knocklofty bridge (1940) and Clonmel and the River Suir (1931).

The use of TRLs enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. A technology's TRL is determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. TRLs are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. The US Department of Defense has used the scale for procurement since the early 2000s. By 2008 the scale was also in use at the European Space Agency (ESA).EAS TRL Handbook The European Commission advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale in 2010. TRLs were consequently used in 2014 in the EU Horizon 2020 program. In 2013, the TRL scale was further canonized by the ISO 16290:2013 standard. A comprehensive approach and discussion of TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO).The TRL scale as a Research & Innovation Policy Tool Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, stating that the \\"concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)\\". History Technology Readiness Levels were originally conceived at NASA in 1974 and formally defined in 1989. The original definition included seven levels, but in the 1990s NASA adopted the current nine-level scale that subsequently gained widespread acceptance. Original NASA TRL Definitions (1989) :Level 1 ‚Äì Basic Principles Observed and Reported :Level 2 ‚Äì Potential Application Validated :Level 3 ‚Äì Proof-of- Concept Demonstrated, Analytically and/or Experimentally :Level 4 ‚Äì Component and/or Breadboard Laboratory Validated :Level 5 ‚Äì Component and/or Breadboard Validated in Simulated or Realspace Environment :Level 6 ‚Äì System Adequacy Validated in Simulated Environment :Level 7 ‚Äì System Adequacy Validated in Space The TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974. At that time, Ray Chase was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin, Mr Chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design. Later Mr Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. Mr Chase joined ANSER in 1978, where he used the TRL methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs. He published several articles during the 1980s and 90s on reusable launch vehicles utilizing the TRL methodology. These documented an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing readiness on the Air Force Have Not program. The Have Not program manager, Greg Jenkins, and Ray Chase published the expanded version of the TRL methodology, which included design and manufacturing. Leon McKinney and Mr Chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the ANSER team's Highly Reusable Space Transportation (\\"HRST\\") concept. ANSER also created an adapted version of the TRL methodology for proposed Homeland Security Agency programs. The United States Air Force adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s. In 1995, John C. Mankins, NASA, wrote a paper that discussed NASA's use of TRL, extended the scale, and proposed expanded descriptions for each TRL. In 1999, the United States General Accounting Office produced an influential report that examined the differences in technology transition between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD make wider use of Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the Defense Acquisition Guidebook.Defense Acquisition Guidebook Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook. Because of their relevance to Habitation, 'Habitation Readiness Levels (HRL)' were formed by a group of NASA engineers (Jan Connolly, Kathy Daues, Robert Howard, and Larry Toups). They have been created to address habitability requirements and design aspects in correlation with already established and widely used standards by different agencies, including NASA TRLs. =In the European Union = The European Space Agency adopted the TRL scale in the mid-2000s. Its handbook closely follows the NASA definition of TRLs. The universal usage of TRL in EU policy was proposed in the final report of the first High Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies, and it was indeed implemented in the subsequent EU framework program, called H2020, running from 2013 to 2020. This means not only space and weapons programs, but everything from nanotechnology to informatics and communication technology. Current TRL definitions =Current NASA usage= The current nine-point NASA scale is: :TRL 1 ‚Äì Basic principles observed and reported :TRL 2 ‚Äì Technology concept and/or application formulated :TRL 3 ‚Äì Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of concept :TRL 4 ‚Äì Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment :TRL 5 ‚Äì Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment :TRL 6 ‚Äì System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (ground or space) :TRL 7 ‚Äì System prototype demonstration in a space environment :TRL 8 ‚Äì Actual system completed and \\"flight qualified\\" through test and demonstration (ground or space) :TRL 9 ‚Äì Actual system \\"flight proven\\" through successful mission operations =European Union= The TRLs in Europe are as follows: 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. :TRL 1 ‚Äì Basic principles observed :TRL 2 ‚Äì Technology concept formulated :TRL 3 ‚Äì Experimental proof of concept :TRL 4 ‚Äì Technology validated in lab :TRL 5 ‚Äì Technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies) :TRL 6 ‚Äì Technology demonstrated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies) :TRL 7 ‚Äì System prototype demonstration in operational environment :TRL 8 ‚Äì System complete and qualified :TRL 9 ‚Äì Actual system proven in operational environment (competitive manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies; or in space) Assessment tools TPMM Transition Mechanism A Technology Readiness Level Calculator was developed by the United States Air Force. This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in Microsoft Excel that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time. The Technology Program Management Model was developed by the United States Army. The TPMM is a TRL-gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition. The model provides a core set of activities including systems engineering and program management tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals. This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model. Uses The primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. It should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization. Among the advantages of TRLs: * Provides a common understanding of technology status * Risk management * Used to make decisions concerning technology funding * Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility: * Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity * A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity * Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch Current TRL models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors. There have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments. For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.

Grayson graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1878, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Christian Schussele and Thomas Eakins. He studied further at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. After graduation, he joined the artist colonies at Pont Aven and Concarneau, and opened a studio in Paris. Grayson was a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon during the 1880s.\\"GRAYSON, Clifford Prevost,\\" National Cyclopedia of American Biography, Volume 13 (New York: J.T. White & Company, 1906), pp. 337-38. =Drexel Institute= Grayson returned to Philadelphia in 1890. He was hired as instructor in oil painting at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry in 1891, and promoted to director of the Art Department in 1893. Under Grayson, the art curriculum expanded from a 2-year to a 4-year program. He hired Howard Pyle as an instructor in 1894, in what became the School of Illustration.Edward N. McDonald and Edward M. Hinton, Drexel Institute of Technology, 1891 - 1941, A Memorial History (Philadelphia: Haddon Craftsmen, Inc., 1942). Grayson taught portraiture and life classes, and Charles Grafly taught clay modeling and sculpture. Thomas Eakins had been forced to resign from PAFA in 1886, after using a fully nude male model before female students. Grayson hired him to lecture in anatomy in January 1895, and dismissed him two months later, after Eakins again used a nude male model before a class that included female students.\\"A Revolt at Drexel Institute. Indignation Caused by a Nude Male Model Before a Mixed Class. Professor Eakins Removed.\\" The Philadelphia Times, March 14, 1895, p. 1.

Dallin, Sculptor,\\" Brush and Pencil, vol. 5, no. 1 (October 1899), p. 15. The Art Department seemed to flourish under Grayson, attracting students such as Maxfield Parrish, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Jessie Willcox Smith, Violet Oakley and Frank Schoonover. After being ordered to make severe budget cuts, Grayson tendered his resignation in December 1904. He left Drexel in June 1905, after the announcement of the dissolution of the Art Department. =Later career= Grayson was an active member of the summer artist colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut.Who Was Who in America, Volume 4 (Chicago: Marquis Press, 1968), p. 376. =Honors and awards= Grayson received Honorable Mentions at the Paris Salons of 1885 and 1892.

Although it has been claimed that Ralph was a half-brother of Sir Owen Hopton's, a suit of 1601 indicates that the marriage of Rachel and Arthur was arranged to ensure that Sir Ralph's estates continued in a family named Hopton, and not through any alliance of consanguinity.The National Archives (UK), Chancery: Final decrees, Mayowe v Hopton (1601), ref.

Thereupon George's second son, Arthur Hopton, an infant, became his father's heir in the manors of Westleton, Westhall, Thorington and Easton Bavents, and his brother's heir in the manor of Blythburgh, 'otherwise called West Woode', with its members and hamlets, in 1490, which was at first the headmanor.Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry VII, I: 1485-1494 (HMSO 1914), p. 334 (Hathi Trust).

Arthur's mother Anne remarried in 1498 to Sir Robert, Lord Curson, who at once entered Hopton's manor of Westleton forcibly, claiming it should belong to Anne during her lifetime.Dale, 'Hopton, Sir Arthur', History of Parliament. Sir George Hopton had left the child in the wardship of four trusted friends, and his executors Sir Robert Clere (c.1453-1529, of Ormesby St. Margaret, Norfolk) and William Eyre became engaged in lengthy Star Chamber proceedings for the recovery of Arthur's rights.The National Archives (UK), Court of Star Chamber, Proceedings (Henry VIII); refs: STAC 2/9, f.241; STAC 2/10, f. 48-49; STAC 2/17/336; STAC 2/25/144 (see Discovery Catalogue). It was then about a decade later that he made his first marriage, to Maud, daughter of Sir Robert Dymoke of Scrivelsby (died 1546). Sir Robert had been knighted on the same occasion as Arthur's grandfather Sir William Hopton, and Robert's maternal grandparents Lionel Welles, 6th Baron Welles and Joan Waterton lay in a fine tomb at Methley, beside Swillington. Sir Robert Dymoke was King's Champion at the Coronations of Kings Richard III, Henry VII and Henry VIII.S. Lodge, Scrivelsby, the Home of the Champions (W.K. Morton, Horncastle/Elliot Stock, London 1893), pp. 56-61 (Internet Archive). This marriage, however, although socially advantageous, produced no surviving children, and by 1518 Arthur Hopton had taken a second wife. The match was no less ambitious, his choice falling upon Anne, daughter of Sir Davy Owen of Cowdray House at Midhurst in West Sussex, a natural son of Sir Owen Tudor (and therefore uncle to King Henry VII).'Owen', in W.

He was a knight of the shire for Suffolk in 1539, and again in 1542, probably on both occasions with Sir Anthony Wingfield.Dale, 'Hopton, Sir Arthur', History of Parliament.  Building at Yoxford and Blythburgh  Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, showing the surviving Tudor work in the north wing Sir Arthur is thought to have built Cockfield Hall at Yoxford in its Tudor brick form, including the part now forming the north wing of the later mansion, and the Gatehouse.

In April 1545 the king's Court of Augmentations granted the bailiwick and keeping of the manor-place, garden and orchard of his manor of Henham to trustees who vested it in Sir Arthur Hopton. The Hall itself was granted by the king to Sir Anthony Rous of Dennington in his demesne as of fee. Sir Arthur therefore conveyed the bailiwick to Sir Anthony in November 1545, by an indenture preserved among the Earl of Stradbroke's muniments. The Tudor mansion was destroyed by fire in 1773.A.I.

These entangled spins act as bosons and their excited states (triplons) can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The quantum dimer system was originally proposed by Matsubara and Matsuda as a mapping of the lattice Bose gas to the quantum antiferromagnet. Quantum dimer magnets are often confused as valence bond solids; however, a valence bond solid requires the breaking of translational symmetry and the dimerizing of spins. In contrast, quantum dimer magnets exist in crystal structures where the translational symmetry is inherently broken. There are two types of quantum dimer models: the XXZ model and the weakly-coupled dimer model. The main difference is the regime in which BEC can occur. For the XXZ model (commonly referred to as the magnon BEC), the BEC occurs upon cooling without a magnetic field and manifests itself as a symmetric dome in the field versus temperature phase diagram centered about H = 0. The weakly-coupled dimer model does not magnetically order in zero magnetic field, but instead orders upon the closing of the spin gap, where the BEC regime begins and is a dome centered at non-zero field. Quantum dimer systems are considered to be of interest due to their relatively simple interactions and their BEC state is of interest as a novel playground for testing BEC physics. In addition, the BEC state of the quantum dimer magnet is thought to be a spin superfluid which could allow for the transfer of spin information over long distances without loss.  Bose-Einstein condensation in the weakly-coupled dimer model  The Bose-Einstein condensation in quantum dimer systems is, at its essence, a field-induced magnetically ordered state that comes about from the Zeeman splitting of the triplet states. The bosons of the Bose-Einstein condensate can be thought of as the component of the spin parallel to the applied magnetic field, reaching a maximum when the spins become polarized by the field. The difference between the Bose-Einstein condensation and a typical ordered state is the spontaneous breaking of the spin's U(1) symmetry (i.e. the circular symmetry transverse to an applied magnetic field). This spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a Goldstone boson that is measureable via a inelastic neutron scattering (amongst other techniques).

After finishing third on her only appearance as a juvenile in 2014 she won the Ballymacoll Stud Stakes in the following spring but was beaten in her other five starts and appeared to be a few pounds below the best fillies of her generation. She finally emerged as a top class racemare in 2016 when she recorded three major victories in France, taking the Prix Corrida, Prix Jean Romanet and Prix de l'Op√©ra. She was retired to become a broodmare at the end of the year. Background Speedy Boarding is a dark bay mare with a large white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud. In October 2013 the yearling filly was put up for auction at Tattersalls but after failing to reach her reserve price of 95,000 guineas and was retained by her breeder. Like all of the stud's home bred horses she raced in the colours of Helena Springfield Ltd, which are black with white spots and a white cap. She was sent into training with James Fanshawe at Pegasus Stables in Newmarket and was ridden in all of her races by Freddy Tylicki. She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St James's Palace Stakes. His other offspring have included Able Friend, Mukhadram, Lope de Vega and Casamento. Her dam Dash To The Front won the Warwickshire Oaks and came from a female-line family which had been based at Meon Valley for several generations, being a granddaughter of Milligram who was in turn a daughter of One In A Million. Racing career =2014: two- year-old season= Speedy Boarding made her first and only appearance as a juvenile in a maiden race over one mile on good to soft ground at Doncaster Racecourse on 24 October. She started a 20/1 outsider and kept on well in the closing stages to finish third of the thirteen runners behind Star of Seville a filly who went on to win the Prix de Diane. =2015: three-year-old season= Speedy Boarding began her second season in a ten furlong maiden at Goodwood Racecourse on 21 May and started the 9/4 favourite against twelve opponents. The closing stages of the race developed into a prolonged struggle between Speedy Boarding and the John Gosden-trained Journey with the former prevailing by half a length and the pair finishing six lengths clear of the rest. On 11 June the filly was stepped up in class for the Listed Ballymacoll Stud Stakes over ten furlongs at Newbury Racecourse and started the 7/2 second favourite behind Encore l'Amour. After racing just behind the leaders, she went to the front a furlong out and won by three quarters of a length from the Irish filly Hot Sauce. On 18 July Speedy Boarding was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Group 1 Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh. Starting at odds of 12/1, she raced in third place for most of the way but appeared to be outpaced in the closing stage and came home fifth behind Covert Love, Jack Naylor, Curvy and Together Forever. After a break of almost two months the filly returned in the John Musker Fillies' Stakes at Yarmouth Racecourse in which she started the 11/4 favourite and finished second, beaten half a length by the four-year-old Talmada. On her final run of the year Speedy Boarding contested the British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 17 October and started a 25/1 outsider. She was never in serious contention and came home ninth of the twelve runners behind Simple Verse. =2016: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Speedy Boarding finished fourth behind Beautiful Romance, Koora and Journey in the Group 2 Middleton Stakes over ten and a half furlongs on 12 May at York Racecourse after being repeatedly being blocked in her attempts to obtain a clear run in the straight. Seventeen days after her defeat at York the filly was sent to France for the Group 2 Prix Corrida over 2100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and started the 4/1 second favourite behind the Prix de Royallieu winner Candarliya. After racing in fourth place, Speedy Boarding went to the front 300 metres from the finish and kept on \\"gamely\\" to win by half a length from the six-year-old Siljan's Saga, the winner of the race in 2014. On 26 June Speedy Boarding ran in the Group 1 Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh but made little impact and finished last of the five runners behind Minding. On 21 August at Deauville Racecourse Speedy Boarding contested the Prix Jean Romanet over 2000 metres and started at odds of 6/1 in a field of ten. The Pretty Polly runner-up Bocca Baciata started favourite while the other runners included Sayana (second in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes), Royal Solitaire (Badener Meile), Bateel (Fred Archer Stakes), Steip Amach (Amethyst Stakes) and Carnachy (Daisy Warwick Stakes). Speedy Boarding tracked the leader before taking the advantage 300 metres out and went clear of her opponents to win by one and three quarter lengths from the outsider Ame Bleu. James Fanshawe commented \\"It's Freddy's first group I winner which is great. He rode her really nicely and got her in a good position. She has always been very talented but as you can see she's a big, tall filly who has taken her time to really come into herself. I think maybe I ran her back a bit quick when she was a little flat in the Pretty Polly in Ireland. On her day she's really good and I thought she won decisively today\\". Speedy Boarding returned to France on 2 October for the Group 1 Prix de l'Op√©ra, which was run that year at Chantilly Racecourse as Longchamp had been closed for redevelopment. She started the 11/2 second choice in the betting behind So Mi Dar, a British- trained three-year-old who was undefeated in four races including the Investec Derby Trial and the Musidora Stakes. The other five runners were Pleascach, Jemayel (Prix Saint-Alary), Royal Solitaire, Sea Front and Pagella. Tylicki settled the filly behind the leaders before making his challenge in the straight and overtook the leader Pleascach 300 metres out. Speedy Boarding repelled the renewed challenge of Pleascach to win by a short head with So Mi Dar half a length away in third. After the race Fanshawe said \\"It was a brilliant race and there didn't deserve to be a loser. She's so tough and has been a wonderful filly for the yard. She raised her game again after the Romanet and really battled\\". On 15 October Speeding Boarding ended her racing career with a second attempt to win the British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes at Ascot. Starting at odds of 14/1 he stayed on well in the closing stages to finish second to Journey, with Queen's Trust, Seventh Heaven, Zhukova, Bocca Baciata and Bateel finishing behind. Breeding record Speedy Boarding was retired from racing to become a broodmare at Meon Valley. Her first foal, a colt sired by Dubawi was born in 2018.

Her time as an economist is largely linked to her time as a federal employee by her career and positions in the United States government. During her career as head of the United States Women's Bureau, Keyserling and her husband Leon Keyserling faced loyalty allegations during the Red Scare that impacted their governmental careers.  Early years  Mary Dublin Keyserling was born in New York City, New York on May 25, 1911 to an educated Jewish family. Both of her parents Augusta Salik, her mother, and Louis I. Dublin, her father, were immigrants to the United States. From a young age Mary Dublin Keyserling was influenced by various social reforms that took place in the United States. This was due to her parents' positive interactions and open minds about many of these social reforms, such as women gaining more rights, that took place during the United States Progressive Era.  Career  = Economist = Mary Dublin Keyserling was a Keynesian economist. She first went to school at Barnard College to study economics and graduated in 1930 as president of her senior class. She then pursued graduate studies at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, the London School of Economics, and ultimately at Columbia University to gain a doctoral degree that she did not finish. While in college, Mary Dublin Keyserling was taught by economist Wesley Clair Mitchell. During a fellowship while still at Barnard, Keyserling, studied with Economist John Maynard Keynes. It was at Columbia University did she meet and marry Leon Keyserling, then an economics instructor, in 1940. She worked for the United States Government as an economist under the presidential administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Lyndon D. Johnson. = Government employee = Keyserling began to work for the United States‚Äô Government in 1930 after graduating from college. Her first government job was as a researcher in the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care. Within a year Keyserling worked in the State Charities Aid Association of New York City as an administrator. Between 1940 and 1953 Keyserling served on various positions in the American Government. * 1940‚Äì1941, Consumers Division * 1941‚Äì1942 in the House Committee on National Defense Migration * 1942‚Äì1943, Chief of the Office of Civilian Defense's Research and Statistics Division * 1943‚Äì1945, director of the Foreign Economic Administration's Liberated Areas Division * 1946‚Äì1953, director of the Department of Commerce's International Economic Analysis Division, Office of International Trade. * 1964‚Äì1968, head of the Women's Bureau. In 1953, following her loyalty trial, Keyserling retired from her governmental position in the Commerce Department. She later returned to working for the government at a later date, as shown in her accepting the position of head of the Women's Bureau in 1964. Keyserling was the head of the Women's Bureau from 1964 to 1968. However, she was an Associate Director on the Council on Economic Progress before selected by President Johnson to be the head of the Women's Bureau in 1964. While in office she used the emphasis on improving the purchasing power of workers from the War on Poverty to justify legislation concerning a minimum wage and maximum hours for workers.  Red Scare  Keyserling was one of the many women working in the United States government that was challenged over her loyalty from 1930s to 1950s. In 1952 and 1953, Keyserling was put on a loyalty trial due to possible Communist leanings. It has been speculated that she was accused due to her husband Leon Keyserling. Another factor was that as a Keynesian economist her ideals went against one of the Red Scare's goals, the goal of rolling back the gains of the New Deal. The accusation that started the trail was made on February 9, 1952 by Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy stated that Keyserlying was a former member of ten Communist groups. Two months later, McCarthy stated that Keyserling had joined the communist party. It was later alleged the Keyserling perjured herself when denying being a part of communist activities. Prior to McCarthy stating she was a communist in 1952, Keyserling swore under oath that she was not a communist before the Dies Committee in 1942. When Keyserling swore that oath she was found to not have any evidence of being a communist. Also, previously in 1948 Keyserling faced loyalty hearings concerning Communist ties and activities. The majority of, these activities were connected to her brother in law George Marshall. Due to these allegations, Keyserling had to take a leave of absence from her job in the United States‚Äô Commerce Department until being found innocent of being a communist. In 1952, Keyserling was found to be guilty by the Commerce Department loyalty board. This decision was later overturned in 1953 on January 5. The information that led to her being found guilty was gained under the 1939 Hatch Act, which allowed for the FBI to collect information about Keyserling when she became a federal employee in 1940. Keyserling, when she was younger, was a part of circles the included communists. However, she did not interact with these groups while she worked for the government.  Women's advocacy  Keyserling was a key figure in the moderate or conservative portion of the feminist movement. Throughout her lifetime she was the president of the Women's National Democratic Club, a part of the Committee for Protective Labor Legislation of the President's Commission on the Status of Women, and the head of the Women's Bureau. Starting in the early 1930s, Keyserling was a part of a network of female experts and activists who tried to resolve social inequalities in gender, class, and race. Keyserling believed sex discrimination to be more serious then race discrimination. She advocated for women and their rights while heading the Women's Bureau. While head of the Women's Bureau she fought for women to be included in the War on Poverty Program. The War on Poverty Program was being created to help combat poverty in the United States by giving those eligible job training and further work opportunities backed by the United States Government. Many of these work opportunities were jobs paid for by the American Government Before intervening in the War on Poverty Program, women were excluded from the program. Keyserling was of the opinion, that women being excluded from the workplace had a negative impact on the economy<. Women would not have been eligible under the original wording of the document outlining the War on Poverty Program to have been a part of the program. While head of the Women's Bureau, Keyserling's actions led to the War Poverty Program including women. Being included in the War on Poverty Program gave women the same benefits as men concerning jobs and job training men gained from the program. Keyseling also worked with already formed Business and Professional Women's Clubs while head of the Women's Bureau to create and implement other such clubs in every state. By 1967 all fifty states had a Business and Professional Women's Club. Keyserling, oftentimes had to go to individual states to help the programs to be implemented. State governors, such as in Texas, had to be taught about the clubs by Keyserling to allow for them to become a recognized organization in their state. In the last few decades of her life, Keyserling was a part of Radcliffe's Women in the Federal Government Oral History Project. After becoming a feminist in the 1930s, Keyserling remained one until her death on June 11, 1997.

A pupil of Jules Massenet, Grand Prix de Rome in 1863, Levad√© wrote chamber music, melodies, religious music, drama and op√©ras comiques. He was very successful in his time.  Life  Levad√© was born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. At the age of 13 he entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he followed the solf√®ge classes of Albert Lavignac, Charles de B√©riot, Georges Mathias, and Auguste Bazille. A few years later, it is at Lavignac's that he met Erik Satie who dedicated one of his Ogives and one of his Gymnop√©dies to him. But it is especially with Jules Massenet that Levad√© reached the fullness of his talent. Among his students Massenet had an impressive number of Grand Prix de Rome. In 1911, the student paid tribute to his master by writing in the Annales politiques et litt√©rairesAnnales politiques et litt√©raires dated 17 December 1911: After Massenet's resignation in 1896, Levad√© attended the classes of Charles Lenepveu and obtained the Grand Prix de Rome in 1899 with his cantata Callirhoe to a text by Eug√®ne Ad√©nis. His public debut was quite rapid. As early as 1895 he produced a Japanese pantomime: Coeur de magots, a \\"sketch\\" given at the \\"Grand Guignol\\" in 1897, and a \\"salon opera\\" in 1903. But his success really began with a three-acts opera: The Heretics, a lyrical tragedy on a poem by Ferdinand H√©rold. In 1908, he composed the music for La Courtisane de Corinthe, to a text by Michel Carr√© and Paul Bilhaud which was staged in 1908 by Sarah Bernhardt, then Les Fian√ßailles de l'ami Fritz, after Erckmann-Chatrian in 1919. Other musical adaptations of literary texts followed, such as Le Capitaine Fracasse, libretto by √âmile Bergerat and Michel Carr√©, lyrical comedy from Th√©ophile Gautier's eponymous novel and in 1929, La Peau de chagrin, lyrical comedy in four acts after Balzac, libretto by Pierre Decourcelle and Michel Carr√©, then La R√¥tisserie de la reine P√©dauque, lyrical comedy in four acts based on the novel by Anatole France in 1934. Levad√© was also a composer of popular songs (J'ai cueilli le lys, 1912), symphonic music (Pr√©lude religieux for string orchestra), lullaby for piano and violin and religious music: Pr√©lude religieux for organ, Agnus Dei for choir, Psaume CXIII for solo, choir and orchestra.

Life  Narciso Sa√©nz D√≠ez Serra was born in Madrid. According to his birth registration he was the son of the businessman Alejandro Sa√©nz D√≠ez and his future wife, Carlota Mar√≠a Petra Serra Ortega. His paternity is widely ascribed to the soldier-writer Antonio Ros de Olano, however. After he grew up Narciso Serra decided to dispense with his paternal surname which, under Spanish naming conventions, would otherwise have been included as part of his own full name. He published his first comedy, \\"Mi mam√°\\" (\\"My Mum\\") in 1848. The play had its stage premier the same year and achieved success with audiences, although Serra did not succeed in establishing his own theatre company. It was also in 1848 that he published a volume of lyric poetry. As a young man he served in the army,Pascual, Pedro; Mart√≠nez Pascual (1994).

Serra participated in the Spanish Revolution of 1854 joining the generals Dulce, Ros de Olano and O'Donnell on 28 June 1854. He was wounded in the action against royalist troops at Vic√°lvaro. Subsequently, during the years of uneasy truce between the parties that began in 1856, he was rewarded by Queen Isabela II with a military promotion. The next year he was made a \\"Knight of Isabella the Catholic\\". In 1859, having reached the rank of a cavalry officer, he applied for and was granted an absolute discharge from the army. The cause was a progressive paralysis, attributed in some sources to a \\"brain ailment\\" (\\"dolencia de cerebro\\"). The circle of his theatrical friends included Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch, Juli√°n Romea and Francisco Camprod√≥n. As a young man he became known for a somewhat \\"Bohemian\\" lifestyle, known as a reveller with a weakness for women and gambling. On November 1861 he suffered an attack of Hemiparesis, apparently in the context of some degenerative condition, which left the left side of his body paralysed. Florencio Moreno Godino wrote in 1895 that \\"his whole body was paralysed except for the head and the right arm\\" (\\"qued√≥se paral√≠tico de todo el cuerpo, excepci√≥n hecha de la cabeza y del brazo derecho\\"). He was confined to a wheel chair. None of this prevented him from continuing to publish, however.Gies, David Thatcher (1996) The Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Spain. Cambridge University Press. He now entered government service, obtaining a ministry job. In 1864 he was elected to the position of theatre censor, a post from which he resigned in November 1866. He was reappointed in January 1867 and continued in post till censorship was abolished as part of the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" in 1868. Serra's financial situation deteriorated after 1868 and he died in relative poverty on 26 September 1877. His funeral took place at Madrid's Sacramental de Santa Mar√≠a (cemetery) during a day of heavy rain. Madrile√±os in attendance from the world of the arts included Jos√© Zorrilla, Ram√≥n de Campoamor y Campoosorio, Jos√© Echegaray, Cecilia Francisca Josefa B√∂hl de Faber (Fern√°n Caballero) and Eusebio Blasco.

He collaborated with writers such as Miguel Pastorfido and Salvador Mar√≠a Gran√©s and also, between 1848 and 1854, trod the boards as an actor. His dramatic output received positive reviews from writers such as Juan Valera y Alcal√°-Galiano and Francisco Miquel y Bad√≠a.

Biography Karin L√∂wenadler was born in London to Swedish parents and attended the Slade School of Art from 1933 to 1936. At the Slade she won prizes in both painting and sculpture and decided to abandon her original ambition to become a cartoonist and concentrate on sculpture. Jonzen continued her studies at the Royal Academy Stockholm and at the City and Guilds Art School in Kennington during 1939. That same year she won the Prix de Rome, but the beginning of World War II prevented her making use of the travelling scholarship it conferred. During the war she worked as a Civil Defence ambulance driver until she developed rheumatic fever and was given a medical discharge. While recovering Jonzen became convinced that modernism and abstract sculpture was not the way to advance her art and decided to focus on figurative works. The Gardener (1971), located by London Wall After the war Jonzen's figures and sculptures were bought by some important art collectors, including Robert Sainsbury and Kenneth Clark, although otherwise commercial galleries showed little interest in her work. In 1948 she won the Royal Society of British Sculptors' Feodora Gleichen Award for women artists. A number of high-profile public commissions followed. The Arts Council commissioned her to produce a sculpture for the newly built Southbank Centre and the World Health Organization commissioned works from her for its centres in New Delhi and Geneva. A standing figure was commissioned for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Jonzen entered three pieces for the 1968 Sculpture in the City exhibition which was part ot that year's City of London Festival. This led to her receiving two commissions from the Corporation of the City of London including her 1972 group Beyond Tomorrow outside the Guildhall. Jonzen was offered the commission on the basis of a small model and subsequently completed the full-size version but was in Sweden when the foundry casting was made. She was disappointed with the casting and had it re-cast, in bronze resin, at her own expense. This version greatly impressed Lord Blackford, a member of the Corporation, to the extant that he paid for a new bronze casting which is the version displayed outside the Guidhall. Jonzen's other commission from the Corporation was for The Gardiner, a piece designed to celebrate the work of the Corporation's Trees, Gardens and Open Spaces Committee. The chair of that committee, Frederick Cleary, was also the Treasurer of the Samuel Pepys Club and in that role he commissioned Jonzen to produce a bust of Pepys for Seething Lane Garden. Jonzen's figurative skills were greatly suited to church sculpture and the College Chapel at Selwyn College in Cambridge, Guildford Cathedral and St Mary-le-Bow in London all have figures by Jonzen. Subjects of her portrait busts include Paul Scofield, Max Von Sydow, Malcolm Muggeridge and Dame Ninette de Valois, as well as Sir Hugh Casson and Sir A. P. Herbert. The National Portrait Gallery in London holds her bronze bust of Learie Constantine, while the Tate collection includes her 1947/1948 terracotta Head of a Youth. Other works by Jonzen are also held by art galleries in Bradford, Glasgow, Brighton, Southend and in Melbourne, Australia.

The woman was found to have come from somewhere in South-East Asia, but despite an international police investigation, the identity of the woman and how she arrived at the location remained a mystery until 2019. The woman was identified in March 2019 through DNA testing.  Discovery  On Monday 20 September 2004 at 11:30 am, a man walking in the vicinity of Pen-y-ghent alerted the police to the discovery of the body of a dead woman. The man had discovered the body in a well-trafficked location on the Pennine Way between Pen-y-ghent and Horton in Ribblesdale in a stream called Sell Gill Beck, which flows into a cave called Sell Gill Hole. It was thought that the body had been in the stream for some time, and that the woman could have died up to three weeks prior to the discovery. The cause of death was not initially apparent, and no signs of violence were reported.  Description  The woman was believed to be of southeast-Asian origin, had dark, shoulder-length hair, and was about tall. Her age was estimated between 25 and 35 years. The woman had healthy teeth with a noticeable gap at the front. Her body was clothed in green jeans and a green-and-white-striped T-shirt; she also wore a wedding ring. The ring was 22-karat gold and made in Bangkok, Thailand. The woman had pierced ears, but no earrings were found. No shoes, warm outer clothing, or other personal effects were found at the site. The woman weighed but appeared to have gained weight in the years prior to her death.  Initial investigation  Immediately after the discovery, North Yorkshire Police commenced an extensive investigation. Police questioned walkers using the Pennine Way, conducted house-to-house enquires in the locality, and issued letters to local holiday accommodations that appealed for witnesses in multiple languages. Police investigated every sighting in the Yorkshire Dales of women matching the description of the unidentified body dating back to 1 August 2004. A postmortem was undertaken, which suggested the woman died between 31 August and 13 September, but it did not provide enough information to enable investigators to establish the cause of death. The postmortem indicated that the woman had probably been pregnant at some point during her life. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Martin stated that the death was unexplained rather than suspicious. A search of missing persons databases did not produce any matches. A number of countries were identified as the potential origin of the woman. These countries included Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Analysis of the body indicated that the woman had been in the UK for at least two years prior to her death and that she had probably lived in Cumbria, Lancashire, or the west Yorkshire Dales.  Subsequent investigations  In December 2004 the police produced an e-fit photograph of the woman, which was issued to the embassies of a number of Asian countries. At this time it was believed that the woman could have originated from the Philippines, China, or Korea. No meaningful response was received from this appeal. In February 2005 an appeal was made on the BBC programme Crimewatch. In May 2007 the inquest heard that the investigation found no evidence of trauma, assault, or drowning, and it recorded an open verdict. In 2011 the police announced that they were reopening the investigation of eight unsolved deaths. The Lady of the Hills was one of these cases along with the Sutton Bank body. In 2018 an appeal was made by the North Yorkshire Police. The appeal was made on Facebook in the Filipino, Thai, and English languages so that the messages could be shared internationally.  Identification  On 22 January 2019, a family in Thailand came forward in the belief that they knew the identity of the victim.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46994879 The woman had married a British man in 1991 and moved to north-west England in 1995. The mother of the woman had not heard from her daughter since 2004. On 19 March 2019, North Yorkshire Police revealed that they had identified the body, following DNA testing, as Lamduan Armitage (nee Seekanya). Armitage was married to British lecturer David Armitage (her second husband) in Thailand and moved to Portsmouth in 1991. David Armitage was located in 2019 and denied any involvement in his wife's death. The cause of death remains unknown but police have not ruled out murder.

Their programs include, Educare Chicago, a nationwide school network, and Home Visits for Homeless Families. They base their programs off of early childhood development research.  History  The Ounce of Prevention Fund was founded by businessman and philanthropist Irving B. Harris in 1982. Harris believed that time needed to be dedicated early on in the lives of children in Chicago's impoverished communities to fight the cycle of poverty. It is why The Ounce focuses on early childhood education, home visiting programs, lobbying, and research for early childhood development. Throughout the late 1980s The Ounce created and funded its early programs such as the Center for Successful Child Development, and its home visiting services. In 1983, The Ounce of Prevention Fund worked to reduce the economic costs associated with teen pregnancy and parenting by working with local Chicago community agencies. In 1991, Harriet Meyer, the then Executive Director of The Ounce, was appointed president of the nonprofit. As president of The Ounce, she lobbied for early childhood development programs. In 2010, Meyer stepped down and Diana Rauner became the organization's president. Prior to her appointment as president, Rauner served as the Executive Director and a board member for The Ounce. She followed Meyer's lead of lobbying for early childhood development programs and funding in her 2017 suit towards then governor of Illinois and husband Bruce Rauner due to a lack of funding by the state budget. In 2013, The Ounce disbursed around $17 million to early childhood agencies around the state.  Programs and partnerships  = Educare Chicago = Educare Chicago is a school on Chicago's South Side for children ages 0 to 5 that was founded by The Ounce and the Irving Harris Foundation in 2000. The Montessori-style curriculum of the school provides classes that focus on the emotional and academic development of children in the early stages of their lives. The school also puts emphasis on parent involvement in their child's emotional, social and academic development. After partnering with The Buffet Early Childhood Fund, the model used for Educare has been expanded to 24 other schools in the United States. = Home Visiting for Homeless Families Demonstration Project = The Home Visiting for Homeless Families Demonstration Project partners with providers of home visits in the Chicago community and homeless shelters to bring medical resources to homeless families. Started in Fall of 2013, the program focuses on helping homeless families get the medical attention and health-related resources they need. In the same year of its start, the Homeless Families Demonstration Project provided service to 160 families. From 2013 to 2018 the program encountered funding problems. = Parents Too Soon = Parents Too Soon is a program that provides a network of support for teen parents in Chicago. In this program, parent educators enter homes and give teen parents advice on how to best support their child's social, emotional, and cognitive growth based on research done by The Ounce. The program also helps parents set personal goals for themselves such as saving money, finishing high school, and job searching. = University of Chicago Urban Education Institute = The Ounce of Prevention Fund partnered with the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute (UEI) in 2009 to conduct further research and build education models that help children and families in low income areas succeed in and outside of school. The Ounce has collaborated with Illinois Governor's Office, Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, Children's Home and Aid, and Healthy Families Illinois to help Erikson Institute steer committee initiative and train home visiting staff.  Funding  The Ounce is a public and privately financed nonprofit with an annual budget of $74 million dollars. Some of its large funders include the Irving Harris Foundation, the Harris Family Foundation, the Robert McCormick Foundation, the Steans Family Foundation, Helen and Sam Zell, the Crown family, and the Buffett Early Childhood Fund. In 2014, The Ounce received a $10 million donation from the Zell Family Foundation. In 2016, the Pritzker Children's Initiative, run by J. B.

Cierium is shown to the lower centre. Cierium or Kierion () was a town and polis (city-state) in the district of Thessaliotis in ancient Thessaly, which according to some ancient commentators, such as Stephanus of Byzantium was the successor to the Homeric Arne, the chief town of the Aeolian Boeotians in Thessaly, from which they emigrated to Boeotia. History According to Thucydides, the Boeotians had occupied the territory of Boeotia when, sixty years after the Trojan War, they had been expelled from the city of Arne by the Thessalians. Archemachus of Euboea and other authors add that only a few Boeotians decided to stay in Arne and remain as servants of the Thessalians and were called penestae. Stephanus of Byzantium identified this Arne located in Thessaly with the city of Cierium, which was accepted by William Smith, writing in the 19th century, and by some current researchers,Jorge Mart√≠nez de Tejada Garaiz√°bal, Instituciones, sociedad, religi√≥n y l√©xico de Tesalia de la antig√ºedad desde la √©poca de la independencia hasta el fin de la edad antigua (siglos VIII AC-V DC), tesis doctoral, pp.449-451. Madrid: Universidad Complutense de Madrid (2012). others place Arne at Magoula Makria. a site nearby, but not at, Cierium. In the Second Macedonian War, in the year 198 BCE after the capture of Phaloria by Roman troops and their allies, the cities of Cierium and of Metropolis sent embassies that offered the surrender of their cities and thus obtained clemency. In the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War, Cieriumwas taken by the army of Antiochus III the Great, together with Metropolis and adjacent fortresses. Shortly thereafter Roman consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, in his advance through Thessalian territory, received delegates from the cities of Metropolis and Cierium that again, as in the Second Macedonian War, offered to surrender their cities shortly before the Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC). The site of Cierium is in the modern village of Pyrgos Kieriou (Œ†œçœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒöŒπŒµœÅŒØŒøœÖ), in the municipal unit of Arni, municipality of Sofades, periphery of Karditsa, Thessaly. Rediscovery and situation The site of Cierium was first discovered by William Martin Leake, who from inscriptions and coins found on the spot has proved that it was sited by the modern villages of Pyrgos Kieriou and Mataragka (ŒúŒ±œÑŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ±), between the Enipeus or Apidanus, and a tributary of that river. The territory of Cierium adjoined that of Metropolis; and we learn from an inscription cited by Leake that the adjustment of their boundaries was a frequent subject of discussion between the two people. William Smith cites as evidence of the identification of Arne with Cierium an inscription, which mentions Poseidon Cuerius (ŒöŒøœÖŒ≠œÅŒπŒøœÇ), a name evidently connected with the river Cuarius or Coralius in Boeotia. The expelled Boeotians gave this name to the river, and founded upon its banks a temple of Athena Itonia in memory of their former abode in Thessaly. Smith concludes that the river upon which Cierium stood was called Cuerius, Cuarius or Curalius, more especially as Strabo mentions a river Curalius in Thessaly, flowing through the territory of Pharcadon in Histiaeotis past the temple of Athena Itonia into the Peneius; in which the only inaccuracy appears to be that he makes it flow directly into the Peneius. Pausanias also appears to speak of this temple of Athena Itonia, since he describes it as situated between Pherae and Larissa, which is sufficient to indicate the site of Cierium. Leake supposes with much probability that the name of Arne may have been disused by the Thessalian conquerors because it was of Boeotian origin, and that the new appellation may have been taken from the neighbouring river, since it was not an uncommon custom to derive the name of a town from the river upon which it stood. Cierium is not mentioned under this name in history; but it occurs under the form Pierium, which is undoubtedly only another appellation of the same place, œÄ and Œ∫ being, according to Smith, often interchangeable. Pierium was probably the general, and Cierium the local form. Pierium is first mentioned by Thucydides. It is called Piera and Pieria by Livy, in both of which passages it is mentioned in connection with Metropolis. In an Armenian translation of Eusebius we find the name of Amyntas of Pieria in the list of the strategoi who governed Thessaly after the battle of Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BCE). Claudius Aelianus speaks of Pierus in Thessaly.Claudius Aelianus, N. An. 3.37.

It was co-founded by Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate and her father, Ziauddin. The stated goal of the organization is to ensure 12 years of free, safe and quality education for every girl. , the organization has 48 staff and supports 58 advocates working across Afghanistan, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. History The first contribution to Malala Fund in 2013 came from Angelina Jolie who gave a $200,000 personal donation, which was used to fund girls' education where Malala is from in Pakistan‚Äôs Swat Valley. In 2014, Malala Fund helped build an all-girls secondary school in rural Kenya and provided school supplies and continued education in Pakistan for children fleeing conflict in North Waziristan and the floods of 2014. In 2015, when the government of Sierra Leone closed schools due to the Ebola epidemic, Malala Fund bought radios and created classrooms for 1,200 marginalized girls to continue their education. Building on Malala's advocacy for girls in Nigeria, Malala Fund pledged full scholarships to Chibok schoolgirls freed from the abduction by Boko Haram to complete their secondary education. On 12 July 2015, her 18th birthday, Malala announced funding through Malala Fund of a secondary school in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, for Syrian refugees. In 2016, Malala visited Dadaab Refugee Camp for her birthday and attended the graduation of refugee girls from a mentorship program on leadership and life skills supported by Malala Fund. In December 2016, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $4 million to help Malala Fund launch the Education Champion Network to support education champions in developing countries. In 2017, Malala Fund significantly expanded investment projects that Newsweek described as, \\"education advocacy programs run by local people ‚Äî the kind Yousafzai and her father led when they lived in Pakistan ‚Äî and will disburse up to $10 million a year over the next decade.\\" New grants included a project in Afghanistan to support the recruitment and training of teachers to fill spots in the country's overcrowded classrooms and supporting local activists in Nigeria to campaign for increasing public education from 9 years to 12 years. In 2018, Apple Inc. partnered with Malala Fund to fund expansion to India and Latin America and provide technology, curriculum assistance and policy research with a goal of educating more than 100,000 girls. In addition, a connection will be established in Brazil with the Apple Developer Academy. Programs =Education Champion Network= Malala Fund supports local advocates and programs to advance girls‚Äô secondary education around the world. The current priority countries for Malala Fund are Afghanistan, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. One of the champions for Pakistan is Gulalai Ismail, chairperson of Aware Girls an organisation with which Yousafzai trained in 2011. =Research and Advocacy= Malala, Ziauddin, Malala Fund staff, members of the Education Champion Network and young education activists participate in conferences and meet with political leaders to advocate for girls' education. The advocacy goals are to increase funding for girls' education and to remove the barriers keeping girls from school, such as early marriage, child labor, conflict and gender discrimination. Malala Fund has conducted research on the impact of girls' secondary education in collaboration with Brookings Institution, World Bank and Results for Development. In June 2018, Malala Fund helped secure a $2.9 billion commitment for girls' education from G7 countries and the World Bank. =Girls' Voices= In July 2018, Malala Fund launched Assembly, a digital publication with stories by girls, for girls.

There was a psychiatric ward which was moved to Colditz Castle in 1829 under Christian August F√ºrchtegott Hayner. The author Karl May served a sentence here from 1870 to 1874. In the Nazi era, it became notorious as a detention centre for political opponents, convicted for preparation of high treason, undermining military morale or just listening to banned Feindsender radio stations. Among the inmates were resistance fighters like Eva Schulze-Knabe, who was convicted by the People's Court in 1942 and freed at the end of World War II. When the NKVD special camps were handed over from the Soviet Military Administration to the East German government in 1950, numerous NKVD detainees were transferred to Waldheim for further detention and for trial. From April to June 1950, the Communist authorities put about 3,400 alleged war and Nazi criminals to the so-called Waldheim Trials, ending with previously prepared and long prison terms and 32 death sentences.

The limestones of the approximately thin formation were deposited in a lacustrine to paludal environment. The formation provides many fossil mammals and amphibians, reptiles, fresh water snails and fish.  Description  The type locality of Black Crow lies a few km north-east of Bogenfels Ghost Town, in the central part of the Tsau//Khaeb National Park (old name ‚Äì Sperrgebiet) in Namibia.Pickford, 2018e, p.81 The Black Crow Limestone with a total thickness of about ,Pickford, 2015, p.107 is an Early Eocene stratigraphic unit of the Sperrgebiet that was formed in a small basin cutting into the dolomites of the Proterozoic Gariep Group. The top of the formation is formed by an erosional unconformity at the base of the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene Blaubok Conglomerate. The fauna from the Black Crow Limestone, especially the arsinoithere Namatherium blackcrowense and the reithroparamyid rodent Namaparamys inexpectatus indicate a Late Ypresian or Early Lutetian age for the deposits. The limestones are likely to be older than 42.5 Ma on the basis of radio-isotopic dates obtained from phonolite cobbles reworked from lavas considered to have erupted later than the limestone deposition. The carbonates could be as old as 47 ¬± 1 Ma, i.e. Late Ypresian to Early Lutetian.Pickford, 2018d, p.64 Abundant pedotubules in the formation suggest accumulation in a swampy setting. There is a thick bed of carbonatite breccia intercalated in the fossiliferous limestone which indicates that carbonate deposition occurred contemporaneously with volcanic activity at the Ystervark Carbonatite Centre to the east of Black Crow,Pickford, 2015, p.105 and other volcanoes in the region, which periodically injected vast quantities of carbonate into the sub-aerial terrestrial ecosystem.Morales & Pickford, 2018, p.72  Fossil content  Various fossils have been recovered from the formation. The fossil land snails from the Black Crow Limestone, even though they are not very diverse, show biogeographic affinities with present-day southwestern Africa (Western Cape in South Africa and Western Namibia) and they suggest that at the time of deposition, the region lay within a zone of summer rainfall rather than winter rainfall.Pickford, 2018a, p.19 The paleoclimate has been interpreted as hot and humid, contrasting with the arid desert of today.Dauteuil et al., 2018, p.6 The following fossils are reported from the formation:Mein & Pickford, 2018, p.39Black Crow at Fossilworks.org ;Mammals * Diamantochloris inconcessus - lower molars, maxillary fragments with premolars and molarsPickford, 2015, p.109 * Glibia namibiensis * Namahyrax corvus - skull, mandible, isolated teethPickford, 2018e, p.83 * Namalestes gheerbranti - isolated teeth and maxillaMorales & Pickford, 2018, p.75 * Namaparamys inexpectatus - isolated molar, premolar, calcaneumMein & Pickford, 2018, p.41 * Namatherium blackcrowense - skull * Notnamaia bogenfelsi - maxilla * Tsaukhaebmys calcareus - isolated teeth, mandible, post-cranial bones * Zegdoumys namibiensis - upper molar * Pterodon sp. - mandible * cf.

Research Susan Kidwell's research focuses on the formation of the fossil record. Early in her career, she explored the close connection between the formation of dense fossil concentrations and sequence stratigraphy. Her studies demonstrated the importance of slow sedimentation rates in allowing fossil remains to be concentrated. Subsequently, she was one of the pioneers in the field of experimental taphonomy, used to understand how recently dead organisms are preserved in the fossil record. Currently, Kidwell's research emphasizes how very young fossil records, that is, remains that are currently or recently accumulating on the seafloor or the land, can be used to understand how human activities have affected ecosystems.

Shot simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu, it stars Vijay Deverakonda, making his Tamil debut, playing the lead role along with Mehreen Pirzada. Sathyaraj, Nassar, Karunakaran, Priyadarshi Pullikonda, Yashika Aannand, M. S. Bhaskar, and Rajendran, among others portray supporting roles. Produced by K. E. Gnanavel Raja, under his production house Studio Green, the film was adapted from novel Vettattam by Shan Karuppusamy who is also involved in the film's screenplay. The film revolves around Varun, the son of a chief minister, who rises to his father's position after corruption charges are brought against the father. Varun, who has no political experience, soon finds himself stuck to the chair for a longer time. The musical score and soundtrack are composed by Sam C. S. and the cinematography and editing were handled by Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran and Raymond Derrick Crasta. The film premiered on 5 October 2018 in India and on 4 October 2018 in the United States. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and was a failure at the box office.  Plot  Varun Subramanyam (Vijay Deverakonda) is a video game designer living in the UK. He is the son of Vinodhan Subramanyam, (Vasudev in Telugu) the long-time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (Andhra Pradesh in Telugu). Varun, visits Chennai (Hyderabad) for his birthday to be celebrated in the orphanage which he runs and also to see his little half-sister. Later he goes out partying, but a heavy police convoy nabs him by 1am and brings him home for a shocking news: Varun is to be sworn in as the new Chief Minister by 5am to protect the party, as Vinodhan is to be sentenced guilty in a corruption case the next day. Despite his reservations, Varun is sworn in as Chief Minister. Despite being head of government, CM Varun, who has no idea about all this, accepts for it, provided that his father will be out in bail within two weeks and remains confined in a self-imposed house arrest. Varun actually does nothing except play video games in his room & signs the documents provided by the Chief Secretary. Unfortunately, consequences turn plates negatively to Vinodhan, who is sentenced to prison in the high court appeal until end of case. After Vinodhan gets arrested, riots take place in the city. In the riots, a bus gets burnt in which a little schoolgirl dies in the fire. Varun, who was out to meet his guru Mahendran (Mahindra in Telugu), goes to the spot where the bus was burnt. He asks Mahendran to meet him at the spot. He is heartbroken upon seeing the wails of the little girl's mother. He then realizes the importance of his position and stops the riots, by threatening, in an immediate press meeting on the accident spot. Unfortunately, this is not liked by the opposition party led by Varadarajan (K. S. G. Venkatesh). Varun then gains the name \\"Rowdy CM\\" given by the opposition party after being mocked as \\"Dummy CM\\". This incident paves way for Varun to gain support, and win the by-election in his father's constituency to become an MLA. On the other side, Vinodhan thinks the reason why he passed on the post to his son reason was due to the advice of a swamiji who predicted that there is a threat to Vinodhan's position and that he has to resign, while the position has to be taken up by someone of his own bloodline. Vinodhan doubts if Varun is his own son because years ago, Varun's mother realized that Vinodhan was a famous actor at that time and was cheating on her with other co-actresses. During a heated argument, she tells him that she might also be cheating on him, which angers him, and he almost chokes her to death. The next day she is found dead, having taken 23 sleeping pills. Thus, Vinodhan never got the answer if Varun was ever his son. Also, due to sudden heavy rain, a dam was required to be opened without prior notice opening. The dam opens, thus killing many lives. It turned out that the officials were waiting for the CM's order. Varun mocks them by telling them to wait until Vinodhan is released from jail, but he later acts immediately, creating awareness and asking the youths to help; thus, when the dam was opened, it only destroyed properties but not lives. Also, Mahendran talks to Varun and his daughter Swathi about his first love, which was broken due to his friend's selfishness. When Varun stands for the post as CM, a video of him which was took earlier that had him kissing a foreigner in a nightclub party is released, but in reality, he was drugged by the opposition party. Varun cleverly clears his name with the help of director Murugadoss. Also, the foreigner tells him that she is an actress who joined Varun to do a short film. Meanwhile, Vinodhan is attacked in a bomb blast by some anonymous men and gets admitted in the hospital, which leads him into a coma. Now, since Varun has to take the responsibility as the CM, he goes through his father's things, in which he finds a diary with codes and bank accounts. Varun comes to know that the case that his father was fighting for involved a property of 10,000 crores. He, along with his friend Wong, investigates about it. Varun sends Wong to Panama to hack the account of the fake owners of the property and transfer the money to his account. Vinodhan, hearing his daughter Narmada talking to his second-wife about Varun winning the temporary election and the clean sweep of the bank accounts, wakes up from his coma and asks for Varun. Thus, when he visits, Vinodhan acts in a way to gain his son's pity. Believing this, he tells it to Mahendran, to which he replies that his father was an actor and there is yet to come. Meanwhile, a chain of events begin to happen: Swathi meets with an accident; Wong ends up being caught in Panama but somehow escapes; and the foreigner commits suicide and blames it on Varun, who is searched by the police to be arrested, but Varun, with the help of Varadarajan's daughter Kayal, stays in her house, where treatment is given to Swathi. Now, the cunning Vinodhan announces one of his goons as the CM instead of Bhai a very well-experienced friend of his. Vinothan and his friend then have a heated argument. Varun, who has hacked the CCTV footage of the hospital, calls and tells his father's friend to tell the followers to vote for him because he has all the money of his party's followers. It is also shown that the swamiji brainwashed Vinodhan for a $20,000,000 deal. Varun wins the trust vote 122 to 110 (in absentia) and retains his job as CM, and Mahendran tells him that he loved Vinodhan's wife before they got married, but Vinodhan broke their relationship to marry Mahendran's lover for her wealth. Mahendran admits that he did not meet her after that. He also said that Varun was Vinodhan's own son and not any other's. Vinodhan realizes his mistake and asks Varun to forgive him. Varun then continues his duty as the CM and decides to bring many changes in the State and also win the next election by people's true votes rather than bribing them .

He is there in almost all frames and along with Nasser and Sathyaraj, the young superstar holds the film together. NOTA, by and large, is enjoyable, racy and relevant to its time.\\" * India Today, gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars stating NOTA could have been a great political thriluler if the director had done away with cinematic clich√©s. Vijay Deverakonda is the only saving grace in director Anand Shankar's NOTA, which has many unfeasible ideas.\\" * Behindwoods rated the film 2.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Vijay Deverakonda's 'NOTA' is a watchable political thriller. More focus on the political factors could have made the film intense.\\" * Sify rated the film 3 out of 5, stating \\"NOTA is thrilling and gripping. Its a film that we recommend for the superb acting, and for the exciting dramatic highs. Watch it to understand why Anand Shankar is one of the most exciting voices in Tamil cinema today.\\" * Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion reviewed it as \\"The film is now merely a watchable one, kept afloat by scenes like the one where the city‚Äôs youths become government officials. It gives you hope. It‚Äôs only a movie. It‚Äôs a band-aid on a gushing artery. But it gives you hope.\\" * Hindustan Times rated the film 2.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Vijay Devarakonda‚Äôs political drama works purely as the scenes rely more on reminding audiences of real life situations than showing them splendid performances.\\" *The Indian Express rated the film 2 out of 5, stating that \\"Vijay Deverakonda plays his role with a swag. And Nassar stands out with his performance as a corrupt politician with a grotesque nose. Mehreen Pirzada is nearly non-existent. Anand should be appreciated for not including a dreamy song just so she will get something to do in the film. Sanchana Natarajan and Sathyaraj play their given roles without any rewarding moment to shine. NOTA is a better political drama than Bharat Ane Nenu. But, is that enough?\\" = Box office = The film has reportedly collected 11.10 crore Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 4.50 crore in Tamil Nadu, 5.15 crore in Karnataka, 1.70 crore in other parts of India and 2.45 crore in the US in the opening weekend.

Jacob Francis Mudenda is the current Speaker of the National Assembly of Zimbabwe and a member of the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). A longtime schoolteacher and lawyer, Mudenda joined the Zimbabwe political scene after it gained independence from the British in 1980. Mudenda is well known for his relationship with former president, Robert Mugabe, along with the rise and fall of his political career after the Willowgate scandal.  Background  Jacob Francis Mudenda was born in Zimbabwe in 1949. Mudenda earned numerous degrees before joining the workforce. Mudenda earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of South Africa while majoring in English and education. He followed this degree by achieving his Bachelor of Laws honour degree from the University of Zimbabwe. In addition, he went back to school a third time to receive a Postgraduate Diploma in Law from the University of Zimbabwe. After gaining his second diploma from the University of Zimbabwe, Mudenda went on to practice law and teach in Zimbabwe until his decision to enter politics.  Early political career  Upon independence in 1980 from British control, Mudenda was selected by the Mugabe government regime as a district administrator. Through connections to Mugabe personally and good results, Mudenda was soon promoted to provincial administrator and provincial governor. In 1984, after continued success in politics, Mudenda was named resident minister for the government when the position was created. The appointment left Mudenda in charge of the Matabeleland North Province. The new position, as spokesperson for Matabeleland North, the second most populous province in Zimbabwe, continued Mudenda's rise in Mugabe's circle. While holding this position, Mudenda, Mugabe and Zimbabwe as a nation took significant fire for the incident known as Gukurahundi. The incident, from early 1983 to late 1987 left over 20,000 individuals dead, and Mudenda is considered to have been Mugabe's line of contact through the period.  Willowgate scandal and aftermath  Willowvale, the site of the incident, is found South West of Harare. In the late 1980s, Mudenda, along with other members of the Zimbabwe government, were implicated in a scandal involving the illegal sales of cars. Mudenda, along with the other individuals involved, purchased vehicles from a legal importer in Willowvale at a low rate and would sell the vehicles at a highly inflated price. Mugabe, and many other politicians were involved in the investigation. Mudenda was found to have made more than 100,000 Zimbabwe dollars ($51,000) in the purchase and resale of one vehicle. The scandal ended the political careers of many individuals, including Maurice Nyagumbo. Mudenda, however, was able to make his way back into politics after years away from serving as a government official. In his time away from politics, Mudenda spent significant time establishing his law firm. The firm, Mudenda Attorneys Legal Practitioners, still practices in Bulawayo today.  Return to politics  In February, 2013 Mudenda stepped back into the public sphere with his appointment as the chairman of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC). The return to politics did not come without controversy. Some in Zimbabwe felt that Mudenda's appointment did not follow constitutional procedures. Mudenda's appointment lasted only a short period of time, however, as he was elected the Speaker of the House on July 31 of the same year. On September 3, 2013 Mudenda took his position replacing former Speaker, Lovemore Moyo Mudenda has remained in the same position since his appointment in 2013.

It is situated eight miles south of Port Angeles, Washington within Olympic National Park. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Angeles, to the west. Klahhane Ridge connects these two peaks. Travelers on the scenic Hurricane Ridge Road traverse the lower south slope of Rocky Peak en route to the Hurricane Ridge visitor center. The mountain was named Rocky Peak by local people from the time of the earliest settlers in the area. Precipitation runoff from the north side of the peak drains into Rocky Creek, whereas the south slope drains into Morse Creek, thence into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Climate Rocky Peak from southwest Set in the north-central portion of the Olympic Mountains, Rocky Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

She is known for her award-winning work on a method to increase food security in drought stricken areas that won the 2016 Google Science Fair. Since 2018, she has attended Stanford University as an undergraduate.  The Innovation  Kiara was sixteen years old at the time of her win at the Google Science Fair. She is known as the sole founder of her project titled: \\"No More Thirsty Crops.\\" In response to one of South Africa's worst droughts in 45 years, with the lowest ever rainfall since 1904 and in 2015, the country only receiving 66% of the annual average rainfall, did Kiara start her research. SAPs absorb and carry about 300 times its weight in liquid relative to their own mass. When a SAP is cross-linked with polymerization, the product is water retaining hydrogels that act as a reservoir of collected water in soil. However, these SAPs are not biodegradable, costly and full of acrylic acid, sodium hydroxide and other chemicals. Kiara developed a unique super-absorbent polymer that holds hundreds of times its weight in water when stored in soil. It is biodegradable, inexpensive and free of harmful chemicals, unlike the manmade materials currently used. The polymer, made entirely from waste products, improves the environment, increases the chance for plants to sustain growth by 84% during a drought and can increase food security by 73% in disaster-struck areas.  Activities  Kiara has often spoken out on the importance of diversifying the STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields to include young girls. As a speaker at TEDx and Forbes Africa she has identified herself as an influential speaker. In September 2017, Kiara was a speaker at the Lead S.A Change Makers Conference.

She was honored as a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1983. Examples of her weaving are housed in the permanent collections of the Birmingham Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of International Folk Art, among others. Early life Ada Vilcan was born on July 31, 1924, on the Chitimacha Reservation, near Charenton, Louisiana, to Jane Bernard and Henry Vilcan. The fourth child in the family, her siblings were Alvin, Hollansworth, Esta/Esther, Raymond and Janet. Through the eighth grade, Thomas attended the reservation elementary school, where she also learned the traditional basket weaving techniques of her tribe from elders, Christine Paul and her sister-in-law Pauline. The baskets woven by Chitimacha women are unique in that the patterns on the inside and outside are different, as two separate baskets are woven and joined at the rim. Using split cane, known locally as piya, dyed with natural walnut, \\"la passiance\\" plant root and lime to produce the traditional black, red and yellow colors, the strips are woven to produce designs of traditional animals of the bayou. Alligators, blackbird's and cow's eyes, hearts, perch, snakes, and turtles are recurring motifs. The plain interior basket is woven first and once the rim is reached, the basket is turned and woven from the rim back to the bottom bringing in the colored design. Career After graduating from the reservation school, Vilcan moved to New Orleans, where she worked in an aircraft plant dedicated to the war effort. Though schools were segregated and Native Americans were not allowed to attend black or white high schools, government policy allowed plant workers to attend night school. Working by day and attending school at night, Vilcan was able to earn her high school diploma. Upon completing her schooling, she traveled the country, working at various jobs in Washington, D. C., New York City and Miami, Florida. In Miami, she met and married a jeweler and former New York City port official, Charles Thomas, with whom she would have three sons: Arthur, Charles Henry and Raymond. When her husband died, Thomas returned to the Chitimacha Reservation in 1970, to raise her young sons. While they attended school, she revived the basket weaving craft she had learned as a child. The poverty which had plagued the tribe during the Great Depression when she left the area, had been replaced by prosperity with the growth in the oil industry. While the growth helped her tribal people economically, it also led to abandonment of their traditional crafts. Determined to save their unique basket weaving techniques, Thomas partnered with Stephen Richmond of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to prepare a show held at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Richmond helped her secure funds to teach others the techniques, though she had little success in the early days. In 1983, she was one of the artisans honored as a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts. Thomas taught basket weaving techniques at schools in Charenton and attended many festivals, like the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Folklife Festival hosted by the Smithsonian, to both show her works and demonstrate the craft. In her later years, she produced works primarily for privately held collections and museums. Death and legacy Thomas died on September 6, 1992, in Charenton. Examples of her weaving are housed in the permanent collections of the Birmingham Museum of Art, the Louisiana Folklife Program, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of International Folk Art of Santa Fe, New Mexico and the collections of the Department of the Interior.

Early life Brumby grew up at an outstation called Victory Downs near to Pukatja (then known as Ernabella) with his mother, father, brother and sister. Early jobs included working at a cattle station called Mount Cavanagh near Kulgera over the threshold of the Northern Territory, where he mustered bullocks, fixed fences and looked after the cows. Career The first time he picked up a paintbrush was in the Ninuku Arts centre, an Aboriginal art and craft centre established in 2008. He produced work almost every day from then, saying he was spontaneously documenting the life of his people. In a short period of time his paintings gained significant attention and were acquired by notable public collections, including the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia and Queensland Art Gallery. His work became collectable quickly. Sharing Country, the show Brumby was involved in at Olsen Gruin, New York, in 2017 was rated among the top ten of the hottest summer group shows to see that year by Artnet. =Style= Brumby's work references symbols frequently used in rock and cave paintings around Uluru and Kata Tjuta. His paintings have a lively, raw character, displaying a powerful communication with his culture and his people. His love of colour makes use of a wide range of hues, but he uses delicate brush strokes in his work. Personal life Sandy met his wife in Pukatja and for some time they settled in the Amata community. Eventually they moved on to Pipalyatjara, before the Kalka and Pipalyatjara communities were fully established. Here they had two children and brought them up in this area.

The type species is Selenocara groenlandica, described by Gunnar S√§ve-S√∂derbergh in 1935 on the basis of skull bones from the Lower Triassic Wordie Creek Formation of Greenland. S√§ve-S√∂derbergh originally described it as a new species of Wetlugasaurus. The original material was redescribed in 1997 by Hans C. Bjerring, who transferred Wetlugasaurus groenlandicus to the separate genus named Selenocara. Bjerring listed the quadrate condyles which were about level with the occipital condyles (both transversally and horizontally), the orbitofacial openings wholly visible through the orbitopalatine openings when viewed ventrally, and the long axes of each orbitofacial opening directed toward the ipsilateral auditive incisure as the characters justifying the exclusion of S. groenlandica from the genus Wetlugasaurus. Bjerring stated that the generic name is derived from the Greek words selene, i.e. moon, and kara, i.e. head; the name honors paleontologist Eigil Nielsen, who went among contemporary Greenland explorers by the sobriquet of M√•nen, the Danish word for the Moon. Damiani (2001) disagreed with Bjerring's arguments in favor of regarding Selenocara as a genus distinct from Wetlugasaurus. The author stated that in Wetlugasaurus groenlandicus the occipital condyles clearly lie well forward of the quadrate condyles; in addition, Damiani did not consider other characters listed by Bjerring to be of signifact taxonomic importance. Damiani maintained W. groenlandicus as a species belonging to the genus Wetlugasaurus. On the other hand, Novikov (2016) maintained Selenocara as a genus distinct from Wetlugasaurus. In addition, the author described the second species of the genus Selenocara, S. rossica, on the basis of an incomplete skull from the Lower Triassic Sukhorechka Formation (Orenburg Oblast of Russia) and skull fragments from the Lower Triassic sediments of the Orenburg Oblast and Samara Oblast of Russia.

Opened in 1956, it was the largest retail development in the state of Florida at the time of its construction. The original complex included two supermarkets and two variety stores, plus a Belk department store. It also underwent multiple expansions in its history, the first of which added a Jordan Marsh department store and an enclosed mall concourse. Further expansion in 1973 added a second enclosed wing and a relocation of Belk, while Ivey's was added in 1983 and sold to Dillard's in 1990. The center's vacancy increased in the early 1990s due to competition from Orlando Fashion Square and complexities with the property's layout, with Jordan Marsh, Dillard's, and Belk all closing between 1991 and 1995. A renovation between 1995 and 1996 restructured the complex into an open-air power center. Since 2001, it has been owned and managed by Weingarten Realty, and major tenants include Total Wine & More, Hobby Lobby, Ross Dress for Less, Staples, Bealls Outlet, Marshalls, Old Navy, Big Lots, Stein Mart, Barnes & Noble, and Petco. History Groundbreaking for the center began in mid-1954. The site chosen for the center was the corner of Colonial Drive (Florida State Road 50) and Bumby Avenue, on land previously used as a cow pasture. Overall construction costs were estimated at $3,000,000 (). Morris Lapidus served as architect, while development, construction, contracting, and engineering were handled by the R. M. Thompson Co. of Clearwater. The firm of Michael R. Sudakow financed the project and Howard D. Spencer handled leasing. At the time, it was the largest retail development in the state of Florida. Representatives of the Sudakow firm said that the site for the center was chosen because they felt that Orlando, being in the center of the state, was poised for significant growth in population and retail development. The specific location was chosen because of its proximity to the Orlando market's center of population at the time. The interior mall of Colonial Plaza in the 1960s. Colonial Plaza opened for business on January 31, 1956. The center included two supermarkets: a Publix, described by The Orlando Sentinel as the \\"largest supermarket in central Florida\\", and A&P;, whose store was described by that chain's vice-president of operations for the Southeastern United States area as \\"large enough to serve the needs of residents in the east area of Orlando.\\" Two variety store chains also had locations in the center: W. T. Grant, whose location was their second in the Orlando area, and a smaller McCrory, which was the forty-first in the state of Florida. Other notable tenants upon opening included a dry cleaner, a shoe repair shop, a television and appliance store, a camera shop, several local clothing stores, a Walgreens pharmacy which had relocated from downtown Orlando, and two national shoe stores: Kinney Shoes and Thom McAn. All of the stores opened to a specially designed sidewalk, which was tinted green to reduce glare, and protected by overhangs from each store. The center's parking lot had over 2,000 spaces, and was illuminated by mercury-vapor lamps. Overall, the center had a total of of shop space at the time, with over 24 shops in total. Opening ceremonies included presentations from city dignitaries and a United States Marine Corps color guard, performances by a local band, free candy for all patrons, and a prize drawing with a grand prize of a Plymouth Plaza. More than 50,000 shoppers were predicted to visit on opening day, with an estimated average of 10 cars using each parking spot daily. Two months after the rest of the center opened, a Belk department store opened as well. It was the largest department store in Orlando at the time, including departments for men's, women's, and children's clothing and footwear, along with jewelry, gardening, sporting goods, patio furniture, a key and lock shop, and a sandwich shop. In 1961 and 1962, the center underwent its first expansion, consisting of 30 new storefronts facing an enclosed, air- conditioned mall concourse, and ending in a Jordan Marsh department store. This expansion increased the size of the property to and over 57 stores, making it the largest shopping center in Florida at the time. Jordan Marsh's store featured a mix of \\"tropical colors\\" and pastel tones, along with Venetian glass and rosewood paneling. Jordan Marsh had originally wanted to locate downtown, but chose to locate at Colonial Plaza instead as the property owners of their intended downtown location had raised their rates. It was also the first four-story department store in Orlando, and stewardesses of Eastern Air Lines were present to instruct shoppers on the use of escalators. The enclosed portion began at the existing strip's middle, extending backward from W. T. Grant to the Jordan Marsh store along a corridor of stores. It was decorated with lampposts, lanterns, planters with palm trees, and brick and redwood flooring. To accommodate the expansion, the parking lot was expanded to a capacity of 15,000 cars. The majority of the stores in this section were local and regional stores, except for 5-7-9 and Lane Bryant. Clinton Gamble was the architect of this expansion, and construction was handled by Frank J. Rooney of Fort Lauderdale. Costs of the expansion were estimated at $2,900,000 (). To accommodate for the anticipation of increased shopping mall traffic, a traffic light was installed on Colonial Drive and Coy Drive, the next intersection to the east of Bumby Avenue and closest to main mall access from Colonial Drive. Following this expansion, Sudakow announced that a 1,200-seat movie theater (now occupied by The Plaza Live, a performance hall) would be built by Florida State Theaters Inc. on an outparcel facing Bumby Avenue. Colonial Plaza marked a shift in shopping patterns for the Orlando market, as many major retailers that had been previously operational downtown had moved either to it or to other suburban developments. Among the stores to move out of downtown Orlando in favor of a suburban location was Sears, which built across from the plaza in 1963. In late 1965 and early 1966, the shopping center held a \\"birthday sale\\" honoring the center's tenth year of business, which included mall-wide sales, a petting zoo, and an exhibition on gems and minerals. At the time, Spencer noted that the center drew shoppers from a 100-mile radius, and that further growth around the property had ensued, including a Goodyear tire service center, a bank, and a bowling alley. =1970s‚Äì1980s: South Mall and Ivey's= A second expansion was announced in 1972, consisting of a second mall concourse behind the Jordan Marsh store, and leading to a newer, larger Belk department store. This expansion, known as the South Mall, would bring the mall's overall size to and over 100 shops, and had a projected cost of $6,000,000 (). Coinciding with this expansion, the existing property was refurbished with new lighting, floors, and ceilings. The new location of Belk and the South Mall both opened in 1973. Among the new tenants in the South Mall were Casual Corner, Waldenbooks, Spencer Gifts, and relocations of Kinney Shoes and 5-7-9. The new Belk location had more than double the floor space of its prior location, reflecting the company's move toward larger stores. Store managers noted that the new location would carry more women's designer clothing and sportswear, in addition to furs and year- round sales of swimsuits. The expansion of Colonial Plaza coincided with several other retail developments throughout the area, including another mall, Orlando Fashion Square, which was built around the existing Sears store across Colonial Drive. An Orlando Sentinel article said that in 1972, prior to the opening of the expansion, Colonial Plaza had seen over 10.4 million visitors, who had spent approximately $60,000,000 (). The sudden increase in retail developments in the Orlando market in the early 1970s was seen by retail analysts as the result of a heavy increase in tourism and overall population growth for the entire Orlando region following the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971. Once the new Belk opened, their previous location in Colonial Plaza was converted to O. G. Wilson's, a catalog showroom chain then owned by the Zale Corporation, in 1974. A year later, W. T. Grant filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its stores. Their location at Colonial Plaza was sold to the F. W. Woolworth Company, who opened there in early 1977. This Woolworth location was based on a prototype introduced at a store in Miami in 1972, offering a wider variety of merchandise than its usual stores and featuring a 140-seat restaurant. Another expansion was announced in 1982. This expansion consisted of a two-story, Ivey's department store, which would connect to the existing property in front of Woolworth via a -wide hallway lined with kiosks. In addition, the mall's parking lot was redesigned and re-landscaped, while the original strip of stores and the O. G. Wilson building were given new facades. Ivey's representatives had first wanted to locate at the mall in 1979, but negotiations were delayed due to two factors: Prudential Financial and J. J. Gumberg Co. both purchasing the mall from its original owners Michael R. Sudakow Corporation in 1980, and concerns from existing mall tenants over potential obstruction of visibility due to the addition of the new store. Upon opening in 1983, the new Ivey's had the largest opening-day sales in the chain's history. Mall merchants noted that the presence of construction workers and equipment caused a temporary decrease in traffic, which was compounded when a fire broke out in the mall and destroyed the merchandise of four stores, causing $1 million () in damage. The most damage was concentrated on the Jarman Shoes store, which operated from a temporary location until its store was rebuilt in March 1984. Also affecting the mall's tenancy at the time was the expiration of leases on many tenants, and a restructuring of the mall's financial structure which resulted in an increase on leasing costs by tenants. Another store, Colonial Plaza Cards, had its roof cave in due to a leak in late 1982 prior to the renovation, but reopened elsewhere in the mall as a Hallmark Cards franchise. Once renovations were complete, many new mall stores opened including Gap, Miracle-Ear, and Fanny Farmer. The owner of the Gap store in the mall noted that sales at his store were slow since it was in the Belk wing, thus putting it further away from main shopper traffic in the Ivey's and Jordan Marsh end of the mall. A map of Colonial Plaza in the 1980s, highlighting the expansions received over the years. By 1985, the Publix store in the mall had closed. Although Dayton- Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) had announced plans to open a branch of its R. G. Branden's housewares chain in the building, it was instead sold to Rhodes Furniture, which opened in 1987. Also in 1987, the O. G. Wilson store closed and was converted to J. Byrons, a Miami-based housewares and clothing store. This opening marked the chain's return to the Orlando market, as its previous stores were sold to Ross Dress for Less in 1985 due to poor sales. =1990s: Decline and redevelopment= Dillard's acquired and rebranded the entire Ivey's chain in mid-1990. Federated Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) announced soon afterward that it would close all of the Jordan Marsh department stores in Florida by 1991. The closure of this anchor drew concern over the mall's design, particularly since Jordan Marsh separated the 1962-era mall from the South Mall. Other issues with the mall's design were brought up by many of its tenants at the time, including its \\"hybrid\\" design from being a traditional strip mall that was expanded; the distance between the Ivey's and Belk stores; and the lack of restaurants or a food court, due to original tenant Ronnie's Restaurant holding veto power over other food vendors in the mall. Representatives of J. J. Gumberg began proposing replacements for the Jordan Marsh store, and underwent negotiations with representatives of J. C. Penney, Parisian, Gayfers, and Montgomery Ward. Gumberg also proposed moving Dillard's into the Jordan Marsh building, or replacing the building with several smaller stores in order to promote better traffic flow to the South Mall and Belk. A representative of Federated noted that the store was not purchased by any of the other chains that took most of the other Jordan Marsh locations in Florida due to its large size and proximity to the company's Burdines store across the street at Orlando Fashion Square. In order to maintain customer traffic to the South Mall, the mall's owners erected more signs directing customers to it, while also offering golf cart service between the older property and it. After Jordan Marsh was closed, the building was used to make a \\"tunnel\\" connecting to the South Mall, lined with artwork. Woolworth announced the closure of its store at Colonial Plaza in October 1993. Zales Jewelers and Fran's Fashions also closed in 1992, creating further vacancies at the mall. In 1994, Cousins/Newmarket, a company out of Atlanta, Georgia, announced plans to buy the mall and redevelop it into a power center. At the time of their acquisition, the mall was nearly 50 percent vacant, and retail analysts had noted that its decline was due to its age, its unconventional layout, and its proximity to Orlando Fashion Square and other newer malls. Following this announcement, both Dillard's and Belk closed between late 1994 and early 1995. =1995‚Äìpresent: Redevelopment into a power center= After acquiring the property in early 1995, Cousins/Newmarket announced that redevelopment plans would call for demolition of nearly the entire property, except for Walgreens, J. Byron's (which closed in early 1996 during redevelopment of the mall), the former Belk, and Rhodes Furniture. As part of the redevelopment, the former Belk was divided between Marshalls and a new location of Rhodes Furniture, while the latter's old store became Barnes & Noble. Tenants in the new center included Old Navy, Circuit City, Ross Dress for Less, Linens 'n Things, Baby Superstore (which merged with Babies \\"R\\" Us soon after opening), and L. Luria & Sons catalog showroom. Other major stores included Stein Mart, Men's Wearhouse, and Just for Feet. Many of these big box stores opened in stages between late 1995 and early 1996. L. Luria & Sons underwent a chainwide liquidation in mid-1997, and by 1999, their building had been retenanted by Staples. Weingarten Realty acquired the property from Cousins/Newmarket in 2001. At the time of acquisition, the center was 97% leased. Under their ownership, some changes in key tenants occurred. Rhodes Furniture closed and became another furniture store called Floor & Decor in 2007. Both Linens 'n Things and Circuit City closed in 2009 after those chains filed for bankruptcy. Taking their respective places at Colonial Plaza were Big Lots and the first Hobby Lobby in the Orlando area. Babies \\"R\\" Us closed in 2011, and was replaced by Bealls Outlet and Ulta Beauty two years later. Five Below opened at the center in August 2018. In late 2018, Floor & Decor moved across the street to Orlando Fashion Square, and in 2020 it became a Conn's electronics store. As of 2020, Colonial Plaza is the eighth-largest shopping center in the Orlando area. The center has a trade area of over 292,000 people within a 5-mile radius, and average daily traffic counts of 72,500 cars along Colonial Drive and Bumby Avenue.
