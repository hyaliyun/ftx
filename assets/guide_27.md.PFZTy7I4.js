Biography =Early years= Houston was born in Washington, D.C., to a middle-class family who lived in the Striver section. His father William Le Pré Houston, the son of a former slave, had become an attorney and practiced in the capital for more than four decades. Charles' mother, Mary (née Hamilton) Houston, worked as a seamstress.\\"Charles Hamilton Houston\\", Separate Is Not Equal: Brown v. Board of Education, Smithsonian National Museum of American History; exhibit has photos of Houston with his parents Houston attended segregated local schools, graduating from the academic (college preparatory) Dunbar High School. He studied at Amherst College beginning in 1911, was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, and graduated as valedictorian in 1915, the only black student in his class. He returned to D.C. and taught English at Howard University, a historically black college. As the U.S. entered World War I, Houston joined the U.S. Army as an officer. The military was racially segregated. From 1917 to 1919, he served as a First Lieutenant in the United States Infantry, based in Fort Meade, Maryland, with service in France. After being chastised for, during a brief detail as a Judge Advocate, finding a Black sergeant not worthy of prosecution, Houston wrote later: > The hate and scorn showered on us Negro officers by our fellow Americans > convinced me that there was no sense in my dying for a world ruled by them. > I made up my mind that if I got through this war I would study law and use > my time fighting for men who could not strike back. After his return to the U.S. in 1919, he entered Harvard Law School. He was the first black student elected to the editorial board of the Harvard Law Review and graduated cum laude. Houston was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He earned a bachelor's of law in 1922 and a JD from Harvard in 1923. That same year he was awarded a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship to study at the University of Madrid. After his return, he was admitted to the Washington, DC bar in 1924 and joined his father's practice.Conyers 2012, p5 In 1924 Houston married Gladys Moran. They divorced in 1937. He next married Henrietta Williams. They had Houston's only child in 1940, Charles Hamilton Houston, Jr. =Career= When several black lawyers were refused admission to the American Bar Association in 1925, they founded the National Bar Association.\\"Howard University School of Law: Preparing for Struggle\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History; accessed 14 May 2017 Houston was a founding member of the affiliated Washington Bar Association. He was recruited to Howard University by the first African-American president, Mordecai Johnson. From 1929 to 1935, Houston served as Vice-Dean and Dean of the Howard University School of Law. He developed the school, beginning its years as a major national center for training black lawyers. He extended its part-time program to a full-time curriculum and gained accreditation by the Association of American Law Schools and the American Bar Association. Bringing prominent attorneys to the school as speakers and to build a law network for his students, Houston served as a mentor to a generation. He influenced nearly one-quarter of all the black lawyers in the United States at the time, including former student Thurgood Marshall, who became a United States Supreme Court justice. Houston believed that the law could be used to fight racial discrimination and encouraged his students to work for such social purpose. Houston left Howard in 1935 to serve as the first special counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), serving in this role until 1940. In this capacity he created litigation strategies to attack racial housing covenants and segregated schools, arguing several important civil rights cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Through his work at the NAACP, Houston played a role in nearly every civil rights case that reached the US Supreme Court between 1930 and Brown v. Board of Education (1954).NAACP History: \\"Charles Hamilton Houston\\" , NAACP; accessed 14 May 2017 Houston worked to bring an end to the exclusion of African Americans from juries across the South. He defended African-American George Crawford on charges of murder in Loudoun County, Virginia, in 1933, and saved him from the electric chair.Bradley, David (2014). Preface, The Historic Murder Trial of George Crawford: Charles H. Houston, the NAACP and the Case That Put All-White Southern Juries on Trial. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co. . In the related Hollins v. State of Oklahoma (1935), Houston led an all-black legal team before the US Supreme Court to appeal another murder case in which the defendant was convicted by an all- white jury and sentenced to death. The defense team had challenged the all- white jury during the trial, but the conviction was upheld by the appeals court. Hearing the case a certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and ordered a new trial. Hollins was tried a third time, again before an all-white jury, and was convicted in 1936. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1950. \\"It is now widely believed that he was innocent.\\"[Alfred L. Brophy, \\"Hollins v. State of Oklahoma (1935)\\"], The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, www.okhistory.org (accessed May 15, 2017) At the time, Oklahoma and southern states systematically excluded blacks from juries, in part because they were not on the voter rolls, having been disenfranchised across the South since the turn of the century by state barriers to voter registration. In the 21st century, attorneys continue to have to challenge prosecutorial strategies that exclude blacks from juries. Houston's strategy on public education was to attack segregation by demonstrating the inequality resulting from the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine dating from the Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson (1897). He orchestrated a campaign to force southern districts to build facilities for blacks equal to those for whites, or to integrate their facilities. He focused on law schools because, at the time, mostly males attended them. He believed this would obviate the fears whites expressed that integrated schools would lead to interracial dating and marriage. In Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada (1939), Houston argued that it was unconstitutional for Missouri to exclude blacks from the state's university law school when, under the \\"separate but equal\\" provision, no comparable facility for blacks existed within the state. In the documentary \\"The Road to Brown\\", Hon. Juanita Kidd Stout described Houston's strategy related to segregated schools: > When he attacked the \\"separate but equal\\" theory his real thought behind it > was that \\"All right, if you want it separate but equal, I will make it so > expensive for it to be separate that you will have to abandon your > separateness.\\" And so that was the reason he started demanding equalization > of salaries for teachers, equal facilities in the schools and all of that. Houston founded a law firm, Houston & Gardner, with Wendell P. Gardner, Sr. It later included, as name partners, William H. Hastie, William B. Bryant, Emmet G. Sullivan, and Joseph C. Waddy, each of whom were later appointed as federal judges. The firm was prestigious but their work not well-compensated. Biography of Wendell Gardner at Superior Court of the District of Columbia websiteBiography of Emmet Sullivan at District Court for the District of Columbia website Ten members of the firm advanced to become judges, including Theodore Newman, Wendell Gardner, Jr., the son of Wendell Gardner; and Emmet Sullivan.Biography of Theodore Newman at District of Columbia Court of Appeals website Houston's efforts to dismantle the legal theory of \\"separate but equal\\" were completed after his death in 1950 with the historic Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ruling, which prohibited segregation in public schools. At one point Houston had carried a movie camera as he traveled across South Carolina, in order to document the inequalities of facilities, materials and teachers' salaries between African-American and white education. As Special Counsel to the NAACP, Houston dispatched Thurgood Marshall, Oliver Hill and other young attorneys to work a litigation campaign of court challenges to equalize teachers' salaries.\\"Salaries Compared\\", Little John Explorers Houston also directed the NAACP's campaign to end restrictive housing covenants. In the early 20th century, the organization had won a United States Supreme Court case, Buchanan v. Warley (1917), which prohibited state and local jurisdictions from establishing restrictive housing. Real estate developers and agents developed restrictive covenants and deeds. The Court ruled in Corrigan v. Buckley (1926) that such restrictions were the acts of individuals and beyond the reach of the constitutional protections. As the NAACP continued with its campaign in the 1940s, Houston drew from contemporary sociological and other studies to demonstrate that such covenants and resulting segregation produced conditions of overcrowding, poor health, and increased crime that adversely affected African-American communities.Leland B. Ware (1989), \\"Invisible Walls: An Examination of the Legal Strategy of the Restrictive Covenant Cases\\", Washington University Law Review, Vol. 67, Issue 3: Symposium on the State Action Doctrine of Shelley v. Kraemer, p. 744 Following Corrigan, Houston contributed to what was a 22-year campaign, in concert with lawyers he had trained, in order to overturn the constitutionality of restrictive covenants. This was achieved in the US Supreme Court ruling in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948). The court ruled that \\"judicial enforcement of private right constitutes state action for the purpose of the fourteenth amendment.\\" Houston's use of sociological materials in these cases lay the groundwork for the approach and ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954).Ware (1989), \\"Invisible Walls\\", p.772 =Death= Houston died from a heart attack on April 22, 1950, at the age of 54.Jessie Carney Smith (ed.), \\"Houston, Charles Hamilton\\", Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture, Greenwood, 2011 (pp. 701-704), p. 703.

The play premiered on Broadway in 1963, starring Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. It was made into a film in 1967, which starred Redford and Jane Fonda. Productions Barefoot in the Park had a pre-Broadway production under the title Nobody Loves Me at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, PA. The play opened on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on October 23, 1963, and closed on June 25, 1967, after 1,530 performances. It was Neil Simon's longest-running hit, and the tenth-longest running non-musical play in Broadway history. The cast included Elizabeth Ashley (Corie), Robert Redford (Paul), Mildred Natwick (Mrs. Banks), and Kurt Kasznar (Victor Velasco); the director was Mike Nichols. Scenic design was by Oliver Smith, costumes by Donald Brooks, and lighting by Jean Rosenthal. The play was nominated for four 1964 Tony Awards, with Nichols winning the award for Best Direction of a Play. Myrna Loy starred in the national tour during the time the play was still on Broadway. Beginning in 1978, Dorothy Lamour spent three years playing Mrs. Banks in dinner theatres around the country. A revival opened on Broadway at the Cort Theater on February 16, 2006, and closed on May 21, 2006, after 109 performances. The cast included Amanda Peet (Corie), Patrick Wilson (Paul), Jill Clayburgh (Mrs. Banks), and Tony Roberts (Victor). The revival was directed by Scott Elliott. A revival production toured the United Kingdom in 2012. The cast included Maureen Lipman, Faye Castelow, Dominic Tighe, and Oliver Cotton. The play was directed by Lipman in partnership with Peter Cregeen. Plot Corie and Paul Bratter are a newlywed couple. For their first home, they live in an apartment on the top floor of a brownstone in New York City. Corie is optimistic about their future together, while Paul, the more anxious and grounded half of the couple, worries about the various flaws in the apartment, such as a hole in the skylight, their leaky closet, and the lack of a bathtub. Shortly after moving in, Corie attempts to set her mother up with their eccentric neighbor Mr. Velasco. During the course of four days, the couple learns to live together while facing the usual daily ups-and-downs. Corie wants Paul to become more easy-going: for example, to run \\"barefoot in the park\\".  Critical reception  According to theatre historian Jordan Schildcrout, \\"Most critics noted that Barefoot in the Park has 'a dime-a-dozen premise [and] virtually no plot' (Variety) and 'is about nothing at all' (Herald Tribune). But they also praised Simon as a 'highly skilled professional writer' (Herald Tribune) who used this simple dramatic situation to create 'one of the funniest comedies ever' (Life).\\" Some critics credited director Mike Nichols for making the play \\"consistently funnier than its modest dialogue seemed to entitle it to be\\" (New York Times). On the basis of strong reviews and even stronger word of mouth, the Broadway production became a sold-out hit, causing the Biltmore Theatre to double the size of its box office staff to deal with the demand for tickets.Schildcrout, p. 144. Adaptations Simon adapted his play for a 1967 feature film, starring Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Mildred Natwick and Charles Boyer, with Gene Saks, director. A television series based on the play began on ABC in September 1970. It was an African-American situation comedy which ran for twelve weeks. The show featured Scoey Mitchell and Tracy Reed as a \\"young middle-class couple living in a New York City apartment and struggling through the first years of marriage.\\" This was one of two television series based on Neil Simon plays to debut on the network that month, the other being The Odd Couple. A production of Barefoot in the Park ran at the Moore Theater in Seattle for one week in late 1981; it was taped for a made-for-TV movie by HBO. The play—and movie—starred Richard Thomas as Paul, Bess Armstrong as Corie, Barbara Barrie as Mrs. Banks, and Hans Conried as Velasco. It was initially telecast in March 1982. The reviewer for UPI wrote: \\"Richard Thomas—light years removed from the John Boy image of his youth—is superb as Paul Bratter, the buttoned-down young lawyer struggling to come to terms with the elfin free spirit with whom he finds himself honeymooning. Bess Armstrong glows in the role of his wife, Corie, but Barbara Barrie virtually walks away with the show as her bemused mother.\\" References External links 1963 plays Broadway plays American plays adapted into films Plays by Neil Simon Plays set in New York City ","title":"Barefoot in the Park"},{"id":"607158","text":"John Norvell (December 21, 1789April 24, 1850) was a newspaper editor and one of the first U.S. Senators from Michigan. History Norvell was born in Danville, Kentucky, then still a part of Virginia, where he attended the common schools. He is the son of Lt. Lipscomb Norvell, an officer of the Virginia Line in the American Revolutionary War and Mary Hendrick. Lipscomb Norvell was taken prisoner by the British when they captured Charleston, South Carolina in 1781 and later was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati. Lipscomb is buried in the Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. Lipscomb descended from Captain Hugh Norvell (1666–1719), one of the original trustees of the City of Williamsburg in the 17th century and a Vestryman at Bruton Parish Church. Mary Norvell, Lipscomb's daughter, married James Walker, the father of William Walker (1824–1860) a soldier of fortune or filibusterer in Nicaragua in 1857. In 1807, Norvell wrote to U.S. President Thomas Jefferson: He received a reply in which Jefferson first recommended authors to read on government and history, then issued a scathing critique of newspapers: Despite Jefferson's highly skeptical appraisal, Norvell apparently took his words as a challenge to reform newspapers and decided to learn the printing trade. Norvell did not publish this letter until after Jefferson's death in 1826, the original letter is now lost, but was in his son's possession as late as 1880. Norvell edited the Baltimore Whig 1813-14. He also studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1814, and began a private practice in Baltimore, Maryland. He enlisted as a private in the War of 1812, serving in the Battle of Bladensburg. Norvell's adventures during the War of 1812 were chronicled in the Some Account of the Life of Spencer Houghton Cone, A Baptist Preacher in America. Norvell and his brother in law Spencer Cone were partners in Baltimore and together at the Battle of Bladensburg. After the battle, they returned to Washington to rescue their wives, who had been left there. In Washington a scene of terror greeted Norvell and Cone. Catherine Cone Norvell was 8 months pregnant and could only travel by wagon. They attempted to walk out of the city, but Cone's feet were badly blistered and he found it impossible to move. Norvell found a pony in a neighboring field and caught him. Cone mounted him and they were once again on their way. Stopping at the White House, they asked one of the servants for a drink. Thus refreshed, they crossed the Potomac and proceeded out of the city for three miles. They were so exhausted that they fell asleep even before they had finished their meager meal, sleeping on the bag of clothes spread out on the floor. While the men slept, Amelia, Cone's wife, awoke and went out into the garden—in the distance she could see the burning White House and Capitol building. After the war, Norvell worked at various newspapers in several cities, including: the Baltimore Patriot 1815-17. Norvell stayed with the Patriot almost two years before abruptly moving back to Kentucky, possibly with the encouragement of Henry Clay, where he took over the state's oldest newspaper, the Lexington Kentucky Gazette in 1817. For nearly the next two years, he maintained Clay's support at home, which earned Norvell apparently no great pecuniary rewards. By early in that year, he was again applying for clerkships in Washington, and soon moved east to Philadelphia, where he became editor of an Anti-Federalist newspaper. By 1819, he joined the Franklin Gazette, which he published with Richard Bache Jr. the brother of Benjamin Franklin Bache, and grandson of Benjamin Franklin. The Franklin Gazette, which supported Jefferson politically, was published in offices \\"at 180 the first door on the left hand side of Carpenter's lane, leading from the Post Office to the Bank of the United States.\\" In June 1829, Norvell and John R. Walker co-founded the Pennsylvania Inquirer, which was to become The Philadelphia Inquirer, although they had to sell the paper in November to Jesper Harding. Norvell continued to work in newspapers when he was appointed to an office in the Treasury Department by his friend Alexander J. Dallas, who was secretary of the treasury for President James Madison. =In Michigan= In 1831, Norvell moved to Michigan Territory after being appointed postmaster of Detroit by Andrew Jackson. Norvell was awarded the post because of his support of U.S. President Andrew Jackson, as were many other printers who had supported the Republican (democratic) party. He served as postmaster until 1836. The people in the Michigan Territory had approved a constitution and elected state officials in 1835, although it was not admitted as a state until 1837 because of a conflict known as the Toledo War with neighboring Ohio. Norvell was selected to be Senator in 1835. However, because the state of Michigan had not been recognized, he was only granted \\"spectator\\" status. Norvell was an influential and active participant in the first constitutional convention in 1835. He was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan from 1837 to 1839. Upon the admission of Michigan as a State into the Union, Norvell entered the U.S. Senate with the Jacksonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party. He served one term in the 24th, 25th, and 26th Congresses from January 26, 1837, to March 4, 1841. He did not seek reelection and resumed the practice of law in Detroit. Norvell was a member of the State senate in 1841 and of the State house of representatives in 1842. He served as United States district attorney in Michigan from 1846 to 1849. Senator John Norvell Grave, Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan Personal Norvell had ten sons by three wives. His third wife, Isabella Hodgkiss Freeman (1804–1873) was the adopted daughter of Tristram B. Freeman, a noted Philadelphia printer and founder of the Freeman auction house. Her parents were Michael Hodgkiss and Sarah DeWeese. With Isabella, Norvell fathered two daughters and eight sons, one fought in the Mexican–American War and six fought in the American Civil War. They all survived the war. Colonel Freeman Norvell, was a Marine Lieutenant who fought at the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847 and in the Civil War at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Freeman's younger brother Lt. Dallas Norvell served on the staff of General George Custer. Another son, Colonel Stevens Thompson Norvell was an officer with the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers after the war and at the Battle of San Juan Hill with Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish American War. Norvell's older daughter Isabella Gibson Norvell married Capt. Angus Keith, a Great Lakes boat captain, and the younger daughter Emily Virginia Norvell married Henry Nelson Walker, a newspaper owner, lawyer, and attorney general of Michigan. Norvell died in Detroit on April 24, 1850, the day that news came from Washington that he had been appointed U.S. Consul to Turkey. He is interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Norvell Township in Jackson County, Michigan is named for him.

He has been a Liberal Party Member of the House of Representatives since 2001, representing the Division of Casey in Victoria. Early life and education Smith was born in Melbourne, to parents Alan Smith, a chemistry teacher, and Noel Smith, a medical secretary. Tony was the youngest child, with two older sisters: Christine (born 1960) and Heather (born 1962). He was educated first at Kerrimuir Primary School in Box Hill North before attending Carey Baptist Grammar School in Kew. He studied Commerce and Arts (Hons) at The University of Melbourne. He was president of the Melbourne University Liberal Club, and is now an honorary life member. Political career After completing his education, Smith was a research assistant at the Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative think-tank, before becoming first a media adviser and then a senior political adviser to Peter Costello, the then-Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Treasurer. =In parliament= On 23 January 2007, Smith was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, John Howard. He managed to hold his seat of Casey by a considerable margin at the federal election in November of that year, although the Liberal-National Coalition was defeated. On 22 September 2008, Smith was appointed Shadow Assistant Treasurer by Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull.Coalition Shadow Ministry Smith had previously been Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training. He was appointed Shadow Minister for Communications in a reshuffle which took place on 8 December 2009. When Malcolm Turnbull's hold on the Liberal leadership became terminal, it was speculated that Smith was part of a \\"two- Tony\\" ticket in which Smith would be the running mate of Tony Abbott in a leadership challenge. Although Abbott successfully challenged Turnbull for the Liberal leadership on 1 December 2009, Smith was not Abbott's running mate, and Julie Bishop remained deputy under Abbott. Despite the speculation that they would make a leadership team in 2009, Abbott and Smith do not seem to be close as Abbott demoted Smith after the 2010 election. When Smith sought the speakership in 2015, it is understood that Abbott as Prime Minister backed rival contender Russell Broadbent as the Government's candidate for Speaker over Smith. In 2015, the Daily Telegraph reported that there was an \\"internal view\\" in the Liberal Party that Abbott blamed Smith for the Coalition's narrow loss at the 2010 election due to Smith's perceived mishandling of the Coalition's broadband policy when Shadow Communications Minister. In the new Abbott shadow ministry announced after the August 2010 election, Smith was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Tax Reform and Deputy chairman, Coalition Policy Development Committee. He was interviewed extensively in the ABC documentary The Howard Years. =Speaker of the House= Following the resignation of Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker of the House of Representatives in August 2015 over entitlement rorts dating back a decade, the Liberal Party nominated Smith as the party's candidate to replace Bishop. The House of Representatives elected Smith unopposed. He has pledged to absent himself from the Liberal party room for the duration of his speakership to protect the neutrality of the chair. He also eschewed the traditional full attire of the Speaker, instead continuing to wear an ordinary business suit. Smith was re- elected Speaker unopposed after the 2016 and 2019 federal elections. He is the first Speaker to be elected unopposed on three occasions since Frederick Holder, the inaugural holder of the position.

It was also used as the basis to place individuals under banning orders, and its practical effect was to isolate and silence voices of dissent. left Description The Act, which came into effect on 17 July 1950,General South African History Timelines South African History Online defined communism as any scheme aimed at achieving change—whether economic, social, political, or industrial—\\"by the promotion of disturbance or disorder\\" or any act encouraging \\"feelings of hostility between the European and the non-European races [...] calculated to further [disorder]\\". The Minister of Justice could deem any person to be a communist if he found that person's aims to be aligned with these aims, and could issue an order severely restricting the freedoms of anyone deemed to be a communist. After a nominal two-week appeal period, the person's status as a communist became an unreviewable matter of fact, and subjected the person to being barred from public participation, restricted in movement, or imprisoned.Separate and Unequal South Africa: A Country Study, Library of Congress. The government justified passage of the Act by noting the involvement of members of the South African Communist Party in the internal resistance to apartheid. Effect The Act was worded in such a way that anyone who opposed government policy could be deemed a communist. Since the Act explicitly declared that communism sought to encourage racial disharmony, it was frequently used to legally gag critics of racial segregation and apartheid. The Act defined communism so sweepingly that defendants were frequently convicted of \\"statutory communism\\". Justice Frans Rumpff, presiding in the 1952 trial of African National Congress (ANC) leaders, observed that such an offence might have \\"nothing to do with communism as it is commonly known.\\" The Act facilitated the government suppression of organisations such as the ANC and others which advocated for equal rights for people of colour. The Act forced these groups to go underground with their activism. Because of this Act, groups such as uMkhonto we Sizwe, led by Nelson Mandela as a branch of the ANC, did seek financial support from the Communist Party. Superseded 1982 Most of the Act was replaced in 1982 by the Internal Security Act, 1982. References Further reading *Benson, Mary. Nelson Mandela: The Man and the Movement, 2nd Edition. W. W.

Later, however, other versions of the origin of the name were considered. In particular, one of them says that the word \\"sarapul\\" formed by the merger of two words: \\"sarah\\", which in one of the Siberian dialects means \\"money\\", and \\"pul\\", a small copper coin, thus meaning \\"place of money\\".

The party being attacked has a latent threat capability or has shown by its posturing that it intends to attack in the future. Preventive war aims to forestall a shift in the balance of powerTaming American Power, Stephen M. Walt, pp 224 by strategically attacking before the balance of power has had a chance to shift in the favor of the targeted party. Preventive war is distinct from preemptive strike, which is the first strike when an attack is imminent. Most experts hold that a preventive strike undertaken without the approval of the United Nations is illegal under the modern framework of international law. Robert Delahunty and John Yoo from the George W. Bush administration maintained in their discussion of the Bush doctrine that those standards are unrealistic.The \\"Bush Doctrine\\": Can Preventive War be Justified, Robert J. Delahunty & John Yoo Advocates Advocates of preventive war have ranged from Posadist Communists, who argued for war to destroy capitalism; to western neoconservatives such as George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, who argued that preventive war is necessary in the post-9/11 world.National Security Strategy of the United States of America - September 2002 Proponents claim it has been used throughout American history and is especially relevant in the present as it relates to unconventional war tactics and weapons of mass destruction. The National Security Strategy advocates a policy of proactive counterproliferation efforts and preventive measures. Criticism There is a consensus that preventive war \\"goes beyond what is acceptable in international law\\" and lacks legal basis. The UN High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change stopped short of rejecting the concept outright but suggested that there is no right to preventive war. If there are good grounds for initiating preventive war, the matter should be put to the UN Security Council, which can authorize such action.https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/C9B1B6D819968E83C1256F5E00597208/$file/Report+of+the+High- level+Panel+on+Threats+Challenges+and+Change.pdf p.54 Examples The Axis powers in World War II routinely invaded neutral countries on grounds of prevention and began the invasion of Poland in 1939 by claiming the Poles had attacked a border outpost first. In 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway and argued that Britain might have used them as launching points for an attack or prevented supply of strategic materials to Germany. In the summer of 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, inaugurating the bloody and brutal land war by claiming that a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy threatened the Reich. In late 1941, the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran was carried out to secure a supply corridor of petrol to the Soviet Union. Iranian Shah Rezā Shāh appealed to US President Franklin Roosevelt for help but was rebuffed on the grounds that \\"movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force.\\"Sunrise at Abadan, Stewart Richard pp 94–108 =Pearl Harbor= Perhaps the most famous example of preventive war is the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941.J. Barnes, R. Stoll, \\"PREEMPTIVE AND PREVENTIVE WAR: A PRELIMINARY TAXONOMY\\", p.15, THE JAMES A. BAKER III INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RICE UNIVERSITY, URL Many in the US and Japan believed war to be inevitable. Coupled to the crippling US economic embargo that was rapidly degrading the Japanese military capability, that led the Japanese leadership to believe it was better to have the war as soon as possible. The sneak attack was partly motivated by a desire to cripple the US Pacific Fleet to allow Japan to advance with reduced opposition from the US when it secured Japanese oil supplies by fighting against the British Empire and the Dutch Empire for control over the rich East Indian (Dutch East Indies, Malay Peninsula) oil-fields.Keith Crane, Imported oil and US national security, p. 26, Rand Environment, Energy, and Economic Development (Program), International Security and Defense Policy Center In 1940, American policies and tension toward Japanese military actions and Japanese expansionism in the Far East increased. For example, in May 1940, the base of the US Pacific Fleet that was stationed on the West Coast was forwarded to an \\"advanced\\" position at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. The move was opposed by some US Navy officials, including their commander, Admiral James Otto Richardson, who was relieved by Roosevelt. Even so, the Far East Fleet was not significantly reinforced. Another ineffective plan to reinforce the Pacific was a rather late relocation of fighter planes to bases located on the Pacific islands like Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines. For a long time, Japanese leaders, especially leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy, had known that the large US military strength and production capacity posed a long-term threat to Japan's imperialist desires, especially if hostilities broke out in the Pacific. War games on both sides had long reflected those expectations. =Iraq War (2003–2011)= The 2003 invasion of Iraq was claimed as a preemptive war by the George W. Bush administration. At the time, the US public and its allies were led to believe that Ba'athist Iraq might have restarted its nuclear weapons program or been \\"cheating\\" on its obligations to dispose of its large stockpile of chemical weapons dating from the Iran-Iraq War. Supporters of the war have argued it to be justified, as Iraq both harbored Islamic terrorist groups sharing a common hatred of Western countries and was suspected to be developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Iraq's history of noncompliance of international security matters and its history of both developing and using such weapons were factors in the public perception of Iraq's having weapons of mass destruction. In support of an attack on Iraq, US President George W. Bush stated in an address to the UN General Assembly on September 12, 2002 that the Iraqi \\"regime is a grave and gathering danger.\\"President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, September 12, 2002 However, despite extensive searches during the several years of occupation, the suspected weapons of mass destruction or weapons program infrastructure alleged by the Bush administration were not found to be functional or even known to most Iraqi leaders. Coalition forces instead found dispersed and sometimes-buried and partially-dismantled stockpiles of abandoned and functionally-expired chemical weapons. Some of the caches had been dangerously stored and were leaking, and many were then disposed of hastily and in secret, leading to secondary exposure from improper handling. Allegations of mismanagement and information suppression followed.

The RXTE had three instruments—an All Sky Monitor, the Proportional Counter Array, and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE). The RXTE observed X-rays from black holes, neutron stars, X-ray pulsars and X-ray bursts. It was funded as part of the Explorer program, and is sometimes also called Explorer 69. RXTE had a mass of 3200 kg and was launched from Cape Canaveral on 30 December 1995 on a Delta rocket. Its International Designator is 1995-074A. History Observations from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have been used as evidence for the existence of the frame-dragging effect predicted by the theory of general relativity. RXTE results have, as of late 2007, been used in more than 1400 scientific papers. In January 2006, it was announced that Rossi had been used to locate a candidate intermediate-mass black hole named M82 X-1. In February 2006, data from RXTE was used to prove that the diffuse background X-ray glow in our galaxy comes from innumerable, previously undetected white dwarfs and from other stars' coronae. In April 2008, RXTE data was used to infer the size of the smallest known black hole. RXTE ceased science operations on 3 January 2012. NASA scientists said that the decommissioned RXTE would re-enter the Earth's atmosphere \\"between 2014 and 2023\\". Later it became clear that the satellite would re-enter in late April or early May 2018, and the spacecraft fell out of orbit on April 30, 2018.

He was the key figure in the creation of the AFL-CIO and served as the AFL-CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979. Meany, the son of a union plumber, became a plumber himself at a young age. He became a full-time union official 12 years later. As an officer of the American Federation of Labor, he represented the AFL on the National War Labor Board during World War II. He served as president of the AFL from 1952 to 1955. He proposed its merger with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1952 and led the negotiations until the merger was completed in 1955. He then served as president of the merged AFL-CIO for the next 24 years. Meany had a reputation for integrity and consistent opposition to corruption in the labor movement, and strong anti-communism. He was one of the best known union leaders in the United States in the mid-20th century. Early years Meany was born into a Roman Catholic family in Harlem, New York City on August 16, 1894, the second of 10 children. His parents were Michael Meany and Anne Cullen Meany, who were both American-born and of Irish descent. His ancestors had immigrated to the United States in the 1850s. His father was a plumber and a strong supporter of the trade union movement and served as president of his plumber's union local. Michael Meany was also a precinct level activist in the Democratic Party. Meany grew up in the Port Morris neighborhood of The Bronx, where his parents had moved when he was five years old. Always called \\"George\\", he learned that his real first name was William only when he got a work permit as a teenager. Following his father's career path, Meany quit high school at 16 to work as a plumber's helper. He then served a five-year apprenticeship as a plumber and got his journeyman's certificate in 1917, with Local 463 United Association of Plumbers and Steamfitters of the United States and Canada. His father died suddenly of a heart attack in 1916 after a bout of pneumonia. When Meany's older brother joined the US Army in 1917, George became the sole source of income for his mother and six younger children. He supplemented his income for a while by playing as a semiprofessional baseball catcher. In 1919, he married Eugenia McMahon, a garment worker and a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. They had three daughters. Beginning of union career in New York In 1920, Meany was elected to the executive board of Local 463 of the Plumber's Union. In 1922, he became a full-time business agent for the local, which had 3,600 members at that time. Meany later stated that he had never walked a picket line during his plumber's union days, explaining that his original plumber's union never needed to picket, because the employers never attempted to replace the workers. In 1923, he was elected secretary of the New York City Building Trades Council, the city federation of unions representing construction workers. He won a court injunction against an industry lockout in 1927, which was then considered an innovative tactic for a union, and was opposed by many of the older union leaders, . In 1934, he became president of the New York State Federation of Labor, the statewide coalition of trade unions. In his first year of lobbying in Albany, the state capital, 72 bills that he supported in the state legislature were enacted into law, and he developed a close working relationship with Governor Herbert H. Lehman. He developed a reputation for honesty, diligence and the ability to testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak clearly to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support among socialists in the union movement for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia . National leadership in Washington, DC Three years later, he moved to Washington, DC to become national secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor, where he served under AFL president William Green. During World War II, Meany was one of the permanent representatives of the AFL to the National War Labor Board. During the war, he established close relationships with prominent anticommunists in the American labor movement, including David Dubinsky, Jay Lovestone and Matthew Woll. In October 1945, he led the AFL boycott of the founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the Soviet Union and was later called a communist front. The strike wave of 1945-1946, which was led to a large extent by CIO unions, resulted in passage of the Taft Hartley Act in 1947, which was widely perceived as anti-union. One provision required union officials to sign loyalty oaths affirming that they were not communists. Opposition to signing the oath was led by John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers Union. Meany, in opposition to Lewis and other left-wing union leaders, replied that he would \\"go further and sign an affidavit that I was never a comrade to the comrades\\" since he had always ostracized communists. Within a year, most US union leaders unaffiliated with the Communist Party signed the affidavit, later upheld by the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1949 that the Communist Party was unique among American political parties in swearing allegiance to a foreign power. Merger of AFL and CIO When Green's health declined in 1951, Meany gradually took over day-to-day operations of the AFL. He became president of the American Federation of Labor in 1952 upon Green's death, which occurred just 12 days after the death of Congress of Industrial Organizations president Philip Murray. Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers became president of the CIO. Upon taking leadership of the AFL, Meany put forward a proposal to merge with the CIO. Meany quickly took effective control of the AFL upon being elected president, but it took a bit longer for Reuther to solidify his control of the CIO. Reuther then became a willing partner in the merger negotiations. It took Meany three years to negotiate the merger, and he had to overcome significant opposition. John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers called the merger a \\"rope of sand\\", and his union refused to join the AFL-CIO. Jimmy Hoffa, second in command of the Teamster's Union, protested, \\"What's in it for us? Nothing!\\" However, the Teamsters went along with the merger initially. Mike Quill, president of the Transport Workers Union of America also fought the merger, saying that it amounted to a capitulation to the \\"racism, racketeering and raiding\\" of the AFL. Fearing a drawn-out negotiation process, Meany decided on a \\"short route\\" to reconciliation. This meant all AFL and CIO unions would be accepted into the new organization \\"as is\\", with all conflicts and overlaps to be sorted out after the merger. Meany further relied on a small, select group of advisors to craft the necessary agreements. The draft constitution was primarily written by AFL Vice President Matthew Woll and CIO General Counsel Arthur Goldberg, while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary- Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents David McDonald and Joseph Curran, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George Harrison, and Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom.Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018). Forty Gavels: The Life of Reuben Soderstrom and the Illinois AFL-CIO. 3. Peoria, IL: CWS Publishing. pp. 95-96. Meany's efforts came to fruition in December 1955 with a joint convention in New York City that merged the two federations, creating the AFL-CIO, with Meany elected as president. Called Meany's \\"greatest achievement\\" by Time magazine, the new federation had 15 million members. Only two million US workers were members of unions remaining outside the AFL-CIO. Campaigns against corrupt unions In 1953, under Meany's leadership, the International Longshoremen's Association, accused of racketeering, was expelled from the AFL, an early example of Meany's efforts against corruption and the influence of organized crime in the labor movement. After bitter internal reform, the union was readmitted to the now-merged AFL-CIO, in 1959. Meany also fought against corruption in the AFL affiliated United Textile Workers of America from 1952. In 1957, he reported that the president of that union had been stealing more than $250,000. Meany also appointed an independent monitor to oversee reform of the union. Concerns about corruption and the influence of organized crime in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, under the leadership of Dave Beck, led Meany to begin a campaign to reform that union in 1956. In 1957, in the midst of a fight for control of the union with Jimmy Hoffa, Beck was called before the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, commonly called the \\"McClellan Committee\\" after its chairman John Little McClellan, of Arkansas. Televised hearings in early 1957 exposed misconduct by both the Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union. Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle for control of the Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, in the wake of the scandal. Meany also led campaigns against organized crime leadership and corruption in the International Jewelry Workers Union, the Laundry Workers International Union, the AFL Distillery Workers, the AFL United Auto Workers, and the Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union. He demanded the firing of corrupt union leaders and internal reorganization of the unions. When some unions resisted, he organized their expulsion from the AFL and later from the AFL-CIO, and he even set up rival unions. He set up an AFL-CIO Committee on Ethical Practices to investigate misconduct and insisted for unions under investigation to co-operate with its inquiries. According to John Hutchinson, a professor at UCLA, \\"few American union leaders have such a public record of repeated and explicit opposition to corruption.\\" Vietnam War Meany consistently defended President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War policies. He criticized labor leaders, including Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers, who called for the US to withdraw its military forces from Vietnam, a stance that he predicted would lead to a communist victory in South Vietnam. In 1966, Meany insisted for AFL-CIO unions to give \\"unqualified support\\" to Johnson's war policy. AFL-CIO critics opposing Meany and the war at that time included Ralph Helstein of the United Packinghouse Workers of America, George Burdon of the United Rubberworkers and Patrick Gorman of the United Auto Workers. Charles Cogen, president of the American Federation of Teachers opposed Meany in 1967, when the AFL-CIO convention adopted a resolution pledging support for the war in Vietnam. Reuther stated that he was busy with negotiations with General Motors in Detroit and could not attend the convention. In his speech to the convention, Meany said that, in Vietnam the AFL-CIO was \\"neither hawk nor dove nor chicken\\" but was supporting \\"brother trade unionists\\" struggling against Communism. Meany meeting with Richard Nixon in 1969 As an anticommunist who identified with the working class, Meany expressed contempt for the New Left. That movement had often criticized the labor movement for conservatism, racism, and anticommunism, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it included many supporters of Communist movements, such as the Viet Cong. In the aftermath of the violence by antiwar demonstrators and police at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Meany sided with the police by calling the protesters a \\"dirtynecked and dirty- mouthed group of kooks\\". Meany opposed the antiwar candidacy of U. S. Senator George McGovern for the presidency against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972 despite McGovern's generally pro-labor voting record in Congress. However he declined to endorse Nixon. On Face the Nation in September 1972, Meany criticized McGovern's statements that the US should respect other peoples' rights to choose communism by pointing out that there had never been a country that had freely voted for communism. Meaney accused McGovern of being \\"an apologist for the Communist world\\". Following Nixon's landslide defeat of McGovern, Meany said that the American people had \\"overwhelmingly repudiated neo-isolationism\\" in foreign policy. Meany pointed out that the American voters had split their votes by supporting the Democrats in Congress. Meany's support for the war effort continued to the final days before Saigon fell to the North Vietnam in April, 1975. He called for President Gerald Ford to provide a US Navy \\"flotilla\\" if it was needed to ensure that hundreds of thousands of \\"friends of the United States\\" could escape before a communist regime could be established. He also appealed for the admission of the maximum possible number of Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Meany blamed Congress for \\"washing its hands\\" of the war and of weakening South Vietnam's military, damaging its \\"will to fight\\". In particular, Meaney accused Congress of failing to provide adequate funding for US troops to stage an orderly withdrawal. Conflict with Reuther Despite their co-operation in the AFL- CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had a contentious relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a major event in the history of the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL- CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism. At the time of the 1967 AFL-CIO convention, Reuther demanded that Meany make the AFL-CIO more democratic. After years of disagreement with Meany, Reuther resigned from the AFL-CIO executive council in February 1967. In 1968, Reuther led the UAW out of the AFL-CIO, and the UAW did not re-affiliate with the AFL-CIO until 1981, long after Reuther's death in a 1970 plane crash., and after Meany's death. Political goals In the midst of the Great Society reforms advocated by President Johnson, Meany and the AFL-CIO in 1965 endorsed a resolution calling for \\"mandatory congressional price hearings for corporations, a technological clearinghouse, and a national planning agency\\". American socialist leader Michael Harrington commented that the AFL-CIO had \\"initiated a programmatic redefinition that had much more in common with the defeated socialist proposal of 1894 than with the voluntarism of Gompers\\" referring to Samuel Gompers, the founder of the AFL, who had openly opposed socialism for decades. The 1965 resolution was part of the AFL-CIO's ongoing support for industrial democracy. Despite Meany's support for reform policies that were sometimes called \\"socialist\\", he also said that \\"I very much agree with the free market system-\\" Meaney pointed out, \\"When you don't have anything, you have nothing to lose by these radical actions. But when you become a person who has a home and has property, to some extent you become conservative.\\" As AFL-CIO president, Meany supported raising the minimum wage, increasing public works spending, and protecting union organizing rights. He also supported universal health care. Under his leadership, the AFL-CIO lobbied vigorously for its goals.> He backed the two party system, and believed in \\"supporting your friends and punishing your enemies\\". Later years By the mid-1970s, Meany was past his 80th birthday and there were increasing calls for him to retire and pass leadership of the AFL-CIO to a younger man. In his final years, Meany took up amateur photography and painting as hobbies. in June 1975 Meany as president of the AFL-CIO hosted Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his tour of the US and held a dinner in Solzhenitsyn's honor where the Russian writer gave one of his most well known speeches. Meany introduced Solzhenitsyn with a powerful speech. Meany's wife of 59 years, Eugenia, died in March 1979, and he became depressed after losing her. He injured his knee in a golfing mishap a few months before his death and was confined to a wheelchair. In November 1979, he retired from the AFL-CIO, after a 57-year career in organized labor. He was succeeded by Lane Kirkland, who served as AFL-CIO president for the next 16 years. Meany died at George Washington University Hospital on January 10, 1980 from cardiac arrest. The AFL-CIO had 14 million members at the time of his death. President Jimmy Carter called him \\"an American institution\\" and \\"a patriot\\". He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland. Awards, tributes and legacy George Meany smoking a cigar, and a cigar also appears in the banner of the League for Industrial Democracy's \\"Tribute to George Meany\\" President John F. Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom on February 22, 1963, but died before he could award it. Two weeks after Kennedy's assassination, President Lyndon Johnson awarded it to Meany and thirty others on December 6, 1963. Johnson said the award was for Meany's service to the union movement and for advancing freedom throughout the world. On November 6, 1974, Meany dedicated the George Meany Center for Labor Studies (founded 1969), which was renamed the National Labor College in 1997. From 1993 to 2013, the college housed the George Meany Memorial Archives, held at the University of Maryland since 2013. The George Meany Award was established by the Boy Scouts of America in 1974. Books published about Meany include Meany: The Unchallenged Strong Man of American Labor (1972) and George Meany and His Times: A Biography (1981). Meany's entry in the biographical encyclopedia American National Biography was published in 2000, authored by historian David Brody. Meany was known as a cigar smoker, and pictures of him often appeared in newspapers and magazines smoking a cigar. On the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1994, Meany was pictured on a United States commemorative postage stamp.

Collection of the New-York Historical Society The New-York Historical Society is an American history museum and library located in New York City, at the corner of 77th Street and Central Park West, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The society was founded in 1804 as New York's first museum. It presents exhibitions, public programs, and research that explore the rich history of New York and the nation. The New-York Historical Society Museum & Library has been at its present location since 1908. The granite building was designed by York & Sawyer in a classic Roman Eclectic style. A renovation of the landmark building was completed in November 2011 that made it more open to the public, provided space for an interactive children's museum, and accomplished other changes to enhance access to its collections. Louise Mirrer has been the president of the Historical Society since 2004. She was previously Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs of the City University of New York. Beginning in 2005, the museum presented a groundbreaking two-year exhibit on Slavery in New York, its largest theme exhibition in 200 years on a topic which it had never addressed before. It included an art exhibit by artists invited to use museum collections in their works. The Society generally focuses on the developing city center in Manhattan. Another historical society, the Long Island Historical Society (later Brooklyn Historical Society) was founded in Brooklyn in 1863. Re-enactment of loyalist colonial troops guard the Society building from George Washington's Rebels The New-York Historical Society holds an extensive collection of historical artifacts, works of American art, and other materials documenting the history of New York and the United States. It presents well-researched exhibitions on a variety of topics and periods in American history, such as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Slavery in New York, The Hudson River School, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Tiffany designer Clara Driscoll, and the history of the Constitution. The Society also offers an extensive range of curriculum-based school programs and teacher resources, and provides academic fellowships and organizes public programs for adults to foster lifelong learning and a deep appreciation of history. Collections Asher B. Durand, Pastoral Landscape, 1861 The New-York Historical Society's museum is the oldest in New York City and predates the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art by nearly 70 years. Its art holdings comprise more than 1.6 million works. Among them are a world-class collection of Hudson River School paintings, including major works by Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church; iconic genre and history paintings, including works by William Sidney Mount and Eastman Johnson; a vast range of American portraits, including paintings by Rembrandt Peale and Gilbert Stuart; all 435 of John James Audubon's extant preparatory watercolors for The Birds of America; and an encyclopedic collection of more than 800 works documenting the full catalog of representational sculpture in America from the colonial period to the present day. The Historical Society also holds an important collection of paintings and drawings by marine artist James Bard.Mariner's Museum and Peluso, Anthony J., Jr., The Bard Brothers—Painting America under Steam and Sail, Abrams, New York 1997 The museum holds much of sculptor Elie Nadelman's legendary American folk art collection, including furniture and household accessories such as lamps, candlesticks, textiles, glass, and ceramic objects, as well as paintings, toys, weather vanes, sculptural woodcarvings, and chalkware. The Historical Society's holdings in artifacts and decorative arts include George Washington's camp bed from Valley Forge, the desk at which Clement Clarke Moore wrote \\"A Visit from Saint Nicholas\\", one of the world's largest collections of Tiffany lamps and glasswork, and a collection of more than 550 late 19th-century American board games. Its research library contains more than three million books, pamphlets, maps, atlases, newspapers, broadsides, music sheets, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and architectural drawings. Among its collections are far-ranging materials relating to the founding and early history of the nation including the first documentary evidence of the phrase \\"United States of America\\";Touba, Mariam (Nov. 5, 2014) Who Coined the Phrase ‘United States of America'?

Grant's terms of surrender for Robert E. Lee; collections relating to trials in the United States prior to 1860; American fiction, poetry, and belles-lettres prior to 1850; a broad range of materials relating to the history of the circus; and American travel accounts from the colonial era to the present day. The Society operates a website showing many images from its collection. In 2015, it announced the digitization and posting of over a thousand negatives by photographer Robert L. Bracklow from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early history Recruiting poster for the First Battalion, New York Mounted Rifles, New-York Historical Society collection 11th Street The Historical Society was founded on November 20, 1804, largely through the efforts of John Pintard. He was for some years secretary of the American Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the founder of New York's first savings bank. He was also among the first to agitate for a free school system. The first meeting comprised 11 of the city's most prominent citizens, including Mayor DeWitt Clinton. At the meeting, a committee was selected to draw up a constitution, and by December 10, the Historical Society was officially organized. According to the Historical Society's first catalogue, printed in 1813, the museum then held 4,265 books, as well as 234 volumes of United States documents, 119 almanacs, 130 titles of newspapers, 134 maps, and 30 miscellaneous views. It had already collected the start of a manuscript collection, several oil portraits and 38 engraved portraits. The Historical Society suffered under heavy debt during its early decades. In 1809, it organized a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the arrival of Henry Hudson in New York Harbor. Inspired by the event, the Historical Society petitioned and later obtained an endowment from the New York State Legislature, to be financed by a lottery in 1814. The failure of the lottery resulted in a debt that forced the Society to mortgage some of its books, which were not redeemed until 1823. The Historical Society and its collections moved frequently during the 19th century. In 1809, the Historical Society and its collections moved to the Government House on Bowling Green. Constructed as a residence for the President of the United States when New York was the temporary capital, the building had been unoccupied since the government's relocation to Philadelphia in 1790. In 1816, the Historical Society moved to the New York Institution, formerly the city almshouse on City Hall Park. In 1857, it moved into the first building constructed specifically for its collections, at the then-fashionable intersection of Second Avenue and 11th Street, where it stayed for the next 50 years. The Historical Society later acquired a collection of Egyptian and Assyrian art, which was eventually transferred to the Brooklyn Museum of Art. In 1936 it acquired the collections of the Naval History Society (1912-1936). Present building Construction for its eighth home began September 10, 1902. The central portion of the present building on Central Park West was completed December 15, 1908, to designs by architects York and Sawyer, who were known for their bank designs. In 1938 that central block was extended and sympathetically completed by the construction of pavilions on either end, with Walker & Gillette as architects. That extension project stands among the last examples of Beaux-Arts architecture completed in the city and in the entire country. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966. Corn Planter, Seneca war chief, by F. Bratoli, 1796 Two notable stained glass windows are found in the library on the 2nd floor. The Arrival of Henry Hudson was designed by Mr. Calvert of the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The second is Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, known as the French Huguenot memorial window, in honor of religious refugees to New York. It is inscribed and signed by the artist, Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast. The window was underwritten by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, a philanthropist who was instrumental in commissioning other windows by Tillinghast. Decline and revival Frederick Childe Hassam, Flags on Fifty-Seventh Street, oil on canvas, 1918, in the New-York Historical Society's collection The Historical Society's collection continued to grow throughout the 20th century, but renewed financial woes in the 1970s and 1980s forced the Historical Society to limit access to its collections to professional researchers. In the 1980s, under the leadership of Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., a private equity financier and Enron board member, the Society was forced to use endowment invasion to pay their annual operating costs and cover their salaries, to the point where by 1988, they had only enough money in their endowment to pay for another 18 months of operating expenses. Barbara Knowles Debs from Manhattanville College was named interim director of the Historical Society. In the same year hundreds of paintings, decorative art objects, and other artifacts, which were stored in a Manhattan warehouse, were found to be critically deteriorating. Many of the objects were on long-term loan to the museum. In 1995, grants from the city and state restored public access under the direction of Betsy Gotbaum. Since the late 1990s, the New-York Historical Society has invested significantly in facility and installation upgrades, and conducted fundraising. It has increased its operating budget by 160 percent to enhance and expand its public programs, while maintaining a balanced budget from 1998 to the present. Recent renovations to the Historical Society include new galleries and exhibition spaces, the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, a state-of-the-art library reading room, and a new facility to house and provide access to the letters and manuscripts of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. In 2005, the Historical Society was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Costumed troops guard the front hall The museum has mounted exhibits on national themes through history in New York. For instance, beginning in 2005 with Slavery and the Making of New York, 1600s–1827, it mounted the first exhibition ever in New York City on the major but little-known role of slavery in the city's economy and history. During the colonial years, 41% of households had slaves, and much of the city's economy through the Civil War was related to the South and slavery; half of its exports were related to cotton. Devoting the entire first floor to the exhibit, the museum mounted the largest theme exhibit in its 200-year history. It also addressed the strengths of African Americans who resisted slavery and created their own culture, both in New York and the nation.\\"About the Exhibit\\", Slavery and the Making of New York, New-York Historical Society, accessed 3 May 2012 A related part of the exhibit was commissioning 20 new works by invited artists, some of whom used objects from the museum's collections to create new works and installations on this theme. The second exhibition was New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, 1827–1865, (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007), which explored the economy before the war and strong business ties to the South, events related to the war such as the New York City Draft Riots, and other aspects. Southerners visited New York so frequently in the antebellum era that they had favorite hotels.\\"About the Exhibit\\", New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, 1827–1865 (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007), New-York Historical Society, accessed 3 May 2012 Under the direction of Louise Mirrer, a three- year, $65 million renovation of the landmark building on Central Park West was completed in 2011 to enhance public access to the institution's resources. On Central Park West, windows were lengthened to form new entrances, with views into the main gallery, and windows were expanded. To establish \\"a street presence,\\" the society has installed life-size bronze sculptures outside the building—Abraham Lincoln on Central Park West, Frederick Douglass on West 77th Street—national figures with connections to New York. After reopening, the Historical Society offered a multimedia installation of major themes of American history through stories and figures from New York's past. It also has a new section for an interactive children's history museum. Branding The Historical Society uses an archaic spelling of the geographic name of \\"New York\\". Hyphenating the city's old name was common in the 19th century when the institution was founded, and is still used in this context to provide a unique identity.

He also was a member of the \\"Rat Pack\\" with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. Early life and education Bishop, the youngest of five children, was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants Anna (Siegel) and Jacob Gottlieb. His father was a bicycle repairman. Bishop was raised in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bishop was drafted into the US Army during World War II, and he rose to sergeant in the Special Services, serving at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. Career Appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1975). Bishop began his career as part of a stand-up comedy act with his elder brother, Maury. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 28, 1950, The Dinah Shore Chevy Show on April 19, 1957, and many other variety programs in the early days of television. He guest-hosted The Tonight Show substituting for Jack Paar, and then guest- hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson at least 175 times in the 1960s, and from 1971 to 1976 more than anyone else until that time (Jay Leno and Joan Rivers later surpassed his record). He also frequently appeared on Steve Allen's and Jack Paar's previous versions of The Tonight Show. He later had his own late night show. Bishop starred in the situation comedy The Joey Bishop Show that premiered on September 20, 1961, and ran for 123 episodes over four seasons, first on NBC and later CBS. Bishop played Joey Barnes, at first a publicity agent and then later a talk show host. Abby Dalton joined the cast in 1962 as his wife. Bishop later hosted a 90-minute late-night talk show, also titled The Joey Bishop Show, that was launched by ABC on April 17, 1967, as competition to Carson's Tonight Show and ran until December 26, 1969.

Bishop was among the stars of the original Ocean's 11 film about military veterans who reunite in a plot to rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve. He co-starred with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Peter Lawford of the so-called Rat Pack, although the five of them did not publicly acknowledge that name. During filming, the five entertainers performed together on stage in Vegas at the Sands Hotel. Bishop did only a little singing and dancing, but he told jokes and wrote most of the act's material. He later appeared with Sinatra, Martin, Davis, and Lawford in the military adventure Sergeants 3 (1962), a loose remake of Gunga Din (1939), and with Martin in the western comedy Texas Across the River (1966), in which he portrayed an Indian. Bishop was the only member of the Rat Pack to work with members of a younger group of actors dubbed the Brat Pack, appearing (as a ghost) in the film Betsy's Wedding (1990) with Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. His final appearance in a film was a non-speaking role in Mad Dog Time (1996), written and directed by his son Larry. His character was named Gottlieb, which was his real surname. The film was panned by critics. Bishop was portrayed by Bobby Slayton in the HBO film The Rat Pack (1998). Personal life and final years Bishop wed Sylvia Ruzga in 1941, and they were married for 58 years until her death from lung cancer in 1999. They had one son, Larry Bishop, a film director and actor. Thereafter, Bishop had a longtime companion, Nora Garibotti. In failing health for some time, Bishop died at age 89 of multiple organ failure on October 17, 2007, in his home on Lido Isle, a man-made island in the harbor of Newport Beach, California. Per Bishop's wishes, his remains were cremated and scattered in the Pacific Ocean near his home. He had two grandsons, Kirk and Scott. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Bishop into their Hall of Fame in 2009.

Examples are mechanical composters for industrial kitchens, effective microorganisms as fertiliser for agricultural purposes and Integrated Biotectural systems in landscaping and architecture like Earthships or the IBTS Greenhouse. Components like tomato plants for more water purification and fish for food have been part of the living, ecosystem-like designs. The Design theory is not limited to any size of the system, or the amount of species. One design optimum is a natural ecosystem which is designed for a special purpose like a sewage treating wetland in a suitable ecosystem for the locality. Another optimum is an economically viable system returning profit for the investor. The practice of Permaculture is one example for a compromise between the two optimum design points. Examples The scale of Living Machine systems ranges from the individual building to community-scale public works. Some of the earliest Living Machines were used to treat domestic wastewater in small, ecologically-conscious villages, such as Findhorn Community in Scotland,.Ecovillage Findhorn: Biological Waste Water Treatment Some treated the mixed municipal wastewater for semi-urban areas, such as South Burlington, Vermont (this plant is closed).

In fixed film systems the wetland cells are filled with a solid aggregate medium having extensive surface area for beneficial biofilm (treatment bacteria) growth. Fixed film ecology allows denser and more diverse micro-ecosystems to form than does a liquid medium. These ecosystems go well beyond bacteria to include a variety of organisms up to and including macro-vegetation. *Tidal cycles (filling and draining the wetland in accelerated tidal action, with 12 or more cycles per day) are used to passively bring oxygen into the wetland cells. This action mimics the type of biological action that occurs in natural tidal estuaries. Tidal flow wetlands replace the need to blow air into a liquid medium -- they use gravity to bring atmospheric oxygen into the cell when it is drained.

Potatoes mashed using a potato masher tend to be fluffier and lighter in texture compared to other methods of mashing, because use of the device reduces cell damage to the potato, releasing less starch. Construction The potato masher consists of an upright or sideways handle connected to a mashing head. The head is most often a large-gauge wire in a rounded zig-zag shape, or a plate with holes or slits. Basic designs made from a single piece of wood were used in Victorian times, before the more complex modern designs which are now used. This type of wooden masher, which is effectively a large wooden pestle, is still used in Scotland and is known as a 'Potato-Beetle' or just a 'Beetle'. Uses Although potato mashers are most commonly used to mash potatoes, they are also used for mashing a variety of foods. They are most used in home kitchens, but may also be used in commercial kitchens. Commercial mashers are often of larger design (up to 32 inches in base width). Other common uses include mashing pumpkins and rutabagas for soup, making hummus, guacamole, baking mix, egg salad, or even purées (depending on the fineness of the ridges).

Birds are sometimes reported at large in Western Europe, especially Britain, but it is a popular species in falconry and these records almost certainly all refer to escapes from captivity. The name is derived from the Greek para, meaning beside, near or like, and the Latin buteo, referring to a kind of buzzard; uni meaning once; and cinctus meaning girdled, referring to the white band at the tip of the tail. John James Audubon gave this bird its English name in honor of his ornithological companion, financial supporter, and friend Edward Harris. The Harris's hawk is notable for its behavior of hunting cooperatively in packs consisting of tolerant groups, while other raptors often hunt alone. Harris hawks' social nature has been attributed to their intelligence, which makes them easy to train and have made them a popular bird for use in falconry.Beebe, Frank (1984). A Falconry Manual. Hancock House Publishers, , page 81. Description The distinctive plumage and tail feathers clearly confirm that this is a Harris's hawk This medium-large hawk is roughly intermediate in size between a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and a red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). Harris's hawks range in length from and generally have a wingspan of about Clark, W. S. and B. K. Wheeler. (1987). A Field Guide to Hawks of North America. Houghton Mifflin Co. Boston. These hawks have a brownish plumage, reddish shoulders and tail feathers with a white base and white tip. They exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females being larger by about 35%. In the United States, the average weight for adult males is about , with a range of , while the adult female average is , with a range of .Hamerstrom, F. (1978). External sex characters of Harris' Hawks in winter. Raptor Res. 12:1–14. They have dark brown plumage with chestnut shoulders, wing linings, and thighs, white on the base and tip of the tail, long, yellow legs and a yellow cere. The vocalizations of the Harris's hawk are very harsh sounds. =Juvenile= Juvenile in a falconry demonstration The juvenile Harris's hawk is mostly streaked with buff, and appears much lighter than the dark adults. When in flight, the undersides of the juveniles' wings are buff- colored with brown streaking. They can look unlike adults at first glance, but the identical chestnut plumage is an aid for identification. =Subspecies= There are three subspecies of Harris's hawk: * P. u. superior: found in Baja California, Arizona, Sonora, and Sinaloa. P. u. superior was believed to have longer tails and wings and to be more blackish than P. u. harrisi. However, the sample size of the original study was quite small, with only five males and six females. Later research has concluded that there is not as strong a physical difference as was originally assumed. Other ecological differences, such as latitudinal cline were also brought up as arguments against the validity of the subspecies segmentation. * P. u. harrisi: found in Texas, eastern Mexico, and much of Central America. * P. u. unicinctus: found exclusively in South America. It is smaller than the North American subspecies. =Distribution and habitat= Harris's hawks live in sparse woodland and semi-desert, as well as marshes (with some trees) in some parts of their range (Howell and Webb 1995), including mangrove swamps, as in parts of their South American range. Olmos Fábio & Robson Silva e Silva (2003). Guará-Ambiente, Flora e Fauna dos Manguezais de Santos-Cubatão Empresa das Artes, Harris's hawks are permanent residents and do not migrate. Important perches and nest supports are provided by scattered larger trees or other features (e.g., power poles, woodland edges, standing dead trees, live trees, and boulders, and saguaros).Bednarz, J. C. and J. D. Ligon. (1988). A study of the ecological bases of cooperative breeding in the Harris' hawk. Ecology 69:1176–1187. The wild Harris's hawk population is declining due to habitat loss; however, under some circumstances, they have been known to move into developed areas. Behaviour At one week of age This species occurs in relatively stable groups. A dominance hierarchy occurs in Harris's hawks, wherein the mature female is the dominant bird, followed by the adult male and then the young of previous years. Groups typically include from 2 to 7 birds. Not only do birds cooperate in hunting, they also assist in the nesting process.Dawson, J. W. and R. W. Mannan. (1991). The role of territoriality in the social organization of Harris' hawks. Auk 108:661–672. No other bird of prey is known to hunt in groups as routinely as this species.Griffin, C. R. (1976). A preliminary comparison of Texas and Arizona Harris' Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) populations. Raptor Res. 10:50–54. =Feeding= Eating chick's leg The diet of the Harris's hawk consists of small creatures including birds, lizards, mammals, and large insects. Because it often hunts in groups, the Harris's hawk can also take down larger prey. Although not particularly common, the Harris's hawk may take prey weighing over , such as adult jackrabbits, great blue heron (Ardea herodias) and half-grown wild turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo).Bednarz, J.

Hoffman, Eds.) Natl. Wildl. Fed. Washington, D.C. Undoubtedly because it pursues large prey often, this hawk has larger and stronger feet, with long talons, and a larger, more prominent hooked beak than most other raptors around its size. Locally, other buteonine hawks, including the ferruginous hawk, the red-tailed hawk and the white-tailed hawk also hunt primarily cottontails and jackrabbits, but each are bigger, weighing about , and , respectively, more on average than a Harris's hawk.Smith, D.

M., J. L. Yanez, and R. P. Schlatter. (1980). Prey of the Harris' hawk in central Chile. Auk 97:196–198. =Hunting= Harris's hawk in flight at a falconry centre While most raptors are solitary, only coming together for breeding and migration, Harris's hawks will hunt in cooperative groups of two to six. This is believed to be an adaptation to the lack of prey in the desert climate in which they live. In one hunting technique, a small group flies ahead and scouts, then another group member flies ahead and scouts, and this continues until prey is bagged and shared. In another, all the hawks spread around the prey and one bird flushes it out. Groups of Harris's hawks tend to be more successful at capturing prey than lone hawks, with groups of two to four individuals having ~10% higher success rates per extra individual. =Breeding= They nest in small trees, shrubby growth, or cacti. The nests are often compact, made of sticks, plant roots, and stems, and are often lined with leaves, moss, bark and plant roots. They are built mainly by the female. There are usually two to four white to blueish white eggs sometimes with a speckling of pale brown or gray. The nestlings start out light buff, but in five to six days turn a rich brown. Very often, there will be three hawks attending one nest: two males and one female. Whether or not this is polyandry is debated, as it may be confused with backstanding (one bird standing on another's back). The female does most of the incubation. The eggs hatch in 31 to 36 days. The young begin to explore outside the nest at 38 days, and fledge, or start to fly, at 45 to 50 days. The female sometimes breeds two or three times in a year. Young may stay with their parents for up to three years, helping to raise later broods. Nests are known to be predated by coyotes (Canis latrans), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and flocks of common ravens (Corvus corax), predators possibly too formidable to be fully displaced by the Harris's hawk's cooperative nest defenses. No accounts show predation on adults in the United States and the Harris's hawk may be considered an apex predator, although presumably predators like eagles and great horned owls would be capable of killing them.Dawson, J. W. and R. W. Mannan. (1991). Dominance hierarchies and helper contributions in Harris' Hawks. Auk 108:649–660. In Chile, black-chested buzzard-eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) are likely predators.Jiménez, J. E., & Jaksić, F. M. (1989). Behavioral ecology of grey eagle-buzzards, Geranoaetus melanoleucus, in central Chile. Condor 913–921. Relationship with humans =Falconry= Harris's hawk at a licensed falconry centre, Ontario, Canada Since about 1980, Harris's hawks have been increasingly used in falconry and are now the most popular hawks in the West (outside of Asia) for that purpose, as they are one of the easiest to train and the most social. Trained Harris's hawks have been used to remove an unwanted pigeon population from London's Trafalgar Square, and from the tennis courts at Wimbledon. Trained Harris hawks have been used for bird abatement by falconers in the United States at various locations including resorts and industrial sites. =In art= John James Audubon illustrated the Harris's hawk in The Birds of America (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 392 with the title \\"Louisiana Hawk -Buteo harrisi\\". The image was engraved and colored by the Robert Havell, London workshops in 1837. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society where it remains to this day (January 2009).

Origin of the name \\"Ghost\\" in Northern England was pronounced \\"guest\\", and the origin is thought to be of the combination burh-ghest, \\"town-ghost\\". Others explain it as cognate to German Berg-geist, \\"mountain ghost\\" or Bär-geist, \\"bear-ghost\\". Another mooted derivation is Bahr-Geist, German for the \\"spirit of the funeral bier\\". Domain and description One notable case is said to frequent a remote gorge named Troller's Gill in the Yorkshire Dales, Yorkshire, England. A ballad entitled \\"The Legend of the Troller's Gill\\" can be found in William Hone's Everyday Book (1830). It recounts the tale of a man who ventures forth \\"to the horrid gill of the limestone hill\\" in order to summon and confront the Barghest in an act of ritual magic. The man's lifeless body is discovered soon after with inhuman marks upon his breast.Hone, William (1830). The Every-day Book and Table Book. Vol. 3, pp. 653–655. There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of York occasionally where, according to legend, it preys on lone travellers in the city's narrow Snickelways. Whitby is also associated with the spectre.Jeffrey Shaw, Whitby Lore and Legend, (1923) In the 1870s a shapeshifting Barghest was said to live near Darlington and was said to take the form of a headless man (who would vanish in flames), a headless lady, a white cat, a rabbit, a dog, or a black dog. Another was said to live in an \\"uncannie-looking\\" dale between Darlington and Houghton near Throstlenest, and yet another haunted an area of wasteland between Wreghorn and Headingley Hill near Leeds.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. pp. 16–17. . The Barghest often serves as an omen of death. At the passing of a notable person the Barghest may appear, followed by all the other dogs of the local area in a kind of funeral procession, heralding the person's death with howling and barking. If anyone were to get in the Barghest's way it would strike out with its paw and leave a wound that never heals. Besides taking the form of a large black dog with fiery eyes, it may also become invisible and walk about with the sound of rattling chains. It may also foretell the death of an individual by laying across the threshold of his or her house, and like the vampire the Barghest is unable to cross rivers. In popular culture Many stories feature ghostly black dogs. Dogs specifically named as barghests appear in the following: * The barghest appears in the children's book The Whitby Witches by Robin Jarvis. * In Roald Dahl's The Witches, the barghest is described as always being male. * Neil Gaiman's short story \\"Black Dog\\" features a barghest in the form of a huge black dog which has occult powers. * In \\"The Child Thief\\" by Brom, barghests are distinctly doglike fairy pets of a powerful witch. * The 1978 made-for-TV movie Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell features a barghest named Lucky. * The EP \\"The Barghest o' Whitby\\" by the Yorkshire-based doom metal band My Dying Bride. * In the video game Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, the barghest is a wolf-like enemy that appears in small packs. * A barghest appears in the first episode of the TV series Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands, where it is killed by Grendel. * The barghest is a monster in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, where it is a shapeshifting fiend that can take the shape of a goblin. * The barghest acts as the first boss of the role-playing video game Heartbound, where it is a corrupted dog. * The Witcher video game series feature barghests as hostile spectral dogs that hunt travelers in desolate roads in the night and can only be hurt with a silver blade. * The barghest is the main antagonist in the CITV show Roger and the Rottentrolls. It is only seen by its red eyes and in later episodes, its arms. * The \\"Black Hound\\" that terrorises Trolberg in Hilda is identified as a barghest in the finale of the first season. *In The Lord Of The Rings Online, barghests are found in many places as killable enemies.

The characters first appeared in Showcase #37 and were created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciller Ross Andru. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the characters have appeared in comic books and other DC Comics-related products such as animated television series, clothing, figurines and trading cards. Publication history =1960s and 1970s= Established as advanced artificially intelligent robots, the Metal Men were introduced in the comic book Showcase #37 as \\"last minute\\" filler. Created by scientist Dr. William \\"Will\\" Magnus, the six robots were field leader Gold; strongman Iron; slow- witted and loyal Lead; hot-headed Mercury; self-doubting and insecure Tin; and Platinum (also called \\"Tina\\"), who believed that she was a real woman and was in love with her creator. The group's personalities mirrored their namesake metals, being dictated by devices called responsometers. Each Metal Man also possessed abilities that reflected the traits of their namesake metal: Gold could stretch his form almost infinitely, Iron was super-strong, Lead could block harmful radiation by morphing into thick shields, Mercury could melt and pass through small spaces before reforming, while Platinum and Tin could stretch, flatten or spin into fine filaments. The characters reappeared in the following three issues of Showcase (#38–40, June–October 1962) and proved popular enough to warrant a reappearance in their own eponymous title. First published in May 1963, the title ran on a bi-monthly schedule with original stories until Metal Men #41 (December 1969). The comic was unusual for the time, for having continued serialized storylines across issues. A second female robot (created by Tin) was introduced in issue #13 (April–May 1965), and was later (issue #15, August–September 1965) christened as \\"Nameless\\", last appearing in issue #32.\\"De Re Metallica: The Metal Men\\". Rutgers University. Retrieved January 6, 2015. With sales dropping, the series' tone darkened with issue #33 (September 1968), as the cover tagline changed to \\"The New Hunted Metal Men\\". Shortly after, the team adopted human identities in issue #37 (May 1969). The title was cancelled in mid-story with issue #41 (December 1969). Issues #42, 43 and 44 (March, May, and July 1973) reprinted earlier Showcase appearances and the first issue, with the title then on hiatus until returning with original numbering in issue #45 (May 1976). The bi-monthly publishing schedule continued until issue #56 (March 1978), when the title and many others were cancelled during the DC Implosion. Until #21, the Metal Men appeared to be the sole super-heroes in a separate fictional universe, with no other DC characters appearing (though the Metal Men watch a Batman TV Show, and Dr. Yes is recognized by them as resembling an enemy of Wonder Woman--Magnus and the Metal Men even seem to know at times that they are comic book characters, referring to earlier issues and reader response).

Magnus had seen it coming and preemptively deactivated his creations, breaking their bodies down into simple objects he scattered around and their responsometers hidden with people the doctor trusted. Revived by the anarchist Rebel-1 and her Undercloud organization in their combined Alloy form, the Metal Men were forced to rampage against their will until the new Batman, Terry McGinnis and his friend Max were able to disrupt the control frequency and allow the Metal Men to restore themselves.

Built in 1945 for the United States Navy, she was still in training when World War II ended. She was named for the clamagore. A National Historic Landmark, she is the only known surviving example of a GUPPY type submarine. Construction Clamagore was built by Electric Boat Co. in Groton, Connecticut near the end of World War II. She was launched on 25 February 1945 and sponsored by Miss Mary Jane Jacobs, daughter of Vice Admiral Randall Jacobs and commissioned on 28 June 1945, with Commander S.C. Loomis, Jr., taking command. Operational history Clamagore was first assigned to Key West, Florida, and reported there on 5 September 1945. She operated off Key West with various fleet units and with the Fleet Sonar School, voyaging on occasion to Cuba and the Virgin Islands until 5 December 1947, when she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for GUPPY II modernization and installation of snorkel. Clamagore returned to Key West 6 August 1948 and assumed local and Caribbean operations for the next eight years, except for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean from 3 February to 16 April 1953. Clamagore called at New London, Connecticut and Newport, Rhode Island early in 1957, returning to Key West 13 March. Between 23 September and 7 December she took part in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, calling at Portsmouth, England, and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. On 29 June 1959, she arrived at Charleston, her new home port, and after a period of coastwise operations, sailed 5 April 1960 to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean for a tour of duty which continued until July, when the submarine returned to Charleston. For the remainder of 1960 Clamagore operated off the east coast. In 1962, Clamagore became one of only nine boats to undergo the GUPPY III conversion. She had a hull extension added forward of the control room, a plastic sail and the BQG-4 PUFFS passive ranging sonar, which included the three sharkfin sensors on her deck.

For this reason, the League of the Iroquois historically met at the Iroquois government's capital at Onondaga, as the traditional chiefs do today. History According to oral tradition, The Great Peacemaker approached the Onondaga and other tribes to found the Haudenosaunee. The tradition tells that at the time the Seneca nation debated joining the Haudenosaunee based on the Great Peacemaker's teachings, a solar eclipse took place. The most likely eclipse to be recounted was in 1142AD, which was visible to the people in the land of the Seneca. This oral tradition is supported by archeological studies. Carbon dating of particular sites of Onondaga habitation shows dates starting close to 1200AD ± 60 years with growth for hundreds of years. Sketch by Samuel de Champlain of his attack on an Onondaga village. In the American Revolutionary War, the Onondaga were at first officially neutral, although individual Onondaga warriors were involved in at least one raid on American settlements. After Americans attacked on their main village on April 20, 1779, the Onondaga later sided with the majority of the League and fought against the American colonists in alliance with the British. After the United States was accorded independence, many Onondaga followed Joseph Brant to Upper Canada, where they were given land by the Crown at Six Nations. On November 11, 1794, the Onondaga Nation, along with the other Haudenosaunee nations, signed the Treaty of Canandaigua with the United States, in which their right to their homeland was acknowledged by the United States in article II of the treaty. In 1816, 450 Onondaga were living in New York, 210 of whom lived on Buffalo Creek Reservation.  Prestige factors  The Onondaga Nation was crucial in forming the Iroquois League which led them to be very well revered by their peers. The \\"Tree of Peace\\" was planted on Onondaga Land. Onondaga has been regarded as the capital of Iroquois land. The Onondaga were known as the Central Fire-Keepers of the Confederacy. The Onondaga were known as the guardians or watch keepers of the league. They were keepers of the law in order to preserve traditions and institutions. The culture hero Hyenwatha was an Onondaga Indian. He was essential in the early organization of the league. The title of Thadodaho was always held by an Onondaga chief. He was to be the chief arbitrator of the Lords of the Confederacy. The Onondaga maintained the largest number chieftainship titles as well as the largest number of clans among the Iroquois. Handsome Lake, the Seneca prophet who was the author of the scripture thats about the new religion of the Iroquois died at Onondaga.  Customs  Iroquois Chiefs from the Six Nations Reserve reading Wampum belts in Brantford, Ontario in 1871. Joseph Snow, Onondaga chief, is first on the left. The Onondaga practice the sprinkling of ashes when juggling the treatment of the sick. They also do a public confession of sins upon a string of wampum. The wampum is employed on all matters of public importance. Their funerals were known to be quiet and solemn with the females covering their faces. There were also special events such as the Planting Feast which would happen in May or when the Onondaga believed the ground was ready. This was three days for penitential and religious services. One day for the children's dance, and one each for the Four Persons, the Holder for the Heavens, the Thunder, and for gambling. The Strawberry Feast comes when the berries are ripe. This day there are dancing for the Thunder and a feast of strawberries. The Green Bean Dance comes when the green beans are fit for use. This day there are dances for the Thunder and a mixture of war and feather dances. The Green Corn dance always comes after the Green Bean dance. This day there are three days for religious services, one for the children, one for the Four Persons, one for the Holder of the heavens, and one for the Thunder with the feast. The Onondaga's Thanksgiving feast in October closely resembled the Green Corn Dance.  Culture  Some factors that defined Onondaga life were a continued placement of villages on defensive high points away from rivers and the presence of defensive earthen embankments. A gradual evolution of pottery vessels and smoking pipe forms and decorations. A gradual evolution of stone and bone tools and implements. Continuity in subsitence systems. Continuity of house forms and inferred communal living. The continued use of human face motifs. Evidence for bear ceremonialism and cannibalism. Government The Onondaga in New York have a traditional form of government, with chiefs nominated by clan mothers, rather than elected. On March 11, 2005, the Onondaga Nation in the town of Onondaga, New York, filed a land rights action in federal court, seeking acknowledgment of title to over of ancestral lands centering in Syracuse, New York. They hoped to obtain increased influence over environmental restoration efforts at Onondaga Lake and other EPA Superfund sites in the claimed area. , Syracuse Post Standard, n.d., accessed 11 Nov 2015 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the Onondagas' claim in 2012, and the Supreme Court in 2013 declined to hear an appeal.  Sports  The Onondaga very much enjoyed sports and physical activity. Lacrosse and foot races were always known to be favorites of the Onondaga people. They also adopted many games from European settlers such as mumble the peg, marbles, some games of ball, pull away, and fox and geese in the snow. Hide and seek and blindman's bluff were played but no games with song.

As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and provide a proof that these axioms were consistent. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as real analysis, could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic arithmetic. Gödel's incompleteness theorems, published in 1931, showed that Hilbert's program was unattainable for key areas of mathematics. In his first theorem, Gödel showed that any consistent system with a computable set of axioms which is capable of expressing arithmetic can never be complete: it is possible to construct a statement that can be shown to be true, but that cannot be derived from the formal rules of the system. In his second theorem, he showed that such a system could not prove its own consistency, so it certainly cannot be used to prove the consistency of anything stronger with certainty. This refuted Hilbert's assumption that a finitistic system could be used to prove the consistency of itself, and therefore anything else. Statement of Hilbert's program The main goal of Hilbert's program was to provide secure foundations for all mathematics. In particular this should include: *A formulation of all mathematics; in other words all mathematical statements should be written in a precise formal language, and manipulated according to well defined rules. *Completeness: a proof that all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formalism. *Consistency: a proof that no contradiction can be obtained in the formalism of mathematics. This consistency proof should preferably use only \\"finitistic\\" reasoning about finite mathematical objects. *Conservation: a proof that any result about \\"real objects\\" obtained using reasoning about \\"ideal objects\\" (such as uncountable sets) can be proved without using ideal objects. *Decidability: there should be an algorithm for deciding the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. Gödel's incompleteness theorems Kurt Gödel showed that most of the goals of Hilbert's program were impossible to achieve, at least if interpreted in the most obvious way. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem shows that any consistent theory powerful enough to encode addition and multiplication of integers cannot prove its own consistency. This presents a challenge to Hilbert's program: *It is not possible to formalize all mathematical true statements within a formal system, as any attempt at such a formalism will omit some true mathematical statements. There is no complete, consistent extension of even Peano arithmetic based on a recursively enumerable set of axioms. *A theory such as Peano arithmetic cannot even prove its own consistency, so a restricted \\"finitistic\\" subset of it certainly cannot prove the consistency of more powerful theories such as set theory. *There is no algorithm to decide the truth (or provability) of statements in any consistent extension of Peano arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this negative solution to the Entscheidungsproblem appeared a few years after Gödel's theorem, because at the time the notion of an algorithm had not been precisely defined. Hilbert's program after Gödel Many current lines of research in mathematical logic, such as proof theory and reverse mathematics, can be viewed as natural continuations of Hilbert's original program. Much of it can be salvaged by changing its goals slightly (Zach 2005), and with the following modifications some of it was successfully completed: *Although it is not possible to formalize all mathematics, it is possible to formalize essentially all the mathematics that anyone uses. In particular Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, combined with first-order logic, gives a satisfactory and generally accepted formalism for almost all current mathematics. *Although it is not possible to prove completeness for systems that can express at least the Peano arithmetic (or, more generally, that have a computable set of axioms), it is possible to prove forms of completeness for many other interesting systems. An example of a non-trivial theory for which completeness has been proved is the theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic. *The question of whether there are finitary consistency proofs of strong theories is difficult to answer, mainly because there is no generally accepted definition of a \\"finitary proof\\". Most mathematicians in proof theory seem to regard finitary mathematics as being contained in Peano arithmetic, and in this case it is not possible to give finitary proofs of reasonably strong theories. On the other hand, Gödel himself suggested the possibility of giving finitary consistency proofs using finitary methods that cannot be formalized in Peano arithmetic, so he seems to have had a more liberal view of what finitary methods might be allowed. A few years later, Gentzen gave a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic. The only part of this proof that was not clearly finitary was a certain transfinite induction up to the ordinal ε0. If this transfinite induction is accepted as a finitary method, then one can assert that there is a finitary proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic. More powerful subsets of second order arithmetic have been given consistency proofs by Gaisi Takeuti and others, and one can again debate about exactly how finitary or constructive these proofs are. (The theories that have been proved consistent by these methods are quite strong, and include most \\"ordinary\\" mathematics.) *Although there is no algorithm for deciding the truth of statements in Peano arithmetic, there are many interesting and non-trivial theories for which such algorithms have been found. For example, Tarski found an algorithm that can decide the truth of any statement in analytic geometry (more precisely, he proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable). Given the Cantor–Dedekind axiom, this algorithm can be regarded as an algorithm to decide the truth of any statement in Euclidean geometry. This is substantial as few people would consider Euclidean geometry a trivial theory. See also *Grundlagen der Mathematik *Foundational crisis of mathematics *Atomism  References  *G.

Launched on 26 November 1989 as TV3, it was New Zealand's first privately owned television channel. The channel currently broadcasts nationally (with regional advertising targeting four markets) in digital free-to-air form via the state-owned Kordia on terrestrial and satellite. Vodafone also carries the channel for their cable subscribers in Wellington and Christchurch. It previously broadcast nationally on analogue television until that was switched off on 1 December 2013. Three is a general entertainment channel owned by MediaWorks New Zealand, with a significant news and current affairs element under the banner of Newshub. Three carries a significant amount of local content, most of which airs at prime-time. History =Establishment= Original TV3 logo Later version logo Applications to apply for a warrant to operate New Zealand's third national television network opened in 1985. The Broadcasting Tribunal announced in 1987 that TV3 had won the warrant. TV3 initially aimed to provide a regionally based television service, with linked studios based in each of the four areas (Auckland, Wellington, Waikato/BOP, and South Island). There were numerous delays to the launch date of TV3. Litigation surrounded the granting of the warrant, as did the share market crash in October 1987, which wiped out a large proportion of the capital that TV3 required to establish the channel. The then Minister of Broadcasting, Richard Prebble, announced in late 1987 that much of the UHF spectrum in New Zealand was to be auctioned to allow for an increased number of television channels, resulting in a reduction in the value of TV3's warrant due to the increased competition. The drawn-out tribunal process of frequency allocation that TV3 had just won would be replaced by a bidding process that would allocate frequencies in weeks rather than months or even years. These problems resulted in the ambitious regional plans being rationalised before being shelved completely. The network was to be based in Auckland with limited studios and news and sales teams in the other main centres. Broadcasting started on 26 November 1989 with a preview of what viewers could expect to see. After Governor-General Paul Reeves officially launched the station, the first broadcast was a two-hour special previewing the network's programmes featuring comedians David McPhail and Jon Gadsby playing cameramen. TV3's initial slogan proclaimed 'Come Home to the Feeling'; a derivative of the 'Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC' slogan used by NBC in the United States at the time. At time of launch about 60 percent of the New Zealand audience could receive TV3's regular broadcasts. Early in TV3's life, financial supporters of the network included ABC and NBC as a minority shareholding, who later sold their interest. =Westpac ownership= TV3 failed to gain ground against a recently revitalised TVNZ and was placed into receivership on 2 May 1990. TV3 continued to broadcast with the major creditor, Westpac Banking Corporation, supporting the network by taking a large shareholding. As TV3 needed investment during a climate of economic recession, the government liberalised the rules on foreign ownership of television stations (raising the 15 percent cap to 49 percent and later removing all restrictions), allowing TV3 to search for an investor overseas. In December 1991, CanWest took a 20 percent shareholding in TV3 and secured a management agreement allowing it full control to operate the station. CanWest introduced tighter controls on budgets while targeting the lucrative 18- to 49-year-old audience. TV3's audience share and advertising revenue steadily increased, leading to significant profits. TV3 also steadily increased its coverage within New Zealand, adding dozens of transmitters and translators, often with the assistance of New Zealand On Air. By 1998 about 97 percent of the population could receive the channel. On 2 October 1996, TV3 announced a reshuffling of its broadcast frequencies to enable it to launch a new network, to be called TV4 Network Limited, on the VHF band. TV4, which started on 29 June 1997, is a free-to-air network aimed at a younger audience than TV3. The launch was considered successful, with high brand recognition and ratings significantly higher than MTV, TV4's television rival. TV4's opening broadcast was the controversial Tyson–Holyfield boxing rematch. =CanWest ownership= In April 1997 CanWest purchased Westpac's 48 percent shareholding in TV3, taking CanWest's stake to 68 percent. In June CanWest picked up the More FM Radio network, followed in November with the purchase of the remaining 32 percent of TV3. In April 1998, CanWest announced that it had made C$22 million in the six months to February 1998 in New Zealand, up a third on the same period the year before. TV4 contributed positively to the result, with some of the increase due to the inclusion of More FM, while TV3 was continuing to experience strong revenue growth. Canwest's investments in New Zealand had developed considerably in New Zealand over the period that it had interests in the country. TV4 continued to be a source of concern for the broadcaster, but the position of TV3 was strengthened by alliances with SKY Television for sport and a series of high-profile mistakes by TVNZ as it dealt with the dominance of SKY in pay television. The election of the Labour government in 1999 refocused TVNZ as a semi-non-commercial broadcaster, no longer ratings-driven and no longer attempting to dominate the free to air television market. As a commercial broadcaster, TV3 was in a position to take advantage of TVNZ's change of focus. TV3 logo used from 2003 to 2017 During 2004 the station was transferred into the ownership of Canwest MediaWorks New Zealand as a way of listing 30 percent of the Canadian company's New Zealand assets on the New Zealand share market. TV3's parent company TVWorks announced its annual revenue at $124 million in October 2004, which was $13 million up from the previous financial year. =Mediaworks New Zealand ownership= In May 2007 it was announced that Ironbridge Capital, an Australian private equity firm, was paying $386 million or $2.43 a share for the 70 percent of CanWest MediaWorks New Zealand owned by CanWest Global Communications. It was also offering the same price to minority shareholders under a full takeover bid. On 1 April 2008, TV3 became the first New Zealand television network to introduce high- definition television, to coincide with the launch of Freeview HD and MySky HDi in New Zealand. The first programme to broadcast in true 1080i high definition (i.e. not upscaled) was that night's screening of Boston Legal. On 17 June 2013 the parent company of TV3 went into receivership, this being the second receivership for TV3. When TV3's parent company Mediaworks was purchased by Ironbridge Capital they took on $700 Million of debt which could no longer be sustained. Following the receivership TV3 and the radio stations owned by Mediaworks remained on air and all staff have retained their jobs. Shares in the company were gradually and completely bought out by US hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management. Former 3NOW logo used until 2017 Since 3 July 2016, with the closure of sister channel Four, some of its programming, such as Sticky TV, moved over to TV3 in a new daytime lineup. On 9 February 2017, TV3 underwent a major re-branding, changing its name to Three and adopting a new logo and on-air imaging. The new brand was promoted as being \\"vibrant, playful, and inspiring\\"; chief content officer Andrew Szusterman explained that TV3 as a brand had not evolved with its programming, and that \\"a channel this strong, with content this strong, should be bigger than the sum of its parts and it should represent the content itself whereas the pieces of content were living in isolation.\\" The new imaging was widely criticized by viewers, particularly the unusual design and stylization of its new logo as \\"+HR=E\\". A second sister channel, ThreeLife, was launched on 15 April 2018. On 18 October 2019, Mediaworks announced Three was for sale. On 25 March 2020, ThreeLife went off air, and was replaced by the return of The Edge TV and new channel, The Breeze TV. =Discovery, Inc. ownership= In early September 2020, MediaWorks confirmed that it would be selling its television media assets, which include Three, to the US mass media multinational company Discovery, Inc. Content =Output contracts= Mediaworks acquired a first-run and re-run contract with HD sourced material for 20th Century Fox Television content (which includes films under the brands 20th Century Fox, DreamWorks Animation – 2008 to present, Fox Atomic, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Icon Films – 2007 to 2012, now belongs to Prime Television New Zealand and Regency Enterprises), which was previously held by TVNZ. When TVNZ outbid them for their previous Disney Media Distribution contract. In 2015, they had the rights to Metro Goldwyn Mayer for more recent films. Exclusive contracts with CBS News, ITV News and Seven News for international news coverage. Mediaworks has long held first-option contracts with NBC Universal (which includes films under the brands Focus Features and Universal Pictures) with select HD material from February 2011. As well as until the start of the US 2012 season, a first-option contract with CBS Television Distribution (which included films under the brands Paramount Pictures and non-animated DreamWorks Pictures) with select HD material from the end of 2012, this deal came to an end for new content from the start of 2013. From mid-2013, TV3 secured a first option deal with Sony Pictures Television for new content for TV series and movies that will be scheduled for late 2013 and the 2014 season. This deal signals a move away from the more expensive exclusive Fox deal, which is still under re- negotiation following the broadcaster's change in ownership. On 20 December, MediaWorks re-signed a revised down scaled exclusive deal with Fox. As a result of their receivership, they lost their first-option rights over NBC- Universal shows, which resulted in TVNZ acquiring the rights to Brooklyn Nine Nine in 2014. They also lost their rights to air 20th Television programmes, which resulted Prime Television New Zealand to air Sleepy Hollow, and Television New Zealand to air Empire. From 2020, Three will be the new home of Warner Bros. Television content taking over from TVNZ. Broadcasting details From launch in November 1989 until digital television transition was completed on 1 December 2013, TV3 broadcast terrestrially using the analogue PAL-B&G.; Except for Kapiti where it broadcast on ITU Band IV (UHF), TV3 broadcast in the main urban areas on ITU band III (VHF high). In other areas and infill transmitters in the main urban areas, it broadcast on either band I (VHF low), band III, band IV or band V (UHF). In some areas, TV3's analogue broadcast was on a different transmitter from TV One and TV2's analogue broadcasts, and viewers needed an additional antenna to pick up the channel; these included Hamilton, Tauranga, Taupo, Gisborne, Kapiti, Masterton, and Nelson. Three is a broadcasting member of the Freeview platform as well as broadcasting on Sky Digital. TV3 began screening widescreen transmissions on both platforms on 11 April 2007, although TelstraClear InHomeTV, which gets most of its content from SKY Digital, switched back to screening the cropped version of TV3 for a couple of months due to non-widescreen customer complaints. TelstraClear resumed broadcasting the widescreen version of TV3 on 24 July 2007. In April 2008 TV3 commenced 1080i high definition broadcasts on the FreeviewHD terrestrial platform and on Sky's HD satellite platform. Three also broadcasts a livestream of the Auckland feed on its website. ThreeNow ThreeNow logo ThreeNow (previously called 3Now) is an on-demand streaming platform, on which select programmes from Three and sister channel Bravo, as well as web-only programmes, are available. ThreeNow is available on the ThreeNow website as well as on iOS and Android devices. It also has live streams of Three and sister channels Bravo and The Edge TV. ThreePlus1 ThreePlus1 logo ThreePlus1 (previously called TV3 Plus 1) is a 1-hour timeshift channel. It was launched on 30 March 2009, as part of Three's contract with Freeview to provide at least four channels. It is a standard hour delayed timeshift channel of the Three broadcast taken from their Auckland feed that was created originally for the Sky platform, meaning the channel broadcasts Auckland regional advertising. ThreePlus1 is available on digital terrestrial and digital satellite. Defunct = ThreeLife= ThreeLife was a New Zealand nationwide television channel that was launched on 15 April 2018.

During the day, the channel repeated programmes from the previous night. These aired from 9am on Monday through Friday, from 11:30am on Saturday, and from 6am on Sunday. From midnight to 6 am, a simulcast of Magic Talk was broadcast. The station was shut down at the end of 25 March 2020, and was replaced by the return of The Edge TV a little over an hour later. The final program to air was Good Chef Bad Chef. = ThreeLife + 1 = ThreeLife + 1 logo ThreeLife + 1 was a 1-hour timeshift channel. It was launched on 1 July 2019, in the place of The Edge TV.

Carving of mermaid (possibly with mirror), Clontuskert Abbey Merrow (from Irish ', Middle Irish ' or ') is a mermaid or merman in Irish folklore. The term is of Irish-English origin. The merrows supposedly requires to have a magical cap (; Irish-English: cohuleen druith) in its possession in order to travel between deep water and dry land. Overview The word appears in two tales set in Ireland published in the 19th century: \\"Lady of Gollerus\\", where a green-haired merrow weds a local Kerry man who deprives her of the \\"magical red cap\\" ('); and \\"The Soul Cages\\" where a green-bodied grotesque male merrow entertains a fisherman at his home under the sea. These tales with commentary were first published in T. C. Croker's Fairy Legends (1828). William Butler Yeats and others writing on the subject borrowed heavily from this work. \\"The Soul Cages\\" turned out not to be a genuine folktale, but a piece of fiction fabricated by Thomas Keightley. A number of other terms in Irish are used to denote a mermaid or sea-nymph, some tracing back to mythological tracts from the medieval to the post-medieval period.

But this was not the derivation given by 19th century writers. According to Croker, \\"merrow\\" was a transliteration of modern Irish ' or ', which resolved into ' \\"sea\\" + ' \\"maid\\". This \\"Gaelic\\" word could also denote \\"sea monster\\", and Croker remarked that it was cognate with Cornish ', a \\"sea hog\\". Yeats added ' as an alternative original, as that word is also synonymous with mermaid. The corresponding term in the Scots dialect is ', derived from the Irish, with no original Scottish Gaelic form suggested. The Middle Irish ', (from ' + ' \\"chant, song\\") with its singing melodies that held sway over seamen was more characteristic of the sirens of classical mythology, and was imported into Irish literature via Homer's Odyssey. Synonyms The terms ', ', and ' been listed as synonymous to \\"mermaid\\" or \\"sea nymph\\". These are Old or Middle Irish words, and usage are attested in medieval tracts. Other modern Irish terms for mermaid are given in O'Reilly's dictionary (1864);guidheamhain, ; maighdean-mhara, p. 345; moruach, p. 369; muirgheilt, muirimhgeach, p. 371. one of them, ' (\\"sea-maiden\\"), being the common term for \\"mermaid\\" in Irish today (cf. de Bhaldraithe's dictionary, 1959). The term ', literally \\"sea-wanderer\\", has been applied, among other uses, to , a legendary figure who underwent metamorphosis into a salmon-woman. Strictly speaking, the term ' in the ' example signifies \\"mermaid's melody\\". However, O'Clery's Glossary explains that this was rhetorically the \\"name of the nymphs that are in the sea\\". The term ' for \\"mermaid\\" also finds instance in the '. Croker also vaguely noted that ' has been used by \\"romantic historians\\" in reference to the \\"sea-nymphs\\" enountered by Milesian ships. Folk tales Thomas Crofton Croker's Second Volume to the Fairy Legends (1828) laid the groundwork for the folkloric treatment of the merrow. It was immediately translated into German by the Brothers Grimm. Croker's material on the merrow was to a large measure rehashed by such authors on the fairy-kind as Thomas Keightley, John O'Hanlon, and the poet William Butler Yeats. A general sketch of the merrow pieced together by such 19th century authors are as follows. =Characteristics= The merrow-maiden is like the commonly stereotypical mermaid: half-human, a gorgeous woman from waist up, and fish-like waist down, her lower extremity \\"covered with greenish-tinted scales\\" (according to O'Hanlon). She has green hair which she fondly grooms with her comb. She exhibits slight webbing between her fingers, a white and delicate film resembling \\"the skin between egg and shell\\". Said to be of \\"modest, affectionate, gentle, and [benevolent] disposition,\\" the merrow is believed \\"capable of attachment to human beings,\\" with reports of inter-marriage. One such mixed marriage took place in Bantry, producing descendants marked by \\"scaly skin\\" and \\"membrane between fingers and toes\\". But after some \\"years in succession\\" they will almost inevitably return to the sea, their \\"natural instincts\\" irresistibly overcoming any love-bond they may have formed with their terrestrial family. And to prevent her acting on impulse, her ' (or \\"little magic cap\\") must be kept \\"well concealed from his sea-wife\\". O'Hanlon mentioned that a merrow may leave her outer skin behind in order to transform into other beings \\"more magical and beauteous\\", But in Croker's book, this characteristic isn't ascribed to the merrow but to the merwife of Shetland (where she is called the selkie) and Faroese tradition. Another researcher noted that the Irish merrow's device was her cap \\"covering her entire body\\", as opposed to the Scottish Maid-of-the-Wave who had her salmon-skin. Yeats claimed that merrows come ashore transformed into \\"little hornless cows\\". One stymied investigator conjectured this claim to be an extrapolation on Kennedy's statement that sea-cows are attracted to pasture on the meadowland wherever the merrow resided. Merrow-maidens have also been known to lure young men beneath the waves, where afterwards the men live in an enchanted state. While female merrows were considered to be very beautiful, the mermen were thought to be very ugly. This fact potentially accounted for the merrow's desire to seek out men on the land. Merrow music is known to be heard coming from the farthest depths of the ocean, yet the sound travels floatingly across the surface. Merrows dance to the music, whether ashore on the strand or upon the wave. =Merrow-men= While most stories about merrow are about female creatures, a tale about an Irish merman does exist in the form of \\"The Soul Cages\\", published in Croker's anthology. In it, a merman captured the souls of drowned sailors and locked them in cages (lobster pot-like objects) under the sea. This tale turned out to be an invented piece of fiction (an adaptation of a German folktale), although Thomas Keightley who acknowledged the fabrication claimed that by sheer coincidence, similar folktales were indeed to be found circulated in areas of Cork and Wicklow. The male merrow in the story, called Coomara (meaning \\"sea-hound\\"), has green hair and teeth, pig-like eyes, a red nose, grows a tail between his scaly legs, and has stubby fin-like arms. Commentators, starting with Croker and echoed by O'Hanlon and Yeats after him, stated categorically that this description fitted male merrows in general, and ugliness ran generally across the entire male populace of its kind, the red nose possibly attributable to their love of brandy. The merrow which signifies \\"sea maiden\\" is an awkward term when applied to the male, but has been in use for a lack of a term in Irish slang for merman. One scholar has insisted the term macamore might be used as the Irish designation for merman, since it means literally \\"son of the sea\\", on authority of Patrick Kennedy, though the latter merely glosses macamore as designating local inhabitants of the Wexford coast. Gaelic (Irish) words for mermen are ' \\"mermaid-man\\" or ' \\"man of the sea\\". =Cohuleen druith= Merrows wear a special hat called a ', which enables them to dive beneath the waves. If they lose this cap, it is said that they will lose their power to return beneath the water. The normalized spelling in Irish is ', literally \\"little magic hood\\" (' \\"cowl, hood, hooded cloak\\" + ' diminutive suffix, gen. of '). This rendering is echoed by Kennedy who glosses this object as \\"nice little magic cap\\". Arriving at a different reconstruction, Croker believed that it denoted a hat in the a particular shape of a matador's \\"\\", or in less exotic terms, \\"a strange looking thing like a cocked hat,\\" to quote from the tale \\"The Lady of Gollerus\\". A submersible \\"cocked hat\\" also figures in the invented merrow-man tale \\"The Soul Cages\\". The notion that the ' is a hat \\"covered with feathers\\", stated by O'Hanlon and Yeats arises from taking Croker too literally.: \\"O'Hanlon was echoing Croker directly [when he wrote the paragraph on the ' being] ‘generally covered with feathers...’...\\"; ‘The feathers on the merrow's cap’ are clearly a touch borrowed from O'Hanlon' in Yeat's case.\\" Croker did point out that the merrow's hat shared something in common with \\"feather dresses of the ladies\\" in two Arabian Nights tales. However, he did not mean the merrow's hat had feathers on them. As other commentators have point out, what Croker meant was that both contained the motif of a supernatural woman who is bereft of the article of clothing and is prevented from escaping her captor. This is commonly recognized as the \\"feather garment\\" motif in swan maiden-type tales. The ' was also considered to be of red color by Yeats, although this is not indicated by his predecessors such as Croker. An analogue to the \\"mermaid's cap\\" is found in an Irish tale of a supernatural wife who emerged from the freshwater Lough Owel in Westmeath, Ireland. She was found to be wearing a salmon-skin cap that glittered in the moonlight. A local farmer captured her and took her to be his bride, bearing him children, but she disappeared after discovering her cap while rummaging in the household. Although this \\"fairy mistress\\" is not from the sea, one Celticist identifies her as a ' (sea- maiden) nevertheless. The Scottish counterpart to the merrow's cap was a \\"removable\\" skin, \\"like the skin of a salmon, but brighter and more beautiful, and very large\\", worn by the Maid-of-the-wave. Medieval writings It did not escape the notice of 19th century folklorists that attestations of ' occur in Irish medieval and post-medieval literature, although they have been somewhat imprecise in specifying their textual sources. Croker's remark that \\"the romantic historians of Ireland\\" depicted ' (synonym of merrow) playing round the ships of the Milesians actually leads to the Book of Invasions, which recounts siren-like ' encountered by legendary ancestors of the Irish people while migrating across the Caspian Sea. O'Hanlon's disclosure of \\"an old tract, contained in the Book of Lecain [sic]\\" about the king of the Fomorians encountering them in the Ictian Sea is a tale in the '. The Annals of the Four Masters (17th cent.), an amalgamation of earlier annals, has an entry for the year 887 that reports that a mermaid was cast ashore on the coast of Scotland (Alba). She was in length and had hair long; her fingers were long as was her nose, while she was as white as a swan. The Four Masters also records an entry under year 558 for the capture of as a mermaid; the same event (the capture of the \\"sea lunatic\\" , which is 's nickname) is recorded in the Annals of Ulster in the year 571. =Invasions of Ireland= The medieval ' (\\"The Book of Invasions\\") relates how a band of Goidels on a migratory voyage were stalled on the Caspian Sea by ' (translated as \\"sirens\\" by Macalister) who lulled them to sleep with their songs. Wax ear-plugs for the shipmates prescribed by Caicher the Druid proved to be an effective prophylactic. Even though Caicher the Druid is present in either case, different sets of voyagers, generationally-shifted from each other are engaged in actions with the sirens, depending on the variant text groups. In the First Redaction of ', the Goidels settled in Scythia embarking on an exodus, led by men such as were the ones upon which the sirens wreaked havoc, while in the Second and Third Redactions, their progeny the Milesians led by met the same fate. These ' resemble sirens defeated by Odysseus to such a degree, \\"Homeric influence\\" is plainly evident. The medieval scribes of ' eschewed physical descriptions. However, Michael O'Clery's 17th century recension of the Book of Invasions interpolated a decidedly half-fish half-female depiction of the ' in his copy of the ': > In this wise are those seamonsters, with the form of a woman from their > navels upwards, excelling every female form in beauty and shapeliness, with > light yellow hair down over their shoulders; but fishes are they from their > navels downwards. They sing a musical ever-tuneful song to the crews of the > ships that sail near them, so that they fall into the stupor of sleep in > listening to them ; they afterwards drag the crews of the ships towards them > when they find them thus asleep, and so devour them... = Dindsenchas = There are tales featuring Irish mermaids in the ', collections of onomastic tales explaining the origins of place names. One tale explains how the demise of Roth son of Cithang by mermaids (') in the Ictian sea (English Channel) gave birth to the name (now Co. Waterford). \\"Port of the Thigh\\" it came to be called where his thigh washed ashore. The mermaids here are described as beautiful maidens except for their hill-sized \\"hairy-clawed bestial lower part\\" below water. While one text group only goes as far as to say the mermaids dismembered Roth, alternate texts says that they devoured him, so that only the thigh bone drifted ashore. Thus, like the mermaids in O'Clery's version, the half-beautiful mermaids here sang sleep-inducing \\"burdens\\" or musical refrains, tore their victims apart, and ate them. Whitley Stokes noted that the description of mermaids here coincides with the description of sirens in the ', or rather the medieval European bestiaries, particularly that of . There are several onomastic tales which attempts to explain the name origin of (Assaroe Falls), one of which involves mermaid music ('). It purports a woman named Ruad who rowed out to the estuary was induced to sleep by the \\"mermaid's melody\\" and drowned in the spot, which received its name after her. The of (estuary of Delvin River, Co. Dublin) is counted as a mermaid tale, though no \\"mermaid\\" term specifically occurs. Nine women dwelling in the sea held immobilized the fleet of three ships led by son of , a grandson of the king of the people. lay with the beautiful women, but he made an empty promise to carry on their tryst. The women arrived by boat to exact vengeance on , but frustrated, slew two of his sons instead, including the child one of them had borne. The episode is also embedded in the story The Wooing of Emer of the Ulster Cycle.  Popular culture  * Merrow have appeared in the core rules of various classic editions of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. They are essentially just aquatic ogres, and thus only the brutish male merrow of real-world mythology are properly represented therein. * In the Magic: The Gathering card game, \\"Merrows\\" are a type of merfolk, native to the plane of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor. They are friendly, white/blue-aligned freshwater merchants, healers, and guides, dwelling in the clear streams of the \\"sunny\\" aspect of the plane (Lorwyn), and mischievous, blue/black-aligned brackish water looters and assassins dwelling in the bogs of the \\"dusk\\" aspect of the plane (Shadowmoor). * In the Puyo Puyo games, is a type of mermaid, part of the .

Merrow was the first in the fictional place of Miromara in the series. * In the Harry Potter tie-in book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, merrows are said to be one of three subspecies of merpeople, along with Scottish selkies and Greek sirens. * In Kentaro Miura's manga Berserk, Merrow are the name given to a race of mer- folk. * In Jess Kidd's \\"Things in Jars\\", the merrow is a pale girl with eyes that change color between white and black. She has sharp, fish like teeth, and frequently bites. Her bite is fatally poisonous to men, but not women. She also has some control over water, and causes the river in London to rise, threatening a flood. She attracts snails and newts, which she eats.

It is also an iconic devotional image that shows Christ, usually naked above the waist, with the wounds of his Passion prominently displayed on his hands and side (the \\"ostentatio vulnerum\\", a feature of other standard types of image), often crowned with the Crown of Thorns and sometimes attended by angels. It developed in Europe from the 13th century and was especially popular in Northern Europe. The image continued to spread and develop iconographical complexity until well after the Renaissance, but the Man of Sorrows in its many artistic forms is the most precise visual expression of the piety of the later Middle Ages, which took its character from mystical contemplation rather than from theological speculation.Schiller, quote from p.198, figs 681-812 Together with the Pietà, it was the most popular of the Andachtsbilder-type images of the period – devotional images detached from the narrative of Christ's Passion, intended for meditation.  Biblical narrative  The phrase translated into English as \\"Man of Sorrows\\" (\\"\\", ’îš maḵ’ōḇōṯ in the Hebrew Bible, vir dolōrum in the Vulgate, in German Schmerzensmann) occurs at verse 3 (in Isaiah 53): > 3) He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with > grief. And we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we > esteemed Him not. 4) Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our > sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 5) > But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our > iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes > we are healed. 6) All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every > one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. Development of the image The image developed from the Byzantine epitaphios image, which possibly dates back to the 8th century. A miraculous Byzantine mosaic icon of it is known as the Imago Pietatis or Christ of Pity. The work appears to have been brought to the major pilgrimage church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome in the 12th century. Only replicas of the original work now survive. By the 13th century it was becoming common in the West as a devotional image for contemplation, in sculpture, painting and manuscripts. It continued to grow in popularity, helped by the Jubilee Year of 1350, when the Roman image seems to have had, perhaps initially only for the Jubilee, a papal indulgence of 14,000 years granted for prayers said in its presence.Schiller, 199–200, also see Parshall, 58 and Pattison, 150. Man of Sorrows (c. 1485–95), an especially complex version by Geertgen tot Sint Jans, Dutch, 25 × 24 cmDiscussed by Snyder, 176-78 The image formed part of the subject of the Mass of Saint Gregory; by 1350 the Roman icon was being claimed as a contemporary representation of the vision.Parshall, 58. For a somewhat different chronology, see Pattison, 150 In this image the figure of Christ was typical of the Byzantine forerunners of the Man of Sorrows, at half length, with crossed hands and head slumped sideways to the viewer's left. The various versions of the Man of Sorrows image all show a Christ with the wounds of the Crucifixion, including the spear-wound. Especially in Germany, Christ's eyes are usually open and look out at the viewer; in Italy the closed eyes of the Byzantine epitaphios image, originally intended to show a dead Christ, remained for longer. For some the image represented the two natures of Christ – he was dead as a man, but alive as God.Schiller, 198 Full-length figures also first appear in southern Germany in wall-paintings in the 13th century, and in sculpture from the beginning of the 14th.Schiller, 201-202 Other elements that were sometimes included, in distinct sub-forms of the image, included the Arma Christi or \\"Instruments of the Passion\\", the cross, a chalice into which blood poured from Christ's side or other wounds (giving an emphasis on the Eucharist), angels to hold these objects or support a slumped Christ himself (Meister Francke shows both roles below), and mourners or worshippers.Schiller, 201-219 The Throne of Mercy is an image of the Trinity with Christ, often diminutive, as Man of Sorrows, supported by his Father.

This text is also commonly known today under the Latin title Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum (Book of Biblical Antiquities), a title that is not found, per se, on the Latin manuscripts of Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities. Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities is preserved today in 18 complete and 3 fragmentary Latin manuscripts that date between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries CE. In addition, portions of Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities parallel material also found in the Chronicles of Jerahmeel, a 14th century Hebrew composition. The Latin text of Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities circulated in some Latin collections of writings by Philo of Alexandria. Scholars have long recognized the pseudonymous character of the text now known as Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities. Primary in this regard is a vastly differing approach to and use of the Jewish Scriptures than that of Philo of Alexandria. For the sake of convenience and due to the lack of a better option, scholars continue to follow the lead of Philo scholar Leopold Cohn in calling the author “Pseudo-Philo.” Estimated date of work Most scholars contend that Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities was written sometime between the mid-first century CE and the mid-second century CE. Some scholars propose that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities was written shortly preceding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in 70 CE while other scholars suggest that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquites was written post-70 CE, possibly as late as shortly following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 CE). A very small minority of scholars suggest dates outside these bounds. Examples include Abram Spiro who suggests that it was composed in the second century BCE, J. R. Porter who dates Pseudo-Philo to 25 CE, and Alexander Zeron who posits that it was composed sometime in the third or fourth centuries CE. Among the evidence cited by scholars in support of a pre-70 CE date of composition is the depiction of the temple in Jerusalem as still standing and in use for sacrifices (e.g. LAB 22:8).Daniel J. Harrington, “Pseudo-Philo,” in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (ed. James H. Charlesworth; 2 vols.; Garden City: Doubleday, 1983-1985), 2:299. Further, Daniel J. Harrington writes: 'A date prior to AD 70 (and perhaps around the time of Jesus) is suggested by the kind of Old Testament text used in the book, the free attitude towards the text, the interest in the sacrifices and other things pertaining to cult, and the silence about the destruction of the temple'.Daniel J. Harrington, 'Outside the Old Testament' in Marinus de Jong (ed.) Outside the Old Testament (CUP, 1985), p. 8 Howard Jacobson, for example, treats this view dismissively, stating that \\"Simply put, there are no particularly cogent arguments in support of a pre-70 date.\\" Among the evidence cited in support of a post-70 CE date of composition are thematic parallels with 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, Jewish texts composed post-70 CE and references to the destruction of the temple (e.g. LAB 19:7). Original language and translational history The scholarly consensus is that Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities was not composed in Latin but, rather that it was composed in Hebrew and translated into Greek before being translated into Latin by the fourth century CE. The primary evidence for this are the many difficult readings in Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities that are best explained by the existence of Hebrew and Greek antecedents. Short description of content Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities is a selective rewriting of Jewish scriptural texts and traditions.Daniel J. Harrington, “Pseudo-Philo,” in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (ed. James H. Charlesworth; 2 vols.; Garden City: Doubleday, 1983-1985), 2:297. Following a basic narrative outline derived from the Jewish Scriptures, the work opens with the creation of the world (LAB 1) and concludes with the death of King Saul (LAB 65). As Leopold Cohn observes, Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities “passes rapidly over” or “omits” certain aspects of the scriptural narrative while elaborating other on others, even supplying “many quite novel additions” not paralleled in the Jewish Scriptures. Many of its additions have parallels in other Jewish traditions. Some scholars have reasoned that the fact that it ends with the death of Saul implies that there were further parts of the work which are now missing while others believe that it is complete. =The work as source of legends= It is probably the earliest reference for many later legendary accretions to the Biblical texts, such as the casting of Abraham into the fire, Dinah's marriage to Job, and Moses born circumcised. It also contains several other embellishments which deviate quite substantially from the norm, such as Abraham leading a rebellion against the builders of the Tower of Babel (the reason for him being cast into the fire). It includes a lament about the human sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter, with the daughter being the singer. Commentators have noted that the characterisation of the daughter is (like other female characterisations in Pseudo-Philo) much stronger and more positive than that of her biblical counterpart.See for example Philip Alexander's 1988 article 'Retelling the Old Testament' in It Is Written: Scripture Citing Scripture (Cambridge: CUP) and Frederick Murphy's 1993 book Pseudo-Philo: Rewriting the Bible (New York: OUP) She has a name (Seila), and her role is as wise and willing, rather than passive and reluctant, participant. One commentator has observed that 'the author has done his utmost to put this woman on the same level as the patriarchs, in this case especially Isaac'.Van der Horst, Pieter (1989) 'Portraits of Biblical Women in Pseudo- Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum' , Journal for the Study of Pseudepigrapha 5, 29 - 46 (at 42) See also *Antiquities of the Jews *Cairo Geniza *Elephantine papyri *Jewish temple at Elephantine *Land of Onias *Philo *Philosophy *Philo's view of God *Philo's Works *Moses in rabbinic literature References Bibliography * Pseudo-Philo, P.-M.

Biography Ibn al-Muqaffa, though a resident of Basra, was originally from the town of Goor (or Gur, Firuzabad, Fars) in the Iranian province of Fars and was born to a family of local notables. His father had been a state official in charge of taxes under the Umayyads, and after being accused and convicted of embezzling some of the money entrusted to him, was punished by the ruler by having his hand crushed, hence the name Muqaffa (shrivelled hand). Ibn al-Muqaffa served in sectarial posts under the Umayyad governors of Shapur and Kirman. Unlike his other colleagues, he escaped persecution at the hands of Abbasids after their overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty. He later returned to Basra and served as a secretary under Isa ibn Ali and Sulayman ibn Ali, the uncles of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. After their brother Abdallah ibn Ali made an abortive bid for the throne, they asked Ibn al-Muqaffa to write a letter to the Caliph to not retaliate against his uncle and pardon him. The language of the letter offended al-Mansur, who wished to be rid of Ibn al-Muqaffa. He was executed around 756 or 759 AD by the governor of Basra. A defense of Manichaean dualism and a few lines of prose written in imitation of the Quran have been ascribed to him. Whether authentic or not, and despite his conversion to Islam, these texts contributed to his posthumous reputation as a heretic.Said Amir Arjomand, \\"\`Abd Allah Ibn al-Muqaffa\` and the \`Abbasid Revolution,\\" Iranian Studies, 27:33 (1994). Literary career Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the Kalīla wa Dimna from Middle Persian is considered the first masterpiece of Arabic literary prose. \\"Ibn al-Muqaffa' was a pioneer in the introduction of literary prose narrative to Arabic literature. He paved the way for later innovators such as al-Hamadani and al-Saraqusti, who brought literary fiction to Arabic literature by adapting traditionally accepted modes of oral narrative transmission into literary prose.\\" Ibn al-Muqaffa was also an accomplished scholar of Middle Persian, and was the author of several moral fables. Works = Translations and adaptations = Kalīla wa Dimna : His translation of a Middle Persian collection of animal fables, mostly of Indian origin, involving two jackals, Kalīla and Demna. The Middle Persian original, now lost but thought have been entitled Karīrak ud Damanak was written by one Borzōē/Borzūya, a Persian physician attached to the Sasanian court in the 6th century. Prefaced by a putative autobiography of Borzūya and an account of his voyage to India, the full work was done into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa', who introduced it with a prologue of his own and may have been responsible for four added stories. From Ibn al-Moqaffaʿ's Arabic rendering of Borzūya's work are descended not only all later Arabic versions of Kalīla wa Dimna, but also one of two Syriac versions (the other one is pre-Islamic ) and the medieval Greek, Persian (6th/12th century), Hebrew, Latin, and Castilian versions. Though there are many Arabic manuscripts of Kalīla wa Dimna, Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s version is not among them, and the oldest dated copy was written almost five centuries after his death. That he aimed at an idiomatic rather than a slavishly literal rendering is generally agreed, and all indications are that he achieved clarity of expression by simplicity of diction and plain syntactical structures. As no medieval Arab critic seems to have impugned his style, it was evidently pleasing and well suited to the taste of his Arab readers. Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s translation of Kalīla wa Dimna was not a conscious attempt to start a new literary trend; it was clearly just one of several works of old Sasanian court literature which Ibn al-Muqaffa' introduced to an exclusive readership within court circles, its function being to illustrate what should or should not be done by those aiming at political and social success. Kalīla wa Dimna, nonetheless, served as a stimulus to the development of Arabic prose literature and inspired imitators, artists, and poets. A prose Persian translation of the Arabic text was available as early as the 10th century, of which a versified version was made by Rudaki (d.941-42). Both versions are lost except for a few lines of Rūdakī’s poem preserved in other sources. A later prose translation was rendered by Abu’l-Maʿālī Nasr-Allāh Ibn Mohammad Shirazi and dedicated to the Ghaznavid Bahramshah. Khwaday-Namag: Ibn al-Muqaffa' is thought to have produced an Arabic adaptation of the late Sasanian Khwaday-Namag, a chronicle of pre-Islamic Persian kings, princes, and warriors. A mixture of legend, myth, and fact, it served as a quasi-national history inspired by a vision of kingship as a well-ordered autocracy with a sacred duty to rule and to regulate its subjects’ conduct within a rigid class system. Interspersed with maxims characteristic of andarz literature, the narrative also offered practical advice on civil and military matters. Ibn al- Muqaffa' is known to have modified certain parts of the original and excluded others, possibly to make it intelligible to his Arab Muslim readers. He is thought to have inserted an account of Mazdak, from which later Perso-Arab historians derived much of their knowledge of the Mazdakite movement. Like its Middle Persian original, Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s Arabic version is not extant. The Oyun al-akhbar and the Ketab al-maʿaref of Ibn Qutayba (d. 889) may preserve fragments of it; certainly the Sīar al-ʿAjam, quoted by Ibn Qutayba without ascription, renders the Khwaday-Namag. Other books: Ibn al-Nadim attributes several other Arabic translations of Middle Persian works to Ibn al-Muqaffa', namely Āʾīn-nāma, Kitāb al-tāj, and Kitāb Mazdak. Ibn Qutayba is thought to have preserved parts of the Āʾīn-nāma, for in his Oyun a number of passages are quoted, albeit without ascription, with the opening words I have read in the Aiin (or Kitāb al-āʾīn). The quotations bear on topics such as court manners and customs, military tactics, divination and physiognomy, archery, and polo, subjects typical of various works on Sasanian institutions, protocol, entertainment, general savoir faire, and so on. Also in the Oyun are extracts from a Kitāb al-tāj . Ebn al-Nadim describes this book as a biography of Khosrau I (Anoshirvan), but Ibn Qutayba's extracts mostly pertain to Khosrau II (Parviz) and suggest a mirror for princes. The subject of the Ketab Mazdak was, as its title implies, the leader of the revolutionary religious movement whose activities led to his execution in 531.A better product of Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s translation activities is the Nāma-ye Tansar, a political work taking its name from its putative author Tansar , the Zoroastrian priestly adviser to the first Sasanian monarch, Ardashir I . Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s Arabic version is lost, but Ibn Isfandiar’s Persian rendering of it, made in the early 13th century and embodied in his Tarikh-e Tabarestan (History of Tabarestan), reveals its content . Apart from adding various illustrative verses, some…in elegant Persian, Ibn al-Muqaffa evidently inserted Quranic and Biblical quotations, presumably as a concession to Muslims. Be that as it may, his Sasanian text is still Iranocentric: > ...we are the best of Persians, and there is no quality or trait of > excellence or nobility which we hold dearer than the fact that we have ever > showed humility and lowliness…in the service of kings, and have chosen > obedience and loyalty, devotion and fidelity. Through this quality…we came > to be the head and neck of all the climes... = Original works = Two preceptive works in Arabic are ascribed to Ibn al- Muqaffa', al-Adab al-kabīr and al-Adab al-saghir, but only the first, now known as Kitāb al-ādāb al-kabīr, can be accepted as his . The first of its four parts is a very brief rhetorical retrospect on the excellence of the ancients’ legacy, clearly Sasanian, of spiritual and temporal knowledge. The second is a miniature mirror for princes. The addressee, seemingly the caliph's son, is apostrophized as one in pursuit of the rule of seemly conduct (adab). He is to give strict priority to the mastery of fundamentals, examples of which are given along with illustrations of the ways in which they can be applied. The author then turns to pitfalls before a prince (e.g., the love of flattery and the fault of allowing others to detect it). More positively, he urges the prince to cultivate men of religion and moral perfection as potential aides and intimates, to take advice, even if unpalatable, from those best qualified to give it, to keep abreast of his officials’ conduct, to be sparing with his favors, and so on. Having defined, very much in a Sasanian vein, the bases of kingship, he discusses particular circumstances calling for caution and prudence. After exhortation to seemly conduct and sundry observations on statecraft he ends by stressing the pivotal role in government of power and a seemly public image. The Ādāb's third part, longer than the second, is a pragmatic guide to survival for a ruler's intimates and highly, but precariously, placed officers of state. It offers advice in a high moral vein, but it rests on no philosophical, ethico-religious, or spiritual basis: it rests on familiarity with age-old vagaries of oriental despots and their entourages. The fourth and longest part of the Ādāb treats of a man's relations with colleagues in what we may take to be the secretarial fraternity. The main theme is friendship and the avoidance of enmity. For Ibn al-Muqaffa', the ideal is a permanent relationship, sustained by fidelity, loyalty, and devotion, and proof against all corrosive forces. As always, his treatment of the subject is didactic and heavily dependent on aphorisms. He remains pragmatic: A friendship should be formed, not with an inferior, but with a superior, for to make friends of inferiors bespeaks envy, which is reprehensible. To shed a friend is a threat to honor—unlike a divorce. To women and their allure he makes certain disparaging references, but they are only incidental to his main interest,promoting companionship and amity in the circles that concern him. One can detect in the Ādāb as a whole certain ideas known to Sasanian Persia from pre-Islamic translations of Greek works . The Ādāb is cast in the parallelistic mode of expression born of the early Khotba and expanded and elaborated in Omayyad hortatory compositions, unembroidered with contrived rhyming of the sort found in later Abbasid prose literature. To point contrasts and enforce parallels, full use is made of devices well known to the ancient schools of rhetoric. The Risala fi-l-Sahaba is a short but remarkably percipient administrative text. In less than 5,000 words, he discusses specific problems facing the new Abbasid regime. The unnamed addressee is identifiable as al-Mansur, who may never have seen it. There is no logical arrangement. After an opening eulogy, purposefully complimentary but devoid of extravagant panegyric, he discusses the army, praising the Khorasanis in Iraq but suggesting that, as an ethnically mixed body exposed to heterodox thinking, they should be taught only the tenets of a clear, concise religious code issued by the caliph. Concern for the army's standing, morale, and future loyalty leads him to suggest reforms, including the removal of fiscal duties from the military, officer recruitment from the ranks based on merit, religious education, inculcation of integrity and loyalty, regular pay linked to inflation, and maintenance of an efficient intelligence service throughout Khorasan and peripheral provinces, regardless of cost. He calls for vigilance and good intelligence in Iraq to counter discontent in Basra and Kufa and pleads for deserving Iraqis to be afforded scope for the exercise of their talents in government service. In view of wide divergences in legal theory and practice, born of local precedents or flawed personal reasoning, he suggests to the caliph a scrutiny and resolution of all conflicts of law by his own command and the imposition of unity by a comprehensive enactment. He recommends cautious clemency for the conquered Syrians, the recruitment from among them of a hand-picked caliphal elite, the lifting of ruinous economic sanctions, and fair distribution of foodstuffs in the Syrian military districts. At long last, he comes to the caliph's entourage, which, though introduced in glowing terms, can be perceived as far from ideal. In the past, ministers and secretaries—the approach is tactful—brought the entourage into disrepute: men unworthy of access to the caliph became members to the exclusion of, for instance, scions of the great families of early Islam. The caliph should now remedy the situation by taking account of claims to precedence and singling out for preferment men with special talents and distinguished service records, as well as men of religion and virtue and incorruptible and uncorrupting men of noble lineage. Also, the caliph's kin and princes of his house should be considered. In a section on land-tax (Kharaj) the author focuses on the arbitrary exploitation of cultivators and recommends taxation governed by known rules and registers. After a few lines on Arabia he closes with a proposal for mass education aimed at achieving uniformity of orthodox belief through a body of paid professional instructors. This would make for stability, and trouble-makers would not go unobserved. The Resāla ends with an expression of pious hopes and prayers for the caliph and his people. Stylistically, the work markedly differs from the Ādāb in certain important respects, the reason for which may be the subject-matter. Of the various works attributed, rightly or wrongly, to Ibn al-Muqaffa', there are two of which we have only fragments quoted in hostile sources. One, posing a problem of authenticity, may be described as a Manichaean apologia. The other is the Moarazat al-Quran, which sees not as anti-Islamic, but rather as an exercise designed to show that in the author's time something stylistically comparable to the Quran could be composed. Other compositions and occasional pieces attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffa' are the Yatima tania a short, sententious epistle on good and bad rulers and subjects ; may be authentic, though the long resāla entitled Yatimat al-soltan and the collection of aphorisms labeled Hekam certainly are not. A doxology is almost certainly spurious, though a series of passages and sentences that follow it may have come from the lost Yatima fi’l-rasael. Legacy and commemoration The Bosnian poet Dzevad Karahasan wrote a play about al-Muqaffa. The world premiere was performed in 1994 during the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina by the Bosnian actors Zijah Sokolović and Selma Alispahić from the National Theatre of Sarajevo under the direction of Herbert Gantschacher in a production of the Austrian theatre ARBOS - Company for Music and Theatre in ViennaDževad Karahasan \\"Al-Mukaffa\\" ARBOS-Wieser-Edition, Klagenfurt-Salzburg 1994, .

In this period, Egypt was ruled by the Isma'ili Fatimid Caliphate, which had taken Egypt from the Abbasid Caliphate in 969. Fatimid rule slowly but surely changed Coptic Christian culture, especially in the realm of language.

Sternberg (born December 8, 1949) is an American psychologist and psychometrician. He is Professor of Human Development at Cornell University. Prior to joining Cornell, Sternberg was president of the University of Wyoming for 5 months. He has been Provost and Professor at Oklahoma State University, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University, IBM Professor of Psychology and Education at Yale University. He is a member of the editorial boards of numerous journals, including American Psychologist. He was the past President for the American Psychological Association. Sternberg has a BA from Yale University and a PhD from Stanford University, under advisor Gordon Bower. He holds thirteen honorary doctorates from two North American, one South American, one Asian, and nine European universities, and additionally holds an honorary professorship at the University of Heidelberg, in Germany. He is a Distinguished Associate of the Psychometrics Centre at the University of Cambridge. Among his major contributions to psychology are the triarchic theory of intelligence and several influential theories related to creativity, wisdom, thinking styles, love, and hate. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Sternberg as the 60th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Sternberg has acquired over $20 million in grants and contracts for his research and has conducted research on five continents. The central focus of his research is on intelligence, creativity, and wisdom. He has also studied close relationships, love, and hatred. He has authored or co-authored over 1,500 publications, including articles, book chapters, and books. His work has been critiqued due to excessive self- citation and self-plagiarism. In 2018 he resigned as the editor of Perspectives on Psychological Science in response to these claims. Robert Sternberg is married to Karin Sternberg, a German psychologist, with whom he has a set of triplets, consisting of a boy and two girls.\\"Next university president Sternberg and family prepare to settle in Wyoming.\\" . Sternberg and his first wife had a son and a daughter.  Early life  Sternberg was born on December 8, 1949, to a Jewish family, in New Jersey. Sternberg suffered from test anxiety as a child. As a result, he became an inadequate test taker. This upset him and he reasoned that a test was not an adequate measurement of his true knowledge and academic abilities. When he later retook a test in a room that consisted of younger students, he felt more comfortable and his scores increased dramatically. Sternberg later constructed the Test of Mental Ability (STOMA), his first intelligence test. This problem of test taking is what sparked Sternberg's interest in psychology.  Academic career  Sternberg was an undergraduate student at Yale University. Neither of Sternberg's parents finished high school, and he was only able to attend Yale by achieving a National Merit Scholarship and receiving financial aid. He did so poorly in his introductory psychology class that his professor insisted that he pursue another major. Determined to succeed, Sternberg earned a BA summa cum laude, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, gaining honors and exceptional distinction in psychology. Sternberg continued his academic career at Stanford University, where he earned his PhD, in 1975. Sternberg returned to Yale as an assistant professor of Psychology in 1975, and would work at Yale for three decades, eventually becoming the IBM Professor of Psychology and Education, as well as the founder and director of the Center for the Psychology of Abilities, Competencies and Expertise. He left Yale in 2005 to assume the position of Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University, where he quickly began his job search for a promotion to a Provost position. After multiple unsuccessful high-profile attempts to gain other academic leadership positions within a few years of arriving at Tufts, including at the University of Colorado and the University of Iowa, Sternberg was offered a position at Oklahoma State University in 2010, where he remained as provost for three years. In early 2013, Sternberg was named the new president of the University of Wyoming. After resigning from the University of Wyoming in late 2013, Sternberg joined the faculty of Cornell University.  University of Wyoming presidency  Sternberg took office in July 2013 as the University of Wyoming’s 24th president. His major aim was to push the “development of ethical leadership in students, faculty and staff\\".\\"UW Has a New President\\"> Therefore, Sternberg wanted to change the University of Wyoming’s test-based selection process of applicants towards an ethics-based admission process: “The set of analytical skills evaluated in the ACT [American College Testing] is only a small sliver of what you need to be an ethical leader.” After arriving at the University of Wyoming, President Sternberg's term was marked by tumult in the faculty. Three weeks after taking in office as Wyoming’s new president, the provost and vice president for academic affairs was asked to resign and stepped down. In the next four months, three associate provosts and four deans were asked to resign or resigned voluntarily—many explicitly citing disagreements with President Sternberg's approach. In the Chronicle of Higher Education, November 15, 2013 (\\"President of U of Wyoming Abruptly Resigns\\" by Lindsay Ellis), Sternberg's tenure was described as \\"a period that saw rapid turnover among senior administrators and unsettled the campus.\\" The last dean who stepped down, the Dean of the College of Law, Stephen Easton, accused Sternberg at a university meeting of unethical treatment of staff, professors and schools. “You have not treated this law school ethically.” Sternberg refused to discuss the case at the meeting. The Casper Star Tribune portrayed the situation at the university as “chaos in the college”.\\"Chaos At The Law School Leads To Ouster Of University President.\\" Additionally, other provosts blamed a lack of respect for and interest in human capital. According to Peter Shive, a professor emeritus, Sternberg asked everyone to wear the school colors, brown and gold, on Fridays. Shive said the farther away from the administrative building he went, the fewer people were wearing brown and gold. Ray Hunkins, a UW Law College graduate, former counsel to the UW trustees, a member of the board of directors of the UW Foundation, and the Republican nominee for governor of Wyoming in 2006, questioned Sternberg's policies which led to the dismissal or resignation of the administrators. \\"I think there's chaos in the university,\\" Hunkins said. On November 14, 2013, 137 days after Sternberg took the helm of UW, it was announced at a press conference following a trustees meeting in William Robertson Coe Library that Sternberg had tendered his resignation to the board. In a public statement read by trustee President David Bostrom, Sternberg said that despite his care for the university, \\"It may not be the best fit for me as president.\\" Laughter arose immediately upon the reading of Sternberg's statement. In accordance to university regulations, vice president for academic affairs Dr. Dick McGinity took the office as interim president. His resignation was neither asked for, nor forced by the Board of Trustees.\\"Dr. Sternberg Announces Resignation; University Accepts With Understanding.\\" UW. University of Wyoming, 14 Nov. 2013. Web. 15 Nov. 2013. . According to the Wyoming News, Sternberg’s four-month presidency produced more than $1.25 million in administration-related costs equivalent to the costs of 31 faculty staff positions for one year. This includes: $377,000 for Sternberg’s severance pay, including $325,000 that he will be paid 2014; $37,500 in deferred compensation Sternberg is due by December 31; about $89,000 for the next presidential search; $330,000 for search firms to find replacements for administrators and deans who resigned; $265,000 for renovations to the house and garage that Sternberg was allowed to continue to rent at a price of $1,100 a month until May 31.  Honorary degrees  Sternberg holds thirteen honorary doctorates, including some from universities outside the United States. The list of foreign universities that awarded the degrees includes Complutense University of Madrid (Spain), University of Durham (UK), University of Leuven (Belgium), Tilburg University (the Netherlands), University of Cyprus, University of Paris V (France), and St. Petersburg State University (Russia).  Publication ethics  Sternberg began serving as editor of the prestigious Perspectives on Psychological Science in 2015. As editor he published eight commentaries in his own journal between 2016 and 2018 with apparently little or no external peer review. In response to one of these pieces, a letter of concern was drafted, which over 100 psychologists endorsed. In addition to the concerns about the lack of peer review, the letter of concern also mentioned that these articles feature extreme levels of self-citation, ranging from 42% to 65%. In response to the letter and from pressure on social media, Sternberg resigned in late April 2018 from his position of editor of Perspectives on Psychological Science, over a year and a half before his term was scheduled to end. Several of Sternberg's published articles contain \\"self-plagiarism\\" in what appears, based on a small sample, to be a significant portion of his publications. The extent of this is still unknown. A report in Inside Higher Ed reports that he cited himself as much as up to 65% of the time  Awards and recognition  Sternberg’s awards include the Cattell Award from the American Psychological Society, Sir Francis Galton Award from the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics, the Arthur W. Staats Award from the American Psychological Foundation and the Society for General Psychology, the E. L. Thorndike Award for Career Achievement in Educational Psychology Award from the Society for Educational Psychology of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Grawemeyer Award for Psychology in 2018. In the APA Monitor on Psychology, Sternberg has been rated as one of the top 100 psychologists of the twentieth century. The ISI has rated Sternberg as one of the most highly cited authors in psychology and psychiatry (top .5 percent). Sternberg is a fellow of the National Academy of Education, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and other organizations. He is past-president of the American Psychological Association and the Eastern Psychological Association, and currently is President of the Federation of Associations in the Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  Research interests  Sternberg's main research include the following interests: *Higher mental functions, including intelligence and creativity and wisdom *Styles of thinking *Cognitive modifiability *Leadership *Love and hate Sternberg has proposed a triarchic theory of intelligence and a triangular theory of love. He is the creator (with Todd LubartSternberg, R. J., & Lubart, T. I. (1995). Defying the crowd: Cultivating creativity in a culture of conformity. New York City: Free Press.) of the investment theory of creativity, which states that creative people buy low and sell high in the world of ideas, and a propulsion theory of creative contributions, which states that creativity is a form of leadership. He spearheaded an experimental admissions process at Tufts to quantify and test the creativity, practical skills, and wisdom-based skills of an applicant.Jaschik, Scott (2006). A \\"Rainbow\\" Approach to Admissions. Inside Higher Ed, July 6, 2006. He used similar techniques when he was provost at Oklahoma State. Sternberg has criticized IQ tests, saying they are \\"convenient partial operationalizations of the construct of intelligence, and nothing more. They do not provide the kind of measurement of intelligence that tape measures provide of height.\\"The Theory of Successful Intelligence Interamerican Journal of Psychology - 2005, Vol. 39, Num. 2 pp. 189-20 In 1995, he was on an American Psychological Association task force writing a consensus statement on the state of intelligence research in response to the claims being advanced amid the Bell Curve controversy, titled \\"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns.\\"  Triarchic theory of intelligence  Many descriptions of intelligence focus on mental abilities such as vocabulary, comprehension, memory and problem-solving that can be measured through intelligence tests. This reflects the tendency of psychologists to develop their understanding of intelligence by observing behavior believed to be associated with intelligence. Sternberg believes that this focus on specific types of measurable mental abilities is too narrow. He believes that studying intelligence in this way leads to an understanding of only one part of intelligence and that this part is only seen in people who are \\"school smart\\" or \\"book smart\\". There are, for example, many individuals who score poorly on intelligence tests, but are creative or are \\"street smart\\" and therefore have a very good ability to adapt and shape their environment. According to Sternberg (2003), giftedness should be examined in a broader way incorporating other parts of intelligence. = The triarchic model = Sternberg (2003) categorizes intelligence into three parts, which are central in his theory: *Analytical intelligence, the ability to complete academic, problem-solving tasks, such as those used in traditional intelligence tests. These types of tasks usually present well-defined problems that have only a single correct answer. *Creative or synthetic intelligence, the ability to successfully deal with new and unusual situations by drawing on existing knowledge and skills. Individuals high in creative intelligence may give 'wrong' answers because they see things from a different perspective. *Practical intelligence, the ability to adapt to everyday life by drawing on existing knowledge and skills. Practical intelligence enables an individual to understand what needs to be done in a specific setting and then do it. Sternberg (2003) discusses experience and its role in intelligence. Creative or synthetic intelligence helps individuals to transfer information from one problem to another. Sternberg calls the application of ideas from one problem to a new type of problem relative novelty. In contrast to the skills of relative novelty there is relative familiarity which enables an individual to become so familiar with a process that it becomes automatized. This can free up brain resources for coping with new ideas. Context, or how one adapts, selects and shapes their environment is another area that is not represented by traditional measures of giftedness. Practically intelligent people are good at picking up tacit information and utilizing that information. They tend to shape their environment around them. (Sternberg, 2003) Sternberg (2003) developed a testing instrument to identify people who are gifted in ways that other tests don't identify. The Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test measures not only traditional intelligence abilities but analytic, synthetic, automatization and practical abilities as well. There are four ways in which this test is different from conventional intelligence tests. *This test is broader, measuring synthetic and practical skills in addition to analytic skills. The test provides scores on analytic, synthetic, automatization, and practical abilities, as well as verbal, quantitative, and figural processing abilities. *The test measures the ability to understand unknown words in context rather than vocabulary skills which are dependent on an individual's background. *The automatization subtest is the only part of the test that measures mental speed. *The test is based on a theory of intelligence.Sternberg, R. J. (2003). Giftedness According to the Theory of Successful Intelligence. In N. Colangelo & G. Davis (Eds.), Handbook of Gifted Education (88-99). Boston MA: Allyn and Bacon. = Practical application = Sternberg added experimental criteria to the application process for undergraduates to Tufts University, where he was Dean of Arts and Sciences, to test \\"creativity and other non-academic factors.\\" Calling it the \\"first major university to try such a departure from the norm,\\" Inside Higher Ed noted that Tufts continues to consider the SAT and other traditional criteria.McAnerny, Kelly (2005). From Sternberg, a new take on what makes kids Tufts-worthy. Tufts Daily, November 15, 2005.  Theory in cognitive styles  Sternberg proposed a theory of cognitive styles in 1988. Sternberg's basic idea is that the forms of government we have in the world are external reflections of the way different people view and act in the world, that is, different ways of organizing and thinking. Cognitive styles should not be confused with abilities, they are the way we prefer to use these abilities. Indeed, a good fit between a person's preferred cognitive profile and his abilities can create a powerful synergy that outweighs the sum of its parts. The main three branches of government are the executive branch, legislative branch and judicial branch. People also need to perform these functions in their own thinking and working. Legislative people like to build new structures, creating their own rules along the way. Executive people are rule followers, they like to be given a predetermined structure in which to work. Judicial people like to evaluate rules and procedures, to analyze a given structure. The four forms of mental self-government are hierarchical, monarchic, oligarchic, and anarchic. The hierarchic style holds multiple goals simultaneously and prioritizes them. The oligarchic style is similar but differs in involving difficulty prioritizing. The monarchic style, in comparison, focuses on a single activity until completion. The anarchic style resists conformity to \\"systems, rules, or particular approaches to problems.\\" The two levels of mental self-government are local and global. The local style focuses on more specific and concrete problems, in extreme case they \\"can't see the forest for the trees\\". The global style, in comparison, focuses on more abstract and global problems, in extreme cases they \\"can't see the trees for the forest\\". The two scopes of mental self-government are internal and external. The internal style focuses inwards and prefers to work independently. The external style focuses outwards and prefers to work in collaboration. The two leanings of mental self-government are the liberal and conservative. These styles have nothing to do with politics. The liberal individual likes change, to go beyond existing rules and procedures. The conservative individual dislikes change and ambiguity, he will be happiest in a familiar and predictable environment. We all have different profiles of thinking styles which can change over situations and time of life. Moreover, a person can, and often does, have a secondary preferred thinking style.

It was one of the instruments of the Passion, employed by Jesus' captors both to cause him pain and to mock his claim of authority. It is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew (\\"And when they had plaited a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee and mocked him, saying Hail, King of the Jews!\\" ), Mark () and John (, ), and is often alluded to by the early Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen and others. Relic of the crown of thorns, received by French King Louis IX from emperor Baldwin II. It was preserved at Notre-Dame de Paris until 15 April 2019, when it was rescued from a fire at the cathedral. Since at least around the year 400, a relic believed by many to be the crown of thorns has been venerated. At the time of the Crusades, Emperor Baldwin II of Jerusalem yielded the relic to French King Louis IX. Kept in the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris until 15 April 2019, when a fire touched the cathedral, the relic has since been kept in the Louvre Museum. As a relic =Jerusalem= The three Biblical gospels that mention the crown of thorns do not say what happened to it after the crucifixion. The oldest known mention of the crown already being adored as a relic was made by St. Paulinus of Nola, writing after 409, who refers to the crown as a relic that was adored by the faithful (Epistle Macarius in Migne, Patrologia Latina, LXI, 407). Cassiodorus (c. 570) speaks of the crown of thorns among other relics which were “the glory” of the city of Jerusalem. \\"There\\", he says, \\"we may behold the thorny crown, which was only set upon the head of Our Redeemer in order that all the thorns of the world might be gathered together and broken\\" (Migne, LXX, 621). When Gregory of Tours in De gloria martyriPublished in Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores Merovingenses\\", I, 492. avers that the thorns in the crown still looked green, a freshness which was miraculously renewed each day, he does not much strengthen the historical authenticity of a relic he had not seen, but the Breviary or Short Description of Jerusalem) (a short text dated to about 530 AD), and the itinerary of Antoninus of Piacenza (6th century) clearly state that the crown of thorns was then shown in the \\"Basilica of Mount Zion,\\" although there is uncertainty about the actual site to which the authors refer. From these fragments of evidence and others of later date (the \\"Pilgrimage\\" of the monk Bernard shows that the relic was still at Mount Zion in 870), it is shown that a purported crown of thorns was venerated at Jerusalem in the first centuries of the common era. =Constantinople= Some time afterwards, the crown was purportedly moved to Constantinople, then capital of the empire. Historian Francois de Mély supposed that the whole crown was transferred from Jerusalem to Constantinople not much before 1063. In any case, Emperor Justinian is stated to have given a thorn to St. Germain, Bishop of Paris, which was long preserved at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, while the Empress Irene, in 798 or 802, sent Charlemagne several thorns which were deposited by him at Aachen. Eight of these are said to have been there at the consecration of the basilica of Aachen; the subsequent history of several of them can be traced without difficulty: four were given to Saint-Corneille of Compiègne in 877 by Charles the Bald; Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, sent one to the Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan in 927, on the occasion of certain marriage negotiations, and it eventually found its way to Malmesbury Abbey; another was presented to a Spanish princess about 1160; and again another was taken to Andechs Abbey in Germany in the year 1200. =France= In 1238, Baldwin II, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire, offered the crown of thorns to Louis IX, King of France. It was then in the hands of the Venetians as security for a great loan of 13,134 gold pieces, yet it was redeemed and conveyed to Paris where Louis IX built the Sainte-Chapelle, completed in 1248, to receive it. The relic stayed there until the French Revolution, when, after finding a home for a while in the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Concordat of 1801 restored it to the Church, and it was deposited in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. The relic that the Church received is a twisted circlet of rushes of Juncus balticus,Cherry, 22 a plant native to maritime areas of northern Britain, the Baltic region, and Scandinavia; the thorns preserved in various other reliquaries are of Ziziphus spina-christi, a plant native to Africa and Southern and Western Asia,http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Zizyphus_spina- christi.PDF and had allegedly been removed from the Crown and kept in separate reliquaries since soon after they arrived in France. New reliquaries were provided for the relic, one commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, another, in jeweled rock crystal and more suitably Gothic, was made to the designs of Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. In 2001, when the surviving treasures from the Sainte- Chapelle were exhibited at the Louvre, the chaplet was solemnly presented every Friday at Notre-Dame. Pope John Paul II translated it personally to Sainte-Chapelle during World Youth Day. The relic can be seen only on the first Friday of every month, when it is exhibited for a special veneration Mass, as well as each Friday of Lent. See also Feast of the Crown of Thorns. Members of the Paris Fire Brigade saved the relic during the Notre-Dame de Paris fire of April 15, 2019. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: > Authorities are agreed that a sort of helmet of thorns must have been > plaited by the Roman soldiers, this band of rushes being employed to hold > the thorns together. It seems likely according to M. De Mély, that already > at the time when the circlet was brought to Paris the sixty or seventy > thorns, which seem to have been afterwards distributed by St. Louis and his > successors, had been separated from the band of rushes and were kept in a > different reliquary.

Third-class relics Nuremberg 16th-century silver medal of Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns by Valentin Maler. Not all of the reputed holy thorns are first-class relics, that is, relics of the original crown. M. de Mély was able to enumerate more than 700. The statement in one medieval obituary that Peter de Averio gave to the cathedral of Angers, \\"unam de spinis quae fuit apposita coronae spinae nostri Redemptoris (\\"one of the spines which were attached to the thorny crown of our Redeemer\\") (de Mély, p. 362) indicates that many of the thorns were relics of the third class—objects touched to a relic of the first class, in this case some part of the crown itself. (In Roman Catholic tradition, a relic of the first class is a part of the body of a saint or, in this case, any of the objects used in the Crucifixion that carried the blood of Christ; a relic of the second class is anything known to have been touched or used by a saint; a relic of the third class is a devotional object touched to a first-class relic and, usually, formally blessed as a sacramental.) Again, even in comparatively modern times, it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, as first- class relics were often divided and any number of authentic third-class relics may exist. Purported remnants Christ Carrying the Cross by Andrea Solario, 1513, portrays the crown of thorns The Crowning with Thorns, 1603 During a crusade to the Holy Land, French King Louis IX bought what was venerated as Jesus’ Crown of Thorns. It is kept in Paris to this day, in the Notre-Dame Cathedral. Individual thorns were given by the French monarch to other European royals: the Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum, for example, containing a single thorn, was made in the 1390s for the French prince Jean, duc de Berry, who is documented as receiving more than one thorn from Charles V and VI, his brother and nephew.Cherry, 22–23 The Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) reported two \\"holy thorns\\" were venerated, the one at St. Michael's church in Ghent, the other at Stonyhurst College, both professing to be the thorn given by Mary Queen of Scots to Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland. The \\"Gazetteer of Relics and Miraculous Images\\" lists the following, following Cruz 1984: *Belgium: Parochial Church of Wevelgem: a portion of the crown of thorns (since 1561) *Belgium: Ghent, St. Michael's Church: A thorn from the crown of thorns *Czech Republic: Prague, St. Vitus Cathedral: A thorn of the crown of thorns, in the cross at the top of Crown of Saint Wenceslas, part of the Bohemian Crown Jewels *France: Notre-Dame de Paris: The crown of thorns brought from the Holy Land by Louis IX in the 12th century, from which individual thorns have been given by the French monarchs to other European royals; it is displayed the first Friday of each month and all Fridays in Lent (including Good Friday) *France: Sainte-Chapelle: A portion of the crown of thorns, brought to the site by Louis IX. *Germany: Cathedral of Trier: A thorn from the crown of thorns *Germany: Cologne, Kolumba: A thorn from the crown of thorns, given by Louis IX to the Dominicans of Liège, and a second thorn from the treasure of St. Kolumba, Cologne *Germany: Elchingen: Church of the former Benedictine Abbey Kloster Elchingen: a thorn brought to the church in 1650/51 *Italy: Rome, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme: Two thorns from the crown of thorns. *Italy: Rome, Santa Prassede: A small portion of the crown of thorns *Italy: Pisa, Chiesa di Santa Chiara: A branch with thorns from the crown of thorns *Italy: Naples, Santa Maria Incoronata: A fragment of the crown of thorns *Italy: Ariano Irpino, Cathedral: Two Thorns from the crown of thorns *Spain: Oviedo, Cathedral: Five thorns (formerly eight) from the crown of thorns *Spain: Barcelona, Cathedral: A thorn from the crown of thorns *Spain: Seville, Iglesia de la Anunciación (Hermandad del Valle): A thorn from the crown of thorns *United Kingdom: British Museum: Holy Thorn Reliquary (see above), Salting Reliquary, each with a thorn *United Kingdom: Stanbrook Abbey, Worcester: A thorn from the crown of thorns *United Kingdom: Stonyhurst College, Lancashire: A thorn from the crown of thorns *United States: St. Anthony's Chapel, Pittsburgh: A thorn from the crown of thorns *Ukraine: Odessa, St. Prophet Elijah Monastery: A fragment of a thorn of the crown of thorns Iconography The appearance of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject Ecce Homo, arises after the time of St. Louis and the building of the Sainte- Chapelle. The Catholic Encyclopedia reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered that it seemed to be quite as probable that this was only meant for a laurel wreath. The image of the crown of thorns is often used symbolically to contrast with earthly monarchical crowns. In the symbolism of King Charles the Martyr, the executed English King Charles I is depicted putting aside his earthly crown to take up the crown of thorns, as in William Marshall's print Eikon Basilike. This contrast appears elsewhere in art, for example in Frank Dicksee's painting The Two Crowns. Carnations symbolize the passion as they represent the crown of thorns.

He described numerous parts of the crown of thorns known to him, located in different cities. Based on a large number of parts of the crown of thorns, Calvin wrote: > In regard to the Crown of thorns, it would seem that its twigs had been > planted that they might grow again.

The legend, along with those of other mythological figures of the Guaraní, is an important part of the culture of a region stretching from northeast Argentina northward through the whole of Paraguay and into southern BrazilCOLMAN, Narciso R. (Rosicrán): Ñande Ypy Kuéra (\\"Nuestros antepasados\\"), 1929. Online version  Name and appearance  Pombero's original name in the Guaraní language is Karai Pyhare, literally \\"The man of the Night\\"Esas Cosas http://www.esascosas.com/pombero/ Retrieved 10.21 on 17/3/19., he is said to be a primarily nocturnal creature. In some parts of Argentina he is known primarily by the Spanish translation of his name, Señor de la noche. Although accounts of the Pombero's appearance and nature vary slightly from one community to the next, he is usually described as being short and ugly, with very short arms and hairy hands and feet. His hairy feet are said to give him the ability to sneak up on people silently and the touch of his hairy hands to bring a cold shiver. The Pombero generally dwells in rural areas, living in the forest, although he will sometimes choose to inhabit an abandoned house. As a forest dweller, the Pombero is said to be able to imitate the sounds of various forest creatures. Most specifically it is believed that the Pombero can imitate birdsong, especially those of a nocturnal variety, and as such is viewed as something of a protector of the birds. Many witnesses of the Pombero say that before he appears he whistles. Most are so frightened of gathering his wrath that they never whistle again. One common aspect of the myth among various Guaraní based societies is that the Pombero protects the birds from children who hunt them with slingshots. The Pombero is generally viewed as a harmless troublemaker. Owing to his preferred habitat of rural forests, the targets of his mischief tend to be rural farmers. Among his favourite activities are setting loose cattle, stealing eggs, chicken and honey, frightening horses and causing them to throw their riders off, as well as scattering corn, rice, or other provisions. The Pombero is also often accused of impregnating single women either by a mere touch of his hand or by tricking them into having sex with him, and it is said that babies who are born ugly and hairy are likely the result of a visit from the Pombero. Another character from Guaraní mythology, Kurupi, is blamed in a similar manner for unexpected or unexplained pregnancies. The Pombero is difficult, if not impossible, to detect due to his silent movements as well as other supernatural abilities, such as being able to turn invisible, squeeze through impossibly narrow spaces, or other such feats. It is said that one can keep the Pombero from engaging in such mischief by leaving gifts out for him, most specifically cigars and rum, though honey is also an acceptable offering. Thus appeased, the Pombero will abstain from wreaking havoc upon one's home and possessions. In some areas it is believed that repeated giving of these gifts can cause the Pombero to become friendly, to the point where he will guard over one's home, animals, and possessions, and sometimes even leave gifts in return. The Pombero tends to be the most widespread and pervasive of mythological figures among Guaraní speaking cultures today. In rural Paraguay, for example, it is not uncommon for adults to fervently believe in this myth, to the extent that they leave gifts of rum and cigars for the Pombero nightly.

It is the story of a young woman whose sane, structured, consumer-oriented world starts to slip out of focus. Following her engagement, Marian feels her body and her self are becoming separated. As Marian begins endowing food with human qualities that cause her to identify with it, she finds herself unable to eat, repelled by metaphorical cannibalism. In a foreword written in 1979 for the Virago edition of the novel, Atwood described it as a protofeminist rather than feminist work. Atwood explores gender stereotypes through characters who strictly adhere to them (such as Peter or Lucy) and those who defy their constraints (such as Ainsley or Duncan). The narrative point of view shifts from first to third person, accentuating Marian's slow detachment from reality. At the conclusion, first person narration returns, consistent with the character's willingness to take control of her life again. Food and clothing are major symbols used by the author to explore themes and grant the reader insight on each of the characters' personalities, moods and motivations. Setting is used to identify differences between the characters; for example, Duncan is encountered in a mundane laundromat, gloomy theatre or sleazy hotel. In comparison, Peter inhabits genteel bars and a sparkling new apartment. However these changing environments are also used to explore different angles of existence, contrasting a freer, wilder glimpse of life, with a civilised, gilded cage. This highlights the difficulties presented to women in the era, where freedom was synonymous with uncertainty but marriage presented problems of its own. This novel's publication coincided with the rise of the women's movement in North America, but is described by Atwood as \\"protofeminist\\" because it was written in 1965 and thus anticipated second wave feminism. Plot summary Marian MacAlpin works in a market research firm, writing survey questions and sampling products. She shares the top-floor apartment of a house in Toronto (never named in the novel) with her roommate Ainsley and dates a dependable and boring boyfriend, Peter. Marian also keeps in touch with Clara, a friend from college, who is now a constantly pregnant housewife. Ainsley announces she wants to have a baby – and intends to do it without getting married. When Marian is horrified, Ainsley replies, \\"The thing that ruins families these days is the husbands.\\" Looking for a man who will have no interest in fatherhood, she sets her sights on Marian's \\"womanizer\\" friend Len, who is infamous for his relationships with young, naive girls. At work, Marian is assigned the task of gathering responses for a survey about a new brand of beer. While walking from house to house asking people their opinions, she meets Duncan, a graduate student in English who intrigues her with his atypical and eccentric answers. Marian later has a dinner date with Peter and Len, during which Ainsley shows up dressed as a virginal schoolgirl – the first stage of her plan to trick Len into impregnating her. Marian finds herself disassociating from her body as Peter recounts a gory rabbit hunt to Len: > \\"After a while I noticed that a large drop of something wet had materialized > on the table. I poked it with my finger and smudged it around a little > before I realized with horror that it was a tear.\\" Marian runs from the restaurant and is chased down by Peter in his car. Unaware of Ainsley's plan to get pregnant by Len, Peter chides, \\"Ainsley behaved herself properly, why couldn't you?\\" At the end of the night, Peter proposes to her. When asked to choose a date for the wedding, Marian slips into unexpected passivity: > \\"'I’d rather have you decide that. I’d rather leave the big decisions up to > you.' I was astonished at myself. I’d never said anything remotely like that > to him before. The funny thing was that I really meant it.\\" Marian and Duncan have a surprise meeting in a laundromat, engage in awkward conversation, and kiss. Shortly afterwards, Marian's problems with food begin when she finds herself empathizing with a steak that Peter is eating, imagining it \\"knocked on the head as it stood in a queue like someone waiting for a streetcar.\\" After this, she is unable to eat meat – anything with \\"bone or tendon or fiber\\". Ainsley's plot to seduce Len succeeds. When Len later learns that Ainsley is pregnant, he talks to Marian, who confesses that pregnancy was Ainsley's plan all along. Len reveals his childhood fear of eggs, and from that point Marian can no longer face her soft-boiled egg in the morning. Soon thereafter, she is unable to eat vegetables or cake. Peter decides to throw a party, to which Marian invites \\"the office virgins\\" from her work, Duncan, and Duncan's roommates. Peter suggests that Marian buy herself a new dress for his party – something less \\"mousy\\" than her normal wardrobe. Marian submits to his wishes and buys a daring red dress. Before the party, Ainsley does Marian's makeup, including false eyelashes and a big lipsticked smile. When Duncan arrives, he says, \\"You didn't tell me it was a masquerade. Who the hell are you supposed to be?\\" He leaves and Marian follows. They end up going to a sleazy hotel, where they have unsatisfying sex. The next morning, they go out to breakfast and Marian finds that she cannot eat anything. After Duncan leaves, Marian realizes that Peter is metaphorically devouring her. To test him, she bakes a pink cake in the shape of a woman and dares him to eat it. \\"This is what you really want\\", she says, offering the cake woman as a substitute to him feeding upon her. Peter leaves disturbed. Once Peter leaves, Marian feels hungry and realizes it's just a cake so she starts eating it. Marian returns to her first person narrative in the closing pages of the book. Duncan shows up at her apartment; Marian offers him the remains of the cake, which he polishes off. \\"'Thank you,' he said, licking his lips. 'It was delicious.'\\" Characters * Marian MacAlpin is the protagonist and the first-person narrator during Parts One and Three of the novel. * Ainsley Tewce is Marian's roommate; she works in an electric toothbrush repair shop. * Peter Wollander, a lawyer, is Marian's boyfriend, and later, fiancé. * Len Slank is a bachelor friend of Marian's from college; he works in television. * Clara Bates is another friend from college; Clara dropped out second year to marry Joe and now has three children * Duncan is a graduate student in English with whom Marian has an affair. * The three office virgins: Lucy, Emmy, and Millie * Mrs. Bogue, head of the research department at Marian's firm * Fischer Smythe and Trevor, Duncan's roommates, also graduate students in English. * The Lady Down Below is Marian and Ainsley's landlady, allegorically representing traditional female ideals. Themes ; Loss of identity: Marian's refusal to eat can be viewed as her resistance to being coerced into a more feminine role. In a description of Peter's apartment, Marian describes the \\"clutter of raw materials\\" that had, through \\"digestion and assimilation\\", become the walls of the lobby. She sees that consumption precedes construction: the body's assimilation of raw materials (food) is analogous to the social body's assimilation and processing of women into socially acceptable feminine subjects. By not eating, Marian refuses to take in the raw materials used to re-construct her into a role of domesticity. This struggle is made explicit when one of Duncan's roommates expounds on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as having a \\"sexual-identity crisis\\", then goes on to describe the structure of both Alice and The Edible Woman: \\"One sexual role after another is presented [to the heroine] but she seems unable to accept any of them.\\" Marian is shaped first by her parents' plans for her future, then by Peter's. Once married, Marian fears Peter's strong personality will obliterate her own fragile identity. This subconscious perception of Peter as predator is manifested by Marian's body as an inability to eat, as a gesture of solidarity with other prey. Following her engagement, the switch to third-person narrative shows that Marian's story is controlled by someone other than Marian herself; following Marian's regaining of identity, Atwood returns to first-person narration. ; Alienation: In the transitions from first person to third person, Atwood demonstrates Marian's growing alienation from her body. At the company Christmas party, Marian looks around at the other women, thinking \\"You were green and then you ripened: became mature. Dresses for the mature figure. In other words, fat.\\" Marian refuses to become likewise, which would transform her into a woman and as such be constrained by a sexist culture. Marian is, therefore, alienated from nature as she places herself outside the process of maturation. Allusions and references to other works =Allusions to Atwood's personal life= From 1963 to 1964, Atwood worked for Canadian Facts, a Toronto-based survey research firm, fact-checking and editing survey questionnaires. Canadian Facts had a similar work environment to the fictional Seymour Surveys where Marian worked. In Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion, Cooke argues that the characters of Peter, Lucy, and Mrs. Sims were drawn from people in Atwood's life – Peter being a fictionalized version of Atwood's boyfriend (also an amateur photographer) and later fiancé. It is also likely that the name of her roommate and friend Ainsley was inspired by Annesley Hall at Victoria University in the University of Toronto, to which Atwood belonged. The all-female residence building, which was built in 1903, was the first university residence building for women in Canada.

The wall in the background is decorated with Qaitbay's blazon.Carboni, Venice, 306. Sultan Abu Al-Nasr Sayf ad-Din Al-Ashraf Qaitbay () (c. 1416/14187 August 1496) was the eighteenth Burji Mamluk Sultan of Egypt from 872-901 A.H. (1468-1496 C.E.). (Other transliterations of his name include Qaytbay and Kait Bey.) He was Circassian by birth, and was purchased by the ninth sultan Barsbay (1422 to 1438 C.E.) before being freed by the eleventh Sultan Jaqmaq (1438 to 1453 C.E.). During his reign, he stabilized the Mamluk state and economy, consolidated the northern boundaries of the Sultanate with the Ottoman Empire, engaged in trade with other contemporaneous polities, and emerged as a great patron of art and architecture. In fact, although Qaitbay fought sixteen military campaigns, he is best remembered for the spectacular building projects that he sponsored, leaving his mark as an architectural patron on Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, Damascus, Aleppo, Alexandria, and every quarter of Cairo. To some historians, he is infamous for building a fortress on the remains of the ancient wonder, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, in 1480, resulting in the final disappearance of the lighthouse, confining it to the history books. Biography =Early life= Qaitbay was born between 1416 and 1418 in Great Circassia of the Caucasus. His skill in archery and horsemanship attracted the attention of a slave merchant who purchased him and brought him to Cairo when he was already over twenty years of age. He was quickly purchased by the reigning sultan Barsbay and became a member of the palace guard. He was freed by Barsbay's successor, Jaqmaq, after learning that Qaitbay was a descendant of Al-Ashraf Musa Abu'l-Fath al-Muzaffar ad-Din, and appointed the third executive secretary; under the reigns of Sayf ad-Din Inal, Khushqadam and Yilbay, he was further promoted through the Mamluk military hierarchy, eventually becoming taqaddimat alf, commander of a thousand Mamluks. Under the Sultan Timurbugha, finally, Qaitbay was appointed atabak, or field marshal of the entire Mamluk army.Petry, Twilight, 24-29. During this period, Qaitbay amassed a considerable personal fortune which would enable him to exercise substantial acts of beneficence as sultan without draining the royal treasury.Petry, Twilight, 33. =Accession= Qait bey plate at Masjid al-Nabawi at Medina. Citadel of Qaitbay in Alexandria. The reign of Timubugha lasted less than two months, as he was dethroned in a palace coup on 30 January 1468.Petry, Twilight, 22. Qaitbay was proposed as a compromise candidate acceptable to the various court factions. Despite some apparent reluctance, he was enthroned on 31 January. Qaitbay insisted that Timurburgha be granted an honorable retirement, instead of the enforced exile usually imposed on dethroned sovereigns. He did, however, exile the leaders of the coup, and created a new ruling council composed of his own followers and more veteran courtiers who had fallen into disgrace under his predecessors.Petry, Twilight, 36-43. Yashbak min Mahdi was appointed dawadar, or executive secretary, and Azbak min Tutkh was named atabak; the two men would remain Qaitbay's closest advisors until the ends of their careers, despite their profound dislike for each other. In general Qaitbay seems to have pursued a policy of appointing rivals to posts of equal authority, thus preventing any single subordinate from acquiring too much power and maintaining the ability to settle all disputes via his own autocratic authority.Petry, Twilight, 43-50. =Early reign= Qaitbay's first major challenge was the insurrection of Shah Suwar, leader of a small Turkmen dynasty, the Dhu'l-Qadrids, in eastern Anatolia. A first expedition against the upstart was soundly defeated, and Suwar threatened to invade Syria. A second Mamluk army was sent in 1469 under the leadership of Azbak, but was likewise defeated. Not until 1471 did a third expedition, this time commanded by Yashbak, succeed in routing Suwar's army. In 1473, Suwar was captured and led back to Cairo, together with his brothers; the prisoners were drawn and quartered and their remains were hung from Bab Zuwayla.Petry, Twilight, 57-72. Qaitbay's reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. Excavations in the late 1800s and early 1900s at over fourteen sites in the vicinity of Borama in modern-day northwestern Somalia unearthed, among other things, coins identified as having been derived from Qaitbay.Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), The Geographical Journal, Volume 87, (Royal Geographical Society: 1936), p.301. Most of these finds are associated with the medieval Sultanate of Adal,Bernard Samuel Myers, ed., Encyclopedia of World Art, Volume 13, (McGraw-Hill: 1959), p.xcii. and were sent to the British Museum in London for preservation shortly after their discovery. =Consolidation of power= Following the defeat of Suwar, Qaitbay set about purging his court of the remaining factions and installing his own purchased Mamluks in all positions of power. He frequently went on excursions, ostentatiously leaving the Citadel with limited guards to display his trust of his subordinates and of the populace. He traveled throughout his reign, visiting Alexandria, Damascus, and Aleppo, among other cities, and personally inspecting his many building projects. In 1472 he performed the Hajj to Mecca. He was struck by the poverty of the citizens of Medina and devoted a substantial portion of his private fortune to the alleviation of their plight. Through such measures Qaitbay gained a reputation for piety, charity, and royal self-confidence.Petry, Twilight, 73-82. =Ottoman-Mamluk war= In 1480 Yashbak led an army against the Aq Qoyunlu dynasty in Northern Mesopotamia, but was soundly defeated while attacking Urfa, taken prisoner, and executed.Petry, Twilight, 82-88. These events foreshadowed a longer military engagement with the far more powerful Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. In 1485 Ottoman armies began to campaign on the Mamluk frontier, and an expedition was dispatched from Cairo to confront them. These Mamluk troops won a surprising victory in 1486 near Adana. A temporary truce ensued, but in 1487 the Ottomans reoccupied Adana, only to be defeated once more by a massive Mamluk army. As the concomitant Turkish expansion in the western Mediterranean represented an increased threat to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon made a temporary alliance with the Mamluks against the Ottomans from 1488 until 1491, shipping wheat and offering a fleet of 50 caravels against the Ottomans. In 1491 a final truce was signed that would last through the remaining reigns of Qaitbay and the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II. Qaitbay's ability to enforce a peace with the greatest military power in the Muslim world further enhanced his prestige at home and abroad.Petry, Twilight, 88-103. =Final years= Qaytbay's mausoleum, Northern Cemetery, Cairo. The end of Qaitbay's reign was marred by increasing unrest among his troops and a decline in his personal health, including a riding accident that left him comatose for days. Many of his most trusted officials died, and were replaced by far less scrupulous upstarts; a long period of palace intrigue ensued. In 1492 the plague returned to Cairo, and was reported to have claimed 200,000 lives. Qaitbay's health became markedly poor in 1494, and his court, now lacking a figure of central authority, was wracked by infighting, factionalism, and purges. He died on 8 August 1496 and was interred in the spectacular mausoleum attached to his mosque in Cairo's Northern Cemetery which he had built during his lifetime. He was succeeded by his son, an-Nasir Muhammad (not to be confused with the famed 14th-century sultan of the same name.)Petry, Twilight, 103-118. Family Al- Ashraf Sayf ad-Din Qaitbay fathered three sons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad, who was born in 1482. His second son, Al-Aziz Muhammad was born in 1484, and his third son As-Salih Muhammad, born in 1487, would later become a muqaddim a commander in the army of Sultan Qanush al- Ghawri. Legacy Fountain of Qayt Bay, Haram esh-Sharif, Jerusalem, (2015) Qaitbay's reign has traditionally been seen as the \\"happy culmination\\" of the Burji Mamluk dynasty.Garcin, \\"Regime,\\" 295. It was a period of unparalleled political stability, military success, and prosperity, and Qaitbay's contemporaries admired him as a defender of traditional Mamluk values. At the same time, he may be criticized for his conservatism, and for his failure to innovate in the face of new challenges.Petry, Twilight, 233-34. Following Qaitbay's death, the Mamluk state descended into a prolonged succession crisis lasting for five years until the accession of Al-Ashraf Qansuh al- Ghawri.Garcin, \\"Regime,\\" 297. = Architectural patronage = Today Qaitbay is perhaps best known for his wide-ranging architectural patronage, which was second only to al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun. At least 230 monuments, either surviving or mentioned in contemporary sources, are associated with his reign. In Egypt, Qaitbay's buildings are found throughout Cairo, as well as in Alexandria and Rosetta; in Syria he sponsored projects in Aleppo and Damascus; in addition, he was responsible for the construction of madrasas and fountains in Jerusalem and Gaza, which still stand — most notably the Fountain (sabil) of Qayt Bay and al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa. On the Arabian peninsula, Qaitbay sponsored the restoration of mosques and the construction of madrasas, fountains and hostels in Mecca and Medina. After a serious fire struck the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina in 1481, the building, including the Tomb of the Prophet, was extensively renewed through Qaitbay's patronage.Meinecke, Mamlukische Architektur, II.396-442. One of Qaytbay's largest building projects in Cairo was his funerary complex in the Northern Cemetery, which included his mausoleum, a mosque/madrasa, a maq'ad (reception hall), and various auxiliary structures and functions attached to it. It is considered a masterpiece of late Mamluk architecture and is featured today on Egypt's 1 pound note. His other contributions in Cairo include a Wikala at Bab al-Nasr, a Wikala-Sabil-Kuttab near al-Azhar Mosque, a Sabil-Kuttab on Saliba street, a madrasa-mosque at Qal'at al-Kabsh, a mosque on Rhoda Island, and a palace that is now incorporated into the Bayt Al-Razzaz palace. Other amirs and patrons also built notable projects under his reign, such as the Mosque of Amir Qijmas al-Ishaqi, which feature the same refined architectural style of his time. In Alexandria he notably built a fortress on the site of the ruined Pharos, now known as the Citadel (or Fort) of Qaitbay.

In October 1769, the Portola expedition encountered the redwoods of southern Santa Cruz County, and camped at the mouth of Waddell Creek, in present-day Big Basin, later that month. Although many in the party had been ill with scurvy, they gorged themselves on berries and quickly recovered. This miraculous recovery, as it seemed at the time, inspired the name given to the valley: 'Cañada de la Salud' or Canyon of Health. By the late 19th century, redwood forests were gaining international appreciation. Early conservationists, including such notables as Andrew P. Hill, Father Robert Kenna, John J. Montgomery, Carrie Stevens Walter and Josephine Clifford McCracken, led the movement to create a park to preserve the redwoods. On May 19, 1900, the Sempervirens Club was formed at the base of Slippery Rock, within the present day park. In 1902, the California Redwood Park was created in Big Basin on , most of it old growth forest. In the following decades, visitation to Big Basin grew steadily as park amenities were developed. The Big Basin Inn offered cabins to rent, a restaurant, general store, barber shop, gas station and photographic studio. There were also a post office, a concrete swimming pool, boating areas, tennis courts and a dance floor. Campsites cost 50 cents a night in 1927 and many families stayed all summer. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps assigned a company to Big Basin. These men built the amphitheater, miles of trails, and many of the buildings still used today. The main administration building, built by the CCC in 1936, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Save the Redwoods League purchased a parcel known as Cascade Creek in 2020 that links Big Basin with Año Nuevo State Park. = 2020 California wildfires = The park was badly affected by the CZU Lightning Complex fires in August 2020, and was evacuated on August 18. According to NASA FIRMS data, the fire impacted the core of the park on August 19. On August 20, it was reported that the park's historic headquarters building had been \\"almost completely destroyed\\" and the entire core and campgrounds of the park had been extensively damaged. A few redwoods had also fallen during the fires, though the majority remained standing. A fire raged in the Big Basin in 1904.  Flora  Rancho Del Oso section of the Park, including Waddell Marsh in the Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, from the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail Although redwoods dominate the landscape, many other plant species are common in Big Basin. One will certainly see coast Douglas-fir, tan oak and Pacific madrone, Pacific wax myrtle trees in the park. Competing for sunshine are also many shrubs such as red huckleberries, western azalea, and many varieties of ferns. Spring and summer bring the wildflowers: redwood sorrel, salal, redwood violets, trillium, star lily and mountain iris. The rains of fall and winter deliver hundreds of kinds of fungi in a startling variety of shapes, sizes and colors. Upon climbing to higher elevations, one will find the forest growing thinner, as redwoods are replaced by more drought-tolerant species. The higher, drier ridges and slopes of Big Basin are typically full of chaparral vegetation: knobcone pines, chinquapin and buckeye create the canopy, with ceanothus, manzanita, chamise, and chaparral pea growing dense and low. Adding a splash of color are wildflowers such as Indian paintbrush, monkey flower, bush poppies and yerba santa. Near the mouth of Waddell Creek is the Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, a freshwater marsh that is rare because it has been relatively undisturbed. This special place provides habitat for a wide variety of birds, reptiles and amphibians. The nearby Rancho Del Oso Nature and History Center interprets the cultural and natural history of the area. Fauna  The western fence lizard is fairly commonly spotted in Big Basin. Mammals such as black-tailed deer, western gray squirrels, chipmunks and raccoons are common, but foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and opossums are also present. Cougars are known to live in the park but are rarely sighted. Grizzly bears are extinct in California, but were numerous in the past. The last known human to die in California due to a grizzly attack in the wild occurred in Big Basin when, in 1875, William Waddell, a lumber mill owner, was killed near Waddell Creek. Bird life is abundant throughout the park. Steller's jays and acorn woodpeckers are both seen and heard, and the dark-eyed junco is widespread. Less obvious are the brown creeper, Anna's hummingbird, northern flicker, olive-sided flycatcher and sharp-shinned hawk. The first marbled murrelet nest ever sighted was located in Big Basin not far from the park headquarters. These robin-sized seabirds nest high in the oldest coast Douglas-firs and redwoods to feed their young. They can be seen or heard at dawn and dusk, high above the forest canopy. Many reptiles are also present, but aside from the ubiquitous Coast Range subspecies of the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis bocourtii), most are rarely seen due to their shy behavior. The only dangerous reptile in the park is the Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus), found almost exclusively in the high, dry chaparral. The damp, shady woodland floor is home to a variety of amphibians. Commonly seen species include the California newt (Taricha torosa torosa), Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla), and arboreal salamander (Aneides lugubris). Less commonly seen are the black salamander (Aneides flavipunctatus) and California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) and the threatened California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). Particularly intriguing are banana slugs (Ariolimax spp.), which can reach 6 inches long. The butterfly, California sisters (Adelpha bredowii), flutter high in the tree canopies.  Camping  Big Basin Redwoods State Park has many options for camping, including cabins, developed campsites, and trail camps. Within the park, there are 146 individual campsites, 36 cabins, and five trail camps. Campers are allowed to bring dogs to their campsites, provided the dogs are leashed. Dogs are not allowed in trail camps. Each campground at Big Basin Redwoods State Park is open on a different schedule during the year. The Huckleberry and Sequoia Campgrounds are open year round while Blooms Creek, Sempervirens, Watashi and Sky Meadow Campgrounds are seasonal. Big Basin Redwoods State Park has five backcountry trail camps, which require permits to use. Some of the campsites are on the Skyline-to-the- Sea trail and can be used on the hike with proper permissions.  Access  Meandering walkways take visitors through lush redwood groves Berry Creek Falls Big Basin can be approached from the east, through redwood forest and coastal mountains, or from the coast, along State Route 1. The eastern route, over State Route 9 through Saratoga and smaller towns like Boulder Creek is more popular because of the famous trees. This route passes Castle Rock State Park (California) on the eastern side of the Santa Cruz range. From SR 1, Gazos Creek road offers a pleasant fire-road route for mountain bikes (road closed to motor vehicles), which can then descend into the headquarters area or turn off on Johansen fire road to join China Grade above its intersection with State Route 236. The park is about two hours south of San Francisco, or seven hours north of Los Angeles.  In popular culture  In Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Vertigo (1958), Inspector Scottie Ferguson, James Stewart, walks with Madeleine Elster, Kim Novak into Big Basin, where she appears to disappear behind a tree. The movie states that they travel to the better known Muir Woods, but in fact the scene was shot in Big Basin. Big Basin stands in for Redwood National Park in the 1967 Disney film, The Gnome-Mobile.

The series had encore presentations on CNBC and Bravo. Celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito opened the Gramercy Park, New York City, restaurant Union Pacific in August, 1997. The NBC series, it was announced, would follow DiSpirito as he launched and operated a new Manhattan restaurant. The first season revolved around the construction and opening of Rocco's on 22nd, scheduled to open in five weeks. Some 7.5 million viewers tuned in for the July 20, 2003, premiere focusing on the search for a location and construction work for the new restaurant. Among the 2000 people who showed up hoping to be hired were various actors, models and show business hopefuls. In addition to Rocco's mother, Nicolina DiSpirito, known for her famous meatballs, the show's on-camera personnel included David Miller \\"Michael Miller's little bro\\" (Sous-chef), Alex Corrado (Maitre d'), Domiziano Arcangeli (Himself), Heather Kristin (Waitress), Natalie Norman (Waitress), Topher Goodman (Waiter), Lisa Wurzel (Herself), Brian Allen (Himself), Gideon Horowitz (Waiter), Heather Snell (Bartender), Amanda Congdon (Coat-check attendant), Pete Giovine (Waiter), Uzay Tumer (Captain), Emily Shaw (Captain), Lonn Coward (Waiter), Carrie Keranen (Waitress), Colleen Fitzgerald (Captain), Caroline Matler (Waitress), Brian Petruzzell (Busboy), Lola Belle (Bartender), Susanna Hari (Kitchen staff), Tony Acinapura (Chef), John Charlesworth (Kitchen staff), Laurent Saillard (General manager), Perry Pollaci (Kitchen staff), Matt DiBarro (Bartender), Tim Donoho (Himself)and Randy Pezz (also Meg Ryan's cousin) auditioned for the (Maitre d')position as (Himself, Steve Pezzino), but after meeting producer Mark Burnett, Mark saw Randy as a (kitchen staff) chef instead and wanted him in the kitchen, so Randy a former restaurant owner \\"traffic Pizzeria\\" in Newark, New Jersey in the 1980s did not accept the position. Randy was also a star of Manhattan towers a small production by Beverly Bonner in NYC at Don't Tell Mama's and that same year starred in an off Broadway production of 12 Angry Men as juror number 5. Only 6.5 million viewers tuned in for the second season premiere, despite launching a week after the finale of the hit first season of The Apprentice. The second season, filmed six months after the restaurant's opening, showed an ongoing power conflict between part owner Rocco DiSpirito and financier Jeffrey Chodorow, stemming from the restaurant's lack of profitability despite its popularity. On July 27, 2004, New York Supreme Court Judge Ira Gammerman issued an injunction barring Rocco DiSpirito from Rocco's on 22nd street and gave Jeffrey Chodorow permission to sell or reopen the restaurant under a new theme. Chodorow and DiSpirito were ordered to return to court on August 31 to determine if there was an agreement between the parties and if DiSpirito violated the agreement. After that ruling DiSpirito attempted to file a $6 million countersuit charging that Chodorow made accounting irregularities and that he (DiSpirito) was owed $175,000 in unpaid salary, and DiSpirito sought to regain fifty percent ownership of the restaurant. Chodorow initially invested $4 million in the restaurant and claims to have lost an additional $700,000. After the restaurant closed its doors on September 15, 2004, it reopened in 2005 as a Brazilian steakhouse called Caviar & Banana. Chodorow's partner in the Brazilian restaurant was chef Claude Troisgros of Roanne, France, renowned for his namesake restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Caviar & Banana has since closed, along with the subsequent Borough Food & Drink restaurant; the locale continuing to live up to its allegedly \\"cursed\\" reputation. The spot is currently home to Almond, a French bistro opened by Jason Weiner and Eric Lemonides, the men behind Almond and Almoncello in the Hamptons.

In 1964, he founded L'Arche, an international federation of communities spread over 37 countries for people with developmental disabilities and those who assist them. In 1971, he co-founded Faith and Light with Marie-Hélène Mathieu, which also works for people with developmental disabilities, their families, and friends in over 80 countries. He continued to live as a member of the original L'Arche community in Trosly- Breuil, France, until his death. Over the years he wrote 30 books on religion, disability, normality, success, and tolerance. Among the honours he received were the Companion of the Order of Canada (1986), Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec (1992), French Legion of Honour (2003), Community of Christ International Peace Award (2003), the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award (2013), and the Templeton Prize (2015). In February 2020, an internal report published by L'Arche concluded that Vanier sexually abused six women in Trosly-Breuil, France, between 1970 and 2005. The investigation was conducted by the UK-based GCPS Consulting Group.  Early years and background  Vanier was the son of Canadian parents, Major-General Georges Vanier, who became the 19th Governor General of Canada (1959–1967), and his mother Pauline Vanier (née Archer). He was born in Geneva, and was the fourth of five siblings (including sister and brother Bernard Vanier), in his youth Vanier received a broad education in English and French, first in Canada and then in France and England. During World War II, Vanier and his family fled Paris just before the Nazi occupation. He spent much of the war at an English naval academy. From age 13 he trained for a career as a naval officer at the Dartmouth Naval College (later renamed Britannia Royal Naval College). In early 1945, Vanier was visiting Paris, where his father was Canadian ambassador; he and his mother went to assist survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Seeing the emaciated victims was a profoundly moving encounter for him, which he never forgot. He served in World War II with the Royal Navy and then with the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1947 as a midshipman, Vanier accompanied the Royal Family on their tour of South Africa aboard HMS Vanguard. In 1949, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy, at the carrier HMCS Magnificent. In 1950 he resigned his naval commission. Vanier travelled to Paris to study as an undergraduate. He eventually went on to complete a PhD in philosophy from the Institut Catholique de Paris, with a doctoral thesis on Aristotle which was published in 1966 as Happiness as Principle and End of Aristotelian Ethics; this was his first published work. He went on to write over 30 books\\"Obituary: Jean Vanier died on May 7th,\\" The Economist, May 16, 2019. during his career and taught philosophy at the University of St. Michael's College, University of Toronto. He left academia in 1964, seeking a more spiritual ministry. His research lives on at the Jean Vanier Research Centre located at King's University College in London, Ontario, Canada.  Foundation of L'Arche  In 1964, through Vanier's friendship with a priest named , he became aware of the plight of thousands of people institutionalized with developmental disabilities. Vanier invited two men, Raphael Simi and Philippe Seux, to leave the institutions where they resided and live with him in Trosly-Breuil, France. Their time together led to the establishment of L'Arche at Trosly- Breuil, a community where people with disabilities live with those who care for them. Since that time a network of 150 L'Arche communities have been established in 38 countries. A governing philosophy of the communities is Vanier's belief that people with disabilities are teachers, rather than burdens bestowed upon families. Until the late 1990s, Vanier carried the responsibility for L'Arche in Trosly-Breuil in France, and for the International Federation of L'Arche. He then stepped down to spend more time counselling, encouraging, and accompanying the people who come to live in L'Arche as assistants to those with disabilities. Vanier established 147 L'Arche communities in 37 countries around the world which have become places of pilgrimage for those involved.  Later life  Vanier with John Smeltzer, a member of L'Arche Daybreak, 2009 Faith and Light emblem In 1968, Vanier gave a Faith and Sharing retreat in Mary Lake, Ontario, the first in his movement of retreats where people from many walks of life are welcome. The retreats continue today as part of the Faith and Sharing Federation. As of 2013, there were 13 communities in North America that organize annual retreats and days of prayer. Faith and Sharing member Bill Clark, SJ, explains: \\"There is then a two-fold movement in Faith and Sharing: an inward movement towards God hidden in the depths of our own vulnerability, and an outward movement towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are more poor and in need.\\" The organization's records are housed at the John M. Kelly Library, University of St. Michael's College. In 1971, Vanier co-founded Faith and Light with Marie- Hélène Mathieu. This is an international movement of forums for people with developmental disabilities, their family and friends. Today there are over 1,500 Faith and Light communities in 81 countries around the world. Vanier continued to live in the original L'Arche community of Trosly-Breuil, France, until his death in 2019. He continued to travel widely, visiting other L'Arche communities, encouraging projects for new communities and giving lectures and retreats. He was the 1998 Massey lecturer, focusing on the theme of \\"Becoming Human\\". During one of his lectures he touched on his distaste for barriers around people with intellectual disabilities, a motivating philosophy behind L'Arche: \\"We must do what we can to diminish walls, to meet each other. Why do we put people with disabilities behind walls?\\" In 2017, Vanier narrated and appeared in the documentary Summer In The Forest, filmed in the L'Arche communities in Trosly-Breuil and Bethlehem and featuring many of the residents of both communities with whom he worked. Writing in the New York Times, critic Ken Jaworowski observed that \\"just watching the residents leads you to confront and change many of your own preconceptions.\\" Vanier died on May 7, 2019. A week before his death, Pope Francis called Vanier to thank him for his years of ministry and service. Following his death, Pope Francis, who was flying back to Rome from North Macedonia, told a group of journalists, \\"I want to express my gratitude for his testimony\\" and said Vanier could read and interpret not only the Christian gaze on \\"the mystery of death, of the cross, of suffering\\", but also \\"the mystery of those who are discarded by the world\\". Among those he influenced were the Dutch Catholic priest, professor, writer and theologian Henri Nouwen who came to join the L'Arche Daybreak community in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Sexual abuse In February 2020, an internal report by L'Arche concluded that Vanier sexually abused six women in Trosly-Breuil, France, between 1970 and 2005. According to a joint statement by leaders of L'Arche International, Vanier had engaged in \\"manipulative and emotionally abusive\\" sexual relationships with six women in France, between 1970 and 2005. Sexual relations were instigated by Vanier, usually in the context of giving spiritual guidance. \\"These women reported similar facts associated with highly unusual spiritual or mystical explanations used to justify these behaviours\\", the statement said that \\"The relationships ... had a significant negative impact on their personal lives and subsequent relationships. These actions are indicative of a deep psychological and spiritual hold Jean Vanier had on these women.\\" It also said that Vanier asked the women to keep the incidents secret. The women included assistants and nuns. Vanier was also a member of a small clandestine group which subscribed to and participated in some of the deviant sexual practices of disgraced priest , the L'Arche statement said. The practices were founded on so-called \\"mystical\\" or \\"spiritual\\" beliefs that had been condemned by the Catholic Church, it added. Vanier described Philippe, who died in 1993, as his \\"spiritual father\\", but at first publicly denied knowledge of the practices. The investigation was carried out by independent UK consultancy GCPS. Vanier wrote in May 2015 that he now accepted that Philippe \\"hurt mature and intelligent people who appear to have placed all their trust in him\\" and that \\"I am unable to peacefully reconcile these two realities.\\"https://www.larche.org/documents/10181/1126084/1505_LetterJV_EN.pdf/4dc9c755-5794-409a-979d-dd108bdd7964 =Reactions= Cardinal Thomas Collins of the Archdiocese of Toronto described the events \\"tragic and heart wrenching\\". The Canadian and American branches of L'Arche have voiced their concern in various statements. In Canada, where there are many schools named after Vanier, some school boards are considering renaming schools named for him. In February 2020, the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana posthumously stripped Vanier of two awards which the university had awarded him, including the 1994 Notre Dame Award for humanitarian service.  Awards and honours  Vanier received numerous awards for his work, including the Companion of the Order of Canada, the Legion of Honour (France, 2003) and many awards from faith groups, among them the Paul VI International Prize, the Community of Christ International Peace Award, the Rabbi Gunther Plaut Humanitarian Award, and the Gaudium et Spes Award, named after the Second Vatican Council's Gaudium et spes document. In 1993, he received the Loyola Medal from Concordia University. In 1999, he won the Writers' Trust of Canada's Gordon Montador Award for Becoming Human.\\"Montador award winners named\\". North Bay Nugget, May 27, 1999. In November 2004, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation poll ranked him as number 12 in a list of greatest Canadians. In 2010, the asteroid 8604 was officially named Vanier in his honour.The citation and more information are found by entering this number or name in the JPL Small-Body Database. In 2013, he received the United States-based Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award, established by the Diocese of Davenport, Iowa. In March 2015, Vanier was awarded the $1.7 million Templeton Prize in recognition of his advocacy for people with disabilities and his contributions to a broader exploration of helping the weak and vulnerable. On September 27, 2016, Vanier received the Peace Abbey Foundation (USA) International Courage of Conscience Award in Trosly-Breuil, France, for his lifelong commitment to building a world of inclusion for individuals with disabilities. = Schools named after Vanier = SchoolS are named in his honour in several cities. *École Catholique Jean- Vanier, Kirkland Lake, Ontario *Jean Vanier Catholic School, Sherwood Park, Alberta *Jean Vanier School Catholic School, Regina, Saskatchewan *Jean Vanier School, London, Ontario *École Secondaire Catholique Jean-Vanier, Welland, Ontario *Jean Vanier Elementary School, Brantford, Ontario *Vanier Catholic Secondary School, Whitehorse, Yukon Some schools formerly named for Vanier have been renamed in light of the posthumous report of his involvement in abusive sexual relationships: * Our Lady Queen of the World Catholic Academy in Richmond Hill, Ontario was renamed from Jean Vanier Catholic High School by the York Catholic District School Board in May 2020. *St. Francis Xavier Catholic Secondary School in Milton, Ontario was renamed from Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School by the Halton Catholic District School Board in June 2020. * St. Joan of Arc Catholic Academy in Scarborough, Ontario was renamed from Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School by the Toronto Catholic District School Board in July 2020. * Our Lady of the Bay Catholic High School in Collingwood, Ontario was renamed from Jean Vanier Catholic High School in June 2020.

It follows a 13-year- old girl who dreams of being popular. During her birthday party, she is humiliated by her classmates and wishes that she was 30 years old. When she eventually does emerge, she finds herself suddenly 30 years old and in 2004, uncertain how she got there. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Garner's performance and its nostalgic environment. It was also praised for its humorous plot and self-empowering message. The film was also a commercial success, earning $22 million in its first week and grossing over $96 million, becoming one of the year's biggest- selling DVD rental titles. Additionally, the soundtrack charted inside the top 50 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Garner's acting earned her nominations from both the MTV Movie Awards and the Teen Choice Awards. Plot In 1987, young and geeky Jenna Rink yearns to be popular, but can only persuade the \\"Six Chicks\\" – the ruling clique led by Lucy \\"Tom-Tom\\" Wyman – to attend her 13th- birthday party by doing their homework. Jenna's best friend, Matt \\"Matty\\" Flamhaff, brings her a pink dollhouse he made himself, and a packet of \\"magic wishing dust\\" he sprinkles on the dollhouse roof. The Six Chicks arrive with the cutest boys in class, and trick Jenna into playing \\"seven minutes in heaven\\". While Jenna waits blindfolded in a closet, expecting to kiss one of the boys, the Six Chicks and the boys leave with her completed homework, and Matty finds Jenna alone. Humiliated, she tearfully wishes to be 30, as the wishing dust falls on her. The next morning, Jenna awakens in a luxurious Fifth Avenue apartment – her wish has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna is 30, with no memory of the intervening 17 years. Jenna discovers she works for Poise, her favorite fashion magazine, with her co-editor and best friend Lucy. Poise has been scooped so often by rival magazine Sparkle that editor-in-chief Richard believes someone is tipping them off. Jenna finds Matty's address and races to Greenwich Village where the adult Matt, a struggling photographer, is unable to fill in her missing past, as she became head of the \\"Six Chicks (Now Seven Chicks)\\" and stopped speaking to him. Lucy is revealed to be the adult Tom-Tom, having had plastic surgery. While delighting in her freedom, Jenna stumbles through adult life, learning enough to advise the 13-year-olds she prefers to spend time with. She saves a Poise party by leading the guests, including Matt, in an impromptu performance of the \\"Thriller\\" line dance. Her slowly emerging past reveals that the adult Jenna is nothing like the sweet, shy girl she was the day before. This Jenna stole ideas, refused to speak to her parents, and had office sex with a co-worker's husband. The struggling magazine is forced to redesign, and Jenna overhears Lucy badmouthing her, planning to cut Jenna out of her redesign presentation. Jenna returns to her childhood home in New Jersey, weeping in the same basement closet and reuniting with her parents. She apologizes to Matt, and hires him for her yearbook-inspired redesign photoshoot. Even though Matt is engaged to Wendy, who is eager for him to move to Chicago, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other. Jenna's plans to save the magazine are a rousing success, while Lucy's presentation fails, and she lies to Matt that Jenna decided not to use his pictures. Looking for Matt to deliver the good news, Jenna finds Wendy, who reveals their wedding is the next day. Richard informs Jenna that Lucy gave Jenna's material, including Matt's photographs, to Sparkle and has become their new editor-in-chief, effectively killing Poise. Jenna confronts Lucy, who scornfully reveals that she discovered Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine; Lucy merely stole the job Jenna was to receive. Jenna rushes to Matt's childhood home, next door to hers, where the wedding will soon be underway. Finding Matt, she declares that she is not the bad person she seemed to be, and that he would marry her if he could see who she really was. Matt, already in his tuxedo, tells her they cannot turn back time, but reveals the pink dollhouse he has kept for 17 years. In tears, Jenna asks for it back, and Matt sadly confesses that he always loved her. Jenna sits with the dollhouse as the wedding begins, and sees a young Matt and herself inside. She shuts her eyes, and specks of the wishing dust whirl around her. Opening her eyes, Jenna finds herself back in 1987 on her 13th birthday. This time, when Matty finds her alone in the closet, she kisses him. Confronting Lucy, Jenna rips up the homework and runs upstairs with Matty. With this second chance, Jenna lives the intervening 17 years properly, with her and Matt emerging in 2004 as a newly married couple. They share their favorite candy, Razzles, while moving into a pink house identical to the dollhouse. Cast * Jennifer Garner as Jenna Rink-Flamhaff **Christa B.

Written by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, the script was \\"polished\\" by Niels Mueller (who lost an initial writing credit in a subsequent dispute arbitrated by the Writers Guild of America). American actress Jennifer Garner was cast for the movie's lead role. In order to film the picture, Garner shot it while on break from filming her TV series Alias. Gwyneth Paltrow, Hilary Swank, and Renée Zellweger were all considered for the lead role. Judy Greer was cast to play Lucy, Garner's best friend; Kathy Baker and Phil Reeves were invited to be Garner's mother and father, respectively. Later, Andy Serkis was selected to play Garner's boss; while Samuel Ball was announced as Garner's boyfriend. Christa B. Allen, who portrayed 13-year-old Jenna, later \\"reprised\\" her role as a younger version of Jennifer Garner by portraying the teenaged version of Jenny Perotti in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. In October 2016, it was announced 13 Going on 30 was going to be adapted on Broadway in late 2017, but as 2017 came and went, no such adaptation ever occurred.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A-, on a scale of A to F.13 GOING ON 30 (2004) A- CinemaScore Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a very positive review with a grade of \\"A-\\", writing \\"13 Going on 30 is the rare commercial comedy that leaves you entranced by what can happen only in the movies.\\" Gleiberman also praised Jennifer Garner's performance, writing: \\"She cuts out all traces of adult consciousness, of irony and flirtation and manipulation, reducing herself to a keen, goggle-eyed earnestness that's utterly beguiling.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety also praised her performance, writing \\"Garner throws herself so fully and effectively into the role that in a few key scenes, she vividly conveys Jenna's high spirits and giddy pleasure through the graceful curling of her toes.\\" Leydon praised the director Gary Winick for \\" bringing a fresh spin to most of the script's clichés and emphasizing nuggets of emotional truth provided by Goldsmith and Yuspa.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"The movie is tailor-made for women who openly lust for dream houses, dream jobs, and dream hubbies.\\" He also wrote that \\"the best stuff involves the childhood preamble. (The young actors playing Jenna, Matt, and Lucy are terrific.) Those moments feel painfully, comically true.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, commenting, \\"This romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale. The silly humor works with the movie's gentle message of self- empowerment and avoids sappiness in a tender interlude where the adult Jenna returns to her childhood home. Amusing, charming and pleasantly nostalgic, 13 Going on 30 should fall easily onto moviegoers' wish lists.\\" Mick Martin and Marsha Porter's 2005 DVD and Video Guide called it a \\"shameless rip-off of the Tom Hanks' classic Big\\", adding that it was \\"weak, but predictable and is sparked by the excellent performance of Jennifer Garner\\".2005 DVD and Video guide, p.1120. . Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote: \\"The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum. The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success, even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism. The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads. Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it, too.\\" Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader wrote that \\"The formula works, thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner, who's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock. Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral—self-love is a prerequisite for true love—there's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken.\\" Jorge Morales of The Village Voice commented: \\"The thirtysomething in me was all, gag me with a spoon, but the kid in me was like, this movie's rad to the max.\\" =Awards= Garner was nominated for MTV Movie Award and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink.Awards for 13 Going on 30 (2004).

With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the last great fortification system of antiquity, and one of the most complex and elaborate systems ever built. Initially built by Constantine the Great, the walls surrounded the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous double line of the Theodosian Walls was built in the 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, they were, when well-manned, almost impregnable for any medieval besieger, saving the city, and the Byzantine Empire with it, during sieges from the Avar-Sassanian coalition, Arabs, Rus', and Bulgars, among others. The advent of gunpowder siege cannons rendered the fortifications vulnerable, but cannon technology was not sufficiently advanced to capture the city on its own, and the walls could be repaired between reloading. Ultimately, the city fell from the sheer weight of numbers of the Ottoman forces on 29 May 1453 after a six-week siege. The walls were largely maintained intact during most of the Ottoman period, until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite the subsequent lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived and are still standing today. A large-scale restoration program has been under way since the 1980s. Land Walls =Walls of Greek and Roman Byzantium= According to tradition, the city was founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists from Megara, led by the eponymous Byzas, around 658 BC. At the time the city consisted of a small region around an acropolis, located on the easternmost hill (corresponding to the modern site of the Topkapı Palace). According to the late Byzantine Patria of Constantinople, ancient Byzantium was enclosed by a small wall, which began on the northern edge of the acropolis, extended west to the Tower of Eugenios, then went south and west towards the Strategion and the Baths of Achilles, continued south to the area known in Byzantine times as Chalkoprateia, and then turned, in the area of the Hagia Sophia, in a loop towards the northeast, crossed the regions known as Topoi and Arcadianae and reached the sea at the later quarter of Mangana. This wall was protected by 27 towers, and had at least two landward gates, one which survived to become known as the Arch of Urbicius, and one where the Milion monument was later located. On the seaward side, the wall was much lower. Although the author of the Patria asserts that this wall dated to the time of Byzas, the French researcher Raymond Janin thinks it more likely that it reflects the situation after the city was rebuilt by the Spartan general Pausanias, who conquered the city in 479 BC. This wall is known to have been repaired, utilising tomb stones, under the leadership of a certain Leo in 340 BC, against an attack by Philip II of Macedon. Byzantium was relatively unimportant during the early Roman period. Contemporaries described it as wealthy, well peopled and well fortified, but this affluence came to an end due to its support for Pescennius Niger (r. 193–194) in his war against Septimius Severus (r. 193–211). According to the account of Cassius Dio (Roman History, 75.10–14), the city held out against Severan forces for three years, until 196, with its inhabitants resorting even to throwing bronze statues at the besiegers when they ran out of other projectiles. Severus punished the city harshly: the strong walls were demolished and the city was deprived of its civic status, being reduced to a mere village dependent on Heraclea Perinthus. However, appreciating the city's strategic importance, Severus eventually rebuilt it and endowed it with many monuments, including a Hippodrome and the Baths of Zeuxippus, as well as a new set of walls, located some 300–400 m to the west of the old ones. Little is known of the Severan Wall save for a short description of its course by Zosimus (New History, II.30.2–4) and that its main gate was located at the end of a porticoed avenue (the first part of the later Mese) and shortly before the entrance of the later Forum of Constantine. The wall seems to have extended from near the modern Galata Bridge in the Eminönü quarter south through the vicinity of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque to curve around the southern wall of the Hippodrome, and then going northeast to meet the old walls near the Bosporus. The Patria also mention the existence of another wall during the siege of Byzantium by Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) during the latter's conflict with Licinius (r. 308–324), in 324. The text mentions that a fore-wall (proteichisma) ran near the Philadephion, located at about the middle of the later, Constantinian city, suggesting the expansion of the city beyond the Severan Wall by this time. =Constantinian Walls= Like Severus before him, Constantine began to punish the city for siding with his defeated rival, but soon he too realized the advantages of Byzantium's location. During 324–336 the city was thoroughly rebuilt and inaugurated on 11 May 330 under the name of \\"Second Rome\\". The name that eventually prevailed in common usage however was Constantinople, the \\"City of Constantine\\" (Gk. Κωνσταντινούπολις, Konstantinoupolis). The city of Constantine was protected by a new wall about 2.8 km (15 stadia) west of the Severan wall. Constantine's fortification consisted of a single wall, reinforced with towers at regular distances, which began to be constructed in 324 and was completed under his son Constantius II (r. 337–361).; Only the approximate course of the wall is known: it began at the Church of St. Anthony at the Golden Horn, near the modern Atatürk Bridge, ran southwest and then southwards, passed east of the great open cisterns of Mocius and of Aspar, and ended near the Church of the Theotokos of the Rhabdos on the Propontis coast, somewhere between the later sea gates of St. Aemilianus and Psamathos.; Already by the early 5th century however, Constantinople had expanded outside the Constantinian Wall, in the extramural area known as the Exokionion or Exakionion.cf. The wall survived during much of the Byzantine period, even though it was replaced by the Theodosian Walls as the city's primary defence. An ambiguous passage refers to extensive damage to the city's \\"inner wall\\" from an earthquake on 25 September 478, which likely refers to the Constantinian wall, and Theophanes the Confessor reports renewed earthquake damage in 557. It appears that large parts survived relatively intact until the 9th century: the 11th-century historian Kedrenos records that the \\"wall at Exokionion\\", likely a portion of the Constantinian wall, collapsed in an earthquake in 867. Only traces of the wall appear to have survived in later ages, although Van Millingen states that some parts survived in the region of the İsakapı until the early 19th century. The recent construction of Yenikapı Transfer Center has unearthed a section of the foundation of the wall of Constantine. Gates The names of a number of gates of the Constantinian Wall survive, but scholars debate their identity and exact location. The Old Golden Gate (, ), known also as the Xerolophos Gate and the Gate of Saturninus, is mentioned in the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae, which further states that the city wall itself in the region around it was \\"ornately decorated\\". The gate stood somewhere on the southern slopes of the Seventh Hill. Its construction is often attributed to Constantine, but is in fact of uncertain age. It survived until the 14th century, when the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras described it as being built of \\"wide marble blocks with a lofty opening\\", and crowned by a kind of stoa. In late Byzantine times, a painting of the Crucifixion was allegedly placed on the gate, leading to its later Ottoman name, İsakapı (\\"Gate of Jesus\\"). It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1509, but its approximate location is known through the presence of the nearby İsakapı Mescidi mosque. The identity and location of the Gate of At[t]alos (, Porta At[t]alou) are unclear. Cyril Mango identifies it with the Old Golden Gate; van Millingen places it on the Seventh Hill, at a height probably corresponding to one of the later gates of the Theodosian Wall in that area; and Raymond Janin places it further north, across the Lycus and near the point where the river passed under the wall. In earlier centuries, it was decorated with many statues, including one of Constantine, which fell down in an earthquake in 740. The only gate whose location is known with certainty, aside from the Old Golden Gate, is the Gate of Saint Aemilianus (, Porta tou hagiou Aimilianou), named in Turkish Davutpaşa Kapısı. It lay at the juncture with the sea walls, and served the communication with the coast. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the Church of St Mary of Rhabdos, where the rod of Moses was kept, stood next to the gate. The Old Gate of the Prodromos (, Palaia Porta tou Prodromou), named after the nearby Church of St John the Baptist (called Prodromos, \\"the Forerunner\\", in Greek), is another unclear case. Van Millingen identifies it with the Old Golden Gate, while Janin considers it to have been located on the northern slope of the Seventh Hill. The last known gate is the Gate of Melantias (, Porta tēs Melantiados), whose location is also debated. Van Millingen considered it to be a gate of the Theodosian Wall (the Pege Gate), while more recently, Janin and Mango have refuted this, suggesting that it was located on the Constantinian Wall. Again however, while Mango identifies it with the Gate of the Prodromos, Janin considers the name to have been a corruption of the ta Meltiadou quarter, and places the gate to the west of the Mocius cistern. Other authors identified it with the Gate of Adrianople (A. M. Schneider) or with the Gate of Rhesios (A. J. Mordtmann). =Theodosian Walls= Restored section of the Theodosian Walls at the Selymbria Gate. The Outer Wall and the wall of the moat are visible, with a tower of the Inner Wall in the background. The double Theodosian Walls (, teichos Theodosiakon), located about 2 km to the west of the old Constantinian Wall, were erected during the reign of Emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450), after whom they were named. The work was carried out in two phases, with the first phase erected during Theodosius' minority under the direction of Anthemius, the praetorian prefect of the East, and was finished in 413 according to a law in the Codex Theodosianus. An inscription discovered in 1993 however records that the work lasted for nine years, indicating that construction had already begun ca. 404/405, in the reign of Emperor Arcadius (r. 395–408). This initial construction consisted of a single curtain wall with towers, which now forms the inner circuit of the Theodosian Walls.; ; Both the Constantinian and the original Theodosian walls were severely damaged, however, in two earthquakes, on 25 September 437 and on 6 November 447. The latter was especially powerful, and destroyed large parts of the wall, including 57 towers. Subsequent earthquakes, including another major one in January 448, compounded the damage.; Theodosius II ordered the praetorian prefect Constantine to supervise the repairs, made all the more urgent as the city was threatened by the presence of Attila the Hun in the Balkans. Employing the city's \\"Circus factions\\" in the work, the walls were restored in a record 60 days, according to the Byzantine chroniclers and three inscriptions found in situ.; ; It is at this date that the majority of scholars believe the second, outer wall to have been added, as well as a wide moat opened in front of the walls, but the validity of this interpretation is questionable; the outer wall was possibly an integral part of the original fortification concept. Throughout their history, the walls were damaged by earthquakes and floods of the Lycus river. Repairs were undertaken on numerous occasions, as testified by the numerous inscriptions commemorating the emperors or their servants who undertook to restore them. The responsibility for these repairs rested on an official variously known as the Domestic of the Walls or the Count of the Walls (, Domestikos/Komēs tōn teicheōn), who employed the services of the city's populace in this task.cf. ; ; After the Latin conquest of 1204, the walls fell increasingly into disrepair, and the revived post-1261 Byzantine state lacked the resources to maintain them, except in times of direct threat.; For a survey of the repairs undertaken against the Ottoman threat in the last decades of Byzantium, cf. Course and topography In their present state, the Theodosian Walls stretch for about 5.7 km from south to north, from the \\"Marble Tower\\" (), also known as the \\"Tower of Basil and Constantine\\" (Gk. Pyrgos Basileiou kai Kōnstantinou) on the Propontis coast to the area of the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (Tr. Tekfur Sarayı) in the Blachernae quarter. The outer wall and the moat terminate even earlier, at the height of the Gate of Adrianople. The section between the Blachernae and the Golden Horn does not survive, since the line of the walls was later brought forward to cover the suburb of Blachernae, and its original course is impossible to ascertain as it lies buried beneath the modern city. From the Sea of Marmara, the wall turns sharply to the northeast, until it reaches the Golden Gate, at about 14 m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows a more or less straight line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68 m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35 m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76 m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas. Construction Scheme of the Theodosian Walls The Theodosian Walls consist of the main inner wall (μέγα τεῖχος, mega teichos, \\"great wall\\"), separated from the lower outer wall (, exō teichos or μικρὸν τεῖχος, mikron teichos, \\"small wall\\") by a terrace, the peribolos (περίβολος). Between the outer wall and the moat (, souda) there stretched an outer terrace, the parateichion (), while a low breastwork crowned the moat's eastern escarpment. Access to both terraces was possible through posterns on the sides of the walls' towers.; The inner wall is a solid structure, 4.5–6 m thick and 12 m high. It is faced with carefully cut limestone blocks, while its core is filled with mortar made of lime and crushed bricks. Between seven and eleven bands of brick, approximately 40 cm thick, traverse the structure, not only as a form of decoration, but also strengthening the cohesion of the structure by bonding the stone façade with the mortar core, and increasing endurance to earthquakes. The wall was strengthened with 96 towers, mainly square but also a few octagonal ones, three hexagonal and a single pentagonal one. They were 15–20 m tall and 10–12 m wide, and placed at irregular distances, according to the rise of the terrain: the intervals vary between 21 and 77 m, although most curtain wall sections measure between 40 and 60 meters.; ; Each tower had a battlemented terrace on the top. Its interior was usually divided by a floor into two chambers, which did not communicate with each other. The lower chamber, which opened through the main wall to the city, was used for storage, while the upper one could be entered from the wall's walkway, and had windows for view and for firing projectiles. Access to the wall was provided by large ramps along their side. The lower floor could also be accessed from the peribolos by small posterns. Generally speaking, most of the surviving towers of the main wall have been rebuilt either in Byzantine or in Ottoman times, and only the foundations of some are of original Theodosian construction. Furthermore, while until the Komnenian period the reconstructions largely remained true to the original model, later modifications ignored the windows and embrasures on the upper store and focused on the tower terrace as the sole fighting platform. Photo of the peribolos, the space between the inner and outer walls. The outer wall was 2 m thick at its base, and featured arched chambers on the level of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9 m. Access to the outer wall from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The outer wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78 m, with an average distance of 50–66 m. Only 62 of the outer wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14 m tall and 4 m wide. They featured a room with windows on the level of the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The outer wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the outer wall. The moat was situated at a distance of about 20 m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20 m wide and as much as 10 m deep, featuring a 1.5 m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top so as not to be used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople. The weakest section of the wall was the so-called Mesoteichion (Μεσοτείχιον, \\"Middle Wall\\"). Modern scholars are not in agreement over the extent of this portion of the wall, which has been variously defined from as narrowly as the stretch between the Gate of St. Romanus and the Fifth Military Gate (A.M. Schneider) to as broad as from the Gate of Rhegion to the Fifth Military Gate (B. Tsangadas) or from the Gate of St. Romanus to the Gate of Adrianople (A. van Millingen). Gates The wall contained nine main gates, which pierced both the inner and the outer walls, and a number of smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence. In the traditional nomenclature, established by Philipp Anton Dethier in 1873, the gates are distinguished into the \\"Public Gates\\" and the \\"Military Gates\\", which alternated over the course of the walls. According to Dethier's theory, the former were given names and were open to civilian traffic, leading across the moat on bridges, while the latter were known by numbers, restricted to military use, and only led to the outer sections of the walls.; Today however, this division is, if at all, retained only as a historiographical convention. First, there is sufficient reason to believe that several of the \\"Military Gates\\" were also used by civilian traffic. In addition, a number of them have proper names, and the established sequence of numbering them, based on their perceived correspondence with the names of certain city quarters lying between the Constantinian and Theodosian walls which have numerical origins, has been shown to be erroneous: for instance, the Deuteron, the \\"Second\\" quarter, was not located in the southwest behind the Gate of the Deuteron or \\"Second Military Gate\\" as would be expected, but in the northwestern part of the city. =First Military Gate= The gate is a small postern, which lies at the first tower of the land walls, at the junction with the sea wall. It features a wreathed Chi-Rhō Christogram above it.; ; It was known in late Ottoman times as the Tabak Kapı. =Golden Gate= The Golden Gate and the Castle of Seven Towers in 1685. The dense settlement inside the walls of the fortress is evident, as well as the still-preserved outer gate of the Golden Gate, decorated with relief panels. Following the walls from south to north, the Golden Gate (, Chryseia Pylē; ; ), is the first gate to be encountered. It was the main ceremonial entrance into the capital, used especially for the occasions of a triumphal entry of an emperor into the capital on the occasion of military victories or other state occasions such as coronations. On rare occasions, as a mark of honor, the entry through the gate was allowed to non-imperial visitors: papal legates (in 519 and 868) and, in 710, to Pope Constantine. The Gate was used for triumphal entries until the Komnenian period; thereafter, the only such occasion was the entry of Michael VIII Palaiologos into the city on 15 August 1261, after its reconquest from the Latins. With the progressive decline in Byzantium's military fortunes, the gates were walled up and reduced in size in the later Palaiologan period, and the complex converted into a citadel and refuge. The Golden Gate was emulated elsewhere, with several cities naming their principal entrance thus, for instance Thessaloniki (also known as the Vardar Gate) or Antioch (the Gate of Daphne), as well as the Kievan Rus', who built monumental \\"Golden Gates\\" at Kiev and Vladimir. The entrance to San Francisco Bay in California was similarly named the Golden Gate in the middle of the nineteenth century, in a distant historical tribute to Byzantium. The date of the gate's construction is uncertain, with scholars divided between Theodosius I and Theodosius II. Earlier scholars favored the former, but the current majority view tends to the latter, meaning that the gate was constructed as an integral part of the Theodosian Walls. The debate has been carried over to a Latin inscription in metal letters, now lost, which stood above the doors and commemorated their gilding in celebration of the defeat of an unnamed usurper:Bury (1923), p. 71 (English translation) Curiously, the legend has not been reported by any Byzantine author. However, an investigation of the surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls. Modern photograph of the Golden Gate, showing the two flanking towers. The top of the walled-up central arch is also visible. The gate, built of large square blocks of polished white marble fitted together without cement, has the form of a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger than the two others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn quadriga on top, echoing the Porta Triumphalis of Rome, which survived until it fell down in the 740 Constantinople earthquake. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an earthquake in 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the City. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones. Surviving fragments of the statues decorating the outer gate of the Golden Gate complex, from the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. The main gate itself was covered by an outer wall, pierced by a single gate, which in later centuries was flanked by an ensemble of reused marble reliefs. According to descriptions of Pierre Gilles and English travelers from the 17th century, these reliefs were arranged in two tiers, and featured mythological scenes, including the Labours of Hercules. These reliefs, lost since the 17th century with the exception of some fragments now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, were probably put in place in the 9th or 10th centuries to form the appearance of a triumphal gate. According to other descriptions, the outer gate was also topped by a statue of Victory, holding a crown. Despite its ceremonial role, the Golden Gate was one of the stronger positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs and left it unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II. According to one of the many Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend explained the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy. = Yedikule Fortress = The Castle of Seven Towers (1827) After his conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II built a new fort in 1458. By adding three larger towers to the four pre- existing ones (towers 8 to 11) on the inner Theodosian wall, he formed the Fortress of the Seven Towers ( or Zindanları). It lost its function as a gate, and for much of the Ottoman era, it was used as a treasury, archive, and state prison. It eventually became a museum in 1895. =Xylokerkos Gate= The Xylokerkos Gate or Gate of Belgrade The Xylokerkos or Xerokerkos Gate (), now known as the Belgrade Gate (Belgrat Kapısı), lies between towers 22 and 23. Alexander van Millingen identified it with the Second Military Gate, which however is located further north.; Its name derives from the fact that it led to a wooden circus (amphitheatre) outside the walls. The gate complex is approximately 12 m wide and almost 20 m high, while the gate itself spans 5 m. According to a story related by Niketas Choniates, in 1189 the gate was walled off by Emperor Isaac II Angelos, because according to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor Frederick Barbarossa would enter the city through. It was re-opened in 1346, but closed again before the siege of 1453 and remained closed until 1886, leading to its early Ottoman name, Kapalı Kapı (\\"Closed Gate\\"). =Second Military Gate= The gate () is located between towers 30 and 31, little remains of the original gate, and the modern reconstruction may not be accurate. =Gate of the Spring= The Gate of the Spring The Gate of the Spring or Pēgē Gate ( in Greek) was named after a popular monastery outside the Walls, the Zōodochos Pēgē (\\"Life-giving Spring\\") in the modern suburb of Balıklı. Its modern Turkish name, Gate of Selymbria (Tr. Silivri Kapısı or Silivrikapı, Gk. ), appeared in Byzantine sources shortly before 1453.; It lies between the heptagonal towers 35 and 36, which were extensively rebuilt in later Byzantine times: its southern tower bears an inscription dated to 1439 commemorating repairs carried out under John VIII Palaiologos. The gate arch was replaced in the Ottoman period. In addition, in 1998 a subterranean basement with 4th/5th century reliefs and tombs was discovered underneath the gate.; Van Millingen identifies this gate with the early Byzantine Gate of Melantias (Πόρτα Μελαντιάδος), but more recent scholars have proposed the identification of the latter with one of the gates of the city's original Constantinian Wall (see above). It was through this gate that the forces of the Empire of Nicaea, under General Alexios Strategopoulos, entered and retook the city from the Latins on 25 July 1261.; =Third Military Gate= The Third Military Gate (), named after the quarter of the Triton (\\"the Third\\") that lies behind it, is situated shortly after the Pege Gate, exactly before the C-shaped section of the walls known as the \\"Sigma\\", between towers 39 and 40.; It has no Turkish name, and is of middle or late Byzantine construction. The corresponding gate in the outer wall was preserved until the early 20th century, but has since disappeared. It is very likely that this gate is to be identified with the Gate of Kalagros (). =Gate of Rhegion= Modern Yeni Mevlevihane Kapısı, located between towers 50 and 51 is commonly referred to as the Gate of Rhegion () in early modern texts, allegedly named after the suburb of Rhegion (modern Küçükçekmece), or as the Gate of Rhousios () after the hippodrome faction of the Reds (, rhousioi) which was supposed to have taken part in its repair. From Byzantine texts however it appears that the correct form is Gate of Rhesios (), named according to the 10th-century Suda lexicon after an ancient general of Greek Byzantium. A.M. Schneider also identifies it with the Gate of Myriandr[i]on or Polyandrion (\\"Place of Many Men\\"), possibly a reference to its proximity to a cemetery. It is the best-preserved of the gates, and retains substantially unaltered from its original, 5th-century appearance. =Fourth Military Gate= The so-called Fourth Military Gate stands between towers 59 and 60, and is currently walled up.; Recently, it has been suggested that this gate is actually the Gate of St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.; = Gate of St. Romanus = The Gate of St. Romanus () was named so after a nearby church and lies between towers 65 and 66. It is known in Turkish as Topkapı, the \\"Cannon Gate\\", after the great Ottoman cannon, the \\"Basilic\\", that was placed opposite it during the 1453 siege.; With a gatehouse of 26.5 m, it is the second-largest gate after the Golden Gate. According to conventional wisdom, it is here that Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, was killed on 29 May 1453.; =Fifth Military Gate= The Fifth Military Gate () lies immediately to the north of the Lycus stream, between towers 77 and 78, and is named after the quarter of the Pempton (\\"the Fifth\\") around the Lycus. It is heavily damaged, with extensive late Byzantine or Ottoman repairs evident. It is also identified with the Byzantine Gate of [the Church of] St. Kyriake, and called Sulukulekapı (\\"Water-Tower Gate\\") or Hücum Kapısı (\\"Assault Gate\\") in Turkish, because there the decisive breakthrough was achieved on the morning of 29 May 1453. In the late 19th century, it appears as the Örülü kapı (\\"Walled Gate\\"). Some earlier scholars, like J. B. Bury and Kenneth Setton, identify this gate as the \\"Gate of St. Romanus\\" mentioned in the texts on the final siege and fall of the city. If this theory is correct, the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, died in the vicinity of this gate during the final assault of 29 May 1453. Support to this theory comes from the fact that the particular gate is located at a far weaker section of the walls than the \\"Cannon Gate\\", and the most desperate fighting naturally took place here. =Gate of Charisius= The restored Gate of Charisius or Adrianople Gate, where Sultan Mehmed II entered the city. The Gate of Char[i]sius (), named after the nearby early Byzantine monastery founded by a vir illustris of that name, was, after the Golden Gate, the second-most important gate. In Turkish it is known as Edirnekapı (\\"Adrianople Gate\\"), and it is here where Mehmed II made his triumphal entry into the conquered city. This gate stands on top of the sixth hill, which was the highest point of the old city at 77 meters. It has also been suggested as one of the gates to be identified with the Gate of Polyandrion or Myriandrion (), because it led to a cemetery outside the Walls. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, established his command here in 1453. =Minor gates and posterns= Known posterns are the Yedikule Kapısı, a small postern after the Yedikule Fort (between towers 11 and 12), and the gates between towers 30/31, already walled up in Byzantine times, and 42/43, just north of the \\"Sigma\\". On the Yedikule Kapısı, opinions vary as to its origin: some scholars consider it to date already to Byzantine times, while others consider it an Ottoman addition. =Kerkoporta= According to the historian Doukas, on the morning of 29 May 1453, the small postern called Kerkoporta was left open by accident, allowing the first fifty or so Ottoman troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the Inner Wall and opened fire on the Greek defenders of the peribolos below. This spread panic, beginning the rout of the defenders and leading to the fall of the city. In 1864, the remains of a postern located on the Outer Wall at the end of the Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, were discovered and identified with the Kerkoporta by the Greek scholar A.G. Paspates. Later historians, like van Millingen and Steven Runciman have accepted this theory as well. However, excavations at the site have uncovered no evidence of a corresponding gate in the Inner Wall (now vanished) in that area, and it may be that Doukas' story is either invention or derived from an earlier legend concerning the Xylokerkos Gate, which several earlier scholars also equated with the Kerkoporta. Later history The Theodosian Walls were without a doubt among the most important defensive systems of Late Antiquity. Indeed, in the words of the Cambridge Ancient History, they were \\"perhaps the most successful and influential city walls ever built – they allowed the city and its emperors to survive and thrive for more than a millennium, against all strategic logic, on the edge of [an] extremely unstable and dangerous world...\\". With the advent of siege cannons, however, such fortifications were becoming obsolete, but their massive size still provided effective defence, as demonstrated during the Second Ottoman Siege in 1422. Even in the final siege, which led to the fall of the city to the Ottomans three decades later (in 1453), the defenders, severely outnumbered, still managed to repeatedly counter Turkish attempts at undermining the walls, repulse several frontal attacks, and restore the damage from the siege cannons for almost two months. Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general Giovanni Giustiniani was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken. After the capture of the city, Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects, and they were kept in repair during the first centuries of Ottoman rule. =Walls of Blachernae= The section of the Theodosian Walls that adjoins the walls of Blachernae, with the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus in the background, as they appear today in suburban Istanbul. The Walls of Blachernae connect the Theodosian Walls, which terminate at the height of the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (), with the sea wall at the Golden Horn. They consist of a series of single walls built in different periods, which cover the suburb of Blachernae. Generally they are about 12–15 meters in height, thicker than the Theodosian Walls and with more closely spaced towers. Situated on a steep slope, they lacked a moat, except on their lower end towards the Golden Horn, where Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos had dug one. The question of the original fortifications in this area has been examined by several scholars, and several theories have been proposed as to their course.cf. It is known from the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae that the XIV region, which comprised Blachernae, stood apart and was enclosed all around by a wall of its own. Further it is recorded that originally, and at least as late as the Avar-Persian siege of 626, when they were burned down, the important sanctuaries of Panagia Blachernitissa and St. Nicholas lay just outside the quarter's fortifications.; Traces of the quarter's walls have been preserved, running from the area of the Porphyrogenitus Palace in straight line to the so-called Prison of Anemas. The original fortified quarter can thereby be roughly traced to have comprised the two northern spurs of the city's Seventh Hill in a triangle, stretching from the Porphyrogenitus Palace to the Anemas Prison, from there to the church of St. Demetrios Kanabos and thence back to the Porphyrogenitus Palace. These fortifications were apparently older than the Theodosian Walls, probably dating to sometime in the 4th century, and were then connected to the new city walls under Theodosius II, with the western wall forming the outer face of the city's defenses and the eastern wall fell into disrepair.; Today, the Theodosian Walls are connected in the vicinity of the Porphyrogenitus Palace with a short wall, which features a postern, probably the postern of the Porphyrogenitus () recorded by John VI Kantakouzenos, and extends from the Palace to the first tower of the so-called Wall of Manuel Komnenos.; As recorded by the historian Niketas Choniates, that wall was built by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) as a protection to the imperial Palace of Blachernae, since the late 11th century the emperors' preferred residence. It is an architecturally excellent fortification, consisting of a series of arches closed on their outer face, built with masonry larger than usual and thicker than the Theodosian Walls, measuring some 5 m at the top.; It features eight round and octagonal towers, while the last is square. The wall stretches for 220 m, beginning at an almost right angle from the line of the Theodosian Walls, going westward up to the third tower and then turning sharply north. The quality of the wall's construction was shown in the final Ottoman siege, when repeated attacks, intensive bombardment (including the large bombard of Orban) and attempts at undermining it came to naught. The Komnenian wall lacks a moat, since the difficult terrain of the area makes it unnecessary. The wall features one postern, between the second and third towers, and one large gate, the Eğri Kapı (\\"Crooked Gate\\"), between the sixth and seventh towers. Its Turkish name comes from the sharp bend of the road in front of it to pass around a tomb which is supposed to belong to Hazret Hafiz, a companion of Muhammad who died there during the first Arab siege of the city. It is usually, but not conclusively, identified with the Byzantine Kaligaria Gate (, porta en tois Kaligariois), the \\"Gate of the Bootmakers' Quarter\\" (cf. Latin caliga, \\"sandal\\").; ; From the last tower of the Wall of Manuel Komnenos to the so-called Prison of Anemas stretches another wall, some 150 m in length, with four square towers. It is probably of later date, and of markedly inferior quality than the Komnenian wall, being less thick and with smaller stones and brick tiles utilized in its construction. It also bears inscriptions commemorating repairs in 1188, 1317 and 1441.; A walled-up postern after the second tower is commonly identified with the Gyrolimne Gate (, pylē tēs Gyrolimnēs), named after the Argyra Limnē, the \\"Silver Lake\\", which stood at the head of the Golden Horn. It probably serviced the Blachernae Palace, as evidenced by its decoration with three imperial busts.; Schneider however suggests that the name could refer rather to the Eğri Kapı. Then comes the outer wall of the Anemas Prison, which connects to a double stretch of walls. The outer wall is known as the Wall of Leo, as it was constructed by Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820) in 813 to safeguard against the siege by the Bulgarian ruler Krum. This wall was then extended to the south by Michael II (r. 820–829).; The wall is a relatively light structure, less than 3 m thick, buttressed by arches which support its parapet and featuring four towers and numerous loopholes. Behind the Leonine Wall lies an inner wall, which was renovated and strengthened by the additions of three particularly fine hexagonal towers by Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842). The two walls stand some 26 m apart and are pierced by a gate each, together comprising the Gate of Blachernae (, porta tōn Blachernōn). The two walls form a fortified enclosure, called the Brachionion or Brachiolion (\\"bracelet\\") of Blachernae () by the Byzantines, and known after the Ottoman capture of the city in Greek as the Pentapyrgion (Πενταπύργιον, \\"Five Towers\\"), in allusion to the Yedikule (Gk. Heptapyrgion) fortress.; ; The inner wall is traditionally identified by scholars like van Millingen and Janin with the Wall of Heraclius, built by Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) after the Avar-Persian siege to enclose and protect the Church of the Blachernitissa.; Schneider however identified it in part with the Pteron (Πτερόν, \\"wing\\"), built at the time of Theodosius II to cover the northern flank of the Blachernae (hence its alternate designation as proteichisma, \\"outwork\\") from the Anemas Prison to the Golden Horn. Consequently, Schneider transferred the identity of the Heraclian Wall on the short stretch of sea wall directly attached to it to its east, which displays a distinct architecture. The identity of the Pteron remains an unresolved question among modern scholars, however. Another, short wall was added in later times, probably in the reign of Theophilos, stretching from the junction of the land and sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both this wall and the gate were demolished in 1868.; ; =Preservation and restoration work on the Land Walls= The land walls run through the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. Sea Walls The only part of walls where walls and sea meet near Yenikapı The seaward walls (, teichē paralia) enclosed the city on the sides of the Sea of Marmara (Propontis) and the gulf of the Golden Horn (). Although the original city of Byzantium certainly had sea walls, traces of which survive, the exact date for the construction of the medieval walls is a matter of debate. Traditionally, the seaward walls have been attributed by scholars to Constantine I, along with the construction of the main land wall. However, the first actual reference to their construction comes in 439, when the urban prefect Cyrus of Panopolis (in sources often confused with the praetorian prefect Constantine) was ordered to repair the city walls and complete them on the seaward side., note 21; This activity is certainly not unconnected to the fact that in the same year, Carthage fell to the Vandals, an event which signaled the emergence of a naval threat in the Mediterranean. This two-phase construction remains the general consensus; Cyril Mango however doubts the existence of any seaward fortifications during Late Antiquity, as they are not specifically mentioned as extant by contemporary sources until much later, around the year 700., note 7; chain that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the İstanbul Archaeology Museums. The Sea Walls were architecturally similar to the Theodosian Walls, but of simpler construction. They were formed by a single wall, considerably lower than the land walls, with inner circuits in the locations of the harbours. Enemy access to the walls facing the Golden Horn was prevented by the presence of a heavy chain or boom, installed by Emperor Leo III (r. 717–741), supported by floating barrels and stretching across the mouth of the inlet. One end of this chain was fastened to the Tower of Eugenius, in the modern suburb of Sirkeci, and the other in Galata, to a large, square tower, the Kastellion, the basement of which was later turned into the Yeraltı (underground) Mosque. At the same time, on the Marmara coast, the city's defence was helped by strong currents, which made an attack by a fleet almost impossible. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, it was for this reason that the Fourth Crusade did not attack the city from this side. During the early centuries of its existence, Constantinople faced few naval threats. Especially after the wars of Justinian, the Mediterranean had again become a \\"Roman lake\\". It was during the first siege of the city by the Avars and the Sasanid Persians that for the first time, a naval engagement was fought off the city itself. However, after the Arab conquests of Syria and Egypt, a new naval threat emerged. In response, the sea walls were renovated in the early 8th century under Tiberios III (r. 698–705) or Anastasios II (r. 713–715). Michael II (r. 820–829) initiated a wide-scale reconstruction, eventually completed by his successor Theophilos (r. 829–842), which increased their height. As these repairs coincided with the capture of Crete by the Saracens, no expense was spared: As Constantine Manasses wrote, \\"the gold coins of the realm were spent as freely as worthless pebbles\\". Theophilos' extensive work, essentially rebuilding the sea walls, is testified to by the numerous inscriptions found or otherwise recorded that bear his name, more than those of any other emperor. Despite future changes and restorations, these walls would essentially protect the city until the end of the empire. The Virgin Mary rising from among the walls of Constantinople. Coin of Michael VIII Palaiologos, commemorating the recapture of Constantinople in 1261. During the siege of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls nonetheless proved to be a weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened by the addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today. The walls were again restored under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and again under his successor Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341), when, on 12 February 1332, a major storm caused breaches in the wall and forced the seaward gates open. In 1351, when the empire was at war with the Genoese, John VI Kantakouzenos again repaired the walls, and even opened a moat in front of the wall facing the Golden Horn. Other repairs are recorded for 1434, again against the Genoese, and again in the years leading up to the final siege and fall of the city to the Ottomans, partly with funds provided by the Despot of Serbia, George Brankovic. =Golden Horn Wall= The wall facing towards the Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, stretched for a total length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during the construction of the railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, and was about 10 metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14 gates and 110 towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained the quarters allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (mitaton) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own wharfs (skalai) beyond the sea walls. The known gates of the Golden Horn wall may be traced in order from the Blachernae eastwards to the Seraglio Point, as follows: The first gate, very near the land walls, was the Koiliomene Gate (, Koiliōmēnē (Kyliomēnē) Porta, \\"Rolled Gate\\"), in Turkish Küçük Ayvansaray Kapısı.; Shortly after stood the Gate of St. Anastasia (, Pylē tēs hagias Anastasias), located near the Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque, hence in Turkish Atik Mustafa Paşa Kapısı. In close proximity on the outer side of the walls lay the Church of St. Nicholas Kanabos, which in 1597–1601 served as the cathedral of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Nike, recovered from the Royal Gates (Balat Kapı). Further down the coast was the gate known in Turkish as Balat Kapı (\\"Palace Gate\\"), preceded in close order by three large archways, which served either as gates to the shore or to a harbour that serviced the imperial palace of Blachernae. Two gates are known to have existed in the vicinity in Byzantine times: the Kynegos Gate (, Pylē tou Kynēgou/tōn Kynēgōn, \\"Gate of the Hunter(s)\\"), whence the quarter behind it was named Kynegion, and the Gate of St. John the Forerunner and Baptist (, Porta tou hagiou Prodromou kai Baptistou), though it is not clear whether the latter was distinct from the Kynegos Gate. The Balat Kapı has been variously identified as one of them, and as one of the three gates on the Golden Horn known as the Imperial Gate (, Pylē Basilikē).; Further south was the Gate of the Phanarion (, Pylē tou Phanariou), Turkish Fener Kapısı, named after the local light-tower (phanarion in Greek), which also gave its name to the local suburb.; The gate also marked the western entrance of the Petrion Fort (, kastron tōn Petriōn), formed by a double stretch of walls between the Gate of the Phanarion and the Petrion Gate (, Pylē tou Petriou), in Turkish Petri Kapısı. According to Byzantine tradition, the area was named thus after Peter the Patrician, a leading minister of Justinian I (r. 527–565). A small gate of the western end of the fort's inner wall, near the Phanarion Gate, led to the city, and was called the Gate of Diplophanarion. It was at the Petrion Gate that the Venetians, under the personal leadership of Doge Enrico Dandolo, scaled the walls and entered the city in the 1204 sack. In the 1453 siege however, an Ottoman attack on the same place was repelled. The next gate, Yeni Ayakapı (\\"New Gate of the Saint\\"), is not Byzantine, unless it replaces an earlier Byzantine entrance. It was constructed by the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan in 1582. Shortly after it lies the older Ayakapı (\\"Gate of the Saint\\"), known in Greek as the St. Theodosia Gate () after the great earby church of St. Theodosia (formerly identified with the Gül Mosque). The next gate is that of Eis Pegas (, Pylē eis Pēgas), known by Latin chroniclers as Porta Puteae or Porta del Pozzo, modern Cibali Kapısı. It was named so because it looked towards the quarter of Pegae (, Pēgai, \\"springs\\") on the other shore of the Golden Horn.; Next was the now-demolished Gate of the Platea (, Porta tēs Plateas) follows, rendered as Porta della Piazza by Italian chroniclers, and called in Turkish Unkapanı Kapısı (\\"Gate of the Flour Depot\\"). It was named after the local quarter of Plate[i]a (\\"broad place\\", signifying the broad shoreline at this place).; The next gate, Ayazma Kapısı (\\"Gate of the Holy Well\\"), is in all probability an Ottoman-era structure. The next gate is the Gate of the Drungaries (, Pylē tōn Droungariōn), modern Odunkapısı (\\"Wood Gate\\"). Its Byzantine name derives from the high official known as the Drungary of the Watch. It marked the western end of the Venetian quarter.; It is followed by the Gate the Forerunner, known as St. John de Cornibus by the Latins, named after a nearby chapel. In Turkish it is known as Zindan Kapısı (\\"Dungeon Gate\\").; The destroyed Gate of the Perama (, Porta tou Peramatos) lay in the suburb of Perama (\\"Crossing\\"), from which the ferry to Pera (Galata) sailed. It marked the eastern limit of the Venetian quarter of the city, and the beginning of the Amalfitan quarter to its east. In Buondelmonti's map, it is labelled Porta Piscaria, on account of the fishmarket that used to be held there, a name that has been preserved in its modern Turkish appellation, Balıkpazarı Kapısı, \\"Gate of the Fish- market\\".; This gate is also identified with the Gate of the Jews (, Hebraïkē Porta), Porta Hebraica in Latin sources, although the same name was apparently applied over time to other gates as well.; In its vicinity was probably also the Gate of St. Mark, which is recorded in a single Venetian document of 1229. Its identity is unclear, as is the question whether the gate, conspicuously named in honour of the patron saint of Venice, was pre-existing or opened after the fall of the city to the Crusaders in 1204. To the east of the Perama Gate was the Hikanatissa Gate (, Porta tēs Hikanatissēs), a name perhaps derived from the imperial tagma of the Hikanatoi. The gate marked the eastern end of the Amalfitan quarter of the city and the western edge of the Pisan quarter.; Further east lay the Gate of the Neorion (, Porta tou Neōriou), recorded as the Horaia Gate (, Pylē Horaia, \\"Beautiful Gate\\") in late Byzantine and Ottoman times. As its names testifies, it led to the leading to the Neorion, the main harbour of ancient Byzantium and the oldest naval arsenal of the city.; In the early Ottoman period, it was known in Turkish as the Çıfıtkapı (\\"Hebrew Gate\\"), but its modern name is Bahçekapı (\\"Garden Gate\\"). The eastern limit of the Pisan quarter was located a bit eastwards of the gate.; The 12th-century Genoese quarter of the city extended from there to the east, and in the documents conferring privileges on them one finds mention of two gates: the Porta Bonu (\\"Gate of Bonus\\", probably transcribed from Greek ), and the Porta Veteris Rectoris (\\"Gate of the old rector\\"). It is very likely that these two names refer to the same gate, probably named after an otherwise unknown rector Bonus, and located somewhere in the modern Sirkeci district.; Finally, the last gate of the Golden Horn wall was the Gate of Eugenius (, Porta tou Eugeniou), leading to the Prosphorion harbour. In close proximity was the 4th-century Tower of Eugenius or Kentenarion, where the great chain that closed the entrance to the Golden Horn was kept and suspended from. The gate was also called Marmaroporta (Μαρμαροπόρτα, \\"Marble Gate\\"), because it was covered in marble, and featured a statue of the Emperor Julian. It is usually identified with the Ottoman Yalıköşkü Kapısı, and was destroyed in 1871.; =Propontis Wall= The Marble Tower, at the junction of the Propontis sea wall and the Theodosian Walls The wall of the Propontis was built almost at the shoreline, with the exception of harbours and quays, and had a height of 12–15 metres, with thirteen gates, and 188 towers. and a total length of almost 8,460 metres, with further 1,080 metres comprising the inner wall of the Vlanga harbour. Several sections of the wall were damaged during the construction of the Kennedy Caddesi coastal road in 1956–57. The wall's proximity to the sea and the strong currents of the Propontis meant that eastern and southern shores of the peninsula were comparatively safe from attack, but conversely, the walls had to be protected against the sea itself: a breakwater of boulders was placed in front of their base, and marble shafts were used as bonds in the walls' base to enhance their structural integrity. From the cape at the edge of the ancient acropolis of the city (modern Sarayburnu, Seraglio Point), south and west to the Marble Tower, the Propontis Wall and its gates went as follows: File:Istanbul Marble Tower 3473.jpgMarble Tower to Right File:Istanbul Marble Tower 3474.jpgMarble Tower from South File:Istanbul Marble Tower 3476.jpgMarble Tower Connecting structure File:Istanbul Marble Tower 3477.jpgMarble Tower Connecting structure File:Istanbul Marble Tower 3479.jpgMarble Tower from Kennedy Caddesi The first gate, now demolished, was the Eastern Gate (, Heōa Pylē) or Gate of St. Barbara (, Pylē tēs martyros Barbaras) after a nearby church, in Turkish Top Kapısı (\\"Gate of the Cannon\\"), from which Topkapı Palace takes its name.; Unique among the seaward gates, it was, like the Golden Gate, flanked by two large towers of white marble, which in 1816 was used to construct the nearby Marble Kiosk of Sultan Mahmud II. Twice it served as the entry-point for an emperor's triumphal return: in 1126, when John II Komnenos returned from the recapture of his ancestral Kastamonu, and in 1168, when Manuel I Komnenos returned from his victorious campaign against Hungary. Next was the gate known in Turkish as Değirmen Kapı (\\"Mill[stone] Gate\\"), whose Byzantine name is unknown. Close by and to its north stood the great Tower of Mangana, which was intended to hold the one end of the chain, planned (but probably never actually installed) by Manuel I Komnenos to close off the Bosphorus, the other end being at a tower erected on the island of the modern Maiden's Tower (Kız Kulesi) off Chrysopolis (modern Üsküdar), known as Damalis (Δάμαλις) or Arkla () in Byzantine times.; The next gate is now known as the Demirkapı (\\"Iron Gate\\"), and is an Ottoman-era structure. A Greek name is not known, and it is not known whether a gate stood there in Byzantine times. Behind these two gates extended the quarter of the Mangana (Μάγγανα, \\"Arsenal\\"), with its numerous monasteries, the most famous of which were those of St. George of Mangana, the Church of Christ Philanthropos, and of the Theotokos Hodegetria, and the Palace of Mangana.; Four small posterns, in two pairs of two, stand at the southern edge of the Mangana quarter, and probably serviced the numerous churches. The names, but not the identity, of two of them have been recorded, the Postern of St. Lazarus (, pylis tou hagiou Lazarou), and the Small Gate of the Hodegetria (, mikra pylē tēs Hodēgētrias), both named after the respective monasteries located near them. It is also probable that one of them is to be identified with the Postern of Michael the Protovestiarios (, parapylis tou Michaēl tou prōtovestiariou).; One of the marble lions flanking the entrance to the harbour of the Bucoleon palace. Further south, at the point where the shore turns westwards, are two further gates, the Balıkhane Kapısı (\\"Gate of the Fish-House\\") and Ahırkapısı (\\"Stable Gate\\"). Their names derive from the buildings inside the Topkapı Palace they led to. Their Byzantine names are unknown. The next gate, on the southeastern corner of the city, was the gate of the imperial Boukoleon Palace, known in Byzantine times as the Gate of the Lion (Gk. Πόρτα Λέοντος, Porta Leontos, in Latin Porta Leonis) after the marble lions that flanked its entrance, as well as Gate of the Bear (, porta tēs arkoudas) after depictions of that animal at the quay. In Turkish it is known as Çatladıkapı (\\"Broken Gate\\").; To the west of the Bucoleon Palace lies the Church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and the first of the harbours of the city's southern shore, that of the Sophiae, named after the wife of Emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) and known originally as the Port of Julian. A small postern is situated in front of the church, while the first larger gate, the Gate of the Sophiae (, Porta tōn Sophiōn) or Iron Gate (, Porta Sidēra), opened to the harbour. In Turkish, it is known as Kadırgalimanı Kapısı, \\"Gate of the Harbour of the Galleys\\".; Next was the Gate of Kontoskalion (), modern Kumkapısı (\\"Sand Gate\\"), which opened to the late Byzantine harbour of the same name, intended to replace the long silted-up Harbour of the Sophiae. The next harbour to the west is the large Harbour of Eleutherius or Theodosius, in the area known as Vlanga. The harbours are now silted up and known as the Langa Bostan park. Immediately before it to the east stands the gate known in Turkish as the Yenikapı (\\"New Gate\\"). A Latin inscription commemorates its repair after the 447 earthquake It is usually identified with the Jewish Gate of late Byzantine times. Immediately to the west after the harbour lies the next gate, Davutpaşa Kapısı (\\"Gate of Davut Pasha\\"), usually identified with the Gate of Saint Aemilianus (, Porta tou hagiou Aimilianou), which is known to have stood at the junction of the sea wall with the city's original Constantinian Wall. That view however is disputed by Janin, as the junction of the walls occurred considerably to the west from the modern gate's location.; Further to the west, where the shoreline turns sharply south, stood the Gate of Psamathia (, Porta tou Psamatha/Psamatheos), modern Samatya Kapısı, leading to the suburb of the same name. Further south and west lies the gate known today as Narlıkapı (\\"Pomegranate Gate\\"). Its Byzantine name is unknown, but is prominent on account of its proximity to the famed Monastery of Stoudios. Garrisons of the city During the whole existence of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison of the city was quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the pedatoura or kerketon) under the urban prefect were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would have to be dealt with by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population, organized in the guilds and the hippodrome factions, would be conscripted and armed, or additional troops would be brought in from the provincial armies. In the early centuries, the imperial guard consisted of the units of the Excubitores and Scholae Palatinae, which by the late 7th century had declined to parade-ground troops. At about that time Justinian II established the first new guards units to protect the imperial palace precinct, while in the 8th century the emperors, faced with successive revolts by the thematic armies and pursuing deeply unpopular iconoclastic policies, established the imperial tagmata as an elite force loyal to them. As the tagmata were often used to form the core of imperial expeditionary armies, they were not always present in or near the city. Only two of them, the Noumeroi and the Teicheiōtai, the palace guard units established by Justinian II, remained permanently stationed in Constantinople, garrisoned around the palace district or in various locations, such as disused churches, in the capital. The units present in the city at any one time were thus never very numerous, numbering a few thousands at best, but they were complemented by several detachments stationed around the capital, in Thrace and Bithynia. The small size of the city's garrison was due to the uneasiness of emperors and populace alike towards a permanent large military force, both for fear of a military uprising and because of the considerable financial burden its maintenance would entail. Furthermore, a large force was largely unnecessary, because of the inherent security provided by the city walls themselves. As historian John Haldon notes, \\"providing the gates were secured and the defenses provided with a skeleton force, the City was safe against even very large forces in the pre-gunpowder period.\\" Fortifications around Constantinople =Anastasian Wall= The oldest surviving map of Constantinople, by Cristoforo Buondelmonti, dated to 1422. The fortifications of Constantinople and of Galata, at the northern shore of the Golden Horn, are prominently featured. The water trench in front of the Theodosian walls at the western end of the city is also depicted, as well as the Maiden's Tower in the middle of the Bosporus. Several fortifications were built at various periods in the vicinity of Constantinople, forming part of its defensive system. The first and greatest of these is the 56 km long Anastasian Wall (Gk. , teichos Anastasiakon) or Long Wall (, makron teichos, or , megalē Souda), built in the mid-5th century as an outer defence to Constantinople, some 65 km westwards of the city. It was 3.30 m thick and over 5 m high, but its effectiveness was apparently limited, and it was abandoned at some time in the 7th century for want of resources to maintain and men to garrison it. For centuries thereafter, its materials were used in local buildings, but several parts, especially in the remoter central and northern sections, are still extant.The Anastasian Wall Project In addition, between the Anastasian Wall and the city itself, there were several small towns and fortresses like Selymbria, Region or the great suburb of Hebdomon (\\"Seventh\\", modern Bakırköy, so named from its distance of seven Roman miles from the Milion, the city's mile-marker), the site of major military encampments. Beyond the Long Walls, the towns of Bizye and Arcadiopolis covered the northern approaches. These localities were strategically situated along the main routes to the city, and formed the outer defenses of Constantinople throughout its history, serving to muster forces, confront enemy invasions or at least buy time for the capital's defenses to be brought in order. It is notable that during the final Ottoman siege, several of them, such as Selymbria, surrendered only after the fall of Constantinople itself. In Asia Minor, their role was mirrored by the cities of Nicaea and Nicomedia, and the large field camp at Malagina. =Walls of Galata= Galata, then the suburb of Sykai, was an integral part of the city by the early 5th century: the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae of ca. 425 names it as the city's 13th region. It was probably fortified with walls in the 5th century, and under Justinian I it was granted the status of a city. The settlement declined and disappeared after the 7th century, leaving only the great tower (the kastellion tou Galatou) in modern Karaköy, that guarded the chain extending across the mouth of the Golden Horn. After the sack of the city in 1204, Galata became a Venetian quarter, and later a Genoese extraterritorial colony, effectively outside Byzantine control. Despite Byzantine opposition, the Genoese managed to surround their quarter with a moat, and by joining their castle-like houses with walls they created the first wall around the colony. The Galata Tower, then called Christea Turris (\\"Tower of Christ\\"), and another stretch of walls to its north were built in 1349. Further expansions followed in 1387, 1397 and 1404, enclosing an area larger than that originally allocated to them, stretching from the modern district of Azapkapı north to Şişhane, from there to Tophane and thence to Karaköy.Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism article on the city during the Byzantine period After the Ottoman conquest, the walls were maintained until the 1870s, when most were demolished to facilitate the expansion of the city. Today only the Galata Tower, visible from most of historical Constantinople, remains intact, along with several smaller fragments. =Anadolu and Rumeli fortresses= The Rumelihisarı Fortress, seen from the Bosphorus The twin forts of Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı lie to the north of Istanbul, at the narrowest point of the Bosphorus. They were built by the Ottomans to control this strategically vital waterway in preparation for their final assault on Constantinople. Anadoluhisarı (Turkish for \\"Fortress of Anatolia\\"), also called Akçehisar and Güzelcehisar (\\"beautiful fortress\\") in earlier times, was constructed by Sultan Bayezid I in 1394, and initially consisted of just a 25 m high, roughly pentagonal watchtower surrounded by a wall. The much larger and more elaborate Rumelihisarı (\\"Fortress of Rumeli\\") was built by Sultan Mehmed II in just over four months in 1452. It consists of three large and one small towers, connected by a wall reinforced with 13 small watchtowers. When seen from a bird's eye view, the walls and the towers are placed accordingly to write Muhammad in Arabic letters. With cannons mounted on its main towers, the fort gave the Ottomans complete control of the passage of ships through Bosphorus, a role evoked clearly in its original name, Boğazkesen (\\"cutter of the strait\\"). After the conquest of Constantinople, it served as a customs checkpoint and a prison, notably for the embassies of states that were at war with the Empire. After suffering extensive damage in the 1509 earthquake, it was repaired, and was used continuously until the late 19th century.

The crown-of-thorns starfish receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface, resembling the biblical crown of thorns. It is one of the largest starfish in the world. A. planci has a very wide Indo-Pacific distribution. It is perhaps most common in Australia, but can occur at tropical and subtropical latitudes from the Red Sea and the east African coast across the Indian Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Central America. It occurs where coral reefs or hard coral communities occur in this region. Description Unusual brightly coloured crown-of-thorns starfish, Thailand The body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish, with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, prehensile, and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass. Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins its life cycle with this symmetry. The animal has true image forming vision. Adult crown-of-thorns starfish normally range in size from .Carpenter, R.C. (1997) Invertebrate Predators and Grazers\\" In: C. Birkeland, Life and death of coral reefs, Springer. . They have up to 23 arms. Although the body of the crown of thorns has a stiff appearance, it is able to bend and twist to fit around the contours of the corals on which it feeds. The underside of each arm has a series of closely fitting plates which form a groove and extend in rows to the mouth.\\"Crown of Thorns Starfish (Acanthaster Planci).\\" Crown of Thorns Starfish Videos, Photos and Facts. Web. 5 November 2014. . They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colors in some parts of their wide range. The long, sharp spines on the sides of the starfish's arms and upper (aboral) surface resemble thorns and create a crown-like shape, giving the creature its name. The spines are stiff and very sharp, and readily pierce through soft surfaces. Despite the battery of sharp spines on the aboral surface and blunt spines on the oral surface, the crown-of-thorns starfish's general body surface is membranous and soft. When the starfish is removed from the water, the body surface ruptures and the body fluid leaks out, so the body collapses and flattens. The spines bend over and flatten, as well. They recover their shape when reimmersed, if they are still alive. Taxonomy =Family= The family Acanthasteridae is monogeneric; its position within the Asteroides is unsettled. It is generally recognized as a distinctly isolated taxon. Recently, Blake concluded from comparative morphology studies of Acanthaster planci that it has strong similarities with various members of the Oreasteridae. He transferred Acanthasteridae from the Spinulosida to the Valvatida and assigned it a position near to the Oreasteridae, from which it appears to be derived. He attributed Acanthaster morphology as possibly evolving in association with its locomotion over irregular coral surfaces in higher energy environments. There is a complication, however, in that Acanthaster is not a monospecific genus and any consideration of the genus must also take into account another species, Acanthaster brevispinus, which lives in a completely different environment. A. brevispinus lives on soft substrates, perhaps buried in the substrate at times like other soft substrate-inhabiting starfish, at moderate depths where presumably the surface is regular and there is little wave action. =Genus and species= Short- spined form from Gulf of California - live specimen Acanthaster planci has a long history in the scientific literature with great confusion in the generic and species names from the outset, with a long list of complex synonyms. Georg Eberhard Rhumphius first described it in 1705, naming it Stella marina quindecium radiotorum. Later, Carl Linnaeus described it as Asterias planci based on an illustration by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743), when he introduced his system of binomial nomenclature. No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant. Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included Stellonia, Echinaster and Echinites, before settling on Acanthaster (Gervais 1841). Species names included echintes, solaris, mauritensis, ellisii, and ellisii pseudoplanci (with subspecies). Most of these names arose from confusion in the historical literature, but Acanthaster ellisii came to be used for the distinctive starfish in the eastern Pacific Gulf of California. The eastern Pacific Acanthaster is very distinctive (see image to the right) with its rather 'plump' body, large disk to total diameter ratio and short, blunt spines. It gives the impression of living in a habitat where having sharp defenses against predators has little value, although it lives on coral reef and feeds on coral. =Genetic studies= Nishida and Lucas examined variation at 14 allozyme loci of ten population samples of A. planci using starch-gel electrophoresis. The samples were from localities across the Pacific: Ryukyu archipelago (four locations), Micronesia (two locations), and samples from one location each of the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, Hawaii, and Gulf of California. A sample of 10 specimens of A. brevispinus from the Great Barrier Reef region was included for comparison. There was considerable genetic differentiation between the A. brevispinus and A. planci populations (D= 0.20 +/− 0.02)(D is genetic distance). The genetic differences between geographic populations of A. planci were, however, small (D = 0.03 +/− 0.00; Fsr = 0.07 + 0.02) (Fsr is standardized genetic variance for each polymorphic locus) despite the great distances separating them. A positive correlation was observed between degree of genetic differentiation and geographic distance, suggesting the genetic homogeneity among A. planci populations is due to gene flow by planktonic larval dispersion. The distance effect on genetic differentiation most probably reflects decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances. In view of the level of macrogeographic homogeneity, significant allele frequency differences were observed between adjacent populations separated by approximately 10 km. The Hawaiian population was most differentiated from other populations. Treating the morphologically distinctive, eastern Pacific Acanthaster as a separate species, A. ellisii, is not supported by these data. The lack of unique alleles in the central (Hawaii) and eastern Pacific (Gulf of California) populations suggests they were derived from those in the western Pacific. Further details of the genetic relationship between A. planci and Acanthaster brevispinus are presented in the entry for the latter species. These are clearly sibling species and it is suggested that A. planci, the specialized coral-feeding species arose from A. brevispinus, the less specialized soft-bottom inhabitant. In a very comprehensive geographic study, Benzie examined allozyme loci variation in 20 populations of A. planci, throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The most striking result was a very marked discontinuity between the Indian and Pacific Ocean populations. Those, however, off northern Western Australia had a strong Pacific affinity. With the exception of the very strong connection of southern Japanese populations to the Great Barrier Reef populations, the patterns of variation within regions were consistent with isolation by distance. Again, the pattern of decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances is apparent. Benzie suggests that the divergence between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean populations began at least 1.6 million years ago and is likely to reflect responses to changes in climate and sea level. A more recent comprehensive geographic study of A. planci by Vogler et al., using DNA analyses (one mitochondrial gene), suggests it is actually a species complex consisting of four species or clades. The four cryptic species/clades are defined geographically: northern Indian Ocean, southern Indian Ocean, Red Sea and Pacific Ocean. These molecular data suggest the species/clades diverged 1.95 and 3.65 million years ago. (The divergence of A. planci and A. brevispinus is not included in this time-scale.) The authors suggest the differences between the four putative species in behavior, diet or habitat may be important for the design of appropriate reef conservation strategies. There are, however, problems with this proposal of cryptic speciation (cryptic species). The basis of these data from one mitochondrial gene. mtDNA data are, however, only one source of information about the status of taxa and the use of one mtDNA gene as a sole criterion for species identification is disputed. The allozyme data should also be taken into account. Three localities that were sampled by Vogler et al. are of particular interest: Palau Sebibu, UEA and Oman were found to have two clades/sibling species in sympatry. These are important to investigate the nature of the co-existence and barriers to introgression of genetic material. A. planci as a taxon is a generalist, being amongst the most ubiquitous of large coral predators on coral reefs, feeding on virtually all hard coral species, reproducing during summer without a pattern of spawning and often participating in mass multi-species spawnings, and releasing vast amounts of gametes that trigger spawning in other individuals. It is very difficult to conceive of two species/clades of A. planci in sympatry without habitat competition and introgression of genetic material, especially the latter. Biology =Toxins= Image:COTS aboral surface.jpgBroken and regenerating spines Image: Crown-of-thorns spining.JPGSwollen right hand after having been punctured Image:Acanthaster planci saponins.JPGFrothing in water containing A. planci Image:COTS held out of water.jpgStarfish handled to avoid damaging it (spines on the underside are blunt) Starfish are characterized by having saponins known as asterosaponins in their tissues. They contain a mix of these saponins, and at least 15 chemical studies have been conducted seeking to characterize these saponins. The saponins have detergent-like properties, and keeping starfish in limited water volumes with aeration results in large amounts of foam at the surface. A. planci has no mechanism for injecting the toxin, but as the spines perforate tissue of a predator or unwary person, tissue containing the saponins is lost into the wound. In humans, this immediately causes a sharp, stinging pain that can last for several hours, persistent bleeding due to the haemolytic effect of saponins, and nausea and tissue swelling that may persist for a week or more. The spines, which are brittle, may also break off and become embedded in the tissue where they must be removed surgically. Saponins seem to occur throughout the lifecycle of the crown-of-thorns starfish. The saponins in the eggs are similar to those in the adult tissues, and presumably these carry over to the larvae. The mouthing behaviour of predators of juvenile starfish with rejection suggests the juveniles contain saponins. =Behavior= Image:Cryptic juveniles.JPGJuveniles concealed under coral rubble Image:COTS and coral scars - excellent.jpgTwo starfish feeding on a coral, leaving white feeding scars Image:COTS feeding on Acropora.JPGFeeding on branching Acropora coral Image:COTS on Acropora.JPGStarfish 'competing' for remaining live coral The adult crown-of-thorns is a corallivorous predator that usually preys on reef coral polyps. It climbs onto a section of living coral colony using the large number of tube feet on its oral surface and flexible body. It fits closely to the surface of the coral, even the complex surfaces of branching corals. It then extrudes its stomach out through its mouth over the surface to virtually its own diameter. The stomach surface secretes digestive enzymes that allow the starfish to absorb nutrients from the liquefied coral tissue. This leaves a white scar of coral skeleton which is rapidly infested with filamentous algae. An individual starfish can consume up to of living coral reef per year. In a study of feeding rates on two coral reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef region, large starfish (40 cm and greater diameter) killed about 61 cm2/day in winter and 357–478 cm2/day in summer. Smaller starfish, 20–39 cm, killed 155 and 234 cm2/day in the equivalent seasons. The area killed by the large starfish is equivalent to about from these observations. Differences in feeding and locomotion rates between summer and winter reflect the fact that the crown-of-thorns, like all marine invertebrates, is a poikilotherm whose body temperature and metabolic rate are directly affected by the temperature of the surrounding water. In tropical coral reefs, crown-of-thorns specimens reach mean locomotion rates of 35 cm/min, which explains how outbreaks can damage large reef areas in relatively short periods. The starfish show preferences between the hard corals on which they feed. They tend to feed on branching corals and table- like corals, such as Acropora species, rather than on more rounded corals with less exposed surface area, such as Porites species. Avoidance of Porites and some other corals may also be due to resident bivalve mollusks and polychaete worms in the surface of the coral which discourage the starfish. Similarly, some symbionts, such as small crabs, living within the complex structures of branching corals, may ward off the starfish as it seeks to spread its stomach over the coral surface. In reef areas of low densities of hard coral, reflecting the nature of the reef community or due to feeding by high density crown-of-thorns, the starfish may be found feeding on soft corals (Alcyonacea). The starfish are cryptic in behavior during their first two years, emerging at night to feed. They usually remain so as adults when solitary. The only evidence of a hidden individual may be white feeding scars on adjacent coral. However, their behavior changes under two circumstances: * During the breeding season, which is typically during early to midsummer, the starfish may gather together high on a reef and synchronously release gametes to achieve high levels of egg fertilization. This pattern of synchronized spawning is not at all unique, but it is very common amongst marine invertebrates that do not copulate. Solitary spawning gives no opportunity for fertilization of eggs and wastes gametes and evidence exists of a spawning pheromone that causes the starfish to aggregate and release gametes synchronously. * When the starfish are at high densities, they may move day and night, competing for living coral. =Predators= A Triton's trumpet (Charonia tritonis), one of the main predators of A. planci. The elongated sharp spines covering nearly the entire upper surface of the crown-of-thorns serve as a mechanical defense against large predators. It also has a chemical defense. Saponins presumably serve as an irritant when the spines pierce a predator, in the same way as they do when they pierce the skin of humans. Saponins have an unpleasant taste. A study to test the predation rate on juvenile Acanthaster by appropriate fish species found that the starfish were often mouthed, tasted, and rejected. These defenses tend to make it an unattractive target for coral community predators. In spite of this, however, Acanthaster populations are typically composed of a proportion of individuals with regenerating arms. A variety of about 11 species have been reported to prey occasionally on uninjured and healthy adults of A. planci. All of these are generalist feeders and none of these, however, seems to specifically prefer the starfish as a food source. This number, however, is probably lower, as some of these presumed predators have not been witnessed reliably in the field. Some of those witnessed are: * A species of pufferfish and two triggerfish have been observed to feed on crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, and, although they may have some effect on the A. planci population, no evidence exists of systematic predation. In the indo-pacific waters, white- spotted puffers, and Titan triggerfish have also been found to eat COTS.COTS predators * The Triton's trumpet, a very large gastropod mollusk, is a known predator of Acanthaster in some parts of the starfish's range. The triton has been described as tearing the starfish to pieces with its file-like radula. * The small painted shrimp Hymenocera picta, a general predator of starfish, has been found to prey on A. planci at some locations. A polychaete worm, Pherecardia striata, was observed to be feeding on the starfish together with the shrimp on an east Pacific coral reef. About 0.6% of the starfish in the reef population were being attacked by both the shrimp and polychaete worm, killing the starfish in about a week. Glynn suggested this resulted in a balance between mortality and recruitment in this population, leading to a relatively stable population of starfish. * Since P. striata can only attack a damaged A. planci and cause its death, it may be regarded as an 'impatient scavenger' rather than a predator. As distinct from predators, dead and mutilated adults of A. planci attract a number of scavengers. Glynn lists two polychaete worms, a hermit crab, a sea urchin, and seven species of small reef fish. Apparently, they are able to tolerate the distasteful saponins for an easy meal. * A large polyp-like creature of the cnidarian genus Pseudocorynactis was observed attacking, and then wholly ingesting a crown-of- thorns starfish of similar size. Continued studies revealed this polyp is able to completely ingest a crown-of-thorns specimen of up to in diameter.

The ripe ovaries and testes are readily distinguished with the former being more yellow and having larger lobes. In section they are very different with the ovaries densely filled with nutrient-packed ova (see ovum and photograph) and the testes densely filled with sperm, which consist of little more than a nucleus and flagellum. Fecundity in female Crown-of-thorns starfish is related to size with large starfish committing proportionally more energy into ova production such that a: * 200 mm diameter female produces 0.5–2.5 million eggs representing 2–8% of its wet weight * 300 mm diameter female produces 6.5–14 million eggs representing 9–14% of its wet weight * 400 mm diameter female produces 47–53 million eggs representing 20–25% of its wet weight In coral reefs in the Philippines, female specimens were found with a gonadosomatic index (ratio of gonad mass to body mass) as high as 22%, which underlines the high fecundity of this starfish. Babcock et al. (1993) monitored changes in fecundity and fertility (fertilisation rate) over the spawning season of the Crown-of-thorns starfish on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, from 1990 to 1992. The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January. However, both gonadosomatic index and fertility peaked early and declined to low levels by late January, indicating that most successful reproductive events took place early in the spawning season. In northern hemisphere coral reefs however, crown-of-thorns populations reproduce in April and May, and were also observed spawning in the Gulf of Thailand in September. High rates of egg fertilisation may be achieved through the behaviour of proximate and synchronised spawning (see above in Behaviour). Embryonic development begins about 1.5 hours after fertilisation, with the early cell divisions (cleavage) (photograph). By 8–9 hours it has reached the 64-cell stage. There is molecular and histological evidence suggesting the occurrence of hermaphroditism in Acanthaster cf. solaris. =Larval stages= File:Bipinnaria of starfish.JPGBipinnaria larva File:SEM bipinnaria.JPGSEM of bipinnaria larva File:Early starfish brachiolaria.jpgBrachiolaria larva File:Late starfish brachiolaria.JPGLate brachiolaria with starfish primordium File:Brachiolarian arms.JPGSEM brachiolarian arms By Day 1 the embryo has hatched as a ciliated gastrula stage (photograph). By Day 2 the gut is complete and the larva is now known as a bipinnaria (photographs). It has ciliated bands along the body and uses these to swim and filter feed on microscopic particles, particularly unicellular green flagellates (phytoplankton). The SEM photograph is a scanning electron micrograph, which clearly shows the complex ciliated bands of the bipinnaria larva. By Day 5 it is an early brachiolaria larva. The arms of the bipinnaria have further elongated, there are two stump-like projections in the anterior (not evident in the photograph) and structures are developing within the posterior of the larva. In the late brachiolaria larva (Day 11)(photograph) the larval arms are elongate and there are three distinctive arms at the anterior with small structures on their inner surfaces (photographs). To this stage the larva has been virtually transparent, but the posterior section is now opaque with the initial development of a starfish. The late brachiolaria is 1-1.5 mm. It tends to sink to the bottom and test the substrate with its brachiolar arms, including flexing the anterior body to orient the brachiolar arms against the substrate. This description and assessment of optimum rate of development is based on early studies in the laboratory under attempted optimum conditions. However, not unexpectedly, there are large differences in growth rate and survival under various environmental conditions (see Causes of population outbreaks). =Metamorphosis, development and growth= File:Settling starfish brachiolaria.JPGSettling brachiolaria larva File:Post-metamorphosis juvenile starfish.JPG5-armed juvenile starfish immediately after metamorphosis File:Coralline algae feeding juvenile COTS.jpgEarly juvenile starfish feeding on coralline algae (=> white feeding scars) File:Early coral- feeding COTS 1.JPGVery young coral-feeding juvenile with full set of arms and madreporites File:Early coral-feeding COTS.JPGYoung coral-feeding juvenile The late brachiolaria search substrates with their arms and, when offered a choice of substrates, tend to settle on coralline algae, which they will subsequently feed on. In the classic pattern for echinoderms, the bilaterally symmetrical larva is replaced by a pentamerously symmetrical stage at metamorphosis, with the latter's body axis bearing no relationship to that of the larva. Thus the newly metamorphosed starfish are five-armed and are 0.4–1 mm diameter. (Note the size of the tube feet relative to the size of the animal.) They feed on the thin coating layers of hard encrusting algae (coralline algae) on the undersides of dead coral rubble and other concealed surfaces. They extend their stomach over the surface of the encrusting algae and digest the tissue, as in the feeding by larger crown-of-thorns starfish on hard corals. The living tissue of the encrusting algae is approximately pink to dark red and feeding by these early juveniles results in white scars on the surface of the algae (photograph). During the next months, the juveniles grow and add arms and associated madreporites in the pattern described by Yamaguchi until the adult numbers is attained 5–7 months after metamorphosis. Two hard corals with small polyps, Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora acunimata, were included in the aquaria with the encrusting algae and at about the time the juvenile starfish achieved their full number of arms they began feeding on the corals. Juvenile A. planci that had reached the stage of feeding on coral were then reared for some years in the same large closed-circuit seawater system that was used for the early juveniles. They were moved to larger tanks and kept supplied with coral so that food was not a limiting factor on growth rate. The growth curves of size versus age were sigmoidal, as seen in majority marine invertebrates. There was an initial period of relatively slow growth while the starfish were feeding on coralline algae. This was followed by a phase of rapid growth which led to sexual maturity at the end of the second year. The starfish were in the vicinity of 200 mm diameter at this stage. They continued to grow rapidly and were in the order of 300 and tended to decline after 4 years. Gonad development was greater in the third and subsequent years than at 2 years and there was a seasonal pattern of gametogenesis and spawning with water temperature being the only apparent cue in the indoor aquarium. Most specimens of A. planci died from 'senility' during the period 5–7.5 years, i.e. they fed poorly and shrank. =Field observations of life-cycle= The data above are derived from laboratory studies of A. planci, which are much more readily obtained than equivalent data from the field. The laboratory observations, however, accord with the limited field observations of life- cycle. As in laboratory studies where A. planci larvae were found to select coralline algae for settlement, early juveniles (<20 mm diameter) were found on subtidal coralline algae (Porolithon onkodes) on the windward reef front of Suva Reef (Fiji). The juveniles were found in a variety of habitats where they were highly concealed: under coral blocks and rubble in the boulder zone of the exposed reef front; on dead bases of Acropora species in more sheltered areas; in narrow spaces within the reef crest; and on the fore-reef slope to depths of 8 m. Growth rates on Suva Reef were found to be 2.6, 16.7 and 5.3 mm/month increase in diameter in the pre-coral feeding, early coral feeding and adult phases, respectively. This is in accord with the sigmoidal pattern of size versus age observed in laboratory studies, i.e. slow initial growth, a phase of very rapid growth beginning at coral feeding and tapering off of growth after the starfish reaches sexual maturity. In reefs in the Philippines, female and male specimens matured at 13 and 16 cm respectively. Stump identified bands in the upper surface spines of A. planci and attributed these to annual growth bands. He didn't report growth rates based on these age determinations, and mark and recapture data, but he reported that the growth bands revealed 12+ year-old starfish: much older than those that became 'senile' and died in the laboratory. In a small number of field studies, mortality rates of juvenile A. planci have to found to be very high, e.g. 6.5% per day for month-old and 0.45% per day for 7-month-old. Most of the mortality comes from predators, such as small crabs, that occur in and on the substrate with the juveniles. It is possible, however, that these rates may not reflect mortality over the range of habitats occupied by small juveniles. Ecology =Ecological impact on reefs= Coral before A. planci predation Filamentous algae encrusting coral skeletons after A. planci predation Collapsed coral skeletons after A. planci predation and storm Popular anxiety to news of high densities of A. planci on the Great Barrier Reef was reflected in many newspaper reports and publications such as 'Requiem for the Reef', which also suggested that there was a cover-up of the extent of damage. There was a popular idea that the coral and with it whole reefs were being destroyed by the starfish. In fact, as described above, the starfish preys on coral by digesting the surface of living tissue from the coral skeletons. These skeletons persist, together with the mass of coralline algae that is essential for reef integrity. The initial change (first order effect) is loss of the veneer of living coral tissue. A. planci is a component of the fauna of most coral reefs and the effects of A. planci populations on coral reefs are very dependent on the population density. At low densities (1 to perhaps 30/hectare) the rate at which coral is being preyed upon by the starfish, is less than the growth rate of the coral, i.e. the surface area of living coral is increasing. The starfish may, however, influence the coral community structure. Because the starfish don't feed indiscriminately they may cause a distribution of coral species and colony sizes that differs from a pattern without them. This is evident by comparison of coral reefs where A. planci hasn't been found to the more typical reefs with A. planci. Some ecologists suggest that the starfish has an important and active role in maintaining coral reef biodiversity, driving ecological succession. Before overpopulation became a significant issue, crown-of-thorns prevented fast-growing coral from overpowering the slower growing coral varieties. At high densities ('outbreaks', 'plagues'), which may be defined as when the starfish are too abundant for the coral food supply, coral cover goes into decline. The starfish must broaden their diet from their preferred species, colony size and shape. The starfish often aggregate during feeding, even at low densities, but during high densities the cleared coral patches become almost continuous or completely continuous (photograph). There are second-order effects of these large areas of predated coral. * The bare coral skeletons are rapidly colonised by filamentous algae (photograph) * Large stands of staghorn coral, Acropora species, may collapse and become rubble reducing the topographical complexity of the reef (photograph) * Sometimes the predated surfaces are further invaded by macroalgae, soft coral and sponges. These tend to take over reef surfaces for long periods as alternatives to hard coral communities, as, once established, they limit recruitment by hard coral larvae. Aesthetically, in all the above cases, the reef surface is not as attractive as the living coral surface, but it is anything but dead. There is a third-order effect potentially arising from the invasion by filamentous algae. Animals that depend directly or indirectly on hard corals, e.g. for shelter and food, should lose out, and herbivores and less specialist feeders gain. It would be expected that this would be most conspicuous in the fish fauna and long-terms studies of coral reef fish communities confirm this expectation. =Population outbreaks= Outbreak in French Polynesia Large populations of crown-of-thorns starfish (sometime emotively known as 'plagues') have been substantiated as occurring at twenty one locations of coral reefs during the 1960s to 1980s. These locations ranged from the Red Sea through the tropical Indo-Pacific region to French Polynesia. There were at least two substantiated repeated outbreaks at ten of these locations. Values of starfish density from 140/ha to 1,000/ha have been considered in various reports to be outbreak populations, while starfish densities less than 100/ha have been considered to be low; however, at densities below 100/ha there may be feeding by A. planci that exceeds the growth of coral and there is net loss of coral. From the surveys of many reef locations throughout the starfish's distribution large abundances of Acanthaster can be categorised as: * Primary outbreaks where there are abrupt population increases of at least two magnitudes that cannot be explained by the presence of a previous outbreak. * Secondary outbreaks that can plausibly be related to previous outbreaks through the reproduction of a previous cohort of the starfish. These may appear as recruits to reefs down current from an existing outbreak population. * Chronic situations where there is a persistent moderate to high density population at a reef location where the coral is sparse due to persistent feeding by the starfish. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the most outstanding coral reef system in the world because of its great length, number of individual reefs and species diversity. When high densities of Acanthaster which were causing heavy mortality of coral were first seen about Green Island, off Cairns, in 1960–65, there was considerable alarm. High-density populations were subsequently found of a number of reefs to the south of Green Island, in the Central Great Barrier Reef region Some popular publications, with names such as Requiem for the Reef and Crown of Thorns: The Death of the Barrier Reef?, suggested that the whole Reef was in danger of dying, and they influenced and reflected some public alarm over the state and future of Great Barrier Reef. There have been a number of studies modeling the population outbreaks on the GBR as a means to understand the phenomenon. The Australian and Queensland governments funded research and set up advisory committees during the period of great anxiety about the nature of the starfish outbreaks on the GBR. They were regarded as not coming to terms with the unprecedented nature and magnitude of this problem. Many scientists were criticised for not being able to give definitive but unsubstantiated answers. Others were more definitive in their answers. Scientists were criticised for their reticence and for disagreeing on the nature and causes of the outbreaks on the GBR, sometimes described as the \\"starfish wars\\".Starfish Wars (the name is a play on Star Wars), 1986 Melbourne, Robert Raymond =Causes of population outbreaks= There was serious discussion and some strongly held views about the causes of this phenomenon. Some hypotheses focused on changes in the survival of juvenile and adult starfish—the \\"predator removal hypothesis\\": * over-collecting of tritons, a predator of the starfish * overfishing of predators of the starfish * decline in predator populations through habitat destruction * warmer sea temperatures enhance larvae development * anthropogenic impacts, such as allochthonous nutrient input Many of the reports of fish preying on Acanthaster are single observations or presumed predation from the nature of the fish. For example, the humphead wrasse may prey on the starfish amongst its more usual diet. Individual puffer fish and trigger-fish have been observed to feed crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, but there is no evidence that they are a significant factor in population control. A study, however, based on the stomach contents of large carnivorous fish that are potential predators of the starfish found no evidence of the starfish in the fish's guts. These carnivorous fish were caught commercially on the coral reefs on the Gulf of Oman and examined at local fish markets. One problem with the concept of predators of large juvenile and adult starfish causing total mortality is that the starfish have good regenerative powers and they wouldn't keep still while being eaten. Also, they would need to be consumed completely or almost completely to die. 17–60% of starfish in various populations had missing or regenerating arms. Clearly the starfish experience various levels of sublethal predation. When the damage includes a major section of the disk together with arms, the number of arms regenerating on the disk may be less than the number lost. Another hypothesis is the \\"aggregation hypothesis\\", whereby large aggregations of A. planci appear as apparent outbreaks because they have consumed all the adjacent coral. This seems to imply that there is apparently a dense population outbreak when there has already been a more diffuse population outbreak that has been dense enough to comprehensively prey on large areas of hard coral. Female crown-of-thorns starfish are very fecund. Based on the eggs in ovaries, 200, 300 and 400 mm diameter females potentially spawn approximately 4, 30 and 50 million eggs, respectively (see also Gametes and embryos). Lucas adopted a different approach, focusing on the survival of the larvae arising from the eggs. The rationale for this approach was that small changes in the survival of larvae and developmental stages would result in very large changes in the adult population. Considering two hypothetical situations. Twenty million eggs from a female spawning, having a survival rate of about 0.00000001% throughout development, would replace two adult starfish in a low-density population where the larvae recruit. If, however, the survival rate increases to 0.1% (one in a thousand) throughout development from one spawning of 20 million eggs this would result in 20,000 adult starfish where the larvae have recruited. Since the larvae are the most abundant stages of development it is likely that changes in survival will be most importance during this phase of development. Temperature and salinity have little effect on the survival of crown-of-thorns larvae. However, abundance and species of the particular component of phytoplankton (unicellular flagellates) on which the larvae feed has a profound effect on survival and rate of growth. The abundance of phytoplankton cells is especially important. As autotrophs, phytoplankton abundance is strongly influenced by the concentration of inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogenous compounds. Birkeland had observed a correlation between the abundance of crown-of-thorns on reefs adjacent to land masses. These occurred on mainland islands as distinct from coral atolls about three years after heavy rainfall that followed a period of drought. He suggested that runoff from such heavy rainfall may stimulate phytoplankton blooms of sufficient size to produce enough food for the larvae of A. planci through input of nutrients. Combining Birkeland observations with the influence of inorganic nutrients on survival of the starfish larvae in experimental studies gave support for a mechanism for starfish outbreaks: increased terrestrial runoff → increased nutrients denser phytoplankton↑→ better larval survival → increased starfish populations There have been further conformations of these connections, however research by Olson (1987), Kaufmann (2002), and Byrne (2016) suggests terrestrial runoff has little or no impact on larval survival. The conflicting data describing the negligible role of terrestrial agricultural runoff has been described as \\"an inconvenient study\\". There is also a flow-on effect in that where there are large starfish populations producing large numbers of larvae, there is likely to be heavy recruitment on reefs downstream to which the larvae are carried and then settle. Population control Blue Acanthaster planci in Balicasag Island (Philippines) Population numbers for the crown-of-thorns have been increasing since the 1970s.Scientists: To save Great Barrier Reef, kill starfish. CNN News. October 2, 2012 However, historic records of distribution patterns and numbers are hard to come by, as SCUBA technology, necessary to conduct population censuses, had only been developed in the previous few decades. To prevent overpopulation of crown-of-thorns causing widespread destruction to coral reef habitats, humans have implemented a variety of control measures. Manual removals have been successful, but are relatively labour-intensive. Injecting sodium bisulphate into the starfish is the most efficient measure in practice. Sodium bisulphate is deadly to crown-of-thorns, but it does not harm the surrounding reef and oceanic ecosystems. To control areas of high infestations, teams of divers have had kill rates of up to 120 per hour per diver. The practice of dismembering them was shown to have a kill rate of 12 per hour per diver and the diver performing this test was spiked three times. Therefore, it is for this reason and not rumours that they might be able to regenerate that dismembering is not recommended. An even more labour-intensive route, but less risky to the diver, is to bury them under rocks or debris. This route is only suitable for areas with low infestation and if materials are available to perform the procedure without damaging corals. A 2015 study by James Cook University showed that common household vinegar is also effective, as the acidity causes the starfish to disintegrate within days. Vinegar is also harmless to the environment, and is not restricted by regulations regarding animal products such as bile. In 2019, divers were using a 10% vinegar solution to reduce starfish populations in the Raja Ampat Islands. A new successful method of population control is by the injection of thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS). Only one injection is needed, leading to the organism's death in 24 hours from a contagious disease marked by \\"discoloured and necrotic skin, ulcerations, loss of body turgor, accumulation of colourless mucus on many spines especially at their tip, and loss of spines. Blisters on the dorsal integument broke through the skin surface and resulted in large, open sores that exposed the internal organs.\\" An autonomous starfish-killing robot called COTSBot has been developed and as of September 2015 was close to being ready for trials on the Great Barrier Reef.McLeish, Kathy COTSBot: New robot aims to terminate crown- of-thorns starfish destroying Great Barrier Reef ABC News.

Field trials of the robot have begun in Moreton Bay in Brisbane to refine its navigation system, according to Queensland University of Technology researcher Matthew Dunbabin.

About 70 percent of the drainage area is in South Dakota. The river provides the main drainage of the flat lowland area of the Dakotas between the two plateau regions known as the Coteau du Missouri and the Coteau des Prairies. This narrow area was formed by the James lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last ice age, and as a consequence the watershed of the river is slender and it has few major tributaries for a river of its length. The James drops approximately per , and this low gradient sometimes leads to reverse flow. Reverse flow occurs when high inflow from tributaries leads to James River water flowing upstream for several miles above the joining water. This happens most frequently north of Huron, South Dakota. The river arises in Wells County, North Dakota, approximately 10 mi (16 km) northwest of Fessenden. It flows briefly east towards New Rockford, then generally SSE through eastern North Dakota, past Jamestown, where it is first impounded by a large reservoir (the Jamestown Dam), and then joined by the Pipestem River. It enters northeastern South Dakota in Brown County, where it is impounded to form two reservoirs northeast of Aberdeen. At Columbia, it is joined by the Elm River. Flowing southward across eastern South Dakota, it passes Huron and Mitchell, where it is joined by the Firesteel Creek. South of Mitchell, it flows southeast and joins the Missouri just east of Yankton. The James River flows fully across the state of South Dakota, the only river other than the Missouri to do so. River conditions during normal years include still water on both the James and its tributaries as well as flooding. Floods occur after snowmelt or heavy rains, as water easily breaches the James' low banks, and such floods tend to cover a significant portion of the floodplain. When the river is still, water quality drops. History This excerpt from the Lewis and Clark map of 1814 shows the rivers of western Iowa and eastern South Dakota.

It is a fundamental aspect to the heterotrophic theory of the origin of life, first proposed by Alexander Oparin in 1924, and John Burdon Sanderson Haldane in 1929.  Historical background  The notion that living beings originated from inanimate materials comes from the Ancient Greeks—the theory known as spontaneous generation. Aristotle in the 4th century BCE gave a proper explanation, writing: Aristotle also states that it is not only that animals originate from other similar animals, but also that living things do arise and always have arisen from lifeless matter. His theory remained the dominant idea on origin of life (outside that of deity as a causal agent) from the ancient philosophers to the Renaissance thinkers in various forms. With the birth of modern science, experimental refutations emerged. Italian physician Francesco Redi demonstrated in 1668 that maggots developed from rotten meat only in a jar where flies could enter, but not in closed-lid jar. He concluded that: omne vivum ex vivo (All life comes from life). The experiment of French chemist Louis Pasteur in 1859 is regarded as the death blow to spontaneous generation. He experimentally showed that organisms (microbes) can not grow in a sterilised water, unless it is exposed to air. The experiment won him the Alhumbert Prize in 1862 from the French Academy of Sciences, and he concluded: Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment. Evolutionary biologists believed that a kind of spontaneous generation, but different from the simple Aristotelian doctrine, must have worked for the emergence of life. French biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck had speculated that the first life form started from non-living materials. \\"Nature, by means of heat, light, electricity and moisture\\", he wrote in 1809 in Philosophie Zoologique (The Philosophy of Zoology), \\"forms direct or spontaneous generation at that extremity of each kingdom of living bodies, where the simplest of these bodies are found.\\" When English naturalist Charles Darwin introduced the theory of natural selection in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859, his supporters, such as a German zoologist Ernst Haeckel, criticised him for not using his theory to explain the origin of life. Haeckel wrote in 1862: \\"The chief defect of the Darwinian theory is that it throws no light on the origin of the primitive organism—probably a simple cell—from which all the others have descended. When Darwin assumes a special creative act for this first species, he is not consistent, and, I think, not quite sincere.\\" Although Darwin did not speak explicitly about the origin of life in On the Origin of Species, he did mention a \\"warm little pond\\" in a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker dated February 1, 1871 =Heterotrophic theory= A coherent scientific argument was introduced by Soviet biochemist Alexander Oparin in 1924. According to Oparin, in the primitive Earth's surface, carbon, hydrogen, water vapour, and ammonia reacted to form the first organic compounds. Unbeknownst to Oparin, whose writing was circulated only in Russian, an English scientist John Burdon Sanderson Haldane independently arrived at similar conclusion in 1929. It was Haldane who first used the term \\"soup\\" to describe the accumulation of organic material and water in the primitive Earth Today the theory is variously known as the Heterotrophic theory, Heterotrophic origin of life theory or the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. Biochemist Robert Shapiro has summarized the basic points of the theory in its \\"mature form\\" as follows: According to the heterotrophic theory, organic compounds were synthesized in the primitive Earth under prebiotic conditions. The mixture of such compounds with water under the atmosphere of the primitive Earth is referred as the prebiotic soup. There, life originated and the first forms of life were able use the organic molecules to survive and reproduce. # Early Earth had a chemically reducing atmosphere. # This atmosphere, exposed to energy in various forms, produced simple organic compounds (\\"monomers\\"). # These compounds accumulated in a \\"soup\\", which may have been concentrated at various locations (shorelines, oceanic vents etc.). # By further transformation, more complex organic polymers – and ultimately life – developed in the soup. Definitions It is important to make the distinction between prebiotic and abiotic processes. While an abiotic process refers to anything that occurs without the presence of life, a prebiotic process refers to something that happens in the atmospheric and chemical conditions that the primitive Earth had about 4.2 billion years ago, and that preceded to the origin of life on the planet. Oparin's theory Alexander Oparin first postulated his theory in Russian in 1924 in a small pamphlet titled Proiskhozhdenie Zhizny (The Origin of Life). According to Oparin, the primitive Earth's surface had a thick red-hot liquid, composed of heavy elements such as carbon (in the form of iron carbide). This nucleus was surrounded by the lightest elements, i.e. gases, such as hydrogen. In the presence of water vapour, carbides reacted with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons. Such hydrocarbons were the first organic molecules. These further combined with oxygen and ammonia to produce hydroxy- and amino-derivatives, such as carbohydrates and proteins. These molecules accumulated on the ocean's surface, becoming gel-like substances and growing in size. They gave rise to primitive organisms (cells), which he called coacervates. In his original theory, Oparin considered oxygen as one of the primordial gases; thus the primordial atmosphere was an oxidising one. However, when he elaborated his theory in 1936 (in a book by the same title, and translated into English in 1938), he modified the chemical composition of the primordial environment as strictly reducing, consisting of methane, ammonia, free hydrogen and water vapour—excluding oxygen. In his 1936 work, impregnated by a Darwinian thought that involved a slow and gradual evolution from the simple to the complex, Oparin proposed a heterotrophic origin, result of a long process of chemical and pre-biological evolution, where the first forms of life should have been microorganisms dependent on the molecules and organic substances present in their external environment. That external environment was the primordial soup. The idea of a heterotrophic origin was based, in part, on the universality of fermentative reactions, which, according to Oparin, should have first appeared in evolution due to its simplicity. This was opposed to the idea, widely accepted at that time, that the first organisms emerged endowed with an autotrophic metabolism, which included photosynthetic pigments, enzymes and the ability to synthesize organic compounds from CO2 and H2O; for Oparin it was impossible to reconcile the original photosynthetic organisms with the ideas of Darwinian evolution. From the detailed analysis of the geochemical and astronomical data known at that date, Oparin also proposed a primitive atmosphere devoid of O2 and composed of CH4, NH3 and H2O; under these conditions it was pointed out that the origin of life had been preceded by a period of abiotic synthesis and subsequent accumulation of various organic compounds in the seas of primitive Earth. This accumulation resulted in the formation of a primordial broth containing a wide variety of molecules. There, according to Oparin, a particular type of colloid, the coacervates, were formed due to the conglomeration of organic molecules and other polymers with positive and negative charges. Oparin suggested that the first living beings had been preceded by pre-cellular structures similar to those coacervates, whose gradual evolution gave rise to the appearance of the first organisms. Like the coacervates, several of Oparin's original ideas have been reformulated and replaced; this includes, for example, the reducing character of the atmosphere on primitive Earth, the coacervates as a pre-cellular model and the primitive nature of glycolysis. In the same way, we now understand that the gradual processes are not necessarily slow, and we even know, thanks to the fossil record, that the origin and early evolution of life occurred in short geologic time lapses. However, the general approach of Oparin's theory had great implications for biology, since his work achieved the transformation of the study of the origin of life from a purely speculative field to a structured and broad research program. Thus, since the second half of the twentieth century, Oparin's theory of the origin and early evolution of life has undergone a restructuring that accommodates the experimental findings of molecular biology, as well as the theoretical contributions of evolutionary biology. A point of convergence between these two branches of biology and that has been perfectly incorporated into the heterotrophic origin theory is found in the RNA world hypothesis. Haldane's theory J.B.S. Haldane independently postulated his primordial soup theory in 1929 in an eight-page article \\"The origin of life\\" in The Rationalist Annual. According to Haldane the primitive Earth's atmosphere was essentially reducing, with little or no oxygen. Ultraviolet rays from the Sun induced reactions on a mixture of water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Organic substances such as sugars and protein components (amino acids) were synthesised. These molecules \\"accumulated till the primitive oceans reached the consistency of hot dilute soup.\\" The first reproducing things were created from this soup. As to the priority over the theory, Haldane accepted that Oparin came first, saying, \\"I have very little doubt that Professor Oparin has the priority over me.\\" Monomer formation One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the \\"soup\\" theory came in 1953. A graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors, under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis. The now-famous \\"Miller–Urey experiment\\" used a highly reduced mixture of gases--methane, ammonia and hydrogen--to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the \\"soup\\" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centers. Apart from the Miller–Urey experiment, the next most important step in research on prebiotic organic synthesis was the demonstration by Joan Oró that the nucleic acid purine base, adenine, was formed by heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions. In support of abiogenesis in eutectic ice, more recent work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). Further transformation The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited by the \\"soup\\" theory is not at all a straightforward process. Besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were formed in high concentration during the Miller–Urey and Oró experiments. The Miller experiment, for example, produces many substances that would undergo cross- reactions with the amino acids or terminate the peptide chain.

It is used as a biofuel for the production of heat, energy, and electricity, and in the manufacture of pulp and building materials. Agave bagasse is a similar material that consists of the tissue of the blue agave after extraction of the sap. Production, storage and composition Calheta, Madeira. The bagasse falls down a chute and is removed on a conveyor belt below For every 10 tonnes of sugarcane crushed, a sugar factory produces nearly three tonnes of wet bagasse. Since bagasse is a by-product of the cane sugar industry, the quantity of production in each country is in line with the quantity of sugarcane produced. The high moisture content of bagasse, typically 40–50 percent, is detrimental to its use as a fuel. In general, bagasse is stored prior to further processing. For electricity production, it is stored under moist conditions, and the mild exothermic process that results from the degradation of residual sugars dries the bagasse pile slightly. For paper and pulp production, it is normally stored wet in order to assist in removal of the short pith fibres, which impede the paper making process, as well as to remove any remaining sugar. A typical chemical analysis of washed and dried bagasse might show: *Cellulose 45–55 percent *Hemicellulose 20–25 percent *Lignin 18–24 percent *Ash 1–4 percent *Waxes <1 percent Bagasse is a heterogeneous material containing around 30-40 percent of \\"pith\\" fibre, which is derived from the core of the plant and is mainly parenchyma material, and \\"bast\\", \\"rind\\", or \\"stem\\" fibre, which makes up the balance and is largely derived from sclerenchyma material. These properties make bagasse particularly problematic for paper manufacture and have been the subject of a large body of literature. Uses Bagasse, covered with blue plastic, outside a sugar mill in Proserpine, Queensland Many research efforts have explored using bagasse as a biofuel in renewable power generation and in the production of bio-based materials. =Fuel= Bagasse is often used as a primary fuel source for sugar mills. When burned in quantity, it produces sufficient heat energy to supply all the needs of a typical sugar mill, with energy to spare. To this end, a secondary use for this waste product is in cogeneration, the use of a fuel source to provide both heat energy, used in the mill, and electricity, which is typically sold on to the consumer electrical grid. The lower calorific value (LCV) of bagasse in kJ/kg may be estimated using the formula: LCV = 18260 - 207.01 × Moisture - 31.14 × Brix - 182.60 × Ash , where the moisture, brix and ash content of the bagasse are expressed as a percentage by mass. Similarly, the higher calorific value (HCV) of bagasse may be estimated using: HCV = 19605 - 196.05 × Moisture - 31.14 × Brix - 196.05 × Ash. The resulting CO2 emissions are less than the amount of CO2 that the sugarcane plant absorbed from the atmosphere during its growing phase, which makes the process of cogeneration greenhouse-gas-neutral. In countries such as Australia, sugar factories contribute \\"green\\" power to the electricity grid. Hawaiian Electric Industries also burns bagasse for cogeneration. Ethanol produced from the sugar in sugarcane is a popular fuel in Brazil. The cellulose-rich bagasse is being widely investigated for its potential for producing commercial quantities of cellulosic ethanol. For example, until May 2015 BP was operating a cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant based on cellulosic materials in Jennings, Louisiana. Bagasse's potential for advanced biofuels has been shown by several researchers. However, the compatibility with conventional fuels and suitability of these crude fuels in conventional engines have yet to be proven. =Pulp, paper, board and feed= Bagasse is commonly used as a substitute for wood in many tropical and subtropical countries for the production of pulp, paper and board, such as India, China, Colombia, Iran, Thailand, and Argentina. It produces pulp with physical properties that are well suited for generic printing and writing papers as well as tissue products but it is also widely used for boxes and newspaper production. It can also be used for making boards resembling plywood or particle board, called bagasse board and Xanita board, and is considered a good substitute for plywood. It has wide usage for making partitions and furniture. The industrial process to convert bagasse into paper was developed in 1937 in a small laboratory in Hacienda Paramonga, a sugar mill on the coast of Peru owned by W.R. Grace Company. With a promising method invented by Clarence Birdseyehttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Clarence-Birdseye the company bought an old paper mill in Whippany, New Jersey and shipped bagasse from Peru to test the viability of the process on an industrial scale. The first paper manufacturing machines were designed in Germany and installed in the Cartavio sugar cane plant in 1938. On January 26-27, 1950, the Noble & Wood Machine Company of Hoosick Falls, New York, Kinsley Chemical Company of Cleveland, and Chemical Paper Company of Holyoke, Massachusetts, demonstrated the first successful commercial production of newsprint produced from bagasse at Chemical Paper's mills in Holyoke, and its first use in the printing of a special edition of the Holyoke Transcript-Telegram. This demonstration was done in part in collaboration with the governments of Puerto Rico and Argentina, and presented before representatives of 100 industrial interests and officials from 15 countries, due to the economic importance of the product in countries without ready-access to wood fibers. Sociedad Paramonga was bought in 1997 by Quimpac and in 2015 produced 90,000 metric tons of office paper, toilet paper and cardboard for the Peruvian market. K-Much Industry has patented a method of converting bagasse into cattle feed by mixing it with molasses and enzymes (such as bromelain) and fermenting it. It is marketed in Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Taiwan and Middle East and Australia. Xanita, a South African company, mixes 30 percent bagasse cellulose fibres in with recycled kraft paper fibre to make ultra-lightweight composite boards. These are sold as an environmentally friendly, formaldehyde-free alternative to MDF and particle board. Pars Paper co. is one of the biggest producers of bagasse pulp located in Iran. This company produce food contact bagasse pulp and its pulp is mostly export to china Taiwan Vietnam India ... and they make biodegradable tableware and food box, such products are Eco-friendly and compostable with no harm to human and earth. = Nanocellulose = Nanocellulose can be produced from bagasse through various conventional and novel processes. This provides a pathway to generate higher-value products from what can be considered a process waste stream. Health impact Workplace exposure to dust from the processing of bagasse can cause the chronic lung condition pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically referred to as bagassosis. =Human consumption= Processed bagasse is added to human food as sugarcane fiber. It is a soluble fiber but can help promote intestinal regularity. One animal study suggests that sugarcane fiber combined with a high-fat diet may help control type 2 diabetes. Bagasse are good sources of lignoceric and cerotic acids. In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, bagasse is sometimes used to smoke bacon and sausages.

It is known locally as the Alberni Highway to the east of Port Alberni and the Pacific Rim Highway to the west. The original highway from Parksville to Alberni and Port Alberni was completed in 1942 and was originally designated as Highway 1A. It was re- designated as Highway 4 in 1953, and was extended in 1961 to the small community of Tofino, on the west coast of the Island. Route details Highway 4 and 19 Interchange at Qualicum Beach Highway 4's eastern terminus is at the interchange with Highway 19 at Qualicum Beach; however, the roadway continues north as Memorial Avenue for to Highway 19A. From Highway 19, it travels south for to a junction with an older Alberni Highway segment, now known as Highway 4A, at the small community of Hilliers in Coombs. Highway 4 veers directly west upon meeting this junction. The majority of Highway 4's length is composed of a two-lane configuration. An abandoned spur of the E&N; Railway parallels Highway 4 all the way from the coast to the city of Port Alberni. West of Coombs Junction, Highway 4 travels for before meeting Cameron Lake. Highway 4 hugs the shore of Cameron Lake for , then winds its way through MacMillan Provincial Park, which includes a tourist attraction known as Cathedral Grove. After Cameron Lake, Highway 4 climbs for , following the Cameron River, to the Port Alberni Summit—the highest point on the highway (elevation: ), known by locals as \\"The Hump\\", at which it crosses from the Regional District of Nanaimo into the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District—and then descends for to a spur that travels into the city centre of Port Alberni. Highway 4 actually enters the city limits of Port Alberni west of the main spur into the city, and later, exits Port Alberni via a bridge over the Somass River. Tofino was a strong advocate of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and this sign was erected in the hope that Highway 4 would become part of the TCH. west of the Somass River crossing, Highway 4 reaches the shore of Sproat Lake, following the lake shore west for . Highway 4 then follows the Taylor River for to the summit of Sutton Pass (elevation: ), named after William John Sutton, and then turns toward the south-southwest to follow the Kennedy River. This winding bearing of Highway 4, which features very steep grades, continues for before reaching the southeast shore of Kennedy Lake. Highway 4 then follows the shore of Kennedy Lake southwest for , and reaches a junction with a spur into the settlement of Ucluelet (known locally as \\"The Junction\\") later, after which the route continues in a northwest direction. later, Highway 4 enters the Long Beach Unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Highway 4 goes through the national park for northwest before terminating later at Tofino. Major intersections From east to west: Highway 4A Highway 4A is the previous alignment of Highway 4 east of Coombs. The '4A' designation was originally assigned in 1968 to the current section of Highway 4 between Coombs and Qualicum Beach. The 4 and 4A alignments east and north of Coombs, respectively, switched designations when the Parksville to Mud Bay section of the Inland Island Highway was completed in 1996.

It is a member of the Eight Schools Association.  Present Day  NMH offers more than 200 courses, including AP and honors classes in every discipline. Every semester, students take three major courses, each 80 minutes long, as opposed to five 50-minute classes which are more typical of high schools. This \\"College-Model Academic Program\\" allows students to spend more time with their teachers and immerse themselves more deeply in academic subjects. NMH employs 91 full-time teaching faculty members, 60 percent of whom have advanced degrees. The average class size at NMH is 11 students; the student-to-teacher ratio is 6 to 1. Students are required to participate in cocurricular activities every semester; these include athletic teams, performing-arts ensembles, volunteer work on and off- campus, and activities such as working for one of the school's four student publications. Students may join an extensive array of extracurricular clubs, organizations, and affinity groups. Students involved in visual and performing arts courses, as well as NMH's performing ensembles, are supported by the Rhodes Arts Center. (See more under \\"Arts Programs\\") With more than 60 athletic teams in 20 interscholastic sports, NMH offers one of the broadest athletic programs among secondary schools in the U.S. and currently holds the national prep championship title in boys' basketball and New England championship titles in girls' crew, wrestling, and numerous individual swimming and track and field events. NMH offers an extensive outdoor education program in addition to its competitive teams. Each student is required to hold a job on campus, working four to five hours a week for a total of 120 hours each school year. This contribution to the operation of the school stems from the school's founder, Dwight Lyman Moody, and his desire for students to understand the value of manual labor.  Traditions  * Workjob - Students work in all aspects of the school. While the specific jobs change with time, (working in the power plant and laundry are no longer common) students still work in the kitchen washing dishes and preparing food; managing sports teams and performing arts groups; tutoring peers in various disciplines; leading campus tours for visitors; doing administrative office work; and caring for animals and performing other chores on NMH's working farm, such as making maple syrup and apple cider. * \\"Jerusalem\\" - The school song. A short poem written by William Blake and set to music by Sir Hubert-Parry. It is traditional to yell out the \\"Bring me my arrows\\" section of the song (although not always in formal settings). * Rope Pull - A giant tug-of-war held over Shadow Lake between the seniors and juniors. While typically the seniors are the victors, on a few occasions the juniors have triumphed. * Mountain Day - A surprise holiday when classes are cancelled and students and faculty hike either Mount Monadnock or Northfield Mountain. * Bemis-Forslund Pie Race - A 4.3-mile course that is among the oldest footraces in the country (begun in 1891) and which rewards all male runners under 33 minutes and female runners under 40 minutes with a homemade apple pie. Typically run in the late fall. * Christmas Vespers - Held in a candlelit Memorial Chapel (and originally Sage Chapel) since at least the 1930s, Christmas Vespers is a combined choral and orchestral service including Bible readings, Christmas melodies, and other seasonal music. There are two services on campus in addition to an off-campus service, held alternately in New York and Boston. Traditionally, a male soloist performs a verse of Veni Veni Emmanuel to begin the service with a choral response of the refrain which leads into the congregation joining in singing the old French Carol, Sing We Noel. To conclude the service, David Wilcock's arrangement of Adeste Fidelis is sung by the congregation followed by a female soloist singing the descant to Stille Nacht as the choir hums. After a moment of perfect darkness and silence a final organ refrain of Veni Veni Emmanuel concludes the service, followed by an organ arrangement of God Rest ye Merry Gentleman. * Sacred Concert - A combined choral and orchestral performance with history more than a century old. Performed for the community by NMH students and faculty in the Auditorium on the school's former Northfield campus in early May.  History  Marquand Hall, 1904 The school was founded by Protestant evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody as the Northfield Seminary for Young Ladies in 1879 (later called the Northfield School for Girls) and the Mount Hermon School for Boys in 1881. Moody built the girls' school in Northfield, Massachusetts, the town of his birth, and the boys' school a few miles away in the town of Gill. Moody's goal was to provide the best possible education for young people without privilege, and he enrolled students whose parents were slaves as well as Native Americans and people from other countries, which was unprecedented among elite private schools at that time. Moody sent out students who founded schools and churches of their own. For example, a protégé of Moody founded Moores Corner Church in Leverett, MA. Moody viewed Christian religious education as an essential objective of his schools. Under subsequent administrations, the schools grew more theologically liberal and ultimately became non-denominational. Today, NMH offers diverse ways to pursue religious studies and personal spirituality. By 1913, the schools were operated under the single moniker \\"The Northfield Schools,\\" but remained separate institutions until 1972, when the two schools merged to become Northfield Mount Hermon, continuing to operate with two coeducational campuses. In 2005, the school consolidated its students and classes onto the Mount Hermon campus. This decision by the board of trustees stemmed from a belief that students would receive the best possible education in a smaller, more close-knit community, and from a desire to focus the school's resources on educational programs and maintain one campus instead of two. Before consolidation, the school enrolled approximately 1,100 students per year; the student body has now settled at 650, making the admission process even more selective. In June 2016, The Trust for Public Land and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation ensured the complete and permanent protection of 1,300 acres of forest land which was previously the Northfield campus and owned by the Northfield Mount Hermon School for over a century. Although now a permanent part of the Northfield State Forest, it had been the largest parcel of unprotected land in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The property includes woodlands, trails and a reservoir which will be managed by the DCR to ensure public access for recreation as well as serve as important habitat for wildlife. NMH's current head (interim) is Charles A. Tierney III. Brian H. Hargrove will become NMH's 12th head of school, effective July 1, 2019.  Athletics  View of James and Forslund Gymnasiums All students are required to participate in some form of physical education every term, which is not limited to interscholastic sports. The school fields over 60 teams (including junior varsity teams) in 20 different sports. The football team was abolished after the 2013 season, but otherwise most other major sports are offered, and several programs (e.g., boys' basketball, girls' swimming and both boys' and girls' cross-country) are regional and/or national powerhouses. Mount Hermon claims to have invented the sport of Ultimate Frisbee in 1968. Arts Programs Rhodes Arts Center The Gold LEED certified Rhodes Arts Center (at right) is the home of all of the arts programs at NMH. It houses two concert performance spaces, a black-box theater, two dance studios, an art gallery, classrooms, art studios, practice rooms, and faculty offices. Additionally, the RAC is home to the Class of 1958 Carillon, which was originally installed in Sage Chapel in 1924. The funds to make the move possible were spearheaded by the combined Mount Hermon and Northfield classes of '58. It can be played via an electronic keyboard situated in the bottom of the bell-tower. Memorial Chapel houses the school's own tracker action organ. Andover Organ Company Opus 67, completed in December 1970 and donated by Kenneth H. Rockey is a 2-manual 27-stop, 37-rank tracker organ with a pedal compass of 30, and a manual compass of 56.

Podgorny was born to a Ukrainian working-class family in the city of Karlovka, graduating from a local worker's school in 1926 and the Kyiv Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1931. Podgorny became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1930 and climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder by delivering production goals set by the bureaucrats of the centrally planned economy. By 1953, Podgorny became Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1953 before later serving as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine from 1957 to 1963. In October 1964, Podgorny participated in a coup replacing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev with a troika consisting of himself, Premier Alexei Kosygin and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. On 6 December 1965, he took Anastas Mikoyan's place as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Kosygin's standing was damaged in the wake of the Prague Spring in 1968, Podgorny steadily amassed power at his expense to become the second-most powerful figure in the country behind Brezhnev. Thereafter, his influence over policy declined as Brezhnev consolidated his control over the regime. By June 1977, Podgorny was removed as Chairman of the Presidium as well as a member of the Politburo. Upon his removal from the Soviet leadership, he was forced to resign from active politics and sidelined in Soviet affairs until his death in 1983. Early life Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny was born on in Karlovka, Russian Empire, to a Ukrainian working-class family. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Podgorny became one of the founders of the Karlovka branch of the Komsomol, and served as a Secretary of the Komsomol from 1921 to 1923. Podgorny started work at the age of 17 as a student at the mechanical workshops in Karlovka. In 1926, Podgorny graduated from a local workers' school. In 1930, Podgorny became a member of the All- Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the ruling party of the Soviet Union. In 1931, Podgorny graduated from the Kyiv Technological Institute of Food Industry and started working in the sugar industry. Podgorny was promoted to deputy chief engineer of Vinnytsia in 1937 and was promoted in 1939 as the chief engineer of the Kamenetz-Podolsk Oblast sugar trusts. By the end of 1939, Podgorny had become Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR). The next year, Podgorny was appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the Soviet Union. Rise to the Soviet leadership (1942–1964) Podgorny became the Director of the Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1942 during World War II. After the liberation of Ukraine from Nazi Germany, Podgorny reestablished Soviet control over Ukraine on the orders of the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Government. In the post-war years, Podgorny regained his old office of Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR, but was later appointed in 1946 as a Permanent Representative to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR. In April 1950, he was made First Secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU). In 1953, Podgorny was elevated to Second Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the CPU. From 1957 to 1963, Podgorny was First Secretary of the CC of the CPU, effectively the most powerful position in Ukraine. In this role, Podgorny worked on reorganising and modernising the Ukrainian economy, which had been destroyed during the war years. He worked to increase the rate of industrial and agricultural production and to improve people's welfare. He paid particular attention to improving party organisation and educating new cadres. Podgorny (second from left) at East Germany's 6th Party Conference with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev (second from right) in 1963. In 1960, Podgorny became a member of the Politburo (Political Bureau), the highest policy-making authority in the Soviet Union. By 1963, Podgorny had risen to prominence within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As a protégé and close companion of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, he traveled with him to the United Nations headquarters in 1960. Podgorny acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Canada, and Yugoslavia. Podgorny's beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev, and under Leonid Brezhnev's rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership, even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin. Podgorny briefly fell out of Khruschev's favor in 1961 when he blamed bad corn yields in the Ukrainian SSR on \\"bad weather\\", while Khrushchev claimed the crops had been \\"stolen\\" and \\"pilfered\\". However, in 1962, Podgorny reported to Khrushchev that agricultural output had again increased: Under Podgorny's leadership, the Ukrainian SSR had doubled Ukraine's supply of grain to the state from the previous year. Because of his handling of agriculture, First World commentators saw Podgorny as one of Khrushchev's many potential heirs. According to historian Ilya Zemtsov, the author of Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika, Brezhnev began starting a conspiracy against Khrushchev when he found out that he had chosen Podgorny, and not himself, as his potential successor.During the 1964 ouster to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary and Premier, Podgorny and Brezhnev appealed to the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for economic failures and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. Influenced by Brezhnev and his allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office. Post-Khrushchev troika (1964–1977) =Struggle for power= In the aftermath of Khrushchev's removal, a collective leadership known as a troika was formed, headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan as head of state. Before becoming head of state, Podgorny served as the party's Second Secretary, and was therefore in charge of the Party's Organisational Division. In this capacity, Podgorny threatened Brezhnev's position as First Secretary because the Organisational Division, if Podgorny chose so, could easily be turned into his own power base within the party. Due to this risk, Brezhnev allied himself with Alexander Shelepin, the KGB chairman, to oppose both Podgorny and Kosygin. Podgorny's position was constantly threatened by Brezhnev and his allies. In an article in Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta from February 1965, the newspaper criticised the Kharkiv Party organisation which Podgorny had previously headed, but also its management of the economy. By indirectly criticising Podgorny, the article raised doubts about his qualifications as a leading member of the Soviet leadership. Podgorny launched a counterattack in his 1965 speech in Baku, Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, where he criticised the Soviet leadership's heavy industrial policy. This, as it turned out, would be a move he would regret for life. Instead of offending just Brezhnev and Shelepin, he offended the whole conservative wing of the leadership. To make matters even worse for Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov, who had kept outside of the conflict, sided with Brezhnev, and called his views \\"revisionist\\". Later in December 1965, Podgorny relinquished his seat in the Secretariat, and took Mikoyan's place as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. According to Ilya Zemstov, his departure from the Secretariat signaled the end of his wish to assume the First Secretaryship. The majority of Politburo members under Brezhnev were conservative communists. Even so, Podgorny remained one of the most liberal-minded members in the Era of Stagnation. Other liberal-minded Politburo members included Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko. Factionalism within the Soviet leadership in the 1960s led Podgorny to become more active; he held several speeches in Moscow and went on numerous state visits at the expense of Brezhnev and Kosygin's popularity. There was speculation in Soviet society that Podgorny was trying to replace Kosygin as Premier, or even Brezhnev as General Secretary, due to his increasing presence in the late 1960s. In 1971, the 24th Party Congress affirmed Brezhnev's and Kosygin's status as the leadership's current highest-ranking figures but Podgorny nevertheless showed that he remained a major player in Soviet politics by leading delegations to China and North Vietnam later that year. As Brezhnev adopted more liberal positions, Podgorny attracted support among hardline communists by opposing his conciliatory stance towards Yugoslavia, disarmament deals with the West, and pressuring of East Germany into conceding to the Berlin negotiations.In the Politburo, Podgorny could count on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Additionally, when Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, such an opportunity was often ignored due to how frequently Podgorny found himself in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues.. Ultimately, the collective leadership was rendered powerless in the late 1970s when Brezhnev achieved all but complete control over the Politburo. =Diplomatic protocol as head of state= French President Charles de Gaulle (seated left) in Moscow. In 1967, just before the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed, falsely, that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border. That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan's Afghanistan. Brezhnev conspired to oust Podgorny as early as 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol. Since September 1970 Brezhnev tried to form an opposition in the Politburo to oust Podgorny. According to Time, \\"There was some speculation in Moscow\\" that if Brezhnev didn't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in, for example, East Germany (Staatsrat), People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania. The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR. Brezhnev's backers were unable, and didn't even try, to remove Podgorny from the head of state post at the 1970 Central Committee plenum. Brezhnev could count on only five votes, while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power. Under such circumstances, removing Podgorny would be condemned among the Soviet elite for violating the principle of collective leadership. =Later tenure= Podgorny in 1973 In the early 1970s, Brezhnev strengthened Podgorny's position at the expense of Premier Kosygin by giving the Presidium executive powers. As a result of these changes, the post of Chairman of the Presidium changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. Pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called for the expansion of Party activities in the Soviets. Unbeknownst to Podgorny, Brezhnev felt threatened by his new authority and ordered Konstantin Chernenko to review the 1936 Soviet Constitution for a way to weaken Podgorny's position. As it turned out there were none under current Soviet law. As the head of state, Podgorny could block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers. Chernenko's solution to this dilemma was to make it law that the Party leader could also become the Chairman of the Presidium. Consequently, a new constitution was drafted to include such a provision. On 7 October 1977, the 1977 Soviet Constitution which affirmed the Party's supremacy in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership. The approval of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is considered Podgorny's death knell. =Removal= Podgorny's removal from office in 1977 has become the most notable example of power transfer in the late Brezhnev Era. According to Robert Vincent Daniels, Podgorny was, before his removal, the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin. Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny's fall, the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. On 24 May 1977, a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo. The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, he got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members. The Central Committee had however only voted him off the Politburo, and Podgorny still retained the position of Chairman of the Presidium. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny's name disappeared from Soviet media. The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against détente and producing more consumer goods. Podgorny finally lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977. Due to his advanced age, Brezhnev was regarded as too old to carry out some of the functions of head of state. The Supreme Soviet, on Brezhnev's orders, established the new post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, an office equivalent to the post of Vice President. Vasili Kuznetsov, at the age of 76, was unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet as First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium. Retirement, death and recognition Podgorny's life after his resignation is not well documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed by the presence of Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer in Kyiv on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery. As with many other high-standing Soviet officials, Podgorny was honoured with several awards. He was awarded five Orders of Lenin, one Order of the Red Banner and several medals, as well as being awarded several foreign state prizes by the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, and Finland .

Originally from Sicily, it is available throughout Italy in varying forms. It is related to sorbet and Italian ice; however, in most of Sicily, it has a coarser, more crystalline texture. Food writer Jeffrey Steingarten says that \\"the desired texture seems to vary from city to city\\" on the island; on the west coast and in Palermo, it is at its chunkiest, and in the east it is nearly as smooth as sorbet. The chapter is an essay first published in June 1996. This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a gelato machine, while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals. Although its texture varies from coarse to smooth, it is always different from that of ice cream, which is creamier, and from that of sorbet, which is more compact; this makes granita distinct and unique. Ingredients Tris di granite (trio of granitas) with strawberry, mandarin and almond flavors Common and traditional flavoring ingredients include lemon juice, mandarin oranges, jasmine, coffee, almonds, mint, and when in season wild strawberries and black mulberries. Chocolate granitas have a tradition in the city of Catania but are also available in other parts of Sicily. The nuances of the Sicilian ingredients are important to the flavor of the finished granita: Sicilian lemons are a less acidic, more floral variety similar to Meyer lemons, while the almonds used contain some number of bitter almonds, crucial to the signature almond flavor. Another popular flavor used in granita is pistachio, also an agricultural product of Sicily. Serving conventions Granita with coffee is very common in the city of Messina, while granita with almonds is popular in the city of Catania. Granita in combination with a yeast pastry called brioche is a common breakfast in summer time (the Sicilian brioche is generally flatter and wider than the French version). Granita is often found served as a slush-type drink rather than a dessert, in a paper or plastic cup with a plastic lid and a straw (often a spoon straw). Granita, made with savory ingredients or less sugar than the dessert, is often served between courses of a meal as a palate cleanser.

Examples include salt in water, alcohol in water, or the mixing of two solids such as impurities into a finely powdered drug. In all cases, the substance added/present in smaller amounts is considered the solute, while the original substance present in larger quantity is thought of as the solvent. The resulting liquid solution or solid-solid mixture has a lower freezing point than the pure solvent or solid because the chemical potential of the solvent in the mixture is lower than that of the pure solvent, the difference between the two being proportional to the natural logarithm of the mole fraction. In a similar manner, the chemical potential of the vapor above the solution is lower than that above a pure solvent, which results in boiling-point elevation. Freezing-point depression is what causes sea water, (a mixture of salt [and other things] in water) to remain liquid at temperatures below , the freezing point of pure water. Explanation The freezing point is the temperature at which the liquid solvent and solid solvent are at equilibrium, so that their vapour pressures are equal. When a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile liquid solvent, the solution vapour pressure will be lower than that of the pure solvent. As a result, the solid will reach equilibrium with the solution at a lower temperature than with the pure solvent. This explanation in terms of vapor pressure is equivalent to the argument based on chemical potential, since the chemical potential of a vapor is logarithmically related to pressure. All of the colligative properties result from a lowering of the chemical potential of the solvent in the presence of a solute. This lowering is an entropy effect. The greater randomness of the solution (as compared to the pure solvent) acts in opposition to freezing, so that a lower temperature must be reached, over a broader range, before equilibrium between the liquid solution and solid solution phases is achieved. Melting point determinations are commonly exploited in organic chemistry to aid in identifying substances and to ascertain their purity. Uses Ice on a road The phenomenon of freezing-point depression has many practical uses. The radiator fluid in an automobile is a mixture of water and ethylene glycol. As a result of freezing-point depression, radiators do not freeze in winter (unless it is extremely cold, e.g. ). Road salting takes advantage of this effect to lower the freezing point of the ice it is placed on. Lowering the freezing point allows the street ice to melt at lower temperatures, preventing the accumulation of dangerous, slippery ice. Commonly used sodium chloride can depress the freezing point of water to about . If the road surface temperature is lower, NaCl becomes ineffective and other salts are used, such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or a mixture of many. These salts are somewhat aggressive to metals, especially iron, so in airports safer media such as sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate are used instead. Freezing-point depression is used by some organisms that live in extreme cold. Such creatures have evolved means through which they can produce a high concentration of various compounds such as sorbitol and glycerol. This elevated concentration of solute decreases the freezing point of the water inside them, preventing the organism from freezing solid even as the water around them freezes, or as the air around them becomes very cold. Examples of organisms that produce antifreeze compounds include some species of arctic- living fish such as the rainbow smelt, which produces glycerol and other molecules to survive in frozen-over estuaries during the winter months. In other animals, such as the spring peeper frog (Pseudacris crucifer), the molality is increased temporarily as a reaction to cold temperatures. In the case of the peeper frog, freezing temperatures trigger a large-scale breakdown of glycogen in the frog's liver and subsequent release of massive amounts of glucose into the blood.L. Sherwood et al., Animal Physiology: From Genes to Organisms, 2005, Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA, , p. 691–692. With the formula below, freezing-point depression can be used to measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called cryoscopy (Greek cryo = cold, scopos = observe; \\"observe the cold\\"BIOETYMOLOGY – Biomedical Terms of Greek Origin. cryoscopy. bioetymology.blogspot.com.) and relies on exact measurement of the freezing point. The degree of dissociation is measured by determining the van 't Hoff factor i by first determining mB and then comparing it to msolute. In this case, the molar mass of the solute must be known. The molar mass of a solute is determined by comparing mB with the amount of solute dissolved. In this case, i must be known, and the procedure is primarily useful for organic compounds using a nonpolar solvent. Cryoscopy is no longer as common a measurement method as it once was, but it was included in textbooks at the turn of the 20th century. As an example, it was still taught as a useful analytic procedure in Cohen's Practical Organic Chemistry of 1910, in which the molar mass of naphthalene is determined using a Beckmann freezing apparatus. Freezing-point depression can also be used as a purity analysis tool when analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The results obtained are in mol%, but the method has its place, where other methods of analysis fail. This is also the same principle acting in the melting-point depression observed when the melting point of an impure solid mixture is measured with a melting-point apparatus since melting and freezing points both refer to the liquid-solid phase transition (albeit in different directions). In principle, the boiling-point elevation and the freezing-point depression could be used interchangeably for this purpose. However, the cryoscopic constant is larger than the ebullioscopic constant, and the freezing point is often easier to measure with precision, which means measurements using the freezing-point depression are more precise. Also, this phenomenon is applicable in preparing a freezing mixture for use in an ice-cream machine. For this purpose, NaCl or another salt is used to lower the melting point of ice. Last but not the least, FPD measurements are used in the dairy industry to ensure that milk has not had extra water added. Milk with a FPD of over 0.509 °C is considered to be unadulterated.  Of a solvent and a nonvolatile solute  Consider the problem in which the solvent freezes to a very nearly pure crystal, regardless of the presence of the nonvolatile solute. This typically occurs simply because the solute molecules do not fit well in the crystal, i.e. substituting a solute for a solvent molecule in the crystal has high enthalpy. In this case, for low solute concentrations, the freezing point depression depends solely on the concentration of solute particles, not on their individual properties. The freezing point depression thus is called a colligative property. The explanation for the freezing point depression is then simply that as solvent molecules leave the liquid and join the solid, they leave behind a smaller volume of liquid in which the solute particles can roam. The resulting reduced entropy of the solute particles thus is independent of their properties. This approximation ceases to hold when the concentration becomes large enough for solute-solute interactions to become important. In that case, the freezing point depression depends on particular properties of the solute other than its concentration. Calculation If the solution is treated as an ideal solution, the extent of freezing-point depression depends only on the solute concentration that can be estimated by a simple linear relationship with the cryoscopic constant (\\"Blagden's Law\\"): :ΔTF = KF · b · i, where: * ΔTF, the freezing-point depression, is defined as TF (pure solvent) − TF (solution). * KF, the cryoscopic constant, which is dependent on the properties of the solvent, not the solute. (Note: When conducting experiments, a higher KF value makes it easier to observe larger drops in the freezing point.

This simple relation doesn't include the nature of the solute, so this is only effective in a diluted solution. For a more accurate calculation at a higher concentration, for ionic solutes, Ge and Wang (2010) proposed a new equation: : \\\\Delta T_\\\\text{F} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\text{fus}_{T_\\\\text{F}} - 2RT_\\\\text{F} \\\\cdot \\\\ln a_\\\\text{liq} - \\\\sqrt{2\\\\Delta C^\\\\text{fus}_p T^2_\\\\text{F}R \\\\cdot \\\\ln a_\\\\text{liq} + (\\\\Delta H^\\\\text{fus}_{T_\\\\text{F}})^2}}{2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\text{fus}_{T_\\\\text{F}}}{T_\\\\text{F}} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta C^\\\\text{fus}_p}{2} - R \\\\cdot \\\\ln a_\\\\text{liq}\\\\right)}. In the above equation, TF is the normal freezing point of the pure solvent (273 K for water, for example); aliq is the activity of the solvent in the solution (water activity for aqueous solution); ΔHfusTF is the enthalpy change of fusion of the pure solvent at TF, which is 333.6 J/g for water at 273 K; ΔCfusp is the difference between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid phases at TF, which is 2.11 J/(g·K) for water. The solvent activity can be calculated from the Pitzer model or modified TCPC model, which typically requires 3 adjustable parameters. For the TCPC model, these parameters are available for many single salts.

His interests were rooted primarily in psychology, pastoral ministry, spirituality, social justice and community. Over the course of his life, Nouwen was heavily influenced by the work of Anton Boisen, Thomas Merton, Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh, and Jean Vanier. After nearly two decades of teaching at academic institutions including the University of Notre Dame, Yale Divinity School and Harvard Divinity School, Nouwen went on to work with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities at the L'Arche Daybreak community in Richmond Hill, Ontario.  Biography  =Early life= Major seminary in Rijsenburg Henri Nouwen was born in Nijkerk, the Netherlands on January 24, 1932. He was the oldest of four children born to Laurent J. M. Nouwen and Maria Nouwen (née Ramselaar). Nouwen's father was a tax lawyer and his mother worked as a bookkeeper for her family's business in Amersfoort. His younger brother was a prominent Dutch businessman and his uncle was a Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Utrecht and a co-founder of the . Nouwen studied at the Jesuit Aloysius College in The Hague before spending a year at the minor seminary in Apeldoorn. His year at the school was spent preparing for six years of study for the priesthood, consisting of training in philosophy and theology, at the major seminary in Rijsenburg. =Priesthood= Nouwen was ordained a Catholic priest for the Archdiocese of Utrecht on July 21, 1957, by Bernardus Alfrink at St. Catherine's Cathedral in Utrecht. Eager to learn more about himself and the people he counseled, Nouwen requested permission from Alfrink to study psychology instead of theology. His request was granted and from 1957 to 1964 he studied at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. In studying the fundamentals of clinical psychology, Nouwen struggled with the lack of interdisciplinary analysis. He sought to use psychology as a means of exploring the human side of faith which he felt was being overlooked, from a pastoral standpoint, in broader theological discussions. During his studies at the university, he was greatly influenced by Han Fortmann, a Dutch psychologist of religion whose writing about action and contemplation in a busy world are mirrored in Nouwen's own work. For his thesis work, Nouwen focused on Anton Boisen, an American minister credited with founding the clinical pastoral education movement. The thesis was not approved due to a lack of scientific analysis and clinical study. Rather than revising the work to obtain a doctorate, Nouwen completed his studies in 1964 by obtaining a doctorandus degree. The Menninger Clock Tower After receiving his doctorandus, Nouwen studied for two years as a Fellow in the Religion and Psychiatry Program at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, and was influenced by psychologist Gordon Allport.Genius Born of Anguish: Henri Nouwen Talk by official biographer Michael W. Higgins, Avila Carmelite Centre in Donnybrook, Dublin 4 on Thursday, January 17 Nouwen completed his clinical pastoral training at the Topeka State Hospital and graduated from the Menninger Foundation's training program in theology and psychiatric theory on June 19, 1965. During his time at the Clinic he found he preferred direct contact with patients over the more scientific and medical analysis of certain branches of psychology. This prompted an examination of his professional practice in order to better integrate spiritual ministry with modern psychology. Over the course of this same period, Nouwen began to engage with social and political happenings, including the Civil Rights Movement. In 1965 he traveled to the Southern United States to participate in, and later publish an article about, the Selma to Montgomery marches. From 1966 to 1968 he was a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame. From 1968 to 1970 he worked at the Amsterdam Joint Pastoral Institute and taught psychology and spirituality at the Catholic Theological University of Utrecht. In 1971 he received his doctorandus degree in theology. Between 1971 and 1981 Nouwen was a professor of pastoral theology at Yale Divinity School, where he began to establish a broad readership of his work as a contributor to various publications including the National Catholic Reporter and as the author of several books based on personal experience. During his time at Yale, Nouwen took several sabbaticals, some of which informed his writing. In 1976 he was a Fellow at the Collegeville Institute for Ecumenical and Cultural Research at Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville, Minnesota, and in 1978 he was scholar-in-residence at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. While a professor at Yale Nouwen also spent several months at the Abbey of the Genesee. His first visit began on June 1, 1974, and lasted seven months. While there he kept a journal that was published as Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery in 1976. He returned again in 1979, after the death of his mother, which led to the publication of A Cry For Mercy: Prayers from the Genesee. Though Nouwen concluded he was not suited for the trappist life, the Abbey of the Genesee and his relationship with then abbott John Eudes Bamberger continued to be of great importance to him. The Abbey served as his home base for more than a year after he resigned from Yale and it was where he chose to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on August 6, 1982. After leaving Yale in 1981, Nouwen took a six-month trip to South America visiting Bolivia and Peru. Upon his return to the United States in 1983, Nouwen was appointed at the Harvard Divinity School as Professor of Divinity and Horace De Y. Lentz Lecturer. The half-time appointment allowed Nouwen to split his time between teaching at the Divinity School and working with a theological center in Latin America. Nouwen taught at the school until his resignation in 1985. In 1985 and 1986 he spent nine months with the L'Arche community in France. =L'Arche= Nouwen's spirituality was greatly influenced by his friendship with Jean Vanier. The two men met while Nouwen was teaching at Harvard. Vanier sensed how lost Nouwen was feeling and invited him to visit Trosly-Breuil. Nouwen visited Vanier at the French community, the first in the L'Arche network, twice before returning in 1985 for a nine-month residency. The stay helped Nouwen find a purpose that had been missing. As Robert A. Jonas explains: \\"Henri had always wondered what a Eucharistically centered community would be like, and now he had found one at L'Arche.\\" During Nouwen's time in France he traveled to Toronto, Ontario, to officiate at a wedding and sought permission to stay for a week at L'Arche Daybreak in Richmond Hill. While there a core member named Raymond was hit by a car and left in critical condition. Nouwen provided spiritual guidance to the community and Raymond’s family, ultimately helping to reconcile the community and the family, who partially blamed Daybreak for Raymond's injuries. Nouwen's intervention had such an impact that the Daybreak members asked him to serve as their pastor. Nouwen accepted and moved in the fall of 1986 to L'Arche Daybreak, where he would spend the last ten years of his life. While at Daybreak Nouwen was paired with Adam Arnett, a core member at L'Arche Daybreak with profound developmental disabilities.\\"It is I, not Adam, who gets the main benefit from our friendship,\\" Nouwen insisted.Philip Yancey, \\"Holy Inefficiency\\", Christianity Today, Vol. 40, No. 14, (9 December 1996): 80. Nouwen wrote about his relationship with Arnett in a book entitled Adam: God's Beloved. =Sexuality= Geysteren, NL memorial Nouwen struggled with his sexuality, which may have contributed to his feelings of self-doubt. Although this struggle was known by those close to him, Nouwen never publicly identified as homosexual despite acknowledging the matter in discussions with friends and alluding to a personal struggle in his private journals. In his book The Return of the Prodigal Son, Nouwen describes a friendship that had him under a spell, did him no good and when it finally collapsed left him in a depressive mood and in search of self-esteem and acceptance by others. Biographer Michael Ford referenced these instances in the biography Wounded Prophet, which was published after Nouwen's death. Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of chastity and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced. \\"This took an enormous emotional, spiritual and physical toll on his life and may have contributed to his early death.\\" While his struggle to reconcile his priestly vows of chastity with his human desire for physical and emotional intimacy appears in his writings, there is no evidence that Nouwen ever broke his vow of chastity. =Death and legacy= Nouwen died in the Netherlands on September 21, 1996, from a sudden heart attack, while en route to Russia to participate in a Dutch documentary about his book The Return of the Prodigal Son. Nouwen's first funeral Mass was held on September 24 at St. Catherine's Cathedral in Utrecht with a eulogy offered by Jean Vanier, after which Nouwen's body was flown to Canada for burial by the L'Arche Daybreak community. The second funeral Mass was held on September 28 at the Slovak Catholic Cathedral of the Transfiguration in Markham, Ontario, following a full-day wake at St. Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Richmond Hill on September 27. Nouwen was laid to rest in a pine coffin built in L'Arche Daybreak's The Woodery and colourfully painted by members of the community. He is buried in St. John's Anglican Church Cemetery in Richmond Hill in keeping with his desire to be near the graves of other Daybreak community members. There is also a memorial marker for Nouwen in Geysteren, NL at the grave site of his parents. Prior to his death he entrusted Sue Mosteller with his estate, making her the literary executrix of his works. The founding of the Henri J.M. Nouwen Archives and Research Collection at the John M. Kelly Library, University of St. Michael's College, was the culmination of Mosteller's effort to centralize Nouwen's personal records. The work involved organizing his material at L'Arche Daybreak, which included personal correspondence, original manuscripts, and audio visual material, and negotiating with the Yale Divinity School Library for the release of records Nouwen had begun depositing there as a faculty member in 1975. The Nouwen Archives opened in September 2000. He has an award named for him, the Henri Nouwen Leadership Award, given out by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Religion and Spirituality Division. There is an endowed lectureship in Classical Christian Spirituality named after him at Drew University. There is also an elementary school named after him in Richmond Hill, Ontario.Richmond  Writing  \\"Terugkeer van de Verloren Zoon\\" by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn. Nouwen wrote a short book, The Return of the Prodigal Son, based on his contemplation of Rembrandt's painting of the same name. Before his death Nouwen published 39 books and authored hundreds of articles. His books have sold over 7 million copies worldwide and have been published in more than 30 languages. In a magazine survey conducted by Christian Century in 2003 Nouwen's work was indicated as a first choice of authors for Catholic and mainline Protestant clergy. His books include The Wounded Healer, In the Name of Jesus, Clowning in Rome, The Life of the Beloved and The Way of the Heart, along with what is recognized as one of his most popular books, The Return of the Prodigal Son. While visiting the L'Arche Trosly-Breuil community in France, he saw a poster of Rembrandt's painting The Return of the Prodigal Son that made a deep impression on him. He decided to see the painting personally and traveled to Saint Petersburg (Leningrad at that time) to visit the Hermitage Museum where it is kept. This resulted in a several-day contemplation of the painting, which prompted him to write a book of the same name. The Return of the Prodigal Son was ranked number 66 on a list of 100 best Christian books compiled by the Church Times in 2014. =Themes= Nouwen was known to suffer from loneliness and a need for interpersonal connection, which he wrote about openly. His popularity as a spiritual guide has been linked to his capacity to describe his personal struggles in a relatable manner. He credited his approach to an interest in the daily life of people and his own journey with Christian life: One of Nouwen's major ongoing themes involved his struggle reconciling his depression with his Christian faith. His most famous work on this topic is the Inner Voice of Love, his diary from December 1987 to June 1988 during one of his most serious bouts with clinical depression. Nouwen also explored this theme in Return of the Prodigal Son, describing love and forgiveness as unconditional. In the book, he invites the reader to follow him in his personal return to the spiritual fountains and in a parallel meditation on all the characters of the parable, their rendering by Rembrandt, and the painter's personal life. Nouwen also wrote several essays on the necessity of peacemaking. He used God's Love as a justification for the preservation of life, as well as for his opposition to both the ongoing Cold War and the intervention of the United States in Vietnam. This was of a piece with his conviction of the oneness of all peoples under God: Public speaking Nouwen was a frequent public speaker. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, he traveled extensively leading retreats and sermons. With a distinct accent and animated speaking style, Nouwen was known for his engaging and expressive style of communication. The experience of seeing him preach has been compared to being at the theater or seeing a musical conductor at work. It was not uncommon for Nouwen to enthusiastically jump around or wave his arms and hands during speaking events and classroom lectures. Bob Massie describes the experience of watching Nouwen speak in Befriending Life (2001): \\"His squeezing, tugging gestures made it look like he was striving to milk meaning directly out of the air. He would point his fingers down and rotate his wrists as through trying to stir a separate little pot with each digit.\\" Nouwen appealed to many audiences, including Anglicans and evangelicals because of his Jesus-centered spirituality. In 1992 he was invited by Robert H. Schuller to preach on Hour of Power at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Nouwen appeared over three consecutive Sundays and preached on the topic of belovedness. Recordings of his appearance were later used by Schuller as a model for preaching when instructing new ministers.

It later became part of the South African-based holding company Strategic Resource Corporation.The Privatisation of Violence: New mercenaries and the state Christopher Wrigley CAAT March 1999 History =Background= In 1989, following the conclusion of South African Border Wars in Angola and Namibia, the apartheid regime in South Africa was beginning to dissolve. The South African Defence Force was looking at broad cuts in its personnel. African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela demanded that then South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk dismantle some of the South African and South-West African Special Forces units such as 32 Battalion and Koevoet. One of these was the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), a unit that carried out covert operations which included assassinations of government opponents, and worked to bypass the United Nations apartheid sanctions by setting up overseas front companies. Only Koevoet – being part of the South West African Police (SWAPOL) – was disbanded as part of independence negotiations for South-West Africa (now Namibia). Many members of the other units, or simply former national servicemen, were recruited by Executive Outcomes (EO). =Formation= Eeben Barlow & Michael Mullen formerly in charge of the Western European section of the CCBEeben Barlow's autobiography: Executive Outcomes – Against all Odds – established Executive Outcomes (EO) in 1989. Its aim was to provide specialised covert training to Special Forces members. Barlow was also awarded a contract by Debswana to train a selected group of security officers to infiltrate and penetrate the illegal diamond dealing syndicates in Botswana. When Debswana discovered EO was training the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), it promptly cancelled EO's contract. \\"Many of Barlow's Special Forces students would later join him at EO after he started recruiting men to assist with the training of the Angolan forces,\\" says Walter Halicki, one of Eeben's associates in the FAA. The company also went on to recruit many of its personnel from the units President F. W. De Klerk disbanded. Even former enemy fighters of the uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army were recruited as well since many were found out of work after their own restructuring and integration to the South African National Defense Force. At its peak, EO employed about 2,000 former soldiers. Barlow registered Executive Outcomes Ltd in the UK on the insistence of the South African Reserve Bank. There is some confusion over this issue as a top secret British intelligence report states that “Executive Outcomes was registered in the UK on September 1993 by Anthony (Tony) Buckingham, a British businessman and Simon Mann, a former British officer”. Buckingham denies that he registered EO in London and consistently denies any \\"corporate ties\\" to EO. =Key personnel= Apart from founder Eeben Barlow (CEO), other senior EO personnel were Lafras Luitingh (Deputy to CEO) and Nic van der Bergh (CEO after Barlow resigned). Senior associates included Simon Mann and Tony Buckingham, who, along with Barlow and Luitingh were the executive officers of Ibis Air, the aircraft procurement organisation for Executive Outcomes which was essentially their private \\"air force\\". Pilot Crause Steyl was the South African-based director of Ibis Air. =Activities= Executive Outcomes initially trained and later fought on behalf of the Angolan government against UNITA after UNITA refused to accept the election results in 1992. This contract was awarded to the company after EO had assisted Ranger Oil with an equipment recovery operation in the harbour town of Soyo. Dubbed by the South African media as an attempt to assassinate the rebel leader Dr. Jonas Savimbi, EO found itself under constant UNITA attacks where it lost three of its men. This action saw EO as being recognised by the FAA and a contract to train its forces was duly awarded. In a short space of time, UNITA was defeated on the battlefield and sued for peace. The Angolan government, under pressure from the UN and the US, were forced to terminate EO's contract. EO was replaced by the UN's peacekeeping force known as UNAVEM. Angola returned to war shortly thereafter. In March 1995, the company contained an insurrection of guerrillas known as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone, regained control of the diamond fields, and forced a negotiated peace.The New Mercenaries and the Privatization of Conflict Thomas K. Adams. Parameters, Summer 1999 In both these instances they are credited with rescuing both governments against RUF and UNITA. In the case of Angola this led to a cease fire and the Lusaka Protocol, which ended the Angolan civil war – albeit only for a few years. In Sierra Leone, however, the government capitulated to international pressure to have EO withdraw in favour of an ineffective peacekeeping force, allowing the RUF to rebuild and sack the capital in \\"Operation No Living Thing\\". Professional soldiers and military hardware =Executive Outcomes= As is characteristic of one of the first PMCs, Executive Outcomes was directly involved militarily in Angola and Sierra Leone. The company was notable in its ability to provide all aspects of a highly trained modern army to the less professional government forces of Sierra Leone and Angola. For instance, in Sierra Leone, Executive Outcomes fielded not only professional fighting men, but armour and support aircraft such as one Mi-24 Hind and two Mi-8 Hip helicopters, the BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle and T-72 main battle tank. These were bought from sources in the worldwide arms trade within Africa as well as Eastern Europe. =Ibis Air= Ibis air is a partner business entity that provides EO with airborne services, including medevac capabilities via a Boeing 727 D2-FLZ. Ibis Air also owned MiG-23 \\"Flogger\\" fighters and a small fleet of Pilatus PC-7 turbo- prop trainers converted for the reconnaissance and ground attack capabilities via SNEB air-to-ground rockets). Ibis Air also had the connections to operate MiG-27 \\"Flogger\\" strike aircraft and Su-25 \\"Frogfoot\\" close support aircraft for EO that were loaned out via the Angolan Air Force. Major contracts Executive Outcomes had contracts with multinational corporations such as De Beers, Chevron, Rio Tinto Zinc and Texaco. The governments of Angola, Sierra Leone, and Indonesia were also clients. Dissolution Executive Outcomes actively encouraged the South African government to enforce a regulation of PMCs as several South African and international companies were masquerading for work under the banner of Executive Outcomes. Additionally, Executive Outcomes was actively engaged in providing input into the formulation of the bill which became known as \\"Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act\\" in 1998. Executive Outcomes was duly provided with a licence stipulating that it met the requirements of the newly introduced Act. Executive Outcomes was dissolved on 31 December 1998. The aim of the Act was to stop mercenary activities by the dual actions of: # preventing direct participation as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain including the training, recruitment and use of mercenaries; and, # requiring approval of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee for offering of military assistance overseas.Chapter 2 — The Private Military Companies' Perspective Select Committee on Foreign Affairs 1 August 2002 Sandline International Executive Outcomes was often loosely linked with the United Kingdom private military company Sandline International, but in 1997 Sandline directly subcontracted Executive Outcomes for their operation in Papua New Guinea to oust the rebels holding the Pangua mine on Bougainville Island which led to the so-called \\"Sandline affair\\" when news of the government's intention to hire mercenaries was leaked to the Australian press. The Commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, Jerry Singirok – who reversed his support for the operation – ordered the detaining of all the mercenaries on their arrival, and forced the Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan to resign with Papua New Guinea coming close to a military coup.

Across the Pak-Afghan border, a smaller number of Khattaks are scattered in Kandahar, Ghazni, Logar and Khost in Afghanistan.

A number of Khattak are also found in Swat valley near Ramet village (Hawai) and Madyan verified by residents lived there and by presence of their tribe names “Khattak” in the land records of Bahrain. History =Migration from today's Afghanistan= Early records show migration of the Khattak from Ghazni, Ghor and Logar of modern-day Afghanistan. Later on, the Khattak settled in the Shawal region of present-day Waziristan in Pakistan. Subsequently, they migrated further eastwards and settled in Bannu District, where the Pashtun tribes of Mangal and Honai were already settled. In the 14th century, the Shitaks, a tribe allied to the Khattaks which also previously held Shawal, migrated to Bannu. The Shitaks first defeated and drove away the Mangals and the Honais, and later gradually captured Bannu and pushed the Khattaks northwards to the southern portions of Kohat, where the Khattaks settled in Bahadur Khel and Teri. Then the Khattak allied with the Bangash, defeated the other Pashtun tribes, and occupied northeastern Kohat, Gumbat, Pattiala and Zira Tippas. Eventually, the Khattak settled in Karak and Nowshera (Pabbi, Jalozai, Kotle,Bakhti, Shahkot, Salehana,chapri, Dak Asmail Khel, Khesare, Lakare, Spin Kanre, Spinkhak, Urmar) and finally a small number migrated to Nizampur, Mardan and Malakand.

Khattak also migrated from Akora Khattak more than 100 years ago, and settled down in city of Mansehra in the current day province of Khyber Pashtunkhwa. They are settled in the city of Mansehra, and in the villages of Lambi Dheri, Kotkay, Jhagir, and Labarkot. In addition, they are settled in some areas of Abbottabad. =Khushal Khan Khattak= A warrior poet by the name of Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1690) was once the chief of this tribe, and his contributions to Pashto literature are considered as classic texts. His life and times are one of the most chronicled and discussed subjects in Pashtun history, as he was active on the political, social and intellectual fora of his times. He was a most voluminous writer, and composed no less than three hundred and sixty literary works, both in the Pashto and Persian languages. His poetry revolves around concepts of Honour, Justice, Bravery and Nationalism and his works have been translated into numerous languages, English and Urdu being the primary ones. =Older references= According to Nimatullah's 1620 work History of The Afghans, the Khattaks are amongst the oldest of the Afghan tribes.Deportation by the Assyrians, Makhzan-i Afghani, page 37: http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3034/?ql=eng&i;=gcu&view;_type=gallery Their history has been closely knit with that of the khattak have given the place to Yusafzai tribe from their first settlement around the mountains of Ghor and Ghazni to present day East-Central and North-Eastern Pukhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan.

Herodotus, without assigning a name to the satrapy, tells us that Darius' yth Satrapy was inhabited by four tribes, the Sattagudai, the Gandarioi, the Dadikai, and the Aparutai.\\"The Pathans 550 B.C.-A.D. 1957\\" printed St Martin's Press 1958 by MacMillan and Company Limited\\"\\"The Pathans 55O B.C.-A.D. 1957 By Sir Olaf Caroe\\" The addition of the Aparutai/Aparidai correspondence helps to buttress the case for finding in Herodotus traces of names which carry through to the present day. Bellew has gone further and identified the Sattagudai with the famous Khatak tribe. \\"The Pathans 55O B.C.-A.D. 1957\\" printed St Martin's Press 1958 by MacMillan and Company Limited\\" =Sattagudai= Numerous historians identify the Khattak with the Sattagudai.The Histories of Herodotus, George Rawlinson, Translation 1858–1860.Guardians of the Khaibar Pass: the social organisation and history of the Afridis of Pakistan David M.

Sir Olaf Caroe, The Pathans 550BC 1957AD: :\\"Let us now refer to the third passage cited, in which Herodotus, without assigning a name to the satrapy, tells us that Darius' yth Satrapy was inhabited by four tribes, the Sattagudai, the Gandarioi, the Dadikai, and the Aparutai. Bellew has gone further and identified the Sattagudai with the famous Khatak tribe, and the Dadikai with an obscure branch of Kakars whom he calls Dadi.\\" =Khattaks and Shetaks= Sir Olaf Caroe, The Pathans 550BC 1957AD: :\\"Neither Khataks nor Shitaks appear by name until the period of publication of genealogies under the Mughals, and the time of Akbar's dealings with the Khataks for the protection of the highway to Peshawar. Babur indeed in his memoirs mentions the Karranis (Karlanis) whom he encountered in 1505 around Bannu along with the Niazis and Isakhel. It is probable that this reference of his is to Khattaks or Shitaks, or both, for both are Karlani tribes, and the other Karlanis who live in that area, Wazirs and Bangash, Babur mentions by name when he comes to them.\\" It is thus clear that Babur & other Mughals in their descriptions identify Khattaks & Shetaks together without any differentiation. =In Pashtun history= Sir Olaf Caroe, The Pathans 550BC 1957AD: Theory of Israelite descent Khattak tribe has oral traditions and legendary history of descent from the Israelites.Ferishta, History Of The Mohammedan Power. The Packard Humanities Institute Persian Texts in Translation, Book 1 Chapter 2 page 11, Part II page 54 and Part II page 130, (90) Khushal Khan Khattak, chosen malak in 1641, believed that malak was a continuation of the Israelite title malak given to the legendary progenitors King Saul and Malak Afghana.Dastar Nama, Khushal Khan Khattak, Pashto Academy, University of Peshawar. Khushal expresses that the Khattak reputation for fierceness and valor stems from the fact that Khattaks and Afghans have been nursed by the Lioness’s (King Saul’s wife) milk.Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, Volume 54, Issues 3-4, Page 30.Perspective, Volume 4, Pakistan Publications., 1971.Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, Volume 54, Issues 3-4, Pakistan Historical Society, 2006 - Page 86. One of the first progenitors of the modern tribe is Manal. Manal is considered to be a modification of Manas from the word Manasseh. In his book The Armies of India, A.C. Lovett declares the Khattaks to be a widely enlisted tribe, who also lay claim to the Pashtun Jewish descent.The Armies of India, A. C. Lovett, Major, The Lancer International Inc., 19558 S. Harlem Avenue, Suit 1, Frankfort IL. 60423., 224 pages, Page 152. Theory of descent from the Greeks After the creation of Pakistan, some Pakistani scholars, suggested a Greek descent for the Khattaks. However from the Histories of Herodotus, Herodotus, Book 3, 91., it is clear that a tribe by the name of SattaGydae (or Sattagudai) were already settled in the area around current day Ghor in Afghanistan and paid as tribute coinage and materials to the Greeks when they subjugated these areas: \\"The Sattagudai and the Gandarioi and the Dadikai and the Aparutai, who were all reckoned together paid 170 talents.\\" Later Bellew, Caroe and other historians both Pashtun and Western through their works identified the Sattagudai with the famous Khatak & Shitak tribes. \\"The Pathans 550 B.C.-A.D. 1957\\" printed St Martin's Press 1958 by MacMillan and Company Limited\\" Though all Afghan DNA including Khattak DNA has minor contributions from haplogroups more common to the Greeks, these are minor enough to rule out a direct lineage. Together with works from Herodotus and more recent historians, the theory of Khattak descent from the Greeks is unfounded. Afridi and Khattak history Sir Olaf Caroe, \\"The Pathans 550BC - 1957AD\\" : :\\"The Afridis and Khataks lumped together as Karlanis, can be held to reflect a knowledge that they represented a more aboriginal stock, which only later absorbed the characteristics of the invaders. In other words, it is not surprising that in looking for a prototype in the oldest recorded history bearing on this region we hit on the ancestor of the Pakhtun.\\" One theory of the Oriya Khel is below: 1\\\\. A sub tribe of the Kattaks known as Oriya Khel has the DNA of both the Khattak and Afridi tribes. Oriya was an Afridi woman who married a Khattak chief known as Saleh Khan and from their off spring we now have the Oriya Khel sub tribe, consisting of the following 5 villages: Saleh Khana, Kotli Kalan, Bakhte, Sappara/Chapri and Kotli Khurd. 2\\\\. The other theory is that some of the Oriya Khel is that The people of these villages belong to the Zakha Khel clan and then the sub clan Oriya Khel of the Afridi tribe. This could only be the case if the male progeny belonged to the Afridi Zama Khel tribe. these tribals have migrated from their homeland in the Tirah valley in Afghanistan to their current village during the 17 century. 3\\\\. A third and more realistic assertion is one that combines the above. The different Khels in the villages above may be better explained as an amalgamation of people from different backgrounds coming to settle in the area for work. The British who were at a confrontational footing with the Afridi and would not let Afridia settle in the area allowed the Khattaks to settle in the area that was used for arms trade and repair. The Area being known as Aslah khanna. The Various Khels who has settled rebranded themselves as Khattaks to survive in annonymity and retain title and ownership of the lands given and taken. Such is the case of the Tatar Khel who are seen as a branch of the Afridi Adam Khel and also present in various Sajaras. The same Tatar Khel seem to be more paile in complexion than some of the other Khels. The Zaka Khel are also present but they are not the whole tribe. =Molding and amalgamation= Sir Olaf Caroe, \\"The Pathans 550BC - 1957AD\\" : :\\"This is not to assert that the ethnic or linguistic stock can be traced through to tribes of similar names today. The case would be rather that these were sub-stratum agglomerations of people who, through contact with later-comers, modified their language and were assimilated to later cultures, but retained in the more inaccessible places sufficient of their older inspirations to boast their original names. The theory does at least give a starting-point to Pathan history & the stock belief in the Bani Israel.\\" The Khattak super Tribe and sub tribes. Khattak Family Tree.  Demographics  The Khattak sub tribes include the Seni Khattak (Kohat), Barak Khattak (Karak), bora a Khel Khattak (From Lundkhur to Nizampur), Mungi Khel Khattak (Shakar Dara), Mattu Khel Khattak (Shakar Darra), and the Saghri Khattak (Narra Kanjoor, chhab, nakka afghan, INJRA AFGHAN, injra, Jand - Attock). They also live in Sndh, Balochistan and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. In past there was democratic process to make a new leader of the tribe by vote of leaders of clans. each tribe leader was given extra land as Jagir (padgai or pagrrai) to cover the expenses of his Public Kitchen (Langer). There are 3 Chieftain of Khattak's, Khan of Terri, Akora and Makhad. it seems till the time of Khushal Khan, khattaks were having one Chieftain at Akora. Bangi khels live at Narrah (Taraf Jamal Khel of Narrah) Bani Afghan, Tabbi sari at Mianwali and some village at Shakar Dara District Kohat. Bangi khel are much in count so mostly considered separate tribe of Khattak's but actually Bangi khel and Akora's are part of Saghri's. Saghris living at Shakardara are called as \\"Topi Sughri\\" whereas at Attock are called \\"nar-rray sughri\\" in local dialect. According to Punjab government revenue record, Saghri khattak's living at Tehsil Jand belong to the following clans/ Pats. Taraf Narrah comprise the Patti khosar khel, Patti Nanadrak, Patti Khatter khel, Patti Abdullh Khel and Patti Chandel Khel, Patti Taraf Syeded Khel comprise Patti Nanadrak, Kotiwal, Qureshi, Bangash, Awan, Malyar and Sarban and Patti Taraf Jamal khel. The property belonging to each Patti is separately compiled as book to avoid mistake due to repetition of names. This system provide authentic family tree through inherited land transfer record. today each Patti is sub divided in dozens of sub khels. Saghris that live in shakardara they in the past were warlike people and didn't have written history but wisely they recorded their existence through naming their new settlements with old names.  Lund Khwar  Lund Khwar was known in the old days as Sammah. The Khattaks here are the direct descendants of those khattak warriors who came down from the khattak hilly areas and settled down in the early sixteenth century during the times of the great Khushal Khan Khattak. In his campaign of Swat, Khushal Khan Khattak had camped here and those of the Khattaks that live here today helped him in his wars against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

Urban Fantasy: A Literature of the Unseen in The Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts, Volume 27, No.3. 452-69. a subgenre of fantasy in which the narrative uses supernatural elements in a 19th-century to 21st-century (or equivalent) urban society. It usually takes place in the present day (or the equivalent of the \\"present day\\"). (Archived by WebCite® at ) Characteristics * Works of urban fantasy may be set in an approximation of our world in which fantastic exists secretly or in a world (such as an alternative history) in which it occurs openly (or some combination of the above). Elements such as magic, paranormal beings, other worlds and so on, may exist here. Common themes include coexistence or conflict between humans and other beings, and the changes such characters and events bring to local life are the mainspring. Many authors, publishers, and readers distinguish them from works of paranormal romance, which use similar characters and settings, but focus on the romantic relationships between characters. =Unrelated uses of \\"urban fantasy\\"= The term urban fantasy was used in print from as far back as the early 20th century. It originally described a characteristic of some object or place. Horst Schmidt-Brummer's 1973 book about Venice, California is subtitled \\"An Urban Fantasy\\", to denote a nostalgic appreciation for the unique city. In New York Times advertisements in 1928 through 1930 for the St. Regis hotel, the term implies that the hotel is a sort of paradise: \\"Never was an urban fantasy so enchanting...\\" History =Predecessors= Occult detective stories, such as Manly Wade Wellman's John Thunstone stories, written originally during the 1940s. Wellman has been noted by many current authors for bringing contemporary characters and American settings into the fantasy and horror genres.http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/wellman_interview/ Earlier occult detective stories differ from urban fantasy in that they presented supernatural beings and sorcery as unnatural and aberrant and a danger to the lives of ordinary citizens. A number of stories in Unknown magazine (1939-1943), conceived by its editor, John W. Campbell as roughly the fantasy equivalent of Campbell's Astounding science fiction magazine. The stories here tended to take place in the present and to take a more rational, science fictional approach. Here, writers such as Fritz Leiber (with his \\"Smoke Ghost\\", published in 1941), Jack Williamson with \\"Darker Than You Think\\" (originally published 1940), H. L. Gold (with his \\"Trouble with Water', published in 1939) and L. Sprague de Camp's \\"Nothing in the Rules\\" (1939) presented ghosts, lycanthropes, gnomes, mermaids, demons and more, in a modern setting, with horrific and/or humorous results. The prolific de Camp and his writing partner, war game inventor Fletcher Pratt, explored urban material with their stories of Harold Shea in the 1940s and Gavagan's Bar stories in the 1950s. =1970s–early 1980s= The 1974 TV show Kolchak: The Night Stalker was an occult detective series featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter uncovering and battling supernatural creatures (e.g. vampires and zombies) in an urban environment. Unbelieved and unappreciated, considered by his boss, colleagues, the police and the public as something between a crackpot or an insane murderer as he struggles with both real and metaphorical demons in each episode. This series spun off from the 1972 horror movie The Night Stalker. Isaac Asimov's Azazel stories, most of which were written in the 1980s, take some of their urban character of his mystery stories initially published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. In the cinema, the re-write of Dan Aykroyd's original 1982 science fiction comedy script for Ghostbusters by Harold Ramis replaced the futuristic setting for the present day.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-aykroyd-on-ghostbusters-lost- origins-writing-p/1100-6467751/ This effectively enabled the film to be made, and introduced to the mainstream the idea of fantastical events taking place in New York City. Two years later, Gremlins brought another batch of supernatural beings into our everyday world. At the same time another low- budget supernatural comedy success, Teen Wolf was popular enough to generate a television show, an animated cartoon, and a cinema sequel. Before its run was finished, another general-audience teen comedy with supernatural elements, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was in production. =1980s and 1990s= The term began to come into its present use in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This development is apparent in the increased use of the term in contemporary reviews. Terri Windling's shared Borderlands universe, made up of a number of anthologies and novels, launched with the eponymous paperback original anthology, Borderland in 1986, followed up by Bordertown, also in 1986. The series was later touted by Neil Gaiman as \\"one of the most important places where Urban Fantasy began\\". An article in Tor.com has stated that \\"some say, Urban Fantasy was born in Bordertown,\\" which provided \\"young, beginning writers like Charles de Lint and Emma Bull\\" with a platform. Emma Bull's unrelated 1987 urban fantasy War for the Oaks, where fairy factions battle in present-day Minneapolis, also received interest and attention. Both Bull's novel and the Borderlands books emphasized young, poor, hip protagonists. In this, they had much in common with the usual protagonist of the cyberpunk sub- genre of science fiction. Sweet Silver Blues a 1987 novel by fantasy author Glen Cook began his Garrett P.I. series. These chronicled the adventures of a hardboiled detective in a fantasy world. Shadowrun, a tabletop RPG with a similar concept to the Borderlands universe appeared. Like those earlier books, Shadowrun took place in a future Earth setting (specifically 2050, in the first edition), after the reappearance of supernatural powers and beings. Players could play humans (cybernetically enhanced or otherwise), elves, dwarves or orcs, all in a dark high tech setting. The more definitely cyberpunk approach (jaundiced and gritty) of the game's universe exerted its own influence. =21st century= Several publications and writers have cited authors Laurell K. Hamilton and Kim Harrison as notable contributors to the genre. Entertainment Weekly, USA Today, and Time have recognized the longevity and influence of Hamilton's stories, while The New York Times and Amazon.com have noted the work of Kim Harrison. Author Courtney Allison Moulton has cited Hamilton's early works among her inspirations. Kelly Gay has noted Hamilton, Harrison, and Emma Bull as primary influences. Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files series have been described by Barnes and Noble as \\"the gold standard\\" for the genre; one of the books from the series was nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award. Novels =Adult fiction= While adult urban fantasy novels may stand- alone (like Mulengro by Charles de Lint or Emma Bull's War for the Oaks), the economics of the market favor series characters, and genre-crossing allows sales along multiple lines. Many urban-fantasy novels are told via a first- person narrative, and often feature mythological beings, romance, and female protagonists who are involved in law enforcement or vigilantism. Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series—which follows the investigations of a supernatural Federal Marshal during paranormal cases—has been called a substantial and influential work of the genre. Kim Harrison's Rachel Morgan novels, also regarded as inspirational works, feature a bounty-hunting \\"witch- born\\" demon who battles numerous supernatural foes. Multi-genre offerings combine urban fantasy with other established forms (e.g.: police procedurals, as we see in the Peter Grant stories of Ben Aaronovitch, or the Charlie Madigan series, by Kelly Gay, which explores challenges a police officer faces while trying to balance her paranormal cases with life as a single mother).0 In addition to books which present largely independent characters, certain stories feature men and women who are regularly partnered on adventures—often with an underlying romantic element. The Jaz Parks series, by Jennifer Rardin, follows the titular CIA operative and her vampire boss as they combat supernatural threats to national security. Jocelynn Drake's Dark Days novels follow a vampire named Mira and a vampire hunter named Danaus, who work together to protect their people from a mutual enemy. Night Huntress, a series by Jeaniene Frost, centers on a half-vampire named Catherine and a vampire bounty hunter called Bones, who gradually become lovers while battling the undead. =Teen fiction= In contrast to the \\"professional heroes\\" found in adult urban-fantasy novels, many novels aimed at young adult audiences follow inexperienced protagonists who are unexpectedly drawn into paranormal struggles. Amidst these conflicts, characters often gain allies, find romance, and, in some cases, develop or discover supernatural abilities of their own. In Kelley Armstrong's The Darkest Powers series, a group of teens with paranormal talents go on the run while fleeing from a persistent band of scientists. Gone, by Michael Grant, follows an isolated town in which adults have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a society of super-powered children behind. In Unearthly, by Cynthia Hand, a girl discovers that she is part angel and gifted with superhuman abilities, leading her to seek out her purpose on Earth. The Immortals series, by Alyson Noël, follows a girl who gains special abilities after recovering from an accident, and also grows close to a mysterious new boy at her school. Love triangles also play a prominent part in these and several other urban-fantasy novels. Coming-of-age themes and teen 'voices' also often distinguish young-adult urban fantasy from adult books in the genre. Boarding schools are a common setting in teen urban fantasy. Rampant, by Diana Peterfreund, follows a group of young women at a cloisters as they train to fight killer unicorns. The House of Night series, by P. C. and Kristin Cast, presents a school where future vampires are disciplined while on the path to transformation, during which several romantic conflicts and other clashes ensue. Claudia Gray's Evernight novels center on a mysterious academy, where a romantic bond develops between a girl born to vampires, and a boy who hunts them. Fallen, by Lauren Kate, revolves around a student named Luce who finds herself drawn to a boy named Daniel, unaware that he is a fallen angel who shares a history with her. Other series, such as Carrie Jones's Need, have characters moving to new locations but attending public schools while discovering mysterious occurrences elsewhere in their towns. =Distinction from paranormal romance= In an online commentary, author Jeannie Holmes described differences between urban fantasy and paranormal romance: =Media tie-ins= Use of other forms of media has become a common part of the creation and promotion of urban-fantasy works. Music Several urban-fantasy authors cite music as an inspiration. Certain writers recommend songs or playlists on their official websites, including Courtney Allison Moulton, Jaye Wells, and Sarah J. Maas, who couple their recommendations with links to music-providing services. Publishers have also used music for book trailers, including the trailer for Carrie Jones's Captivate, which features the work of songwriter Derek Daisey. Original music is also produced. In 2010, musicians Alexandra Monir, Michael Bearden, and Heather Holley (a songwriter for Christina Aguilera's Stripped) collaborated to create songs for Monir's debut novel, Timeless. Video Book trailers are often used to promote urban-fantasy novels. Publishers such as HarperCollins also produce regular video interviews with debuting authors. Comics and manga Adaptations of urban-fantasy novels have appeared in comic books and manga. Among the tales to be adapted are Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, Patricia Briggs's Mercy Thompson stories, and Melissa Marr's Wicked Lovely. Film and television Works of urban fantasy have been adapted to or have originated in film and television. Well-known examples include the 1992 series Highlander and the TV adaptation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is regarded as a seminal work of the genre. Certain staples of urban-fantasy novels are also present in television shows. The concept of peaceful coexistence with paranormal beings is explored in the 1996 series Kindred: The Embraced, which focuses on secret vampire clans in San Francisco. Works such as Witchblade present the more common matter of a protagonist attempting to protect citizens. While urban-fantasy novels are often centered on heroines, television programs have regularly featured both genders in leading roles. Shows such as Beauty and the Beast, The Dresden Files, Forever Knight, Grimm, Moonlight, and Supernatural are based around male protagonists, while other programs, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, and Witchblade, focus largely on female protagonists. Authors The following is an incomplete list of notable authors of urban fantasy. According to 2013 statistics by the fantasy publisher Tor Books, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal romance, 57% are women and 43% are men, whereas men outnumber women by about two to one in writing historical, epic or high fantasy.

The experience of the German Jewish refugees coming to his home in Hungary for help after 1933 had left an abiding impression upon him. So in 1938, when Mikes had originally been sent to London to cover the Munich Crisis and expected to stay for only a couple of weeks, just one year before the outbreak of World War II he decided not to return to Hungary, and instead remained in England. He worked for the BBC's Hungarian Service from 1939 onwards, interrupted only by his internment as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man in 1940. Living in exile in England, he broadcast to Hungary for the BBC during World War II, and also collaborated with the Hungarian emigration, and wrote political cabaret for the London Podium, a Hungarian theatre in London at that time. From 1939 he also made documentaries for the BBC Hungarian section, at first as a freelance correspondent and, from 1950, as an employee. \\"George Mikes, 75; Wrote Gentle Satires And Serious Works\\", New York Times, 4 September 1987; retrieved 16 May 2017. He was naturalised as a British citizen in 1946. In 1956 he went back to Hungary to cover the Hungarian Revolution for BBC TV. From 1975 until his death on 30 August 1987 he also worked for the Hungarian section of Radio Free Europe. He was president of the London branch of PEN, and a member of the Garrick Club. Mikes wrote in both Hungarian and English, for The Observer, The Times Literary Supplement, Encounter, , , the Viennese Hungarian-language , and . His friends included the Hungarian writer Arthur Koestler, whose biography Mikes wrote (Arthur Koestler; the story of a friendship); J. B. Priestley; academic Doireann MacDermott; (Interview in English) and André Deutsch, whose publishing house promoted Mikes as a writer. \\"George Mikes, 75; Wrote Gentle Satires And Serious Works\\", New York Times, 4 September 1987; retrieved 16 May 2017. He married twice and had a son called Martin by his first marriage, and a daughter called Judith by his second. He died in London on 30 August 1987. On 15 September 1991, a memorial plaque was unveiled at his childhood home.  Publications  His first book published in 1945, was We Were There To Escape – the true story of a Jugoslav officer about life in prisoner-of-war camps. The Times Literary Supplement praised the book for the humour it showed in parts, which led him to write his most famous satiric book, How to be an Alien, which proved a great success in post-war Britain in 1946. This book poked gentle fun at the English, including a one-line chapter on sex: \\"Continental people have sex lives; the English have hot-water bottles.\\" In his subsequent books Mikes blended local jokes into his own humor, dealt with (among others) Japan (The Land of the Rising Yen), Israel (Milk and Honey, The Prophet Motive), the US (How to Scrape Skies), the United Nations (How to Unite Nations), Australia (Boomerang), the British again (How to be Inimitable and How to be Decadent, both collected with How to be an Alien as How to be a Brit), and South America (How to Tango). Other subjects include God (How to be God), his cat (Tsi-Tsa), wealth (How to be Poor) and philosophy (How to be a Guru). Apart from his commentaries, he wrote humorous fiction (Mortal Passion; The Spy Who Died of Boredom) and contributed to the satirical television series That Was The Week That Was. He wrote his ironic autobiography with the title How to be Seventy, published in 1982. Every now and then Mikes ventured the territory of serious literature, his serious writing included a book about the Hungarian secret police, and he narrated a BBC television report of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. According to Thomas Kabdebo, another Hungarian immigrant writer, Mikes's favorite comic device was to place himself an inveterate yet vulnerable traveller, an ardent rationalist with European values, where he discovers national pretensions behind proud phraseology. Thus, he was able to flesh out national stereotypes with comic characteristics. Mikes wrote over forty books, thirty-five of them humorous, however, in some way, it was a pity that his How to be an Alien was a long- lasting best seller. It pushed him into a category of a critic who was viewed with benign fondness and not considered a serious thinker. In the preface to the 24th impression of his book How to be an Alien, he reflects on the book's success:Preface to the 24th impression of How to be an Alien, > ”Since then I have actually written about a dozen books, but I might as well > have never written anything else. I remained the author of How to be an > Alien even after I had published a collection of serious essays.\\"  Selected bibliography  { valign=\\"top\\" * How to be an Alien: a handbook for beginners and more advanced pupils (1946) * How to Scrape Skies: the United States explored, rediscovered and explained (1948) * Wisdom for Others (1950) * Milk and Honey: Israel explored (1950) * Down with everybody (1951) * Shakespeare and Myself (1952) * Uber Alles: Germany explored (1953) * Little Cabbages (1955) * Italy for Beginners (1956) * How to Be Inimitable: coming of age in England (1960) * How to Tango: a solo across South America (1961) * Switzerland for Beginners (1962) * How to Unite Nations (1963) * Mortal Passion (1963), a novel * Germany Laughs at Herself: German cartoons since 1848 (1965) * Eureka!: Rummaging in Greece (1965) valign=\\"top\\" * How to Be Affluent (1966) * Boomerang: Australia Rediscovered (1968) * The Prophet Motive: Israel today and tomorrow (1969) * The Land of the Rising Yen: Japan (1970) * Humour in Memoriam (1970) * Any Souvenirs?: Central Europe revisited (1971) * The Spy who Died of Boredom (1973) * How to Be Decadent (1977) * Tsi- Tsa: the biography of a cat (1978) * English Humour for Beginners (1980) * How to Be Seventy: an autobiography (1982) * How to Be Poor (1983) * How to Be a Guru (1984) * How to Be God (1986) * The Riches of the Poor: who's WHO (1987) } = Non-fiction = * The Epic of Lofoten (1941) * Eight humorists (1954) * We Were There to Escape: the true story of a Jugoslav officer (1945) * The Hungarian Revolution (1957) * A Study in Infamy: the operations of the Hungarian Secret Police (AVO) (1959) * Arthur Koestler; the story of a friendship (1983)  References  Sources * Penguin Readers Factsheet on How to be an Alien for teachers Hungarian Biographical Encyclopedia (in Hungarian) * \\"George Mikes, 75; Wrote Gentle Satires And Serious Works\\", New York Times, 4 September 1987; retrieved 16 May 2017. * Sorrel Kerbel: The Routledge Encyclopedia of Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century, Taylor & Francis Books Inc., 2003. 1912 births 1987 deaths British autobiographers 20th-century Hungarian novelists Hungarian Jews 20th-century British novelists British humorists Hungarian journalists British Jewish writers Hungarian emigrants to England British people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom British male novelists Hungarian male novelists 20th-century Hungarian male writers 20th-century journalists ","title":"George Mikes"},{"id":"607529","text":"The Ithaca Journal is a daily morning broadsheet newspaper published in Ithaca, New York. It is locally edited and printed in Johnson City, New York, and publishes Monday through Saturday. It has been owned by Gannett since 1912. Publications =Daily newspaper= The Ithaca Journal publishes a daily morning newspaper Monday through Saturday. No edition is printed on Sundays. Starting on March 27, 2006, The Ithaca Journal included four sections Monday through Friday. The first section includes local, national and international news. The second section includes several pages of city and county news and sports. The third section, which was launched March 27, 2006, is called Life. The front of this section includes a rotating selection of features: *Mondays: Food and Personal Finance *Tuesdays: Outdoors & Recreation and Family *Wednesdays: Science & Environment *Thursdays: Health *Fridays: House & Garden In addition, Life also includes an Arts & Entertainment page that includes entertainment and celebrity news, TV listings and Amy Dickinson's advice column. There is also a full page of comics and puzzles. Business and personal finance news appears on a page called Dollars & Sense. The fourth section is entirely classified advertising. On Saturdays, the classified ads expand to two sections. Starting June 17, 2006, The Journal added a Life section on Saturdays. This day's focus will be Travel, a feature that currently appears in Saturday's main news section. Also on June 17, The Journal will add a separate Sports section in addition to the two news sections, Life and two classified sections, bringing the total number of sections to six. Offices The Ithaca Journal is located on West State Street in downtown Ithaca. The Journal's offices spread over two buildings; the newspaper's original building and the neighboring Greenstate Building. The newsroom is located on the second floor of the original building with various administrative offices on the first floor. The first floor of Greenstate building houses the newspaper's public lobby as well as the advertising offices. Much of the newspaper's general administrative operations are handled from the Binghamton, New York, offices of the Press & Sun Bulletin. Behind the original building, on Green Street, is the newspaper's old press facility. This press has been unused since June 10, 2006 when printing was transferred to the Gannett Central New York Production Facility. =Ticket and Cortland Ticket= On Thursdays a tabloid-sized insert called Ticket is included in The Ithaca Journal. Ticket includes local arts and entertainment news and events calendar. A similar publication, Cortland Ticket, is included in newspapers sold in the Cortland, New York, area on Fridays. =Buzz= The Ithaca Journal produces a youth-oriented tabloid-sized publication called Buzz every week. The publication is distributed at no cost at retail locations and vending machines throughout the area and features stories of interest to a younger audience as well as an events calendar. Buzz is also distributed in the markets of The Ithaca Journal's sister publications, the Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin and Elmira Star-Gazette. History Founded in 1815 as the Seneca Republican, it was renamed The Ithaca Journal in 1823. According to its website (see links below), the first daily edition of paper was published in 1870 and its offices are housed in the same building it has occupied since 1905. The Journal was purchased by Frank E. Gannett in 1912, thereby becoming the second local newspaper of what would later become the media conglomerate Gannett Co, Inc. It merged with the Daily News in 1919 and officially adopted the name The Ithaca Journal-News, although it is published under the name The Ithaca Journal. Among its stars were Kenneth Van Sickle, the long-time sports editor who had a popular column for decades, covering everything from Cornell and Ithaca College to high schools to local recreational sports. The newspaper in 1985, under Managing Editor Joseph Junod, won Best of Gannett for Sports Coverage for its weekly Softball magazine. At that time, the Journal also was home to three photographers, whose work was noted throughout Gannett and the newspaper industry. In May 1996, The Journal switched to a morning printing and distribution schedule after many years as an afternoon daily. Until that point, the newspaper run by Cornell University students, The Cornell Daily Sun had been the only morning daily paper in the city. On June 12, 2006, the newspaper's printing facilities were relocated to the Gannett Central New York Production Facility in Johnson City, New York, located outside of Binghamton, New York. This new facility also houses the printing facilities for the Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin and Elmira Star-Gazette, both daily newspapers owned by Gannett. Following this relocation, The Ithaca Journal's existing building will be renovated to include expanded office space. In late 2006, The Ithaca Journal laid off some of its Ithaca-based circulation, marketing and advertising staff. The newspaper's circulation and marketing needs are now managed out of the Binghamton office. By June 2020, the newspaper's local staff was down to just a single reporter: Matt Steecker. This has resulted in days with no news from Ithaca. Instead, the newspaper uses content from Gannett properties in Binghamton and Elmira to fill the paper and website.At Gannett’s Ithaca Journal, local news staffing is down to one reporter  Pulitzer  The Journal was awarded a Pulitzer Prize special citation in 1964 for meritorious public service.  Criticism  The Journal has been frequently criticized throughout its history as pro-war and pro-corporate. Critics have pointed out that the newspaper strongly supported the Vietnam War, headlining an editorial in 1967 \\"U.S. Troops Must Stay in Vietnam,\\" and condemned protests of the first Persian Gulf War as \\"unrealistic\\" in 1991. Prior to World War II, The Journal, as with many American newspapers of the era, praised Europe's dictators. \\"No objective critic can fail to see that, viewed by the practical standard, [Fascism] has been, on the whole, a success,\\" pronounced a 1932 editorial. Nevertheless, the paper is not immune to criticism from the right; in recent years, particular attention has been paid to left-leaning editorial page editor John Carberry. The Journal has also consistently endorsed Democratic Party candidates for federal offices in recent years. In its downsizing, The Journal has eliminated its high school sports staff, relying entirely on staff from Binghamton and Elmira newspapers for Ithaca-area high school coverage.

A chemical mechanism is a theoretical conjecture that tries to describe in detail what takes place at each stage of an overall chemical reaction. The detailed steps of a reaction are not observable in most cases. The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible, and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, and which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, all products formed and the amount of each. SN2 reaction mechanism. Note the negatively charged transition state in brackets in which the central carbon atom in question shows five bonds, an unstable condition. The electron or arrow pushing method is often used in illustrating a reaction mechanism; for example, see the illustration of the mechanism for benzoin condensation in the following examples section. A reaction mechanism must also account for the order in which molecules react. Often what appears to be a single-step conversion is in fact a multistep reaction. Reaction Intermediates Reaction intermediates are chemical species, often unstable and short-lived (however sometimes can be isolated), which are not reactants or products of the overall chemical reaction, but are temporary products and/or reactants in the mechanism's reaction steps. Reaction intermediates are often free radicals or ions. The kinetics (relative rates of the reaction steps and the rate equation for the overall reaction) are explained in terms of the energy needed for the conversion of the reactants to the proposed transition states (molecular states that corresponds to maxima on the reaction coordinates, and to saddle points on the potential energy surface for the reaction). Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant.Espenson, James H. Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms (2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, 2002) chap.6, Deduction of Reaction Mechanisms Consider the following reaction for example: :CO + NO2 -> CO2 \\\\+ NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law r = k[NO_2]^2. This form suggests that the rate- determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: :2 NO2 -> NO3 \\\\+ NO (slow) :NO3 \\\\+ CO -> NO2 \\\\+ CO2 (fast) Each step is called an elementary step, and each has its own rate law and molecularity. The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate r which obeys the rate law r = k[NO_{2}(t)]^2. Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms. Benzoin condensation reaction mechanism. Cyanide ion (CN−) acts as a catalyst here, entering at the first step and leaving in the last step. Proton (H+) transfers occur at (i) and (ii). The arrow pushing method is used in some of the steps to show where electron pairs go. A chain reaction is an example of a complex mechanism, in which the propagation steps form a closed cycle. Other experimental methods to determine mechanism Many experiments that suggest the possible sequence of steps in a reaction mechanism have been designed, including: * measurement of the effect of temperature (Arrhenius equation) to determine the activation energyEspenson p.156-160 * spectroscopic observation of reaction intermediates * determination of the stereochemistry of products, for example in nucleophilic substitution reactionsMorrison R.T. and Boyd R.N.

For many combustion and plasma systems, detailed mechanisms are not available or require development. Even when information is available, identifying and assembling the relevant data from a variety of sources, reconciling discrepant values and extrapolating to different conditions can be a difficult process without expert help. Rate constants or thermochemical data are often not available in the literature, so computational chemistry techniques or group additivity methods must be used to obtain the required parameters. Computational chemistry methods can also be used to calculate potential energy surfaces for reactions and determine probable mechanisms.Atkins and de Paula p.887-891 Molecularity Molecularity in chemistry is the number of colliding molecular entities that are involved in a single reaction step. * A reaction step involving one molecular entity is called unimolecular. * A reaction step involving two molecular entities is called bimolecular. * A reaction step involving three molecular entities is called trimolecular or termolecular. In general, reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities do not occur, because is statistically improbable in terms of Maxwell distribution to find such transition state.

All map series span four degrees of latitude, but are split differently east- to-west depending on the zones they are located in. Map series in the Southern and Arctic zones span eight degrees of longitude, while those in the High Arctic zone span sixteen degrees of longitude. The NTS designates the southernmost set of map series, from 40 to 44 degrees north latitude, with numbers that end with the digit 0, using 10, 20, 30 and 40. The third row, ending with the digit 2, spans from 2, 12, 22, 32 and so on to 102 off the west coast, while the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rows extend furthest west, using 114, 115, 116 and 117.

Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch (8 August 1839, Warmbrunn – 31 January 1917, Braunschweig) was a German ethnographer, naturalist and colonial explorer. He is known for a two-volume monograph on the parrots of the world which earned him a doctorate. He also wrote on the people of New Guinea and was involved in plans for German colonization in Southeast Asia. Several species of bird (such as Oenanthe finschii, Alophoixus finschii, Psittacula finschii) are named after him as also the town of Finschhafen in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea and a crater on the moon. Biography Carte-de- visite, 1882 Finsch was born at Bad Warmbrunn in Silesia to Mortiz Finsch and Mathilde née Leder. His father was in the glass trade and he too trained as a glass painter. An interest in birds led him to use his artistic skills for the purpose. Finsch went to Budapest in 1857 and studied at the Royal Hungarian University, earning money by preparing natural history specimens. He then spent two years in Russe, Bulgaria on an invitation from the Austrian Consul and gave private tutoring in German while exploring the birdlife of the region. He published his first paper in the Journal fur Ornithologie on the birds of Bulgaria. This experience helped him obtain a curatorial position at the Reichsmuseum of Natural History in Leiden (1862–1865) assisting Herman Schlegel. In 1864 he returned to Germany on the suggestion of Gustav Hartlaub to become curator of the museum in Bremen and became its director in 1876. After publishing the two volume monographs on the parrots of the world, Die Papageien, monographisch bearbeiter (1867-68), he obtained an honorary doctorate from the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Bonn. Apart from ornithology he also took an interest in ethnology. In 1876 he accompanied the zoologist Alfred Brehm on an expedition to Turkestan and northwest China. 180px Finsch resigned as curator of the museum in 1878 in order that he could resume his travels, sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation. Between spring 1879 and 1885 he made several visits to the Polynesian Islands, New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea. His proposal was to obtain as many artefacts as possible with the claim that native cultures, fauna and flora were fast vanishing. Finsch was shocked by the punitive actions of the English Methodist missionary George Brown (1835-1917) and was concerned by the violent conflicts between the natives and westerners. He also found no support for contemporary ideas on race with neat categories and found instead a continuum of variations in the human form. After witnessing a cannibal feast at Matupit he commented that the people were still not classifiable as \\"savages\\" as they maintained neat agriculture, had their own song, dance and followed commerce. He returned to Germany in 1882Melbourne Argus 24 Nov 1882 page 7e, from St James Budget 22 September 1882. and began to promote the creation of German colonies in the Pacific along with the South Sea Plotters, an influential group led by a banker Adolph von Hansemann. In 1884 he returned aboard the steamer Samoa to New Guinea as Bismarck's Imperial Commissioner to explore potential harbours under the guise of scientists and negotiated for the north-eastern portion of that island, together with New Britain and New Ireland, to become a German protectorate. It was renamed Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and the Bismarck Archipelago. The capital of the colony was named Finschhafen in his honour. In 1885 he was the first European to discover the Sepik river, and he named it after Kaiserin Augusta, the German Empress. Newspapers of the period speculated that he would be appointed as an administrator to the new territories but this never happened. He was instead offered a position as station director which involved menial administrative tasks that would come in the way of his plans to explore and study the region. He returned to Germany and spent much of the subsequent period without formal employment. Finsch had been married to Josephine Wychodil from around 1873 but they divorced around 1880. In 1886 he married Elisabeth née Hoffman (1860-1925). Elisabeth was a talented artist and she illustrated many of his catalogues. Finsch was briefly an advisor to the Neuguinea-Kompagnie. In 1898 he abandoned his dreams in ethnology and returned to ornithology, becoming curator of the bird collections at the Rijksmuseum in Leiden. He did not enjoy this period, noting that life for him, his wife and daughter Esther, felt like living in exile. He also wrote several articles on his past work Wie ich Kaiser-Wilhelmsland erwarb (How I acquired Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land, 1902) and Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Eine friedliche Kolonialerwerbung (Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land: A peaceful colonial acquisition, 1905). Seeking return to Germany, he finally joined the ethnographical department of the Municipal Museum in Brunswick in 1904 and worked the remainder of his life there. In 1909 he was titled professor by the Duke of Braunschweig and honoured with a 'medal for distinguished services for art and science' in silver. One of his major works was on the parrots of the world. This was not without its critics, since he often tried to rename genera apparently to gain taxonomic authorship. Some species of parrot bear his name, including the lilac-crowned parrot, Amazona finschi,Oenanthe finschii, Alophoixus finschii, and the grey-headed parakeet, Psittacula finschii. A species of monitor lizard, Varanus finschi, is named after him, as he collected what would become the holotype for this species. The crater Finsch on the Moon is also named in his honor. In 2008, following international treaties, some of the human remains that he had collected from Cape York and the Torres Straits that were held in the Charité Medical University in Berlin were repatriated.

The military history of New Zealand during World War II began when New Zealand entered the Second World War by declaring war on Nazi Germany with Great Britain. The state of war with Germany was officially held to have existed since 9:30 pm on 3 September 1939 (local time), simultaneous with that of Britain, but in fact New Zealand's declaration of war was not made until confirmation had been received from Britain that their ultimatum to Germany had expired. When Neville Chamberlain broadcast Britain's declaration of war, a group of New Zealand politicians (led by Peter Fraser as Prime Minister Michael Savage was terminally ill) listened to the shortwave radio in Carl Berendsen's room in the Parliament Buildings. Because of static on the radio they were initially not certain what Chamberlain had said until a coded telegraph message was received from London. This message did not arrive until just before midnight as the messenger boy with the telegram in London took shelter because of a (false) air-raid warning. The Cabinet acted after hearing the Admiralty's notification to the fleet that war had broken out. The next day Cabinet approved nearly 30 war regulations as laid down in the War Book, and after completing the formalities with the Executive Council the Governor- General, Lord Galway, issued the Proclamation of War, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September. Diplomatically, New Zealand had expressed vocal opposition to fascism in Europe and also to the appeasement of Fascist dictatorships, and national sentiment for a strong show of force met with general support. Economic and defensive considerations also motivated the New Zealand involvement—reliance on Britain meant that threats to Britain became threats to New Zealand too in terms of economic and defensive ties. There was also a strong sentimental link between the former British colony and the United Kingdom, with many seeing Britain as the \\"mother country\\" or \\"Home\\". The New Zealand Prime Minister of the time Michael Joseph Savage summed this up at the outbreak of war with a broadcast on 5 September (largely written by the Solicitor-General Henry Cornish) that became a popular cry in New Zealand during the war: > It is with gratitude in the past, and with confidence in the future, that we > range ourselves without fear beside Britain, where she goes, we go! Where > she stands, we stand!The Empire and the Second World War Radio 4, episode 88 New Zealand provided personnel for service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and in the Royal Navy and was prepared to have New Zealanders serving under British command. Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) pilots, many trained in the Empire Air Training Scheme, were sent to Europe but, unlike the other Dominions, New Zealand did not insist on its aircrews serving with RNZAF squadrons, so speeding up the rate at which they entered service. The Long Range Desert Group was formed in North Africa in 1940 with New Zealand and Rhodesian as well as British volunteers, but included no Australians for the same reason. The New Zealand government placed the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy at the Admiralty's disposal and made available to the RAF 30 new Wellington medium bombers waiting in the United Kingdom for shipping to New Zealand. The New Zealand Army contributed the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF).  Home front  Memorandum of 9 December 1941, providing for mobilization of New Zealand troops. In total, around 140,000 New Zealand personnel served overseas for the Allied war effort, and an additional 100,000 men were armed for Home Guard duty. At its peak in July 1942, New Zealand had 154,549 men and women under arms (excluding the Home Guard) and by the war's end a total of 194,000 men and 10,000 women had served in the armed forces at home and overseas. Conscription was introduced in June 1940, and volunteering for Army service ceased from 22 July 1940, although entry to the Air Force and Navy remained voluntary. Difficulties in filling the Second and Third Echelons for overseas service in 1939–1940, the Allied disasters of May 1940 and public demand led to its introduction. Four members of the cabinet including Prime Minister Peter Fraser had been imprisoned for anti-conscription activities in World War I, the Labour Party was traditionally opposed to it, and some members still demanded conscription of wealth before men. From January 1942, workers could be manpowered or directed to essential industries.McGibbon, 2000 pp. 118–120 Access to imports was hampered and rationing made doing some things very difficult. Fuel and rubber shortages were overcome with novel approaches. In New Zealand, industry switched from civilian needs to making war materials on a much larger scale than is commonly understood today. New Zealand and Australia supplied the bulk of foodstuffs to American forces in the South Pacific, as Reverse Lend-Lease. With earlier commitments to supply food to Britain this led to both Britain and America (MacArthur) complaining about food going to the other ally (and Britain commenting on the much more generous ration allocations for American soldiers; General Marshall admitted that the meat ration was too large, but he was not going to challenge the ration set by Congress). By 1943 there was a manpower crisis, and eventually the withdrawal of the Third Division from the Pacific. To alleviate manpower shortages in the agricultural sector, the New Zealand Women's Land Army was created in 1940; a total of 2,711 women served on farms throughout New Zealand during the war. In winter 1944 the government hastened work on docks and repair facilities at Auckland and Wellington following a British request, to supplement the bases and repair yards in Australia needed for the British Pacific Fleet.  Land forces  = Greek campaign = The New Zealand authorities deployed the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force for combat in three echelons — all originally destined for Egypt, but one diverted to Scotland (it would arrive there in June 1940) following the German invasion of France. In April 1941, after a period training in Egypt, 2NZEF's New Zealand 2nd Division, stationed in Egypt, deployed to take part in the defence of Greece against invasion by Italian troops, and soon German forces too when they joined the invasion. This defence was mounted alongside British and Australian units – the corps-size Commonwealth contingent under the command of British General Henry Maitland Wilson known together as W Force, supported a weakened Greek Army. As German panzers began a swift advance into Greece on 6 April, the British and Commonwealth troops found themselves being outflanked and were forced into retreat. By 9 April, Greece had been forced to surrender and the 40,000 W Force troops began a withdrawal from the country to Crete and Egypt, the last New Zealand troops leaving by 29 April. During this brief campaign, the New Zealanders lost 261 men killed, 1,856 captured and 387 wounded. =Crete= Two of the three brigades of the New Zealand 2nd Division had evacuated to Crete from Greece (the third and division headquarters went to Alexandria). New Zealanders bolstered the Crete garrison to a total of 34,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers (25,000 evacuated from Greece) alongside 9,000 Greek troops (see Crete order of battle for more detail). Evacuated to Crete on 28 April (having disregarded an order to leave on 23 April), the New Zealand General Freyberg became commander of the Allied forces on Crete on the 30th. Ultra intercepts of German signals had already alerted Allied commanders to the German plans to invade Crete with Fallschirmjäger (Luftwaffe paratroopers). With this knowledge, General Freyberg began to prepare the island's defences, hampered by a lack of modern and heavy equipment, as the troops from Greece had in most cases had to leave only with their personal weapons. Although German plans had underestimated Greek, British and Commonwealth numbers, and incorrectly presumed that the Cretan population would welcome the invasion, Freyberg was still faced with the harsh prospect that even lightly equipped paratroopers could overwhelm the island's defences. Operation Mercury opened on 20 May when the German Luftwaffe delivered Fallschirmjäger around the airfield at Maleme and the Chania area, at around 8:15 pm, by paradrop and gliders. Most of the New Zealand forces were deployed around this north-western part of the island and with British and Greek troops they inflicted heavy casualties upon the initial German attacks. Despite near complete defeat for their landing troops east of the airfield and in the Galatas region, the Germans were able to gain a foothold by mid-morning west of Maleme Airfield (5 Brigade's area) – along the Tavronitis riverbed and in the Ayia Valley to the east (10 Brigade's area – dubbed 'Prison Valley'). Maleme Map of the positions of 22 Battalion, New Zealand 2nd Division at Maleme in the Battle of Crete, 20 May 1941 Over the course of the morning, the 600-strong New Zealand 22 Battalion defending Maleme Airfield found its situation rapidly worsening. The battalion had lost telephone contact with the brigade headquarters; the battalion headquarters (in Pirgos) had lost contact with C and D Companies, stationed on the airstrip and along the Tavronitis-side of Hill 107 (see map) respectively and the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Andrew (VC) had no idea of the enemy paratrooper strength to his west, as his observation posts lacked wireless sets. While a platoon of C Company situated northwest of the airfield, nearest the sea, was able to repel German attacks along the beach, attacks across the Tavronitis bridge by Fallschirmjäger were able to overwhelm weaker positions and take the Royal Air Force camp. Not knowing whether C and D Companies had been overrun, and with German mortars firing from the riverbed, Colonel Andrew (with unreliable wireless contact) ordered the firing of white and green signals – the designated emergency signal for 23 Battalion (to the south-east of Pirgos), under the command of Colonel Leckie, to counterattack. The signal was not spotted, and further attempts were made to get the message through to no avail. At 5:00 pm, contact was made with Brigadier James Hargest at the New Zealand 2nd Division headquarters, but Hargest responded that 23 Battalion was fighting paratroopers in its own area, an untrue and unverified assertion. Faced with a seemingly desperate situation, Colonel Andrew played his trump card — two Matilda tanks, which he ordered to counterattack with the reserve infantry platoon and some additional gunners turned infantrymen. The counterattack failed — one tank had to turn back after suffering technical problems (the turret would not traverse properly) and the second ignored the German positions in the RAF camp and the edge of the airfield, heading straight for the riverbed. This lone tank stranded itself quickly on a boulder, and faced with the same technical difficulties as the first Matilda, the crew abandoned the vehicle. The exposed infantry were repelled by the Fallschirmjäger. At around 6:00 pm, the failure was reported to Brigadier Hargest and the prospect of a withdrawal was raised. Colonel Andrew was informed that he could withdraw if he wished, with the famous reply \\"Well, if you must, you must,\\" but that two companies (A Company, 23 Battalion and B Company, 28 (Māori) Battalion) were being sent to reinforce 22 Battalion. To Colonel Andrew, the situation seemed bleak; ammunition was running low, the promised reinforcements seemed not to be forthcoming (one got lost, the other simply did not arrive as quickly as expected) and he still had no idea how C and D companies were. The two companies in question were in fact resisting strongly on the airfield and above the Tavronitis riverbed and had inflicted far greater losses on the Germans than they had suffered. At 9:00 pm, Andrew made the decision to make a limited withdrawal, and once that had been carried out, a full one to the 21 and 23 Battalion positions to the east. By midnight, all of 22 Battalion had left the Maleme area, with the exception of C and D Companies which withdrew in the early morning of the 21st upon discovering that the rest of the battalion had gone. This allowed German troops to seize the airfield proper without opposition and take nearby positions to reinforce their hold on it. Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft flew in ammunition and supplies, as well as the rest of the Fallschirmjäger and troops of the 5th Mountain Division. Although the landings were extremely hazardous, with the airstrip under direct British artillery fire, substantial reinforcement was made. On 21 May, the village of Maleme was attacked and captured, and a counterattack was made by the 20 Battalion (with reinforcements from the Australian 2/7 Battalion), 28 (Māori) Battalion and later 21 Battalion. The attack was hampered by communications problems and although the New Zealanders made significant advances in some areas, the overall picture was one of stiff German resistance. 5 Brigade fell back to a new line at Platanias, leaving Maleme securely in German hands, allowing them to freely build up their force in this region. Galatas On the night of 23 May and the morning of 24 May, 5 Brigade withdrew again to the area near Daratsos, forming a new front line running from Galatas to the sea. The relatively fresh 18 Battalion replaced the worn troops from Maleme and Platanias, deploying 400 men on a two kilometre front. Galatas had come under attack on the first day of the battle — Fallschirmjäger and gliders had landed around Chania and Galatas, to suffer extremely heavy casualties. They retreated to \\"Prison Valley,\\" where they rallied around Ayia Prison and repulsed a confused counterattack by two companies of 19 Battalion and three light tanks. Pink Hill (so named for the colour of its soil), a crucial point on the Galatas heights, was attacked several times by the Germans that day, and was remarkably held by the Division Petrol Company, with the aid of Greek soldiers, though at a heavy cost to both sides. The Petrol Company comprised poorly armed support troops, primarily drivers and technicians, and by the day's end all their officers and most of their non-commissioned officers had been wounded. They withdrew around dusk. On the second day, the New Zealanders attacked nearby Cemetery Hill to take pressure off their line, and although they had to withdraw, for it was too exposed, the hill became a no man's land as Pink Hill was, relieving the New Zealand front. Day three, 22 May, saw German soldiers take Pink Hill. The Petrol Company and some infantry reserve prepared a counterattack, but a notable incident pre-empted them – as told by Driver A. Pope: > Out of the trees came [Captain] Forrester of the Buffs, clad in shorts, a > long yellow army jersey reaching down almost to the bottom of the shorts, > brass polished and gleaming, web belt in place and waving his revolver in > his right hand [...] It was a most inspiring sight. Forrester was at the > head of a crowd of disorderly Greeks, including women; one Greek had a shot > gun with a serrated-edge bread knife tied on like a bayonet, others had > ancient weapons—all sorts. Without hesitation this uncouth group, with > Forrester right out in front, went over the top of a parapet and headlong at > the crest of the hill. The [Germans] fled. Days four and five featured only skirmishes between the two forces. Luftwaffe air raids targeted Galatas on 25 May at 8:00 am, 12:45 pm and 1:15 pm, and the German ground attack came at around 2:00 pm. 100 Mountain and 3 Parachute Regiment attacked Galatas and the high ground around it, while two battalions of 85 Mountain Regiment attacked eastwards, with the aim of cutting Chania off. The New Zealand defenders, though prepared, suffered from a disadvantage: 18 Battalion, 400 men, was the only fresh infantry formation on the line — the rest were non-infantry groups like the Petrol Company and the Composite Battalion, consisting of mechanical, supply and artillery troops. The fighting was fierce, especially along the north of the line, and platoons and companies were forced to retreat. Brigadier Lindsay Inglis called for reinforcement and received 23 Battalion, which, along with an improvised group of reinforcements scraped together at Brigade headquarters (including the brigade band and the Kiwi Concert Party), stabilised the north of the line. South of Galatas, only 18 Battalion and the Petrol Company were defending – 18 Battalion was forced to withdraw, and the Petrol Company on Pink Hill followed suit after eventually becoming aware of this. 19 Battalion was the only formation still in combat on Pink Hill, and they too withdrew. These forces withdrew past Galatas, as no defenders were in the village to link up with. By nightfall, German troops had occupied Galatas, and Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kippenberger prepared a counterattack. Two tanks led two companies of 23 Battalion into Galatas at a running pace – heavy fire was encountered and as the tanks went ahead towards the town square, the infantry cleared each house of German soldiers as they worked inward. When the infantry caught up with the tanks, they found one out of action. With German fire coming primarily from one side of the square, a bayonet charge was mounted and the New Zealanders cleared the German opposition. Patrols quelled resistance elsewhere in Galatas – apart from one small strongpoint, Galatas was back in New Zealand hands. A conference between Brigadier Inglis and his commanders reached the consensus that Allied forces needed to make a further counterattack urgently — and that without a counterattack Crete would fall to the Germans. Despite hard fighting so far in the battle, the 28 (Māori) Battalion was considered to be the only \\"fresh\\" battalion available and the only one capable of carrying out such an attack. Their commander was willing to mount the attack despite the difficulty, but a representative sent from Brigadier Edward Puttick at New Zealand 2nd Division headquarters recommended against such an attack for fear of being unable to hold the line subsequently. The counter-attack was scrapped, and so too was Galatas, its position being far too vulnerable to hold. However, without Galatas the whole line was untenable and so the New Zealanders again retreated, forming a line from the coast to Perivolia and Mournies, near the Australian 19th Brigade. = North Africa = New Zealander soldiers recapture a Matilda tank and take prisoner its German crew during Operation Crusader, 3 December 1941. While New Zealand soldiers formed the majority of the personnel of the Long Range Desert Group when it was formed in 1940, and a small number of New Zealand transport and signals units supported Operation Compass in the Western Desert in December 1940, it was not until November 1941 that the 2nd New Zealand Division became fully involved in the North African Campaign. Following its evacuation from Crete, the division regrouped at its camp near Maadi, at the base of the desert slopes of Wadi Digla and Tel al-Maadi. Reinforcements arrived from New Zealand to bring the division back up to strength and the training, cut short by the deployment to Greece and Crete, was completed. On 18 November 1941, Operation Crusader was launched to lift the Siege of Tobruk (the third such attack), under the command of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham and the 2nd New Zealand Division (integrated into the British Eighth Army) took part in the offensive, crossing the Libyan frontier into Cyrenaica. Operation Crusader was an overall success for the British, although Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps inflicted heavy armour and infantry losses before its weakened and under-supplied units retreated to El Agheila and halted the British advance. The New Zealand troops were the ones to relieve Tobruk after fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Axis tanks had inflicted heavy casualties against the several New Zealand infantry battalions, protected by very little of their own armour. In February 1942, with Crusader completed, the New Zealand government insisted that the division be withdrawn to Syria to recover – 879 men were killed and 1,700 wounded during the operation, the most costly battle the 2nd New Zealand Division fought in the Second World War. On 14 June 1942, the generals recalled the New Zealanders from their occupation duties in Syria, as the Afrika Korps had broken through Gazala and captured Tobruk. The New Zealanders, put on the defence, found themselves encircled at Minqar Qa'im, but escaped thanks to brutally efficient hand-to-hand fighting by 4 Brigade. The British forces prevented Rommel's advance from reaching Alexandria, Cairo and the Suez Canal in the First Battle of El Alamein, where New Zealand troops captured Ruweisat Ridge in a successful night attack. However, they were unable to bring their anti-tank weapons forward, and more importantly, British armour did not move forward to support the soldiers. Heavy casualties were suffered by the two New Zealand brigades involved, as they were attacking by German tanks, and several thousand men were taken prisoner. Charles Upham earned a bar for his Victoria Cross in this battle. With the Eighth Army now under the new command of Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, the Army launched a new offensive on 23 October against the stalled Axis forces in the Second Battle of El Alamein. On the first night, as part of Operation Lightfoot, the New Zealand 2nd Division, with British divisions, moved through the deep Axis minefields while engineers cleared routes for British tanks to follow. The New Zealanders successfully captured their objectives on Miteiriya Ridge. By 2 November, with the attack bogged down, Montgomery launched a new initiative to the south of the battle lines, Operation Supercharge, with the ultimate goal of destroying the Axis army. The experienced 2nd New Zealand Division was called on to carry out the initial thrust – the same sort of attack they had made in Lightfoot. As the under-strength division could not achieve this mission alone, two British brigades were attached. The German line was breached by British armour and, on 4 November, the Afrika Korps, faced with the prospect of complete defeat, skillfully withdrew. The New Zealanders continued to advance with the Eighth Army through the Tunisia Campaign, driving the Afrika Korps back into Tunisia, and notably fought at Medenine, the Tebaga Gap and Enfidaville. On 13 May 1943, the North African campaign ended with the surrender of the last 275,000 Axis troops in Tunisia. On 15 May, the division began a withdrawal back to Egypt and, by 1 June, the division had returned to Maadi and Helwan, on standby for use in Europe. Total losses for the 2nd New Zealand Division since November 1941 stood at 2,989 killed, 7,000 wounded and 4,041 taken prisoner. = Italy = Cassino, Italy, 8 April 1944. During October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari in Apulia, weeks after the Allied invasion of Italy. In November, the division crossed the Sangro River with a view to breaching the German Gustav Line and advancing to Rome, capturing the village of Castelfrentano in the Abruzzo (part of the Gustav Line) on 2 December. The division attacked Orsogna on the next day, but was repulsed by the strong German defence. In January 1944, the 2nd New Zealand was withdrawn from the stalled front line and transferred to the Cassino sector, where other Allied troops were bogged down in costly fighting for the position of Monte Cassino. On 17 February, the division attacked Cassino but it was strongly defended and they withdrew in early April. Cassino was eventually captured on 18 May by British and Polish troops, with the support of New Zealand artillery units. On 16 July, the division captured Arezzo and reached Florence on 4 August. By the end of October they had reached the Savio River, and Faenza was captured on 14 December. In Operation Grapeshot, the final Allied offensive in Italy, the division crossed the Senio River on 8 April 1945, then began their final push across the Santerno and Gaiana Rivers, finally crossing the Po River on Anzac Day 1945. The division captured Padua on 28 April 1945, crossed the Isonzo River on 1 May, and reached Trieste on 2 May, the day of the German unconditional surrender. = Campaigns in the Pacific = New Zealand troops land on Vella Lavella in the Solomons When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the New Zealand Government raised another expeditionary force, known as the 2nd N.Z.E.F. In the Pacific, or 2nd N.Z.E.F. (I.P.), for service with the Allied Pacific Ocean Areas command. This force supplemented existing garrison troops in the South Pacific. The main fighting formation of the 2nd N.Z.E.F. (I.P.) comprised the New Zealand 3rd Division. However, the 3rd Division never fought as a complete formation; its component brigades became involved in semi- independent actions as part of the Allied forces in the Solomons at Vella Lavella), Treasury Islands and Green Island.Crawford 2000, pp. 140–162. The War Cabinet had held the division at two rather than three brigades, and this limited its use, although MacArthur had a role for a full division; Halsey was \\"greatly disappointed that New Zealand could not furnish a division with three full brigades\\" but his deputy accepted that the division was last in New Zealand's Pacific priorities, after the air force, navy and food production. Preference was given to the Second Division, on the advice of Churchill and Roosevelt. However New Zealand also had 19,000 troops in New Caledonia, Tonga, Norfolk Island and Fiji in 1943; and the 3000 Air Force personnel would rise to 6000 when more planes were available. In Australia the reaction of Curtin (but not Evatt) to the withdrawal of the Third Division was hostile. Eventually, American formations replaced the New Zealand army units in the Pacific, which released personnel for service with the 2nd Division in Italy, or to cover shortages in the civilian labour-force.Crawford 2000, p. 157. New Zealand Air Force squadrons and Navy units continued to contribute to the Allied island-hopping campaign, with several RNZAF squadrons supporting Australian ground troops on Bougainville.Bradley 2012, p. 395. German and Japanese surface raiders and submarines operated in New Zealand waters on several occasions in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1945, sinking a total of four ships while Japanese reconnaissance aircraft flew over Auckland and Wellington preparing for a projected Japanese invasion of New Zealand. In 1945 Peter Fraser wanted to contribute to a Commonwealth force against Japan, including an army contribution of at least two brigade groups as \\"from previous experience small units are given the harder jobs or are not properly supported\\". But during the Hamilton by-election, 1945, National had campaigned on withdrawing New Zealand troops from Italy and restricting New Zealand's role in the Pacific War to food supply, though Labour wanted to keep New Zealand troops in the Pacific to \\"have a say\\" in the peace. So Fraser met the Opposition leaders Sidney Holland and Adam Hamilton before the Dunedin North by-election, 1945, noting the divisions in his own caucus. Holland agreed with Fraser not to refer to the matter (which was agitating the whole country) during the by-election campaign, saying it would not be right to divide the House on this. In a (non-broadcast) semi-secret section on 2 August the House agreed to participate in a force against Japan \\"within the capacity of our remaining resources of manpower\\". And National's proposal to reduce the total armed forces to 55,000 was accepted. The Commonwealth Corps, planned to participate in Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan, would have included New Zealand Army and Air Force units, with Air Force units included in Tiger Force to bomb Japan. In 1945, some troops who had recently returned from Europe with the 2nd Division, got drafted to form a contribution (known as J-Force) toward the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in southern Japan. No. 14 Squadron RNZAF, equipped with Corsair fighters, and RNZN ships also joined BCOF.  Naval actions  At the outbreak of war in 1939, New Zealand still contributed to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. Many New Zealanders served alongside other Commonwealth sailors in vessels of the Royal Navy and would continue to do so throughout the war. took part in the Battle of the River Plate (13 December 1939) as part of a small British force against the German pocket battleship . The action resulted in the German ship retiring to neutral Uruguay and its scuttling a few days later. Another cruiser, , destroyed the Italian auxiliary cruiser off the Maldives on 27 February 1941. The New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy when King George VI granted it the name on 1 October 1941. = The naval war against Japan = Jintsu. On 13 December 1939, New Zealand deployed its naval forces against Germany and Italy. The first vessel into action against Japan, the minesweeper , steamed forward to Fiji, arriving on Christmas Day, 1941. HMNZS Rata and Muritai arrived in January 1942, followed by the corvettes , and , to form a minesweeping flotilla. The Achilles, Leander, and initially served as troop-convoy escorts in the Pacific in early 1942. In January 1942, Monowai inconclusively engaged a Japanese submarine off Fiji. On 4 January 1943, a Japanese bomber destroyed the aft gun-house of Achilles off Guadalcanal. In January 1943, a morale- boosting episode occurred: the duel Kiwi and Moa fought with the much larger . Unable to pierce the I-1, the Kiwi rammed her three times, destroying her ability to dive. Moa then hounded I-1 onto a reef, where she broke up. In April 1943, an aerial attack sunk the Moa in Tulagi Harbour in the Solomons. The Tui participated in the sinking of the 2,200-ton before joining the Kiwi in redeploying to New Guinea, while the corvette went to the Ellice Islands. The Leander helped sink the in the Battle of Kolombangara on the night of 11–12 July 1943. Holed by a Japanese torpedo during the engagement, the Leander withdrew to Auckland for repairs. Twelve New Zealand built Fairmile launches of the 80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas went forward in early 1944. The cruiser bombarded Sabang (in Sumatra) in July 1944, and with the recommissioned Achilles joined the British Pacific Fleet, later re-inforced by the corvette . The Fleet detached Achilles to tow the damaged destroyer Ulster to the New Zealand Hospital Ship Maunganui in the Philippines (where the was at that time stationed). Both Gambia and Achilles bombarded Japanese positions in the Sakishima Group in May 1945. They were supported by 100 New Zealanders in the Fleet Air Arm operating from British carriers. The Achilles left the fleet for Manus Island on 10 August. Gambia was off Tokyo on VJ day, and was attacked by a Japanese plane while flying the \\"Cease hostilities\\" signal – with assistance from surrounding ships, Gambia shot down the aircraft but was hit by the debris. The Gambia represented New Zealand at the surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay (2 September 1945), and stayed as part of the occupation force. Air Vice-Marshal Isitt signed the surrender document on behalf of New Zealand. By the end of the war the RNZN had 60 vessels, most of them light craft.  Royal New Zealand Air Force in World War II  = European theatre = Wellingtons of the RNZAF in England, August 1939 On the outbreak of World War II the RNZAF had as its primary equipment 30 Vickers Wellington bombers, which the New Zealand government offered to the United Kingdom in August 1939, together with the crews to fly them. A restored 485 (NZ) Squadron Spitfire Many other New Zealanders also served in the RAF. As New Zealand did not require its personnel to serve with RNZAF squadrons, the rate at which they entered service was faster than for other Dominions. About 100 RNZAF pilots had been sent to Europe by the time the Battle of Britain started, and several had a notable role in it. The RNZAF's primary role took advantage of New Zealand's distance from the conflict by training aircrew as part of the Empire Air Training Scheme, alongside the other major former British colonies, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. Many New Zealanders did their advanced training in Canada. Local enterprises manufactured or assembled large numbers of De Havilland Tiger Moth, Airspeed Oxford and North American Harvard training aircraft, and the RNZAF also acquired second-hand biplanes such as Hawker Hinds and Vickers Vincents, as well as other types for specialised training such as Avro Ansons and Supermarine Walruses. Only when German surface-raiders became active did the military authorities realise the need for a combat force in New Zealand in addition to the trainers.  New Zealand Squadrons of the RAF  Air Chief Marshal Park, the NZ Commander in the Battle of Britain. NZ Mosquitoes over Amiens during Operation Jericho, the jailbreak raid. Once trained, the majority of RNZAF aircrew served with ordinary units of the RAF or of the Fleet Air Arm. As in World War I, they served in all theatres. At least 78 became aces. New Zealanders in the RNZAF and RAF included pilots such as the first RAF ace of WW2, Flying Officer Cobber Kain, Alan Deere, whose Nine Lives was one of the first post war accounts of combat, and leaders such as World War I ace, Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, who commanded 11 Group, responsible for the defence of London in the Battle of Britain, the air defence of Malta and in the closing stages of the war, the RAF in South East Asia. Through accident or design, several RAF units came to be mostly manned by RNZAF pilots (for example No. 243 Squadron RAF in Singapore, No. 258 Squadron RAF in the UK and several Wildcat and Hellcat units of the FAA – leading some texts to claim these types of aircraft were used by the RNZAF). Hurricane night fighter pilots of 486 squadron at Wittering in 1942 The Royal Air Force deliberately set aside certain squadrons for pilots from particular countries. The first of these, 75 Squadron, comprised the Wellingtons and pilots lent by New Zealand in August 1939, which later flew Short Stirlings, Avro Lancasters and Avro Lincolns. Other New Zealand squadrons within the RAF included 485, which flew Supermarine Spitfires throughout the war, 486 (Hawker Hurricanes, Hawker Typhoons and Hawker Tempests), 487 (Lockheed Venturas and De Havilland Mosquitoes), 488 (Brewster Buffaloes, Hurricanes, Bristol Beaufighters and De Havilland Mosquitoes), 489 (Bristol Blenheims, Bristol Beauforts, Handley Page Hampdens, Beaufighters, and Mosquitoes), and 490 (Consolidated Catalinas and Short Sunderlands). = RNZAF in the Pacific = The presence of German raiders led to the formation of New Zealand-based air-combat units — initially using re- armed types like the Vildebeest, and hurriedly converting impressed airliners such as the DH86 to carry bombs. RNZAF obtained Lockheed Hudsons early in 1941 to take over this role. 5 Squadron with Vickers Vincents and Short Singapores was sent to Fiji to protect that colony. Flying boats of 5 Squadron RNZAF In December 1941, Japan attacked and rapidly conquered much of the area to the north of New Zealand. New Zealand had perforce to look to her own defence as well as help the \\"mother country\\". Trainers in New Zealand such as the North American Harvard, Hawker Hind and even the de Havilland Tiger Moth were camouflaged and armed. Hudsons moved forward, while 5 Squadron in Fiji, commenced operations against the Japanese despite its obsolete equipment. The Imperial Japanese Navy demonstrated the vulnerability of New Zealand when submarine-launched Japanese float-planes overflew Wellington and Auckland in 1942. In March a Glen floatplane from I-25 overflew Wellington on 8 March and Auckland on 13 March, then Suva, Fiji on 17 March. The submarine was not seen by the Wellington-Nelson ferry when navigating Cook Strait on the surface on a full-moon night. In May a floatplane from I-21 overflew Suva on 19 May and then Auckland on 24 May. Lost in heavy fog the pilot (Matsumora) was helped by airport staff who heard a plane apparently in trouble and turned on the runway lights so allowing the pilot to find his bearings. During one March or May 1942 overflight a Tiger Moth apparently gave chase ineffectually. As few combat-capable aircraft were available at home, and Britain was unable to help, New Zealand benefited from the British-United States lend-lease agreement. Gradually, America supplied New Zealand with aircraft for use in the Pacific Theatre. The early lend-lease aircraft were obsolescent models like the Brewster Buffalo which were no match for the skilled and well- equipped Japanese pilots, although the Brewster was successfully used by Geoffrey Fisken the top New Zealand and Commonwealth ace in the Pacific. Restored RNZAF Corsair From mid-1943 at Guadalcanal, starting with No 15 and No 14 squadrons, several Kittyhawks units fought with distinction. Several RNZAF pilots became aces against the Japanese, including Geoff Fisken, the Commonwealth's leading ace in the Pacific war. Other squadrons flew the elderly but effective Douglas Dauntless and later the big, modern Grumman Avenger torpedo-bomber. The RNZAF took on a major part of the maritime reconnaissance task too, with Catalina (and later Sunderland) flying-boats and Hudson bombers. The role of the RNZAF changed as the allies moved off the defensive. The Americans, prominent amongst the Allied nations in the Pacific, planned to bypass major Japanese strongholds, but instead to capture a handful of island bases to provide a supply-chain for an eventual attack on Japan itself (see island hopping). The Allied advance started from the South Pacific. The RNZAF became part of the force tasked with securing the line of advance by incapacitating the bypassed Japanese strongholds. As the war progressed, more powerful modern aircraft replaced the older types; Kittyhawks gave way to Corsairs and Hudsons to Venturas. At its peak in the Pacific, the RNZAF had 13 squadrons of Corsair fighters, six of Venturas, two each of Catalinas, Avengers and C-47 Dakotas, one using Dauntless dive bombers, mixed transport and communications squadrons, a flight of Short Sunderlands and nearly 1,000 training machines. By 1945, the RNZAF had over 41,000 personnel, including just over 10,000 aircrew who served with the RAF in Europe and Africa.  Intelligence  New Zealand had a \\"Combined Intelligence Centre\\" in Wellington. In 1942 papers from the centre to the C-in-C, Eastern Fleet in Colombo and the RN signals intelligence at Anderson outside Colombo were captured on the Australian steamer Nankin when she was intercepted in the Indian Ocean by the German raider Thor. In the 1930s the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy established a chain of radio direction finding (D/F) stations from Awarua Radio on the Awarua Plains in Southland, Musick Point near Auckland, Waipapakauri in the far north and Suva, Fiji. There were radio intercept stations at Awarua, Suva, Nairnville in Khandallah near Wellington, and from 1943 at Waiouru. Transmissions were sent to the Far East Combined Bureau via the Navy Office in Wellington. New Zealand's network of radio intercept and D/F stations sent its material to Central Bureau in Brisbane despite its main area of responsibility being outside the SWPA. The network was supplemented in 1943 by a Radio Finger-Printing (RFP) organisation \\"manned\\" by local WRENS. These were valuable for identifying Japanese submarines, and RFP alerted the minesweepers HMNZS Kiwi and HMNZS Moa, who attacked and rammed the Japanese submarine I-1 running supplies to Guadalcanal on 29 January 1943. In 1943 the New Zealand (naval) operation was run by a Lieutenant Philpott assisted by Professor Campbell (Professor of Mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington) plus a part-time civilian Japanese interpreter and two women assistants both of whom were of above average ability and one of whom knew quite a bit of Japanese. It was said to be remarkably productive despite its small size and apparent lack of assistance or direction from FRUMEL in Melbourne (where Rudi Fabian was reluctant to cooperate with the Royal Navy or the US Army's Central Bureau).  Research  Several military research projects were conducted in New Zealand during World War II, notably a joint US/NZ project in 1944–45 called Project Seal to develop a tsunami bomb.

In cases of criminal negligence, the defendant is commonly charged with unintentional vehicular manslaughter. Vehicular homicide is similar to the offense, in some countries, of \\"dangerous driving causing death.\\" The victim may be either a person not in the car with the offending motorist (such as a pedestrian, cyclist, or another motorist), or a passenger in the vehicle with the offender. Jurisdictions =Canada= The Criminal Code does not have a specific offence for vehicular homicide, but has a series of provisions covering driving offences causing death,Quebec: Société de l'assurance automobile, Criminal Code Offences. among them: * dangerous driving causing death * criminal negligence causing death * failure to stop for police causing death * street racing causing death * impaired driving causing death * hit and run driving causing death The maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death, absent any of the remaining 5 elements mentioned above, is 14 years' imprisonment. The maximum penalty is otherwise life imprisonment. Anyone sentenced to life imprisonment for a Criminal Code driving offence is eligible to apply for parole after serving 7 years, but there is no guarantee of parole. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, there is no offense of \\"vehicular homicide\\". Where a vehicle has been used as a weapon as part of a deliberate assault; and the intention was to kill or cause serious injury; and that assault resulted in the death of the victim then the driver may be charged with murder contrary to the Common Law. Where death is the result of driving that falls short of a deliberate assault, the Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA 88) governs the disposal of the case. The offenses created by this act relating to road deaths are as follows ... * \\"Causing death by dangerous driving\\" - Section 1 RTA 88, the only points for the prosecution to prove are that death was caused and the driver of the vehicle that caused the death was driving dangerously. * \\"Causing death by careless, or inconsiderate, driving\\" - Section 2B RTA 88, deals with cases similar in scope to Section 1 but while the standard of the driving remains reprehensible the lapse(s) alleged are considered to fall short of being actually dangerous. * \\"Causing death by driving: unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured drivers\\" - Section 3ZB RTA 88, it is a requirement under UK law for the drivers of motor vehicles to be properly licensed and for them to hold third party insurance for their vehicle. This section was inserted to the RTA 88 to deal with road death cases where there was no provable lapse in driving standards but nevertheless the driver should not in law have been driving. * and \\"Causing death by careless driving while unfit through alcohol/over prescribed limit\\", Section 3A RTA 88 The RTA 88 introduced the simple concept of dangerousness by removing the offence of \\"reckless driving\\" as the concept of recklessness in UK law requires a mens rea. This had been difficult to prove in court. C. M. V. Clarkson, an advocate of a vehicular homicide offense, opines that while people's perceptions are that death resulting from a motor vehicle is in a different \\"family\\" to other killings, \\"in terms of fault there can be little distinction between those who kill through the dangerous operation of their cars and those who kill with machines, trains, etc.\\" In addition to the above there also exists the option of charging offenders with causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. Originally framed in the era of horse-drawn vehicles this legislation is now applied where offences involving motorised vehicles take place outside the provisions of the Road Traffic Act (on private land, when driving off-road or in pedestrianised areas) and in the small number of serious cases involving non-motorised collisions such as the few that involve cyclists and result in severe injury or loss of life, typically of pedestrians. =United States= The definition and penalties of vehicular manslaughter in the United States vary by state. All states except Alaska, Montana, and Arizona have vehicular homicide statutes. The laws have the effect of making a vehicle a potentially deadly weapon, to allow for easier conviction and more severe penalties; in states without such statutes, defendants can still be charged with manslaughter or murder in some situations. In the Model Penal Code, there is no distinction between vehicular homicide and vehicular homicides that involve negligence; instead, both are included in the overall category of negligent homicide. California In the state of California, depending on the degree of recklessness and whether alcohol was involved, a person could be charged with progressively more serious offenses: vehicular manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, or second-degree murder. In any of these cases, the prosecution must prove that the driver committed some wrongful act (which could be a felony, a misdemeanor, an infraction, or a lawful act that might cause death) and that the wrongful act caused the collision and the death of the victim. Murder charges are usually reserved for the most egregious cases, such as a convicted DUI offender who drives recklessly while intoxicated and thereby causes a fatal collision. Georgia In the state of Georgia, vehicular homicide is more properly known as homicide by vehicle. It is defined, by statute, as the unlawful killing of another person using a vehicle. To be guilty of the offense, the perpetrator does not have to have an intent to kill, malice aforethought, or premeditation. There are two degrees of vehicular homicide: ;First degree homicide by vehicle: This is a felony that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of between 3 and 15 years of imprisonment (or between 5 and 20 years for habitual violators), with no parole for at least 1 year. A homicide is first degree homicide by vehicle if the driver \\"unlawfully met or overtook a school bus; unlawfully failed to stop after a collision; was driving recklessly; was driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; failed to stop for, or otherwise was attempting to flee from, a law enforcement officer; or had previously been declared a habitual violator\\". ;Second degree homicide by vehicle: This is a misdemeanor that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of up to 1 year (which may be suspended), a fine of up to US$1,000, or both. Second degree homicide by vehicle encompasses all other homicides by vehicle, involving any other violation of the laws governing motor vehicles, that are not classed as first degree homicides. Louisiana In the state of Louisiana, vehicular homicide is defined as the killing of a human being while operating a motor vehicle, or other means of conveyance, under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. The minimum punishment is a fine of at least $2,000 (not more than $15,000) and 5–30 years in prison. The law is LSA RS 14:32.1. Minnesota In the state of Minnesota, vehicular homicide is one of the six levels of criminal vehicular operation, and is defined as causing the death of a person, that does not constitute murder or manslaughter, as a result of operating a motor vehicle in a grossly negligent manner, or in a negligent manner while in violation of the driving while intoxicated law, or where the driver flees the scene in violation of the felony fleeing law. Vehicular homicide in Minnesota requires, at a minimum, a mens rea of gross negligence. Washington Vehicular homicide in Washington state, is governed by RCW 46.61.520 Vehicular homicide—Penalty. =Text= ::(1) When the death of any person ensues within three years as a proximate result of injury proximately caused by the driving of any vehicle by any person, the driver is guilty of vehicular homicide if the driver was operating a motor vehicle: :::a While under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, as defined by RCW 46.61.502; or :::b In a reckless manner; or :::c With disregard for the safety of others. ::(2) Vehicular homicide is a class A felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW, except that, for a conviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section, an additional two years shall be added to the sentence for each prior offence as defined in RCW 46.61.5055. Sentencing A study by professors at Dartmouth College and Harvard University found that those convicted of vehicular homicide are given, on average, shorter sentences than those found guilty of other types of homicide. The study found that the gender of the offender does not statistically affect the length of the sentence, but the race does. The identity of the victim is a more important predictor of sentencing length, with longer sentences given to offenders in cases where the victim was female and/or had no violent criminal record. Some states, such as Minnesota, have statutes allowing for a charge of a vehicular homicide if an unborn child is killed or injured by a motorist.

Background and education He was the eldest son of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill, daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. He was the elder brother of Frederick Guest, Oscar Guest and Henry Guest, and a first cousin of Winston Churchill. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Dorset Yeomanry on 9 May 1896. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, he volunteered for service and was appointed a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 24 February 1900, leaving England for South Africa on the SS Manchester Merchant in early March. He was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with two clasps. After returning to the United Kingdom, he was promoted to captain on 18 January 1902. Political career, 1900–1915 Duke of Peñaranda and Lord Wimborne on 4 June 1914 in New York City for the 1914 Westchester Cup He was elected to Parliament for Plymouth in a by-election in February 1900 (a seat he had unsuccessfully contested in 1898), as a Conservative, and retained his seat in the general election of 1900. In 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting protectionism, he and other members of his family followed Churchill into the Liberal Party in support of free trade. He sat as an MP until 1910, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashby St Ledgers, of Ashby St Ledgers in the County of Northampton, and became Paymaster General in the government of H. H.

In 1914, he succeeded his father as Baron Wimborne. At the start of World War I, he was appointed to the staff of the newly formed 10th (Irish) Division under Lieutenant-General Sir Bryan Mahon at the Curragh Camp.Ó Broin, Leon, Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1970, p. 31Townshend, Charles, Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion, Penguin, 2006, , p. 147 Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1915–1918 In February 1915, Wimborne was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in succession to Lord Aberdeen. At this time, the Lord Lieutenant was largely a ceremonial position; real power was in the hands of the Chief Secretary and the Under-Secretary. Determined to be more involved in decision-making, he was appointed Director of Recruiting in October 1915, heading up the new Department of Recruiting for Ireland. He insisted on being kept up to date on the state of the country, and had the Under-Secretary, Sir Matthew Nathan, send him police reports, details of prosecutions and recruitment figures.Ó Broin, Leon, Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising pp. 68–69 On the weekend preceding the Easter Rising, following the capture of the German arms ship Aud and the arrest of Sir Roger Casement, Wimborne urged Nathan to order the arrest of a large number of rebel leaders. Nathan was unwilling to do so without the authorisation of the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, who was in London.Townshend, Charles, Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion pp. 149–151 Before the authorisation was received, the Rising began on 24 April 1916. Wimborne proclaimed martial law in Dublin. Thereafter, the military took control. A new Commander-in Chief, General Sir John Maxwell, arrived in Ireland on 28 April and the rebels surrendered on 29 April. Wimborne initially refused to offer his resignation after the Rising. He resigned under pressure from the government but was re-appointed.Ó Broin, Leon, Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising pp. 120–121 The Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) exonerated Wimborne of any blame for the Rising, saying that his position as Lord Lieutenant was \\"anomalous in quiet times and almost unworkable in times of crisis\\".Ó Broin, Leon, Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising p. 161 He continued as Lord Lieutenant for another two years. On his retirement in 1918, he was created Viscount Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset. Marriage and issue Lady Wimborne in 1914 On 10 February 1902, he married at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, London, the Honourable Alice Grosvenor (1880–1948), daughter of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Baron Ebury. They had one son, Ivor Guest, 2nd Viscount Wimborne, and two daughters, Rosemary and Cynthia. By the 1930s, they were living separate lives, though remaining on the friendliest terms. From 1934 until her death, Alice was linked with the composer William Walton. Wimborne died in June 1939, aged 66, at Wimborne House in Arlington Street, London, the house in which he was born. He was succeeded by his only son, Ivor. Lady Wimborne died in April 1948, aged 67.

Rosellini Bridge, and commonly called the SR 520 Bridge or 520 Bridge, was a floating bridge in the U.S. state of Washington that carried State Route 520 across Lake Washington, connecting Medina with the Montlake/Union Bay district of Seattle. The bridge's total length was approximately .USGS map Its WSDOT - SR 520 Bridge Facts. Washington State Department of Transportation. Accessed May 22, 2011. floating section was the longest floating bridge in the world until April 11, 2016, when its replacement exceeded it by . The bridge was named for Evergreen Point, the westernmost of the three small Eastside peninsulas that SR 520 crosses. (The other two are Hunts Point and Yarrow Point.) In 1988, it was renamed for the state's 15th governor, Albert D. Rosellini, who had advocated its construction. Although there were plans to replace the bridge several years following its completion, it was not until much later that investigations revealed the aging bridge to be in poor condition and unable to withstand the major hazards for which it was originally designed. This finding may have accelerated plans to finally replace it. In response to these hazards and the need to expand the current infrastructure, construction on a replacement began in 2012; the new bridge opened in April 2016. The original bridge was closed to traffic on April 22, 2016. History Aerial view of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge under construction, 1962. This shows the causeway extending from Foster Island in the Washington Park Arboretum roughly east to where Union Bay opens up into Lake Washington. Evergreen Point is across the lake. The bridge was opened for commuter traffic on August 28, 1963, after three years of construction. It was built as a four-lane toll bridge to provide easy access from Seattle to Eastside communities such as Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond. The total cost of the bridge, in 1961 dollars, was $21 million (at least $127 million in 2011 dollars Using the \\"Project\\" costs.). To make up for this cost, commuters paid a 35-cent toll in each direction until 1979. The toll booths were then converted into bus stops. The bridge affected many communities on the Eastside. Redmond's population saw a dramatic increase, jumping from less than 1,500 in 1960 to 11,000 in 1970.City of Redmond, , 2005 It was the second floating bridge to cross Lake Washington; the first was the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, built in 1940 as part of U.S. Route 10, later part of Interstate 90, which at its construction was the largest floating structure ever built. Drawspan opening The bridge was built with a drawspan in the center that could open for boats too tall to go under the bridge. The bridge opened by raising two 100-foot-long steel grids about 7 feet and moving an adjacent pontoon beneath them. In 1989, an electrical fault caused the drawspan to open during rush hour, causing one death and five injuries. In 2000, a gravel barge struck the bridge, closing it for eleven days and causing $500,000 worth of damage. Replacement bridge Just five years after the bridge opened, a study commissioned by the state legislature was completed to figure out how to provide for the great demand for cross-lake transportation. That study evaluated bridge and tunnel crossings north and south of the bridge.Tudor Engineering Company for Washington State Highway Commission Department of Highways. Legislative Reconnaissance and Feasibility Report \\"Lake Washington Bridge Crossings, Parallel Evergreen Point Bridge, North Lake Bridge. December 1968. To help provide the political lubrication needed for any plan to go forward, the Trans-Lake Study was commissioned by the State of Washington. The study brought together 47 representatives of public agencies, neighborhoods, businesses, and advocacy interests. In 1997, Myint Lwin, WSDOT's chief bridge engineer, said that even with repairs, the bridge could be expected to last only about twenty more years (until 2017).Whitely, Peyton. \\"New bridge first faces political, fiscal tests.\\" February 19, 1997. The bridge needed to be closed to traffic in high winds, and even after a seismic retrofit in 1999, it was at risk of collapse during an earthquake. Due to the weight of various reinforcements over the years, the bridge deck ultimately sat about lower over the water than it did originally. Since the bridge was built in the early 1960s, prior to the implementation of modern earthquake standards, its hollow support structures would have likely failed during a major earthquake. Additionally, vibrations induced by storm surges and strong winds could have compromised the drawspan, anchor cables, and pontoons, subjecting them to structural failure. Even for storms below the maximum threshold for failure to occur, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) still closed the floating bridge to traffic. The original bridge carried two lanes of traffic in each direction, but did not include emergency shoulders or pedestrian and bicycle crossings. This posed traffic problems since any obstruction caused by car breakdown, wreck or maintenance would result in traffic backups. In 2011, WSDOT broke ground on the replacement bridge. On April 2, 2016, WSDOT held a grand opening ceremony, allowing the public to explore the top deck of the new bridge on the westbound side. The replacement bridge opened to westbound traffic on April 11, 2016, and opened to eastbound traffic on April 25, 2016. The old bridge was permanently closed at 23:00 PDT on April 22, 2016, with demolition completed by the end of 2016. =Construction= Replacement bridge, to the north of the Rosellini Bridge, under construction in May 2015 Photo of the south side of the bridge in 2015, with construction visible in the background. New Evergreen Point Floating Bridge has been in use since April 2, 2016. The cost of all improvements to SR-520 between I-5 and I-405, including the new bridge, is forecast to be $4.65 billion. The first of 21 longitudinal pontoons were positioned on August 11, 2012. Each pontoon is 360 feet (110 meters) long and 75 feet (23 meters) wide. The pontoons were constructed in Aberdeen by Kiewit Construction. Pontoon construction was plagued by errors and shoddy construction. Reports included workers installing incorrectly sized rebar, installing it in the wrong location, and even having it missing altogether. Workers also poured concrete in weather that was too wet or too cold. Several of the new pontoons have had problems with cracking, which has been blamed on Kiewit's poor work. An independent auditor stated that there had been a long-running pattern of poor-quality work and that WSDOT failed to force Kiewit to take corrective actions. An inspector for the construction called it a disaster waiting to happen, adding \\"I won't drive across that bridge when they have it built.\\" By the end of February 2015, enough of the new bridge was in place to block tall ships that used to pass through a drawspan in the Rosellini Bridge. In early July 2015, the westernmost floating pontoon was moved to make room for the installation of the west end of the bridge; on July 8, 2015, all longitudinal pontoons for the new bridge were in place. Tolling When the bridge opened in 1963, a 35 cent toll was collected to fund the bridge. This tolling ended in 1979 when a citizen realized that the state was still tolling drivers long after the bridge had already been paid off, therefore exposing a violation of public-trust by those overseeing the tolling. New tolling began in 2011 to fund the original bridge's replacement. To fund the new bridge, in May 2009, Gov. Christine Gregoire signed ESHB 2211, which authorized tolling on the SR 520 bridge beginning in 2010. Tolling actually began on December 29, 2011 and has assisted WSDOT in funding the project. The State Transportation Commission has proposed a toll of US$3.59 each way during peak periods. The proposed rates during other hours are to range from $0 to $2.87.Comments sought on proposed SR 520 toll rates. Kpbj.Com (December 5, 2010). Retrieved on 2011-08-29. All tolling is done automatically with no tollbooths. Tolling for people without \\"Good to Go\\" passes is done by license plates. Toll readers were located on gantries at the east highrise, but additional gantries on the east mainland were added to facilitate tolling on the new bridge once opened. Tim Eyman promoted Initiative 1125, which among other measures, would have banned the time-of-day tolling proposed for the bridge, required funding to be used on the road that collected the toll, and required tolls to be set by elected officials. The initiative was defeated by Washington voters.

Legislative Reconnaissance and Feasibility Report \\"Lake Washington Bridge Crossings, Parallel Evergreen Point Bridge, North Lake Bridge. December 1968. History Construction of the bridge; photo taken one year after start of construction. The bridge was the brainchild of engineer Homer Hadley, who had made the first proposal in 1921. The bridge came about after intensive lobbying, particularly by George Lightfoot, who came to be called the \\"father of the bridge.\\" Lightfoot began campaigning for the bridge in 1930, enlisting the support of Miller Freeman. Construction began January 1, 1939 and was completed in 1940. The construction cost for the project, including approaches, was approximately $9 million. It was partially financed by a bond issue of $4.184 million. Opened July 2, 1940, the bridge carried US 10 (later decommissioned and renamed Interstate 90). Tolls were removed in 1949. The bridge sank in a storm on November 25, 1990 while it was undergoing refurbishing and repair. The current bridge was built in 1993. The eponymous Lacey V. Murrow was the second director of the Washington State Highway Department and a highly decorated U.S. Air Force officer who served as a bomber pilot in World War II and rose to the rank of graduate of Washington State College in Pullman, he was the oldest brother of CBS commentator Edward R. Murrow. The original bridge was built under a -year contract awarded to the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company (the project was led by engineer Peter John Jensen) in the amount of $3.254 million. It included a movable span that could be retracted into a pocket in the center of the fixed span to permit large boats to pass. This design resulted in a roadway \\"bulge\\" that required vehicles to swerve twice across polished steel joints as they passed the bulge. A reversible lane system, indicated by lighted overhead lane control signals with arrow and 'X' signs, compounded the hazard by putting one lane of traffic on the \\"wrong\\" side of the bulge at different times of day in an effort to alleviate rush-hour traffic into or out of Seattle. There were many serious collisions on the bridge. The problems grew worse as the traffic load increased over the years and far outstripped the designed capacity. Renovation or replacement was essential and a parallel bridge, the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, was completed in 1989, and named for Hadley in 1993. With the opening of the new bridge, the 49-year-old Murrow Bridge closed on June 23, 1989, for renovation work that was originally projected to take In 1979, Stacy Sparks drowned after driving off the bridge. 1990 disaster View northeast of bridge, west approach and Mount Baker Tunnel On November 25, 1990, while under re-construction, the original bridge sank because of a series of human errors and decisions. The process started because the bridge needed resurfacing and was to be widened by means of cantilevered additions in order to meet the necessary lane-width specifications of the Interstate Highway System. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) decided to use hydrodemolition (high-pressure water) to remove unwanted material (the sidewalks on the bridge deck). Water from this hydrodemolition was considered contaminated under environmental law and could not be allowed to flow into Lake Washington.Donald O. Dusenberry, et al. (Feb. 1995). \\"Failure of Lacey V. Murrow floating bridge, Seattle, Washington.\\" Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, v. 9, n. 1, p 4-23. Engineers then analyzed the pontoons of the bridge, and realized that they were over-engineered and the water could be stored temporarily in the pontoons. The watertight doors for the pontoons were therefore removed. A large storm on November 22–24 (the Thanksgiving holiday weekend), filled some of the pontoons with rain and lake water. On Saturday, November 24, workers noticed that the bridge was about to sink, and started pumping out some of the pontoons; on Sunday, November 25, a section of the bridge sank, dumping the contaminated water into the lake along with tons of bridge material. It sank when one pontoon filled and dragged the rest down, because they were cabled together and there was no way to separate the sections under load. No one was hurt or killed, since the bridge was closed for renovation and the sinking took All of the sinking was captured on film and shown on live TV. The cost of the disaster was $69 million in damages. A dozen anchoring cables for the new Hadley bridge were and it was closed for a short time afterward. Westbound traffic was allowed and eastbound traffic was resumed in early December. The disaster delayed the bridge's reopening by 14 months, to September 12, 1993. =Precedents and lessons learned= WSDOT had lost another floating bridge, the Hood Canal Bridge, in February 1979 under similar circumstances.

S., ed. (1990).Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Harmondsworth: Penguin. Organizational structure affects organizational action and provides the foundation on which standard operating procedures and routines rest. It determines which individuals get to participate in which decision-making processes, and thus to what extent their views shape the organization's actions.Jacobides., M. G. (2007). The inherent limits of organizational structure and the unfulfilled role of hierarchy: Lessons from a near-war. Organization Science, 18, 3, 455-477. Organizational structure can also be considered as the viewing glass or perspective through which individuals see their organization and its environment. Organizations are a variant of clustered entities. An organization can be structured in many different ways, depending on its objectives. The structure of an organization will determine the modes in which it operates and performs. Organizational structure allows the expressed allocation of responsibilities for different functions and processes to different entities such as the branch, department, workgroup, and individual. Organizations need to be efficient, flexible, innovative and caring in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.Lim, M. (2017). Examining the literature on organizational structure and success. College Mirror, 43, 1, 16-18. http://www.cfps.org.sg/publications/the-college-mirror/article/1098 Types =Pre-bureaucratic structures= Pre-bureaucratic (entrepreneurial) structures lack standardization of tasks. This structure is most common in smaller organizations and is best used to solve simple tasks, such as sales. The structure is totally centralized. The strategic leader makes all key decisions and most communication is done by one on one conversations. It is particularly useful for new (entrepreneurial) business as it enables the founder to control growth and development. They are usually based on traditional domination or charismatic domination in the sense of Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority. =Bureaucratic structures= Large international organisation bureaucratic structure: the League of Nations in 1930. See also: French version (PDF) and English summary.Weber (1948, p. 214) gives the analogy that “the fully developed bureaucratic mechanism compares with other organizations exactly as does the machine compare with the non- mechanical modes of production. Precision, speed, unambiguity, … strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.”Weber, M. (1948). From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, translated, edited and with an introduction by H. H. Gerth and C. W. Mills. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. Bureaucratic structures have a certain degree of standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic is echoed in Burns and Stalker'sBurns, T. and G. Stalker. (1961) The Management of Innovation. London: Tavistock. distinction between mechanistic and organic structures. The Weberian characteristics of bureaucracy are: * Clear defined roles and responsibilities * A hierarchical structure * Respect for merit Bureaucratic structures have many levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, all the way to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organizedaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top- level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. A disadvantage in bureaucratic structures is that it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace. =Post-bureaucratic= The term of post bureaucratic is used in two senses in the organizational literature: one generic and one much more specific.Grey C., Garsten C., 2001, Trust, Control and Post-Bureaucracy, Sage Publishing) In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type bureaucracy. This may include total quality management, culture management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies,Heckscher C. (Editor), Donnellon A. (Editor), 1994, The Post- Bureaucratic Organization: New Perspectives on Organizational Change, Sage Publications rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'. Another smaller group of theorists have developed the theory of the Post- Bureaucratic Organization., provide a detailed discussion which attempts to describe an organization that is fundamentally not bureaucratic. Charles Heckscher has developed an ideal type, the post-bureaucratic organization, in which decisions are based on dialogue and consensus rather than authority and command, the organization is a network rather than a hierarchy, open at the boundaries (in direct contrast to culture management); there is an emphasis on meta-decision-making rules rather than decision-making rules. This sort of horizontal decision-making by consensus model is often used in housing cooperatives, other cooperatives and when running a non-profit or community organization. It is used in order to encourage participation and help to empower people who normally experience oppression in groups. Still other theorists are developing a resurgence of interest in complexity theory and organizations, and have focused on how simple structures can be used to engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner et al. (2000) studied how simple structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow,Nicolaj Sigglekow and Jan W. Rivkin, October 2003, Speed, Search and the Failure of Simple Contingency, No. 04-019 and Nelson RepenningRepenning, N. (2002). A Simulation-Based Approach to Understanding the Dynamics of Innovation Implementation. Organization Science, 13, 2: 109-127. revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments. =Functional structure= A functional organizational structure is a structure that consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term organizational structure refers to how the people in an organization are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting. This organizing of specialization leads to operational efficiency, where employees become specialists within their own realm of expertise. On the other hand, the most typical problem with a functional organizational structure is that communication within the company can be rather rigid, making the organization slow and inflexible. Therefore, lateral communication between functions becomes very important, so that information is disseminated not only vertically, but also horizontally within the organization. Communication in organizations with functional organizational structures can be rigid because of the standardized ways of operation and the high degree of formalization. As a whole, a functional organization is best suited as a producer of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing a limited number of products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost.Raymond E. Miles, Charles C. Snow, Causes of Failure in Network Organizations, California Management Review, Summer 1992 For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them. Even though functional units often perform with a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals. =Divisional structure= The divisional structure or product structure consists of self- contained divisions. A division is a collection of functions which produce a product. It also utilizes a plan to compete and operate as a separate business or profit center. According to Zainbooks.com, divisional structure in America is seen as the second most common structure for organization today. Employees who are responsible for certain market services or types of products are placed in divisional structure in order to increase their flexibility. Examples of divisions include regional (a U.S Division and an EU division), consumer type (a division for companies and one for households), and product type (a division for trucks, another for SUVS, and another for cars). The divisions may also have their own departments such as marketing, sales, and engineering. The advantage of divisional structure is that it uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. Another advantage of using divisional structure is that it is more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar functions and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally. The disadvantages of the divisional structure is that it can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel. =Matrix structure= The matrix structure groups employees by both function and product simultaneously. A matrix organization frequently uses teams of employees to accomplish work, in order to take advantage of the strengths, as well as make up for the weaknesses, of functional and decentralized forms. An example would be a company that produces two products, \\"product a\\" and \\"product b\\". Using the matrix structure, this company would organize functions within the company as follows: \\"product a\\" sales department, \\"product a\\" customer service department, \\"product a\\" accounting, \\"product b\\" sales department, \\"product b\\" customer service department, \\"product b\\" accounting department. *Weak/functional matrix: A project manager with only limited authority is assigned to oversee the cross- functional aspects of the project. The functional managers maintain control over their resources and project areas. *Balanced/functional matrix: A project manager is assigned to oversee the project. Power is shared equally between the project manager and the functional managers. It brings the best aspects of functional and projectized organizations. However, this is the most difficult system to maintain as the sharing of power is a delicate proposition. *Strong/project matrix: A project manager is primarily responsible for the project. Functional managers provide technical expertise and assign resources as needed. There are advantages and disadvantages of the matrix structure. Some of the disadvantages include tendencies towards anarchy, power struggles and 'sinking' to group and division levels. Matrices increase the complexity of the chain of command, which can present problems because of the differentiation between functional managers and project managers. This, in turn, can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However, the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure may improve upon the \\"silo\\" critique of functional management in that it aims to diminish the vertical structure of functional and create a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. It aims to allow specialization to increase depth of knowledge and allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs. =Organizational circle= The flat structure is common in small companies (entrepreneurial start-ups, university spin offs). As companies grow they tend to become more complex and hierarchical, which lead to an expanded structure, with more levels and departments. However, in rare cases, such as the examples of Valve, GitHub, Inc. and 37signals, the organization remains very flat as it grows, eschewing middle managers. (However, GitHub subsequently introduced middle managers.) All of the aforementioned organizations operate in the field of technology, which may be significant, as software developers are highly skilled professionals, much like lawyers. Senior lawyers also enjoy a relatively high degree of autonomy within a typical law firm, which is typically structured as a partnership rather than a hierarchical bureaucracy. Some other types of professional organizations are also commonly structured as partnerships, such as accountancy companies and GP surgeries. Often, growth would result in bureaucracy, the most prevalent structure in the past. It is still, however, relevant in former Soviet Republics, China, and most governmental organizations all over the world. Shell Group used to represent the typical bureaucracy: top-heavy and hierarchical. It featured multiple levels of command and duplicate service companies existing in different regions. All this made Shell apprehensive to market changes,Grant, R.M. (2008). History of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Available at: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/07Shell.pdf (accessed 20/10/08) leading to its incapacity to grow and develop further. The failure of this structure became the main reason for the company restructuring into a matrix. Starbucks is one of the numerous large organizations that successfully developed the matrix structure supporting their focused strategy. Its design combines functional and product based divisions, with employees reporting to two heads.(Starbucks.com (2008). Starbucks Coffee International. Available at: (accessed 20/10/08)) Some experts also mention the multinational design,Robbins, S.F., Judge, T.A. (2007). Organizational Behavior. 12th edition. Pearson Education Inc., p. 551-557. common in global companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Toyota and Unilever. This structure can be seen as a complex form of the matrix, as it maintains coordination among products, functions and geographic areas. With the growth of the internet, and the associated access that gives all levels of an organization to information and communication via digital means, power structures have begun to align more as a wirearchy, enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results. In general, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that through the forces of globalization, competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many companies has become flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and even virtual.Gratton, L. (2004). The Democratic Enterprise, Financial Times Prentice Hall, pp. xii-xiv. =Team= One of the newest organizational structures developed in the 20th century is team and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical.Thareja P(2008), \\"Total Quality Organization Thru’ People,(Part 16), Each one is Capable\\", FOUNDRY, Vol. XX, No. 4, July/Aug 2008 While an organization is constituted as a set of people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality.Thareja P. (2007). A Total Quality Organisation thru'People Each One is Capable. Available at: http://www.foundry-planet.com For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous profit centre composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team.Fishman C. (1996). Whole Foods Is All Teams. Available at: https://www.fastcompany.com/26671/whole-foods-all-teams Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks. =Network= Another modern structure is network. While business giants risk becoming too clumsy to proact (such as), act and react efficiently,Gummesson, E. (2002). Total Marketing Control. Butterworth- Heinemann, p. 266. the new network organizations contract out any business function, that can be done better or more cheaply. In essence, managers in network structures spend most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations, usually by electronic means. H&M; is outsourcing its clothing to a network of 700 suppliers, more than two-thirds of which are based in low-cost Asian countries. Not owning any factories, H&M; can be more flexible than many other retailers in lowering its costs, which aligns with its low-cost strategy.Capell, K. H&M; Defies Retail Gloom.

A special form of boundaryless organization is virtual. Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist.Hedberg, B., G. Dahlgren, J. Hansson, and N.-G. Olve (1999). Virtual Organizations and Beyond: Discover Imaginary Systems. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons. The virtual organization exists within a network of alliances, using the Internet. This means while the core of the organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.Anderson, C. (2007). The Long Tail. Random House Business Books, pp. 23, 53. =Hierarchy-community phenotype model= Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organizational Structure In the 21st century, even though most, if not all, organizations are not of a pure hierarchical structure, many managers are still blind to the existence of the flat community structure within their organizations.Butler Jr., J.K. (1986). A global view of informal organization. Academy of Management Journal, 51, 3, 39-43. The business is no longer just a place where people come to work. For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community.Stacey, M. (1974). The myth of community studies. C. Bell, H. Newby, (Editors), The Sociology of Community: A Selection of Readings. London, Frank Cass, 13-26. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.Lim, M., G. Griffiths, and S. Sambrook. (2010). Organizational structure for the twenty-first century. Presented the annual meeting of The Institute for Operations Research and The Management Sciences, Austin. https://communities-innovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Organizational- Structure-for-the-Twenty-first-Century-220619i.pdf Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) developed the Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organizational Structure borrowing from the concept of Phenotype from genetics. \\"A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism. It results from the expression of an organism’s genes and the influence of the environment. The expression of an organism’s genes is usually determined by pairs of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene. In our model, each employee’s formal, hierarchical participation and informal, community participation within the organization, as influenced by his or her environment, contributes to the overall observable characteristics (phenotype) of the organization. In other words, just as all the pair of alleles within the genetic material of an organism determines the physical characteristics of the organism, the combined expressions of all the employees’ formal hierarchical and informal community participation within an organization give rise to the organizational structure. Due to the vast potentially different combination of the employees’ formal hierarchical and informal community participation, each organization is therefore a unique phenotype along a spectrum between a pure hierarchy and a pure community (flat) organizational structure.\\" \\"The Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organisational Structure views an organisation as having both a hierarchy and a community structure, both equally well established and occurring extensively throughout the organisation. On the practical level, it utilises the organizational chart to study the hierarchical structure which brings across individuals’ roles and formal authority within their designated space at the workplace, and social network analysis to map out the community structure within the organisation, identifying individuals’ informal influences which usually do not respect workplace boundaries and at many times extend beyond the workplace.\\" History Organizational structures developed from the ancient times of hunters and collectors in tribal organizations through highly royal and clerical power structures to industrial structures and today's post-industrial structures. As pointed out by Lawrence B. Mohr,Mohr, L. B. (1982). Explaining Organizational Behavior. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers. the early theorists of organizational structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber \\"saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered a matter of choice... When in the 1930s, the rebellion began that came to be known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation of a different sort of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition.\\" However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is \\"an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact.\\"Mohr, L. B. (1982). Explaining Organizational Behavior. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers. In the 21st century, organizational theorists such as Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) are once again proposing that organizational structure development is very much dependent on the expression of the strategies and behavior of the management and the workers as constrained by the power distribution between them, and influenced by their environment and the outcome. Military Command and Control There are correspondences between Mintzberg's organizational archetypes and various approaches to military Command and Control (C2). Mintzberg's Machine Bureaucracy represents a highly centralized approach to C2, with a narrow allocation of decision rights, restricted patterns of interaction among organization members, and a restricted flow of information. Mintzberg's Adhocracy, on the other hand, represents a more networked and less centralized approach to C2, with more individual initiative and self- synchronization. It involves a broader allocation of decision rights, broader interaction patterns, and broader information distribution. Mintzberg's other organization types (for example, the Professional Bureaucracy and the Simple Structure) fall in between these two.Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). \\"C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise.\\" CRC Press; New York; pp. 93-96. Operational and informal The set organizational structure may not coincide with facts, evolving in operational action. Such divergence decreases performance, when growing as a wrong organizational structure may hamper cooperation and thus hinder the completion of orders in due time and within limits of resources and budgets. Organizational structures should be adaptive to process requirements, aiming to optimize the ratio of effort and input to output.  Configurations of organizational structure according to Mintzberg  = Parts of organization = Diagram, proposed by Henry Mintzberg, showing the main parts of organisation, including technostructure Henry Mintzberg considers five main parts of organization:Robertas Jucevičius \\"Strateginis organizacijų vystymas\\", „Pasaulio lietuvių kultūros, mokslo ir švietimo centras“, 1998, , p. 81-92 * Strategic apex (leaders of organization) * Middle line (managers of lower level) * Operating core (workers of lowest level, directly producing something or providing services) * Technostructure (analysts) * Support staff (helping other members of organisation to perform their function) An additional element is organisational ideology. = Mechanisms of coordination = Mintzberg considers six main mechanisms of coordination of work: * Mutual adjustment (without formal, standardized mechanisms) * Direct supervision (when one person, leader of organization, gives direct orders to others) * Standardization of work processes (based on the documents that regulate work and are produced by technostructure) * Standardization of outputs (only the results of work are regulated) * Standardization of skills (based on preparing the specialists outside the organization) * Standardization of norms (based on organisation's values, ideology) = Configurations of organizations = Mintzberg considers seven main configurations of organizational structure: # Entrepreneurial organization (strategic apex, direct supervision dominate) # Machine organization (technostructure, standardization of work processes dominate) # Professional organization (operating core, standardization of skills dominate) # Diversified organization (middle level, standardization of outputs dominate) # Innovative organization (support staff, mutual adjustment dominate) # Missionary organization (ideology, standardization of norms dominate) # Political organization (no part or mechanism of coordination dominates) Entrepreneurial organisation or Simple structure has simple, informal structure.Victoria Lemieux \\"Applying Mintzberg's Theories on Organizational Configuration to Archival Appraisal\\" // \\"Archivaria\\", 1998, 46, p. 32-85 Its leader coordinates the work using direct supervision. There is no technostructure, little support staff. Such structure is usually found in organizations with environment that is simple (so that one man could have significant influence), but changing (so that flexibility of one man would give a significant advantage over the bureaucratic structures). Machine organisation or Machine bureaucracy has formal rules regulating the work, developed technostructure and middle line, is centralised, hierarchical. Such structure is common when the work is simple and repetitive. Organizations also tend to achieve such structure when they are strongly controlled from outside. Also, such structure is common for organizations that perform work that is related to some sort of control (for example, prisons, police), or organizations with special safety requirements (for example, fire departments, airlines). Professional configuration or Professional bureaucracy mostly coordinates the work of members of operating core, professionals, through their training (for example, in university). Operating core in such organisation is large, middle line insignificant, as the professionals perform complex work and have significant autonomy. Technostructure is also insignificant.Fred C. Lunenburg „Organizational Structure: Mintzberg’s Framework“ // „International Journal of Scholarly Academic Intellectual Diversity“, 2012, Volume 14, Number 1 Support staff, helping the professionals to do their job, is numerous. Professionals participate in administrative work, thus there are many committees. Such structure is common for universities, hospitals, law firms. Diversified Configuration or Divisionalized form consists of several parts having high autonomy. Such structure is common for old, large organizations. Innovative Configuration or Adhocracy gathers the specialists of different fields into teams for specific tasks. Such organizations are common when environment is complex and dynamic. Mintzberg considers two types of such organization: operating adhocracy and administrative adhocracy. Operating adhocracy solves innovative problems for its clients. Examples of such organisation can be advertising agency or firm that develops the prototypes of products. Administrative adhocracy has teams solving problems for the organization itself. As an example of such organization Mintzberg gives NASA when it worked on Apollo program. Missionary organisation coordinates the work through organisational ideology. Formal rules in such organization are not numerous. Such organizations are decentralized, the differences between levels are not significant. Political configuration happens when the power is mostly used through workplace politics. Bibliography * Lawrence B. Mohr, Explaining Organizational Behavior.

Background and education Cadogan was the eldest son of Henry Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan, by his wife Mary, daughter of Reverend Gerald Wellesley, younger brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He was born in the city of Durham and baptised at St James's, Westminster, London. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. States he was born at \\"Durham College\\". Military Service As Viscount Chelsea, Cadogan served as a Major in the 5th (Militia) Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) from 1865 to 1872; he was later Honorary Colonel of the battalion from 1886, and of the 2nd (South) Middlesex Rifle Volunteers from 1892 to 1902. Political career In the 1868 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate for Bury, Lancashire but was successfully returned as Member of Parliament for Bath in a by-election in May 1873, just before he was ennobled on the death of his father on 8 June and had to move to the House of Lords. He was made Under-Secretary for War in 1875 and Under-Secretary to the Colonies in 1878 by Disraeli. He served under Lord Salisbury as Lord Privy Seal from 1886 to 1892 (after 1887 in the Cabinet), and again in the cabinet as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1895 to 1902. In the latter office, he supported the Land Act of 1896 which enabled Irish tenants to buy their homes from their landlords' estates and pressed the Treasury for more liberal terms than initially intended, appointed commissions to investigate intermediate education (1899) and university education (1901), and sponsored the Act of 1899 that created a department of agriculture, industries and technical education for Ireland.Article by H.W.C. Davis. He was first Mayor of Chelsea in 1900 and a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and London. Philanthropy By 1888, at the initiative of the Fifth Earl, building work was well under way at the south-eastern end of London's Sloane Street to rebuild Holy Trinity Church to the design of the leading Arts and Crafts architect John Dando Sedding. Cadogan funded the entire initial operation, including the commissioning of numerous fittings for the new building by leading sculptors and designers including Henry Wilson (who assumed overall artistic control when Sedding died prematurely), Onslow Ford, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Nelson Dawson and Henry Hugh Armstead. Money was found for the installation of a great organ by James John Walker, which quickly became famous for its cathedral-like effect in the opulent acoustic of the building. The church (and its fittings, including the organ) remain a testament to a very particularly focussed example of aristocratic patronage. As Lord of the Manor of Chelsea he held large estates there, much of which he dedicated to houses for the working class. During his lifetime Lord Cadogan commissioned a mausoleum for family interments at Brookwood Cemetery but in 1910 he decided he no longer wanted to be interred in the mausoleum. This building, the largest mausoleum in the cemetery, was bought by the cemetery owners, the London Necropolis Company, fitted with shelves and niches to hold urns, and used as a dedicated columbarium from then on. Family On 16 May 1865, he married Lady Beatrix Craven, fourth daughter of William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven. They had nine children: *Albert Edward George Henry, briefly Viscount Chelsea (1866–1878), a godchild of Albert, Prince of Wales. *Henry Arthur, Viscount Chelsea (1868–1908) *Gerald Oakley, 6th Earl Cadogan and briefly Viscount Chelsea (1869–1933) *Lady Emily Julia (1871–1909), married William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan. *Hon. Lewin Edward (1872–1917) *Lady Sophie Beatrix Mary (1874–1943), married Sir Samuel Scott, 6th Baronet. *Hon. William George Sydney (1879–1914), killed in action. *Hon. Edward Cecil George (1880–1962) *Hon. Alexander George Montagu (1884–1968) He bought Culford Park, Culford, Suffolk, in 1889 as a family home. It is now a private school. Lord Cadogan's wife died in 1907 and on 12 January 1911, he married his first cousin once removed, Adele, daughter of Lippo Neri, Count Palagi del Palagio and Olivia Georgiana Cadogan. Lord Cadogan died in Chelsea, London, on 6 March 1915, aged 74. The Countess Cadogan died in February 1960.

It is the first amusement park in the Six Flags chain. The park opened on August 5, 1961, following just a year of construction and an initial investment of US$10 million by real estate developer Angus G. Wynne, Jr. The park is managed by the Six Flags Entertainment Corp., which also owns 53.1% interest of the Texas Limited Partnership that owns the park. A similar arrangement exists with the partnership that owns Six Flags Over Georgia. Six Flags Over Texas Fund, Ltd, a private-equity and asset management firm headed by Dallas businessman Jack Knox, purchased the park in 1969. Over the years the various companies that managed the park, exercised options to purchase interest in the fund. Six Flags Entertainment has an option to purchase the remaining 46.9% in 2028. Starting in 1991, the park was managed by Time Warner Entertainment. In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to Premier Parks of Oklahoma City, which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc. History The original logo for Six Flags over Texas Following a visit to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, shortly after its opening, wealthy real estate developer Angus G. Wynne, Jr. decided that his home state of Texas should have a local park for entertainment. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction on the park began in August 1960. The name \\"Six Flags Over Texas\\" refers to the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America and the Confederate States of America. Wynne originally intended to name the park \\"Texas Under Six Flags.\\" Various legends have attributed the name change to his wife Joann; a group called \\"The Daughters of The Texas Republic\\" — of which his wife may, or may not, have been a member; or his entertainment director, Charles Meeker, stating that, \\"Texas isn’t 'under' anything.\\" The original park was divided into six separate themed areas for each of the six governing entities that have ruled over Texas. Although additional themed areas have been added, the original six can still be found within the park. Six Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a \\"soft-test opening.\\" The park held its grand opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie and Irving. Park attendance reached 8,374. Admission was $2.75 () for adults and $2.25 () for children; parking was 50 cents (); hamburgers were 35 cents (), and soft drinks were 10 cents (). On opening day, guests could visit the six original themed sections: Mexico, Spain, France, The Confederacy, Texas and Modern (representing the USA). According to the 1961 Park Map\\"1961 Park Map\\" , rcreride.com. there were 46 \\"major attractions\\" listed. The park's first season, lasting only 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success with over 550,000 visitors. The 1960s were a decade of growth for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added numerous attractions, including two new sections: Boomtown, named after the boomtowns that sprang up rather quickly during Texas' oil boom era and the \\"Tower Section\\", named after the Oil Derrick observation tower built in 1969. The park also witnessed the birth of two classic theme park attractions: El Aserradero in 1963 and the Runaway Mine Train roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. For the 50th anniversary (2011), Six Flags Over Texas introduced the first I-Box roller coaster track with a transformation of Texas Giant. The reception from the conversion, led the manufacture to bring the new technology all over the world. During this time, Six Flags (the company) began the process of removing licensed theming company wide across its theme parks from attractions that the park had built in previous years. Six Flags Over Texas had to rename and retheme Tony Hawks Big Spin to Pandemonium. In 2020, the park begin (for the first time in its history), operating at a year-round schedule. Before 2020, Six Flags Over Texas ran seasons from March to the end of that specific year. Within three months into the longer season (March 13, 2020), Six Flags suspended all operations across all their properties due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the time of closure, the park has donated food and supplies to a local charities. On June 4, Six Flags announced the park would reopen on June 19 to members and season pass holders, and to the general public on June 22.

Events Six Flags Over Texas hosts a number of events for different holidays all throughout the operating season that often draws thousands of visitors to the park. * Fright Fest – Originally only one night in October called 'Fright Night', Fright Fest is the annual Halloween festival at Six Flags Over Texas. Fright Fest takes place throughout the month of October and features several specialized additions to the park. Haunted houses, decorated pathways, patrolling ghouls and spooky music all contribute to the park's transformation into a giant 'scream' park. * Holiday in the Park – A tradition started in 1985, Holiday in the Park is now one of the park's most popular seasonal events as the park's season winds down towards the end of November and throughout December. Hundreds of thousands of Christmas lights are strung around the park buildings and rides. An authentic snow hill is available for visitors to sled down. Festive holiday shows, arts and crafts, and delicious seasonal food also bring the holidays to Six Flags Over Texas. Controversy The Confederacy was one of the original themed areas and it showcased Civil War re-enactments and displayed the Confederate Battle Flag. In the 1990s it was rethemed to \\"Old South\\" and all Confederate Battle Flags were removed. The land drew little attention as there weren't any high-profile rides in that area. However, the Confederate \\"stars and bars\\" remained one of the six flags that was flown at the park entrance. In August 2017, in response to the controversial Unite the Right rally that was held in Charlottesville, Virginia, the park replaced its six flags (which had included the first Confederate flag, a Republic of Texas flag, a 19th-century Spanish flag, an 18th-century French flag, a 19th-century United States flag, and a 19th-century Mexican flag) with six American flags. A representative of the park told KXAS-TV, \\"We always choose to focus on celebrating the things that unite us versus those that divide us. As such, we have changed the flag displays in our park to feature American flags.\\" References * Jordan, Scott L. MousePlanet - This Old Park. Retrieved September 21, 2004. * McCown, Davis.

In other words, it refers to a collection of intermediate structures in a chemical reaction that persist while bonds are breaking and new bonds are forming. It therefore represents not one defined state, but rather a range of transient configurations that a collection of atoms passes through in between clearly defined products and reactants. It is the subject of transition state theory - also known as activated complex theory - which studies the kinetics of reactions that pass through a defined intermediate state with standard Gibbs energy of formation . The state represented by the double dagger symbol is known as the transition state and represents the exact configuration that has an equal probability of forming either the reactants or products of the given reaction. The activated complex is often confused with the transition state and is used interchangeably in many textbooks. However, it differs from the transition state in that the transition state represents only the highest potential energy configuration of the atoms during the reaction while the activated complex refers to a range of configurations near the transition state that the atoms pass through in the transformation from products to reactants. This can be visualized in terms of a reaction coordinate, where the transition state is the molecular configuration at the peak of the diagram while the activated complex can refer to any point near the maximum.

He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1889 and 1892. Background, education and military service He was born in London, the son of the Hon. John Charles Dundas, younger son of Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland (Zetland is an archaic spelling of Shetland). His mother was Margaret Matilda, daughter of James Talbit. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, being commissioned as a Cornet in the Royal Horse Guards in 1866. Political career By 1869 a Lieutenant, Zetland retired from the British Army in 1872 and was elected Member of Parliament for Richmond, North Yorkshire that same year. However, he sat in the House of Commons for less than a year before succeeding his uncle as third Earl of Zetland. A Lord in Waiting from May to September 1880, Lord Zetland subsequently moved from supporting the Liberals to joining the Conservative Party in 1884. In 1889 he was sent to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant. The same year he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Saint Patrick (KP). In the post he proved both successful and popular, and remained there until the Liberals returned to power in 1892. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1889 and in 1892, on Lord Salisbury's recommendation, he was created Earl of Ronaldshay, in the County of Orkney and Zetland, and Marquess of Zetland. In the 1890s Lord Zetland became more involved in local politics, becoming an alderman on the North Riding of Yorkshire County Council in 1894 and being elected Mayor of Richmond in 1895 and 1896. In 1900 he was made a Knight of the Thistle. A freemason like his uncle and grandfather, Zetland was the society's provincial Grand Master in the North and East Riding of Yorkshire from 1874 to 1923. He was also an enthusiastic sportsman, and was Master of the Zetland Hunt for thirty-five years. Family Lord Zetland married Lady Lilian Selina Elizabeth Lumley, daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough, in 1871. He died in March 1929, aged 84, at Aske Hall, Yorkshire, and was buried there. His eldest surviving son Lawrence succeeded him. The Marchioness of Zetland died in December 1943. They had five children: *Lady Hilda Mary Dundas (b. 24 Nov 1872 - d. 19 May 1957) married Charles Henry FitzRoy, 4th Baron Southampton on 9 July 1892. *Thomas Dundas, Lord Dundas (b. 19 Jan 1874 - d. 11 Feb 1874) *Lawrence John Lumley Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland (b. 11 Jun 1876 - d. 6 Feb 1961) *Lady Maud Frederica Elizabeth Dundas (b. 9 Jul 1877 - d. 15 Mar 1967) married William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam on 24 June 1896. *Lord George Heneage Lawrence Dundas (b. 1 Jul 1882 - d. 30 Sep 1968) married Iris Winifred Hanley on 23 December 1905.

The Taylor rule was proposed by the American economist John B. Taylor, economic adviser in the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, in 1992 as a central bank technique to stabilize economic activity by setting an interest rate.Judd, John P. and Bharat Trehan, Has the Fed Gotten Tougher on Inflation? (1995) FRBSF Weekly Letter, Number 95-13, March 31 The rule is based on three main indicators: the federal funds rate, the price level and the changes in real income.John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Stanford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905 The Taylor rule prescribes economic activity regulation by choosing the federal funds rate based on the inflation gap between desired (targeted) inflation rate and actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural level. According to Taylor, a central bank implements a stabilizing monetary policy when it raises the nominal interest rate by more than an increase in inflation.Frederic S. Mishkin, Monetary Policy Strategy Lessons from the Crisis National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge MA 02138 February 2011 In other words, the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate in the situation when actual inflation is higher than targeted. The main advantage of a general targeting rule is that a central bank gains the discretion to apply all means to achieve the set target. The economic model based on backwards- and forward-looking assumptions is justified.Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has been changing throughout the 20th century. The period between 1960s - 1970s is defined by Taylor as a period of a poor monetary policy. The inflation rate was growing in the US while the interest rate was sat at the low level not allowing to restrain the rise of prices.B.

Kahn, and Robert Leeson, The Taylor Rule and the Practice of Central Banking (February 2010), The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City However, since the 2000s the actual interest rate in advanced economies, especially in the US, was below the suggested by the Taylor rule.Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global “Great Deviation”? (September 2012) The Taylor rule is usually opposed to discretion policy. Due to the high technicality of the rule, the inaccuracy of predictable variable and limited number of factors incorporated into the model, the Taylor rule often faces criticism. As an equation According to Taylor's original version of the rule, the nominal interest rate should respond to divergences of actual inflation rates from target inflation rates and of actual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from potential GDP: :i_t = \\\\pi_t + r_t^* + a_\\\\pi ( \\\\pi_t - \\\\pi_t^* ) + a_y ( y_t - \\\\bar y_t ). In this equation, \\\\,i_t\\\\, is the target short-term nominal interest rate (e.g. the federal funds rate in the US, the Bank of England base rate in the UK), \\\\,\\\\pi_t\\\\, is the rate of inflation as measured by the GDP deflator, \\\\pi^*_t is the desired rate of inflation, r_t^* is the assumed equilibrium real interest rate, \\\\,y_t\\\\, is the logarithm of real GDP, and \\\\bar y_t is the logarithm of potential output, as determined by a linear trend. In this equation, both a_{\\\\pi} and a_y should be positive (as a rough rule of thumb, Taylor's 1993 paper proposed setting a_{\\\\pi}=a_y=0.5).Athanasios Orphanides (2008). \\"Taylor rules,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. v. 8, pp. 2000-2004, equation (7).Abstract. That is, the rule \\"recommends\\" a relatively high interest rate (a \\"tight\\" monetary policy) when inflation is above its target or when output is above its full-employment level, in order to reduce inflationary pressure. It recommends a relatively low interest rate (\\"easy\\" monetary policy) in the opposite situation, to stimulate output. Sometimes monetary policy goals may conflict, as in the case of stagflation, when inflation is above its target while output is below full employment. In such a situation, a Taylor rule specifies the relative weights given to reducing inflation versus increasing output. The Taylor principle By specifying a_{\\\\pi}>0, the Taylor rule says that an increase in inflation by one percentage point should prompt the central bank to raise the nominal interest rate by more than one percentage point (specifically, by 1+a_{\\\\pi}, the sum of the two coefficients on \\\\pi_t in the equation above). Since the real interest rate is (approximately) the nominal interest rate minus inflation, stipulating a_{\\\\pi}>0 implies that when inflation rises, the real interest rate should be increased. The idea that the nominal interest rate should be raised \\"more than one-for-one\\" to cool the economy when inflation increases (that is increasing the real interest rate) has sometimes been called the Taylor principle.  The historical perspective  The policy rule emerged in the era of the broad debate on the policy rules versus discretion. The discourse among economists and policymakers started at the beginning of the 19th century. The first forum for debate was launched in the 1920s by the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In the hearing on the Strong bill in 1923, the conflict in the views on the monetary policy clearly appeared. New York Fed Governor Benjamin Strong Jr., supported by Professors John R. Commons and Irving Fisher, was highly concerned about the practices uses by the Fed to control the price stability. In his opinion, Federal Reserve policy regarding the price level was unstable and could not guarantee long-term stability. After the death of the congressman, a political debate on changing the Fed's policy was suspended. The Fed was dominated at that time by Strong and his New York Reserve Bank. Only after the Great Depression hit the country, the Fed policies started to be debated again. Irving Fisher compressed that “this depression was almost wholly preventable and that it would have been prevented if Governor Strong had lived, who was conducting open-market operations with a view of bringing about stability”.Robert L. Hetzel, The Rules versus discretion debate over monetary policy in the 1920 Later on, such monetarists as Friedman and Schwartz, confirmed that the economic dichotomy and the high inflation could be bypassed if the Fed followed more precise the constant-money-rule. The recession in the US in the 1960s was accompanied by relatively high-interest rate. After Bretton Woods collapse the policy-makers were focused on keeping a low- interest rate, which had a negative impact on inventory process and resulted in the Great Inflation of 1970. Since the mid-1970s monetary targets have been used in many countries to state targets for inflation. Many advanced economies, such as the US and the UK, their policy rates were broadly consistent with the Taylor rule in the period of the “Great Moderation” between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. The Great moderation period was characterized by the limited inflation and stability of prices. Thus, many central banks started to adjust their policies. The first mover was New Zealand, where the inflation target was introduced in 1984. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand was reformed to prioritize the price stability, besides, it gained more independence. After that, the Bank of Canada in 1991 and by 1994 the banks of Sweden, Finland, Australia, Spain, Israel and Chile were given the mandate to target inflation. However, since the 2000s the actual interest rate in advanced economies, especially in the US, was below the suggested by the Taylor rule. The deviation can be explained by the fact that the central banks were supposed to mitigate the outcomes of financial busts but should intervene only when there are inflation expectations. The economics shocks were accompanied by the fall of the interest rate. Alternative versions of the rule Effective federal funds rate and prescriptions from alternate versions of the Taylor Rule While the Taylor principle has proved very influential, there is more debate about the other terms that should enter into the rule. According to some simple New Keynesian macroeconomic models, insofar as the central bank keeps inflation stable, the degree of fluctuation in output will be optimized (Blanchard and Gali call this property the 'divine coincidence'). In this case, the central bank does not need to take fluctuations in the output gap into account when setting interest rates (that is, it may optimally set a_y=0.) On the other hand, other economists have proposed including additional terms in the Taylor rule to take into account financial conditions: for example, the interest rate might be raised when stock prices, housing prices, or interest rate spreads increase. * Taylor Rule 1993 - the original definition by John Taylor with a_{\\\\pi} = a_y = 0.5 * Taylor Rule 1999 - adapted and updated by John Taylor in a new research paper: a_{\\\\pi} = 0.5, a_y \\\\ge 0  Alternative theories  Solvency rule: the alternative theory to the Taylor equation. The new perspective on the rule was presented by Emiliano Brancaccio after the financial crises of 2008. The central banker follows a 'rule' aimed to control the solvency conditions in the economic system.Emiliano Brancaccio, Giuseppe Fontana, The Global Economic Crisis. (2011), Routledge, Oxon OX14 4RN The inflation target and output gap are neglected, while the interest rate is put under the conditionality to the solvency of workers and firms that represent financial stability. Opposite to stricter Taylor rule the solvency rule represents more a benchmark than a mechanistic formula.E. Brancaccio and G. Fontana, (2013). ‘Solvency rule’ versus ‘Taylor rule’: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 37, 1. See also Brancaccio, E., Moneta, A., Lopreite, M., Califano, A. (2020). Nonperforming Loans and Competing Rules of Monetary Policy: a Statistical Identification Approach. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics. Volume 53, pages 127-136 McCallum rule: The rule created by economist Bennett T. McCallum at the end of the 20th-century targets the nominal gross domestic products. In the idea of McCallum the Fed should stabilize the nominal GDP to achieve economic stability. Although the same monetary policy objectives can be reached by McCallum rule as by Taylor rule, the McCallum rule uses the precise financial data.Michael F. Gallmeyer Burton Hollifield Stanley E. Zin, Taylor Rules, McCallum Rules and the term structure of interest rates (April 2005), National Bureau Of Economic Research 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138 Thus, the McCallum rule can overcome the problem of the unobservable variables. Empirical relevance Although the Federal Reserve does not explicitly follow the Taylor rule, many analysts have argued that the rule provides a fairly accurate summary of US monetary policy under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan. Similar observations have been made about central banks in other developed economies, both in countries like Canada and New Zealand that have officially adopted inflation targeting rules, and in others like Germany where the Bundesbank's policy did not officially target the inflation rate. This observation has been cited by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler as a reason why inflation had remained under control and the economy had been relatively stable (the so-called 'Great Moderation') in most developed countries from the 1980s through the 2000s. However, according to Taylor, the rule was not followed in part of the 2000s, possibly leading to the housing bubble. Certain research has determined that some households form their expectations about the future path of interest rates, inflation, and unemployment in a way that is consistent with Taylor-type rules.  Limitation of the Taylor rule  The Taylor rule is highly debated in the discourse of the rules vs. discretion. There are a few main limitations of the Taylor rule. 1) Technical reasons. For the economic models, the period of 4 months was widely used, however, the period is not accurate to track the real changes in price, and this period is too long for setting the fixed interest rate.John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Stanford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905) Besides, the formulate incorporates the unobservable parameters can be easily misevaluated. For example, the output-gap could not be precisely estimated by any bank. 2) The inaccuracy of predictable variables, such as the inflation and output gap that depend on the different scenarios of economic development. 3) Difficulty to assess the state of the economy in real-time 4) The discretionary optimization that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence. 5) The limited number of factors in the model. The model does not outlook the financial parameters. Thus, in the period of the financial boost the Taylor rule might tend to underestimate the interest rate, and opposite, during the financial busts overestimate. 6) Does not reflect the usability of other monetary policy instruments such as reserve funds adjustment, balance sheet policies. 7) The relationship between the interest rate and aggregate demand is questioning by Kriesler and Lanoie, 2007.Emiliano Brancaccio and Giuseppe Fontana, ‘Solvency rule’ versus ‘Taylor rule’: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis (August 2012 ), Cambridge Journal of Economics However, Taylor in his economic work highlighted that the rule should not be implicated mechanically: “…There will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors.” On another hand, the Taylor rule is opposed to the discretion approach since it aimed to overcome the limitation of the purely discretionary approach. Hence, although the Taylor rule gives the room for manoeuvre, it is encouraged to treat the Taylor rule as a policy rule that required the strict implementation of the policy based on the incoming economic parameters. Criticisms Athanasios Orphanides (2003) claims that the Taylor rule can misguide policy makers since they face real- time data. He shows that the Taylor rule matches the US funds rate less perfectly when accounting for these informational limitations and that an activist policy following the Taylor rule would have resulted in an inferior macroeconomic performance during the Great Inflation of the seventies. In 2015, financial manager Bill Gross said the Taylor rule \\"must now be discarded into the trash bin of history\\", in light of tepid GDP growth in the years after 2009. Gross believed low interest rates were not the cure for decreased growth, but the source of the problem.

Federal Reserve System Monetary policy ","title":"Taylor rule"},{"id":"607596","text":"The is a fictional line of manned robots (mecha) from Mobile Suit Gundam, part of the Universal Century fictional universe, where they are the Principality of Zeon's most commonly fielded Mobile Suits. The most widely known model is the MS-06 Zaku II series. It is redesigned by Kunio Okawara based upon the earlier draft by the series director Yoshiyuki Tomino, in which only the name was kept. The Zaku II has seen various redesigns and variants for hundreds of pieces of merchandise, and the Japanese post office has two stamps with Zaku IIs on them.The 20th Century Stamp Series 15Animation Hero and Heroine Series II \\"Gundam\\" The Zaku's aesthetic can be seen in more symbolic homages in the Gundam mythos, such as the GINN and ZAKU Warrior from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, the Busshi from Mobile Fighter G Gundam, and the Jenice from After War Gundam X. After the original show's run, Okawara and other designers created a number of variants of the Zaku. Many of these modified configurations never appeared in animation, but they are official Mobile Suit variations, appearing instead in plastic model form and in various Gundam video games. The MS-06 Zaku II is still a major force in Gundam, with almost every new side story in the Universal Century adding a new variant to the basic frame. Concept and Development The original concept of the Zaku was simply a disposable underling, with its name derived from the sound of a huge man (or many soldiers) walking and the Japanese term 雑魚 (zako), meaning \\"inferior fish\\" (referring to mediocre-quality fish not suitable for fine dining, also signifying expendable grunts).アニメック(Animec) 16th issue special volume, 機動戦士ガンダム大事典 (Mobile suit Gundam Encyclopedia), 1 March 1981, Yoshiyuki Tomino Interview, そうですね、ザクなんかでも………大きい人が歩いてくると地面がザクッザクッと音をだしますね、それからとったんですよ。(笑), Yes, Zaku whatever... is when a huge man walking the ground will make Zaku, Zaku sound, and it took that (for its name) (laughter)ガンダム･エイジ (Gundam Age), 洋泉社, 敵のモビルスーツのザクは、もともとは、雑兵っていうか、雑魚(ザコ)なのね。でも、ザコじゃあんまりだ。やつら軍隊だから、軍団でザクザクやってくるでしょ。だからザクにしようって, Enemy's Mobile suit Zaku is originally (designed as) a common soldier, disposable underling (Zako). However, saying it is an underling is too extreme, they are a military force and flanks of army make the Zaku Zaku sound, thus it was named Zaku. The Zaku later became better known as a common military machine, symbolizing the realism of the Mobile Suit Gundam series. While in previous manga and anime giant robots tended to be the tools of protagonists or villains (often in a monster of the week format), the Zaku was portrayed as nothing more than another weapon such as a tank or fighter plane that was assigned to pilots. The Zaku is the first mobile suit to feature its parts (a damaged head) and is shown in 3 of the 4 box arts in the 1/35 U.C. Hard Graph line of plastic models made by Bandai, which heavily resembles real battle fields.U.C. Hard Graph products This militaristic development did not start just recently, but actually started on the first release of Gundam series models in 1980, where military modellers at that time were amazed by the 1/144 scale Zaku model fitting in so naturally when placed next to World War I and World War II 1/144 models, and modellers started to build them like AFVs.Dengeki Hobby Nov 2006 issue, Gundam Military The popularity of the first batch of the models spawned the Mobile Suit Variations where the mecha designer Kunio Okawara started designing variant mobile suits that could perform different tasks or adapt to different combat zones (for example, a Zaku specialized for underwater operations). The MS-06 Zaku II unit then became the unit with most variantsDengeki Hobby June 2007, MG Zaku Ver. 2.0 Interview of the 12 year anniversary of the Master Grade Zaku (22 alone in the first MSV all having its own model compared to titular machine RX-78-2 Gundam's 3 variants). It could be said that the Zaku is the impetus of MSV.MSV's origin = Zaku, Dengeki Hobby July 2007 The Zaku also had redesigns and variants created by other mecha designers, like the famous Katoki Hajime, who designed the MS-06F2 Zaku II Type F2 for Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory and redesigned the Zaku II Ground Type and Char's Commander type Zaku for the MG (Master Grade) number 97 and 98 Zaku Ver. 2.0, Yutaka Izubuchi, who is famous for his designs in Patlabor designed the MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai for Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket. The design of the Zaku II influenced the later designs of the RMS-106 Hizack in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and AMX-011 Zaku III in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. The RMS-116H Hobby Hizack, not a military-use but a personal entertainment suit, which appeared in Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack is also a descendant of the Zaku. Its descendants continue to appear, even in Manga stories like the OMS-06RF RF Zaku used by the Mars Zeon faction in Mobile Suit Gundam F90.機動戦士ガンダム MS-06解体新書 (MS-06 Anatomy), ティーツー出版, ISBN：4-88749-055-0 Role in plot The Zaku II is the most common Zeon mobile suit during the beginning of the show. Although a threat to unskilled characters, the Zaku is ultimately cannon fodder that comes in plentiful numbers for the Gundam. In the Gundam timeline, the Zaku appears as one of the first units created for battle in the series. At the start of the One Year War, Zaku II's were the mainstay of Zeon's military. Zaku II quickly becomes inferior to newer and more powerful mobile suits as the war progresses, and by the later stages of the war is considered antiquated. Because the Zaku II is the basic military unit of the Zeon forces, and because it is a mass production mobile suit, there are many units left by the end of the war. These suits survive only to be destroyed en-masse to show the power of the newer models.July 2007 edition Dengeki Magazine By the time of Gundam Unicorn, over fifteen years after the One Year War, Zaku II's are literally shown as museum pieces. Upon seeing a display model of an old Zaku II, some characters remark upon how outdated it is, while others point out its historical significance as an early example of widely mass-produced Mobile Suits. =Other Gundam series= The Zaku II design has also been included in story lines outside of the Universal Century, in the Cosmic Era series of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny where the director Mitsuo Fukuda requested the mecha designer Kunio Okawara to add his Zaku into the story.Kunio Okawara interview, Newtype Magazine SEED Destiny special edition, December 2004 The ZAKU (ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity) Warrior designed became a high-end model in the plot. The ZAKU Phantom is a commander unit. The Zaku series of Mobile Suits also appears in the CC Era of Turn A Gundam as the MS-06 Borjarnon and MS-05 Borjarnon Gavane Gooney Custom, which are excavated MS-06F Zaku II's and a slightly modified MS-05B Zaku I, respectively. Naming History The original name for this mobile suit as it originally appeared was simply Zaku.Original model box set, Mass Production type Zaku released before Gundam Century. In the non-official publication Gundam Century(in which later endorsed by Bandai as a semi-official guide book), it was named the Zaku II, so as to separate it from the MS-05 Zaku I (originally referred to simply as Old Zaku in the original series). The name was then officially endorsed and all subsequent publications by either Sunrise or Bandai refer to it as Zaku II.MSV model box set, MS-06R Zaku II Variations The variants of the Zaku are what gave it a more realistic military feel, and started the later militaristic variation boom of the Universal Century Gundam series with many units having their own variant designs. Most of these units can be simply classified by the code given to it. There are Type A, B, C, D, E, E-3, F, F2, Fs, FZ, G, H, J, K, M, R-1, R-1A, R-2, RD-4, S, T, V, W, Z and various colour scheme featuring different pilots' personal colouring like the World War I flying Aces. Also, official parody version called Saku is also featured in a few games and manga. =Saku= First appeared online as a fan parody, later officially in the Gundam Ace magazine. The unit was a parody of the original Zaku II, but is much cheaper and was mass-produced in a much greater number than the original Zaku II. Its head has the katakana sign \\"Zi\\", the original word for \\"Zeon\\". It was a single pill-shaped body and head with a mono-eye drawn on it, with rope-like limbs and a mouth like an octopus. A red Char Custom version saku with a horn (antenna) is the leader of a large squad of green saku and unknown named horned blue ones are a parody of the MS-07 Gouf. =MS-06F Zaku II= First appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam, the Zaku II Type F is by far the most common variant of the Zaku II seen in the One Year War, seeing action both on Earth and in space. Overall, more than 3000 units are known to have been manufactured and deployed over the course of the war. =MS-06F2 Zaku II Type F2= First appeared in Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, design by Hajime Katoki. Near the end of the One Year War, the Zeonic Company introduced an upgraded version of the MS-06F Zaku II, called MS-06F2 or Type F2. This upgraded model featured improved armor around the cockpit and a new Minovsky fusion reactor which was approximately 4% more powerful than the regular F-type's. It was also lighter than the previous model, making it more fuel efficient and giving it a longer flight time, as well as overall improved performance. After the One Year War, F2s were still in use. Some retained by Zeon remnants, as well as units captured by the Federation, which were usually used as aggressor units in squadrons conducting pilot training and mobile suit field testing. =MS-06FZ Zaku II Last Mass Production Type (Zaku Kai)= First appeared in Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, design by Yutaka Izubuchi. Developed very late during the One Year War as part of the \\"United Maintenance Plan\\", the MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai () was an improved and redesigned version of the Zaku II. The United Maintenance Plan was an effort by the Zeon military to simplify the production of their different types of mobile suits by standardizing parts and systems where possible. Due to the MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai's late introduction into the One Year War, only a handful of the units were produced. Few, if any, of the mobile suits survived the war. Originally the OVA staff for Gundam 0080 intended for the FZ to be a Retcon Revision to the Zaku II. The Toy arm of Bandai came up with a separate back story in order to keep selling both the 1979 and the new zaku as model kits. the picture book MS Era illustrated by the same team still depicts the original concept.M.S. Era - The Documentary Photographs Of The One Year War - Mobile Suit Gundam 0001~0080 (1990.3.30, Bandai, ) =MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type= Design by Kunio Okawara, the MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type (also known as the Zaku II Custom in some sources) looks very similar to the normal Zaku: so much so that the Earth Federation can generally only tell the difference from color schemes most pilots apply to their units and the increased performance of this version. The S-Type Zaku II features a squad- leader \\"horn\\" that is mounted on the head on the Zaku II, which is used to distinguish squad-leaders or higher ranking pilots from other squad-members or lower ranking pilots. It also featured a more powerful fusion reactor. In turn, the S-Type Zaku II had greater thrust and acceleration. This allowed them to move at speeds 1/3 faster than a normal Zaku II (in the original TV series, it was stated to be 3 times faster, but this was retconned in the movie trilogy to the more reasonable figure). This made it incredibly dangerous in the hands of the ace pilots it was handed out to, such as the \\"Red Comet\\" Char Aznable whose mobile suit was painted in a fade tonality of red and pink. =Land Type variations= MS-06J Zaku II Ground Type Appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. The J-Type Zaku II was built specifically for terrestrial operations, and thus lacked space-specific equipment, greatly reducing its overall mass and cost. It also featured a slightly more powerful reactor to assist in its mobility under the full-gravity conditions of Earth. Compared to the F-type Zaku, the J-type was better insulated against its environment, and could be used in brief underwater operations. Its weapons were the same as its spaceborne counterpart, though a few weapons, such as the 175mm Magella Top gun were used only by the land types. =JC Subtype= Appears in Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team, design by Kunio Okawara. The land-battle Zakus appearing in the 08th MS Team anime were portrayed in a different style than in other anime: they were redesigned similarly to the Master Grade Zaku model kits that had been recently released, though with a few differences. Originally, the Zakus in 08th MS Team were identified as J-types, but recently this designation was retconned to MS-06Jc. The description of the JC-type Zaku on the official 08th MS Team website describes it as being similar to the J-type Zaku, but with features seen in the 08th MS Team anime, such as the redesigned cockpit and the spiked shield seen in the show's opening.ジオン軍 :: Mobile Suit :: 機動戦士ガンダム 第08MS小隊 MS-06V Zaku Tank First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, design by Kunio Okawara. A worker variant appear in Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team, design by Kimitoshi Yamane. As the One Year War dragged on, the Zeon forces found themselves in desperate need of replacement parts for their mobile suits and other weapons. Forced to salvage whatever they could, inoperable machines were often disassembled for use as replacement parts, new unit designs cobbled together from whatever was available in order to get more combat units to the field. One of the most common variations was the MS-06V Zaku Tank, created from mounting a Zaku torso, head and arms on the drive base of a Magella attack tank. These units were prized by field commanders starved for replacement mobile suits, and were used for both construction and combat. =Reconnaissance Type variations= The reconnaissance models were said to be used to team up with other mobile suits and launch skirmish attacks on enemies and determine by the countering numbers how many forces the enemy had in the area.Dengeki Hobby Nov 2006 issue, Gundam Military, Reconnaissance Team MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Type First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, design by Kunio Okawara. The MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Type, or just Zaku Recon Type for short, was designed for scouting and reconnaissance missions. These Zaku Recon Types, also known as E-Types, mounted specialized camera guns and sensor systems. MS-06E-3 Zaku Flipper First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. Of the one hundred or so MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Types that were built during the One Year War, a handful were further upgraded into the MS-06E-3 Zaku Flipper. The Zaku Flipper was designed to play the role of a reconnaissance and scouting unit. It got its name from the creator because instead of a normal mono-eye head, its head is three-eyed with two large fins (flips) next to it as high-powered radar that can even penetrate Minovsky particle. =MS-11 Action Zaku= First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, design by Kunio Okawara. The MS-11 Action Zaku, often referred to as Act Zaku for short, is a Principality of Zeon prototype mobile suit based on the MS-06 Zaku II. However, the Act Zaku was introduced too late for the Principality of Zeon. When the Earth Federation Forces captured the Pezun asteroid, they obtained the designs for the Action Zaku, and the concept of magnetic joint coating. The Earth Federation would put the Act Zaku into production for their own use after the One Year War. =Worker Type variations= MS-06F (MS-06H) Zaku Minelayer First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. The Zaku Minelayer is a standard MS-06F Zaku II equipped with a different style backpack. With this new backpack, the Zaku II is adapted to play the role of a mine-laying unit. The new backpack houses several drums filled with space mines, with twelve mines packed into every drum. The backpack also has a few additional maneuvering thrusters and carries five times the amount of fuel of a standard Zaku II. However, the Zaku Minelayer requires a special loading area on a Musai to reload, launch, or land. MS-06W Worker Zaku First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. The Worker Zaku was a variant on the traditional Zaku design designed exclusively for labor. The unit's cockpit was modified and constructed from the cockpit of a standard construction vehicle, allowing someone without military training to pilot the suit. The suits were fielded in western Asia, until the production was moved towards the MS-06V, which used most of the same parts as the MS-06W. =Psycommu Test Type Variations= MS-06Z (MS-06Z-3) Psycommu Test Type Zaku II First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. The MS-06Z Psycommu Test Type Zaku II was the final Zaku variant developed under the MS-16X \\"Bishop\\" plan. Three test units were created, but the plan was halted due to a fatal flaw. The suit's incredibly high energy consumption meant that they could only fight for a maximum of 10 minutes. The wire-guided forearms with beam cannons mounted in each of the fingers were almost identical to the ones that would later be implemented in the MSN-02 Zeong. Additionally, the suit's unique weaponry, psycommu system, and additional apogee thrusters brought the price of the suit up to the equivalent of several Zaku IIs. =Post-war Insurgent variations= MS-21C Dra-C First appeared in the anime OVA Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, designed by Mika Akitaka. After the end of the One Year War many of the Zeon remnants that refused to let the war end in anything less than victory retreated from the Earth Sphere and went into hiding. While in exile these renegade fleets slowly built up their forces, plotting to renew their conflict against the Earth Federation. There were little supplies available to the Zeon remnants, so to build up their forces, the Dra-C was built from salvaged parts and mobile suit components (notably the torsos and arms of Zaku II F2s). This new machine is a space-only, high-speed interceptor Mobile Suit. Its standard armaments were light; most units were fielded with a 40mm vulcan gun and a beam saber- equipped shield on the left arm, though some have been shown with larger beam gatling guns. This mobile suit was notably used by the Delaz Fleet remnants during the Delaz Conflict of 0083, and some would continue to see some use at least another thirteen years afterward, in the hands of the Axis Fleet during both the Gryps Conflict of 0087–0088, and by the Sleeves in 0096. As a retcon, the Dra-C appears as part of the Axis fleet in a dark-gray color scheme in the third Zeta Gundam film, and in a pink color scheme with a gatling gun in episode 3 of Gundam Unicorn. MS-06F (Stutzer version) Appear in ' photonovel, design by Kenki Fujioka. After the One Year War, the remnants of the Zeon forces upgraded their Zaku II units to this MS-06F Zaku II \\"Stutzer\\" configuration to counter the Titans' new machines, as Zeon no longer had any production capabilities for any new mobile suit designs. The Zaku II \\"Stutzer\\" was enhanced with winch units, which were able to launch wire-guided arm parts that could entangle enemy machines with wire, or throw hand grenades at them while the mobile suit itself remained hidden. Additionally, the Stutzer mounted the MS-14A Gelgoog's beam rifle, which was powered by an auxiliary generator on its back. =Novel version= In the Mobile Suit Gundam Novel by Yoshiyuki Tomino, Zaku fingers contain Laser Touch to burn its way through obstructions and its boosters can bring it to jump to a height of 800m.Mobile Suit Gundam (Novel) =Descendants of the Zaku II series= Although the original Zaku II was obsolete by the end of Zeon's war for independence, its design was frequently revisited in following conflicts; for instance, the RMS-106 Hi-Zack (a hybrid between Zeon's Zaku and Federation's GM) of the Gryps Conflict, the AMX-011 Zaku III of the first Neo Zeon movement, (to a lesser extent) the AMS-119 Geara Doga of the second Neo Zeon movement, the AMS-129 Geara Zulu of the third Neo Zeon movement, and the OMS-06RF RF Zaku of the Mars Zeon Rebellion.

It is the administrative centre of the shire. At the 2016 census, Cloncurry recorded a population of 2,719 people. Cloncurry is known as the Friendly Heart of the Great North West and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2017.Community Research Report - Cloncurry (QLD) Introduction (20 September 2002) Cloncurry was recognised for its liveability, winning the Queensland's Friendliest Town award twice by environmental movement Keep Queensland Beautiful, first in 2013 and again in 2018.  Geography  Cloncurry is situated in the north-west of Queensland, 770 kilometres west of the city of Townsville via the Flinders Highway. The town lies adjacent to the Cloncurry River.Post Office Hotel Cattle grazing is the significant industry in the region, and a large sale yards is located in the town. History Kalkatunga (also known as Kalkadoon, Kalkadunga, Kalkatungu) is an Australian Aboriginal language. The Kalkatunga language region is North-West Queensland including the local government areas of the City of Mount Isa. The first Europeans to traverse these tribal lands of peoples such as the Maithakari and the Wanamara, were Burke and Wills on their epic, and ultimately fatal, transcontinental expedition. The Cloncurry River was named by Burke after Lady Elizabeth Cloncurry, his cousin, with the town eventually taking its name from the river. Ernest Henry discovered copper in the area in 1867, and the town sprang up to service the Great Australia Mine to the south. Roger Sheaffe established the first pastoral run in the Cloncurry district - \\"Fort Constantine\\". Gold was discovered at Top Camp. The town was surveyed in 1876. Cloncurry was proclaimed a town in 1884. Front page of the Cloncurry Advocate Saturday 17 January 1931 The Cloncurry Advocate was a newspaper published in Cloncurry between 1889 and 1953. Queensland's Northern Line railway reached Cloncurry in December 1907 and was officially opened the next year. St Joseph's School opened on 29 October 1909. In 1914 a fire broke out in the town resulting in the destruction of the Post Office, the hotel, eleven shops, two store-rooms and a cottage. The telegraph office was saved by employees who kept the office damp and protected with wet blankets. One man died in the blaze which cost an estimated £15,000. The discovery of uranium at Mary Kathleen brought wealth to the community in the 1950s. Until the development of Mount Isa in the 1960s, Cloncurry was the administrative centre of the region. The first-ever flight of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia took place from Cloncurry on 15 May 1928, using a de Havilland DH.50 aircraft hired from the then small airline, Qantas. A Royal Flying Doctor Service museum is situated in the town. The population in Cloncurry decreased from 3,898 in 1996 to 2,900 in 2002. It declined further to 2,719 by 2016. The Cloncurry Bob McDonald Library opened in 2012. Heritage listings Cloncurry has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Via Sheaffe Street: Mount Elliott Company Metallurgical Plant and Mill * 42-48 Daintree Street: Cloncurry Courthouse * 47 Scarr Street: Cloncurry Post Office Climate Cloncurry was widely regarded as holding the record for the highest temperature recorded in Australia at on 16 January 1889. Recent investigations have revealed that this temperature was measured in an improvised screen made from a beer crate and that it equated to 47–49 °C under standard conditions. The highest temperature ever recorded at Cloncurry's current weather station is , well short of the now widely disputed 1889 temperature of 53.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is , almost all of which falls In the months of December to March Because of the area's extreme solar conditions, Cloncurry was expected to become Australia's first solar-powered town.\\"Town so hot it’s first on the solar block\\" , Sydney Morning Herald (5 November 2007) However the planned 10MW Thermal solar plant was scrapped due to light pollution concerns and a 2.128MW flat panel photovoltaic solar farm was to be built in its place. However, the Queensland Government withdrew financial support for the solar farm in May 2012.

He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1880 to 1882. Overwhelmingly by inheritance he was rendered a sterling millionaire, a threshold reached by his own death estate which is estimated to apply to seven other British residents per year, only, in 1905. Background Cowper (pronounced \\"Cooper\\") was the eldest son of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper, by his wife Anne de Grey, 7th holder of the barony of Lucas of Crudwell, daughter of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. He was educated at Harrow School and the University of Oxford. He was commissioned a cornet in the Yorkshire Hussars on 19 February 1852. On 22 November 1855, his father appointed him a deputy lieutenant of Kent. Political career Cowper entered the House of Lords on his father's death in 1856 and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1871 to 1874 and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1880 to 1882. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1865 and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1871. Other public positions Apart from his political career Cowper held the position of Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire between 1861 and 1905. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and Kent. Peerages In 1871, Cowper managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the Scottish lordship of Dingwall and the English barony of Butler, which had been under attainder since 1715, and he became the 4th Lord Dingwall and the 3rd Baron Butler as well. In 1880, he succeeded his mother as 8th Baron Lucas. Relative wealth He came to own more than £1M of assets which Sir Leo Chiozza Money, an analyst of the rich of the era, estimated was true of only eight British people who died \\"in an average year\\".

The name is derived from an indigenous language called Tupi, and means \\"healthy water river\\". Its name has changed over time, from the primitive Tupi word Tybaia, to Thibaia, Atubaia, Thibaya, and finally the city's modern name, Atibaia. Its strawberry crops are well known. These crops are cultivated mainly by Japanese descendants, since the city was a common Japanese immigrant center. History In 1665, Jerônimo de Camargo and his expedition found a hill near a river named Tubaia (later called Atibaia River). Jerônimo de Camargo was a Bandeirante explorer.Atibaia, Brazil Their main objective was to search the interior lands of Brazil for rich mineral resources, such as gold, silver and emeralds in present-day state of Minas Gerais. Camargo had his men build a chapel by the Tubaia river, which served as shelter to \\"tropeiros\\"—interior explorers on horse back—as well. The area was already occupied by Mateus Nunes da Siqueira, a priest who established contact with the Guarulhos tribe. In June 1665, a farm was established and Father Mateus built a village with the help of enslaved natives. The village was called Atibaia. Atibaia was a very important settlement at that time, because it was part of the route to Minas Gerais. São Paulo, probably the second most important city in Brazil at that time, was south of Atibaia, and the mining region north of it, locating Atibaia midway between those two important points. As time passed, Atibaia became very important. Even the king of Portugal, D. João VI, visited the small town. Many famous artists lived in or visited Atibaia, such as Benedito Calixto, a famous church fresco painter. The city boasts two of his paintings. Alberto Santos-Dumont, the father of aviation, also visited Atibaia. In April 1864, Atibaia was officially promoted to the status of city, due to the increased size of its population. An important thoroughfare that divides the city is now called Avenida Jerônimo de Camargo. The correct denomination for the native people is \\"atibaiano\\", \\"atibaiense\\" is the nomination for those who live there but weren't non born in the city.

Atibaia, general view from Pedra Grande The city is located on a strategic highway crossing: the junction of Rodovia D. Pedro I and Rodovia Fernão Dias, having direct access to important cities, such as São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Campinas and Jacareí. Atibaia has 478 square kilometers of area, 40% of this area is urbanized. The average altitude is 800 meters. Demographics According to the census of 2007, executed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Atibaia has approximately 119,166 inhabitants. However, 30,000 of these are people who own land or summer homes in the city, but do not reside there. Atibaia have a Gini index average = 0,43 according to 2007 IBGE data. There is not a great industrial activity in Atibaia, and so there is a huge labour offer. According to the IBGE census, 65% of the population (95,342 inhabitants) is part of the economical active age group.

While some actions like price-fixing are considered illegal per se', other actions, such as possession of a monopoly, must be analyzed under the rule of reason and are only considered illegal when their effect is to unreasonably restrain trade. William Howard Taft, then Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, first developed the doctrine in a ruling on Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States, which was affirmed in 1899 by the Supreme Court. The doctrine also played a major role in the 1911 Supreme Court case Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States.  History  Upon its development some critics of Standard Oil, including the lone dissenter Justice John Marshall Harlan, argued that Standard Oil and its rule of reason were a departure from previous Sherman Act case law, which purportedly had interpreted the language of the Sherman Act to hold that all contracts restraining trade were prohibited, regardless of whether the restraint actually produced ill effects. These critics emphasized in particular the Court's decision in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 166 U.S. 290 (1897), which contains some language suggesting that a mere restriction on the autonomy of traders would suffice to establish that an agreement restrained trade within the meaning of the Act. Others, including William Howard Taft and Robert Bork, argued that the decision and the principle it announced was entirely consistent with earlier case law. These scholars argue that much language in Trans-Missouri Freight was dicta, and also emphasized the Court's decision in United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U.S. 505 (1898), in which the Court announced that \\"ordinary contracts and combinations\\" did not offend the Sherman Act, because they restrained only trade \\"indirectly\\". Indeed, in his 1912 book on antitrust law, Taft reported that no critic of Standard Oil could succeed in Taft's challenge: to articulate one scenario in which the rule of reason would produce a result different from that produced under prior case law. In 1911, the Supreme Court announced United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106 (1911). That decision held that Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which bans monopolization, did not ban the mere possession of a monopoly but banned only the unreasonable acquisition or maintenance of monopoly. This reflects a long-standing view that one can have a monopoly just by having a superior product and that it violates no law to produce such a product. In 1918, seven years later, the Court unanimously reaffirmed the rule of reason in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States. In an opinion written by Justice Louis Brandeis, the Court held that an agreement between rivals limiting rivalry on price after an exchange was closed was reasonable and thus did not violate the Sherman Act. The Court rejected a strict interpretation of the Sherman Act's language: \\"The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.\\" The Court did so mostly because the agreement was regulatory rather than anticompetitive. The rule was narrowed in later cases that held that certain kinds of restraints, such as price fixing agreements, group boycotts, and geographical market divisions, were illegal per se. These decisions followed up on the suggestion in Standard Oil that courts can determine that certain restraints are unreasonable based simply upon the \\"nature and character\\" of the agreement. More recently, the Supreme Court has removed a number of restraints from the category deemed unlawful per se and instead subjected them to fact-based rule of reason analysis. These include non-price vertical restraints in 1977's Continental Television v. GTE Sylvania, maximum resale price maintenance agreements in 1997's State Oil v. Khan, and minimum resale price maintenance agreements in 2007's Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. Moreover, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the conclusion in Standard Oil that analysis under the rule of reason should focus on the economic but not the social consequences of a restraint (National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679 (1978)). Further, the Court retained the per se rule against tying contracts but raised the threshold showing of market power that plaintiffs must make to satisfy the rule's requirement of \\"economic power\\" (see Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1985). Several authorsThibault Schrepel, \\"A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets\\", Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 have worked on the creation of a \\"structured rule of reason\\" so to avoid the flaw in term of legal certainty surrounding a pure rule of reason.  In EU  A rule of reason does not exist in EU competition law (see e.g. T-11/08,https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication- detail/-/publication/6bb4ac70-7ffa-46ba-8ae6-29b8d5cb4518 T-112/99,https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61999TJ0112 T-49/02,https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1562642686000&uri;=CELEX:62002TJ0049 T-491/07,https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1562642822071&uri;=CELEX:62007TA0491(01) T-208/13,https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1562642886580&uri;=CELEX:62013TJ0208 etc.). It does, however, exist in the EU's substantive law, as developed in the European Court of Justice's Cassis de Dijon-ruling.

History and profile Rudé právo was founded in 1920 when the party was splitting from the social democrats and their older daily Právo lidu (People's Right). During the 1920s and 1930s it was often censored and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938 the party was abolished and during the German occupation and World War II that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union's Pravda, highly propagandistic and sometimes obedient to the government. Its Slovak equivalent in Slovakia was Pravda. Rudé právo had a circulation of over one million daily, making it the most widely distributed newspaper in Czechoslovakia. The communist government promoted its sales, for example, by sometimes forbidding other newspapers to be sold before 10am, or kiosk owners might be paid to not sell other papers at all, or the presses that printed rival newspapers could just be ordered not to print them. Following the Velvet Revolution, Rudé právo was privatised in 1989. In addition, some editors founded a new daily, Právo, unaffiliated with the party but taking advantage of the existing reader base. In popular culture * In the book Life is Elsewhere by Milan Kundera, Jaromil, the protagonist, makes a reference to reading Rudé právo. * In the 2006 movie Bobby, Svetlana Metkina plays a Czechoslovak reporter for Rudé právo who is granted an interview with Robert F.

A rangoli made with flowers on the occasion of Onam. Rangoli at Delhi, India. Rangoli at Chennai, India. Sankranti Muggu (Rangoli) with flowers. Rangoli with flowers at Chennai. Rangoli at Andhra Pradesh peacock rangoli Rangoli is an art form, originating in the Indian subcontinent, in which patterns are created on the floor or the ground using materials such as coloured rice, coloured sand, quartz powder or flower petals. It is usually made during Diwali or Tihar, Onam, Pongal and other Hindu festivals in the Indian subcontinent. Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the art form and the tradition alive. The purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings. Rangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually powdered quartz, dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which sindooram (vermilion), pasupu (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colours are a modern variation. Other materials include red brick powder and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis. Etymology From Sanskrit word \\"रङ्ग\\" which means colour. Rangoli is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘rangavalli’. The various names for this art form and similar practices include muggu (ముగ్గు) in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, rangoli/rangole (ರಂಗೋಲಿ/ರಂಗೋಲೆ) in Karnataka, kolam (கோலம்) in Tamil Nadu, mandana/mandas (माँडना) in Rajasthan, chowkpurana (छोवकपुराणा) in Chhattisgarh, alpana/alpona (আল্পনা) in West Bengal, muruja/marje (मूर्जा) or jhoti (झोटी) or chita (चिता) in Odisha, haripan/aripan (आरिपना) in Bihar, chowkpujan (चौकपूजन) in Uttar Pradesh, chowk poorana in Punjab, pookkalam (പൂക്കളം) in Kerala,Rangoli/ sanskarbharti/bharti in Maharashtra, saathiya/gahuli in Gujarat, and aipan/eipan (ऐपण) in Uttarakhand. Rangoli in different states In middle India mainly in Chhattisgarh Rangoli is called Chaook and is generally drawn at the entrance of a house or any other building. Powdered quartz, dried rice flour or other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the creativity of the person who draws it. It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled. During the festival of Onam in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and many parts of Maharashtra, the Rangoli or Kolam is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs are geometric and symmetrical मूल्यतः shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: powdered quartz, rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the Mandana are painted on walls. Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. Kumaon's \\"writing beat 'or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart – separated by different groups – different icons and art media is used. In Odisha, the Murja is put at the aangan of every home in front of the Tulsi plant called \\"Tulasi chahura\\". The Rangoli patterns mostly are dedicated to Lord Krishna and Lord Jagannath. The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima. The Rangoli's most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on as they are made – and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli is made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India. The second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are – Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from the leaves colour, charcoal, burned soil was, wood sawdust, etc.. The third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around. Dehri gateway is a tradition of making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain. Rangoli is also created using coloured powdered quartz, rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), Vermillion (Sindooram) and coloured sand. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India's rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns. Creation of Rangoli There are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like chalk, sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and geometric patterns are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a peacock, icon or landscape). \\"Readymade Rangoli\\" patterns, often as stencils or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs. Once the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or dry pigments. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like crayons, dyes or dyed fabrics, acrylic paints and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium. Shape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; Onam Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials. It is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the Kolam, prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised. Faith and beliefs A rangoli made in front of a house In India, there is a prevalent myth that Andaal worshipped Lord Thirumaal and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers. There are modern and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but they can also be in the form of abstract art.

Background and education Born at Seymour Place, Mayfair, on 21 January 1811, Abercorn was the son of James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton, himself the eldest son of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn. His mother, Harriet, was the second daughter of the Hon. John Douglas, himself the son of James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton. His father died when Abercorn was only three. In 1818, aged seven, he succeeded his grandfather in his titles and estates. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 2 July 1829. Political career James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn Shield of arms of John Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn, KG, PC Abercorn was first appointed a deputy lieutenant of County Tyrone, where he had a family seat at Baronscourt. On 13 November 1844, Lord Abercorn was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Donegal. The next month, on 12 December 1844, he was made a Knight of the Garter at the relatively young age of 33. Abercorn was appointed Groom of the Stole to Prince Albert on 8 February 1846, and shortly thereafter, on 25 February 1846, was made a Privy Counsellor. He served as Groom of the Stole until June 1859, and remained a prominent figure in the royal court for the next two decades. He received two honorary degrees during this period, becoming an LL.D. of Cambridge on 5 July 1847, a DCL of Oxford on 4 June 1856. From 11 April 1855 to 22 September 1860, he was honorary colonel of the Donegal Militia, and on 18 February 1860, was commissioned a captain in the newly raised London Scottish Rifle Volunteers. On 6 July 1866, he was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, under the third ministry of Lord Derby. He retained the post after Derby resigned in February 1868 and Benjamin Disraeli took the reins of the ministry. On 10 August 1868, he was created Marquess of Hamilton and Duke of Abercorn in the Peerage of Ireland. Around this time, he received his third honorary degree, an LL.D. from Trinity College, Dublin. After Gladstone and the Liberals won the 1868 general election, Abercorn resigned the Lord-Lieutenancy on 14 December. After the formation of the second Disraeli ministry, Abercorn was again appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 2 March 1874, and was also chosen Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, a post he held until his death. He resigned the Lord- Lieutenancy again on 6 December 1876, partly on account of his wife's ill health. Abercorn was Envoy-Extraordinary for the investiture of King Umberto I of Italy with the Order of the Garter on 2 March 1878. He was elected Chancellor of the University of Ireland in 1881, and died four years later at his home of Baronscourt, County Tyrone on 31 October 1885.

Her keel was laid down on 4 March 1943 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 14 November 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. M. Comstock), and commissioned on 29 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Herman J. Kossler, USN, (class of 1934) in command. Operational history Departing New London 11 April 1944, Cavalla arrived at Pearl Harbor 9 May, for voyage repairs and training. On 31 May 1944 the sub put to sea on active service for the first time. =First patrol= On her maiden patrol Cavalla, en route to her station in the eastern Philippines, made contact with a large Japanese task force on 17 June. Cavalla tracked the force for several hours, relaying information which contributed to the United States victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea (commonly known as the \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\") on 19–20 June 1944. On 19 June, she caught the carrier Shōkaku recovering planes, and quickly fired a spread of six torpedoes, with three hits. Shōkaku sank at . After a severe depth charging by three destroyers, Cavalla escaped to continue her patrol, having suffered relatively minor damage by depth charges from the . The feat earned her a Presidential Unit Citation. =Second patrol= Cavalla's second patrol took her to the Philippine Sea as a member of a wolfpack operating in support of the invasion of Peleliu 15 September 1944. =Third patrol= On 25 November 1944, during her third patrol, Cavalla encountered two Japanese destroyers and made a surface attack which destroyed the Shimotsuki at . The companion destroyer began depth charge attacks, while Cavalla evaded on the surface. Later in the same patrol, on 5 January 1945 Cavalla made a night surface attack on an enemy convoy and sank two converted net tenders (Kanko Maru, Shunsen Maru) at . =Fourth and fifth patrols= Cavalla cruised the South China and Java Seas on her fourth and fifth war patrols. Targets were few and far between, but she came to the aid of an ally on 21 May 1945. A month out on her fifth patrol, the submarine sighted , damaged by enemy depth charges and unable to submerge or make full speed. Cavalla stood by the damaged submarine and escorted her on the surface to Fremantle, arriving 27 May 1945. =Sixth patrol= Cavalla received the cease-fire order of 15 August while lifeguarding off Japan on her sixth war patrol. A few minutes later she was bombed by a Japanese plane that apparently had not yet received the same information or heard the Gyokuon-hōsō radio broadcast. She joined the fleet units entering Tokyo Bay 31 August, remained for the signing of the surrender on 2 September, then departed the next day for New London, arriving 6 October 1945. She was placed out of commission in reserve there 16 March 1946. =Postwar= Recommissioned 10 April 1951, Cavalla was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 and engaged in various fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off Nova Scotia. She was placed out of commission 3 September 1952 and entered Electric Boat Co. yard for conversion to a hunter-killer submarine (reclassified SSK-244, 18 February 1953). The SSK conversion included remodeling Cavallas bow with the addition of a curved housing for a BQR-4 sonar system. The conversion included removal of two bow torpedo tubes, along with remodeling the original conning tower and bridge into the sail visible today. Cavalla was recommissioned 15 July 1953 and assigned to Submarine Squadron 10. Her new sonar made Cavalla valuable for experimentation, and she was transferred to Submarine Development Group 2 on 1 January 1954, to evaluate new weapons and equipment, and to participate in fleet exercises. She also cruised to European waters several times to take part in NATO exercises, and visited Norfolk, Va., for the International Naval Review (11–12 June 1957). On 15 August 1959, her classification reverted to SS-244. In November, 1961, Cavalla was ordered to Puerto Rico and provided electrical power via umbilical connection to which had suffered a diesel generator failure while the nuclear reactor was shut down. Cavalla successfully assisted Thresher's restart of her reactor.The Cavalla-Thresher Incident Thresher was lost during post-overhaul sea trials on April 10, 1963 during a deep dive.

Such action may be in disregard for other parties, or as an expression of a commitment toward a direction which other parties may find disagreeable. As a word, unilateralism is attested from 1926, specifically relating to unilateral disarmament. The current, broader meaning emerges in 1964.\\"Unilateralism (n.).\\" Online Etymology Dictionary. It stands in contrast with multilateralism, the pursuit of foreign policy goals alongside allies. Unilateralism and multilateralism represent different policy approaches to international problems. When agreement by multiple parties is absolutely required—for example, in the context of international trade policies—bilateral agreements (involving two participants at a time) are usually preferred by proponents of unilateralism. Unilateralism may be preferred in those instances when it is assumed to be the most efficient, i.e., in issues that can be solved without cooperation. However, a government may also have a principal preference for unilateralism or multilateralism, and, for instance, strive to avoid policies that cannot be realized unilaterally or alternatively to champion multilateral solutions to problems that could well have been solved unilaterally. Typically, governments may argue that their ultimate or middle- term goals are served by a strengthening of multilateral schemes and institutions, as was many times the case during the period of the Concert of Europe.

This includes: * the total currency circulating in the public, * plus the currency that is physically held in the vaults of commercial banks, * plus the commercial banks' reservesSee, e.g., U.S. Federal Reserve System regulations at 12 C.F.R. section 204.5(a)(1) and 12 C.F.R. section 204.2. held in the central bank.See, e.g., U.S. Federal Reserve System regulation at 12 C.F.R. section 204.5(a)(1)(i). The monetary base should not be confused with the money supply, which consists of the total currency circulating in the public plus certain types of non-bank deposits with commercial banks. Management U.S. Monetary base Open market operations are monetary policy tools which directly expand or contract the monetary base. The monetary base is manipulated during the conduct of monetary policy by a finance ministry or the central bank. These institutions change the monetary base through open market operations: the buying and selling of government bonds. For example, if they buy government bonds from commercial banks, they pay for them by adding new amounts to the banks’ reserve deposits at the central bank, the latter being a component of the monetary base. Typically, a central bank can also influence banking activities by manipulating interest rates and setting reserve requirements (how much money banks must keep on hand instead of loaning out to borrowers). Interest rates, especially on federal funds (ultra- short-term loans between banks), are themselves influenced by open market operations. The monetary base has traditionally been considered high-powered because its increase will typically result in a much larger increase in the supply of demand deposits through banks' loan-making, a ratio called the money multiplier. However, for those that do not agree with the theory of the money multiplier, the monetary base can be thought of as high powered because of the fiscal multiplier instead. Monetary policy Monetary Policy is generally presumed to be the policy preserve of Reserve Banks, who target an interest rate. Control of the amount of Base Money in the economy is then lost, as failure by the Reserve Bank to meet the reserve requirements of the banking system will result in banks who are short of reserves bidding up the interest rate. Interest rates are manipulated by the Reserve bank to maintain an inflation rate which is considered neither too high or too low. This is usually determined using a Taylor Rule. The quantity of reserves in the banking system is supported by the open market operations performed by the Reserve Banks, involving the purchase and sale of various financial instruments, commonly Government debt (bonds), usually using \\"repos\\". Banks only require enough reserves to facilitate interbank settlement processes. In some countries, Reserve Banks now pay interest on reserves. This adds another lever to the interest rate control mechanisms available to the Reserve Bank. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Quantitative Easing raised the amount of reserves in the banking system, as the Reserve Banks purchased bad debt from the banks, paying for it with Reserves. This has left the banking system with an oversupply of reserves. This increase in reserves has had no effect on the level of interest rates. Note that reserves are never lent out by banks. United States As of April 2019, the monetary base in the United States was about US$3.3 trillion, up from about $0.8 trillion in March 2008. This increase was a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Sexes are similar, but immatures are duller than adults, scaly below, and lack the wing spots. Black-billed wood doves eat grass and other small seeds. They are quite terrestrial, and usually forage on the ground. They are not very gregarious, but form large flocks at waterholes.

Hodges (in Kristensen, 1999) retained the Blastodacnidae in the Agonoxenidae, giving a grouping of some 31 genera, and treating the whole as a subfamily Agonoxeninae of the grass-miner moths (Elachistidae).

Modern monetary systems usually consist of the national treasury, the mint, the central banks and commercial banks. Commodity money system A commodity money system is a monetary system in which a commodity such as gold or seashells is made the unit of value and physically used as money. The money retains its value because of its physical properties. In some cases, a government may stamp a metal coin with a face, value or mark that indicates its weight or asserts its purity, but the value remains the same even if the coin is melted down. Commodity-backed money One step away from commodity money is \\"commodity-backed money\\", also known as \\"representative money\\". Many currencies have consisted of bank-issued notes which have no inherent physical value, but which may be exchanged for a precious metal, such as gold. (This is known as the gold standard.) The silver standard was widespread after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and lasted until 1935, when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong. Another alternative which was tried in the twentieth Century was bimetallism, also called the \\"double standard\\", under which both gold and silver were legal tender.Velde, Francois R., \\"Following the Yellow Brick Road: How the United States Adopted the Gold Standard\\". Economic Perspectives, 4th Quarter, 2002. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=377760 or Fiat money The alternative to a commodity money system is fiat money which is defined by a central bank and government law as legal tender even if it has no intrinsic value. Originally fiat money was paper currency or base metal coinage, but in modern economies it mainly exists as data such as bank balances and records of credit or debit card purchases, and the fraction that exists as notes and coins is relatively small. Money is mostly created, contrary to what is written in most textbooks, by banks when they loan to customers. Put simply, banks lending currency to customers creates more deposits and deficit spending. In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money ‘multiplied up’ into more loans and deposits. Although commercial banks create money through lending, they cannot do so freely without limit. Banks are limited in how much they can lend if they are to remain profitable in a competitive banking system. Prudential regulation also acts as a constraint on banks’ activities in order to maintain the resilience of the financial system. And the households and companies who receive the money created by new lending may take actions that affect the stock of money – they could quickly ‘destroy’ the money or currency by using it to repay their existing debt, for instance. Central banks control the creation of money by commercial banks, by setting interest rates on reserves. This limits the amount of money the commercial banks are willing to lend, and thus create, as it affects the profitability of lending in a competitive market. This is the opposite of what many people believe about the creation of fiat money. The most common misconception was that central banks print all the money, this is not reflective of what actually happens. Today's global monetary system is essentially a fiat system because people can use paper bills or bank balances to buy goods.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008 as it is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in the world due to the extent of its collections and facilities. Background Children at the Montreal Botanical Garden in 1941 The botanical garden is located at 4101 Sherbrooke Street East, at the corner of Pie-IX and Sherbrooke Streets, in Maisonneuve Park, located in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, facing Montreal's Olympic Stadium. It contains a greenhouse complex full of plants from around the world, and a number of large outdoor gardens, each with a specific theme. The outdoor gardens are bare and covered with snow from about November until about April, but the greenhouses are open to visitors year round, hosting the annual Butterflies Go Free exhibit from February to April. The garden was founded in 1931, in the height of the Great Depression, by mayor Camillien Houde, after years of campaigning by Brother Marie-Victorin. The grounds were designed by Henry Teuscher, while the Art Deco style administration building was designed by architect Lucien F. Kéroack. It serves to educate the public in general and students of horticulture in particular, as well as to conserve endangered plant species. The grounds are also home to a botanical research institution, to the Société d'astronomie de Montréal, and to the Montreal Insectarium; offsite, the Garden staff also administer the Ferme Angrignon educational farm and petting zoo. Le banc des amoureux by Léa Vivot While it charges admission, city residents can obtain a pass granting free admission to the outdoor gardens, so many people visit regularly, even if only to sit under the trees. The nearest metro station is Pie-IX, which is located on the corner of the Olympic Stadium. The Montreal Botanical Garden is one of four nature-focused attractions belonging to the City of Montreal in the Space for Life () museum district.

Kulick's brother was session guitarist/producer Bob Kulick, whose performance credits include W.A.S.P., Meat Loaf's touring band, and Kiss. Career =Early projects= In a 2004 feature interview with Paul Stanley, Kulick discussed his very first recorded project from 1974, a band called KKB. It featured performances by his childhood friends Mike Katz and Guy Bois (the other K and B of KKB, respectively) and he likened its sound to that of Cream. Kulick found the master tape from those sessions in 2008 and issued it via limited edition CD, available during his appearances at Kiss expos and via his website. In a follow-up interview with Paul Stanley, Kulick also discussed his lifelong love of Star Wars and its historical similarities to Kiss. In the late 1970s, following the release of Meat Loaf's first album Bat Out of Hell, Kulick played rhythm guitar/lead guitar on tour with Meat Loaf's band alongside his brother Bob on lead guitar/rhythm guitar. =Blackjack= Kulick was a member of the band Blackjack, with Michael Bolton, during the band's short existence from 1979 to 1980. He also played on several Bolton solo albums. (Bolton later co-wrote the Kiss song \\"Forever\\", from Hot in the Shade). \\"Stay\\", a Blackjack song co-written by Kulick and Bolton, was sampled by rapper Jay-Z for the song \\"A Dream\\" off his 2002 album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse which reached #1 on the Billboard charts. =The Good Rats= Kulick joined the Long Island-based band the Good Rats in 1981. =Kiss (1984–1996)= Kulick joined the rock band Kiss in September 1984 as the lead guitarist, replacing Mark St. John, who left the band after being diagnosed with reactive arthritis. Kulick never wore onstage makeup, since the band had stopped wearing it in 1983. Kulick and St. John are the only two members of Kiss never to have worn makeup in the band. He stayed with Kiss until 1996. Kulick played on five Kiss studio albums: Asylum (1985), Crazy Nights (1987), Hot in the Shade (1989), Revenge (1992) and Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions (1997); he also appeared on Alive III and KISS Unplugged. The song \\"I Walk Alone\\", from Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions, is the only Kiss track to feature Kulick as lead vocalist. To this day, Kulick is featured on more than twenty Kiss releases. When the original members of the band regrouped, starting in 1995 with the MTV Unplugged special that carried over into re-adopting their make-up and costuming for the Alive/Worldwide Tour in 1996, Kulick and Eric Singer were paid weekly during the tour; while \\"sidelined\\" from Kiss, both were allowed to do other projects so long as Simmons and Stanley okayed them.Sherman, Black Diamond, p. 244. Kulick officially left Kiss in December 1996.Sherman, Black Diamond, p. 248. Kulick was with the band longer than any member aside from the original foursome and drummer Eric Singer (Singer has done three discontinuous stints with the band). When Ace Frehley again left Kiss (in 2002, after the Kiss Farewell Tour), Kulick was not asked to rejoin, as Simmons and Stanley thought that Tommy Thayer (former Black 'n Blue guitarist and Kiss tour manager) could capture/copy Frehley's persona better than Kulick; however, Kulick continued to work with Kiss after his departure, contributing work to the Psycho Circus album. =Union= Soon after leaving Kiss, Kulick formed the band Union with John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting in 1996. Corabi and Kulick wrote what would become the first album, the self-titled Union, which was released in 1998. They proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the album. Their second album 1999's Live in the Galaxy, was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third Union album was The Blue Room (2000). =Grand Funk Railroad= Kulick is the lead guitarist for Grand Funk Railroad, with whom he has been playing since 2000. =Solo work= thumb Kulick has released three solo albums: Audiodog in 2001, Transformer in 2003, and most recently BK3, which was released on February 2, 2010. =Other work= Kulick contributed to the 1998 album Pissed to the Gills, released by the Canadian rock band Syre.\\"SYRE Pissed To The Gills\\" . RoxxZone, by Stefano Gottardi, 07/09/2017 Kulick earned a writing credit on the song \\"Never Let Me Down\\" on the 2004 Kanye West album, The College Dropout. Kulick has also appeared on all album releases by Eric Singer's solo project ESP (Eric Singer Project): Lost and Spaced (1998), ESP (1999), and Eric Singer Project: Live in Tokyo (2006). Kulick also appeared on the DVD Eric Singer Project: Live at the Marquee (2006), which was filmed live in Australia.

It was written between 1809 and 1811 in Vienna, and was dedicated to Archduke Rudolf, Beethoven's patron and pupil. The first performance took place on 13 January 1811 at the Palace of Prince Joseph Lobkowitz in Vienna, with Archduke Rudolf as the soloist, followed by a public concert on 28 November 1811 at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig under conductor Johann Philipp Christian Schulz, the soloist being Friedrich Schneider.Michael Steinberg: The Concerto: A Listener's Guide. Retrieved 4 August 2014San Francisco Symphony. Retrieved 4 August 2014 On 12 February 1812, Carl Czerny, another student of Beethoven's, gave the Vienna debut of this work. The epithet of Emperor for this concerto was not Beethoven's own but was coined by Johann Baptist Cramer, the English publisher of the concerto. Its duration is approximately forty minutes. Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo piano, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B (clarinet I playing in A in movement 2), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani in E and B, and strings. In the second movement, 2nd flute, 2nd clarinet, trumpets, and timpani are tacet. Movements The concerto is divided into three movements: =I. Allegro= : \\\\relative c' { \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'stencil = ##f \\\\key es \\\\major es2~\\\\f es8 \\\\times 2/3 { f16( es d) } es8-. f-.  g4( es c) bes8. bes16  es2~\\\\sf es8 \\\\times 2/3 { f16( es d) } es8-. f-.  g4( es c) bes8. bes16  d2\\\\sf es8 r f r  g2\\\\sf as4.\\\\sf f8  es4\\\\p } The first movement begins with the solo piano unfurling a series of virtuosic pronouncements punctuated by emphatic loud chords from the full orchestra. The vigorous, incessantly propulsive main theme follows, undergoing complex thematic transformation, with a secondary theme of tonic and dominant notes and chords. When the piano enters with the first theme, the expository material is repeated with variations, virtuoso figurations, and modified harmonies. The second theme enters in the unusual key of B minor before moving to B major and at last to the expected key of B major several bars later. Following the opening flourish, the movement follows Beethoven's three-theme sonata structure for a concerto. The orchestral exposition is a two-theme sonata exposition, but the second exposition with the piano introduces a triumphant, virtuosic third theme that belongs solely to the solo instrument, a trademark of Beethoven's concertos. The coda elaborates upon the open-ended first theme, building in intensity before finishing in a final climactic arrival at the tonic E major. =II. Adagio un poco mosso= : \\\\relative c' { \\\\key b \\\\major dis2(\\\\p cis4 dis  b4 e cis2)  fis4 fis( gis ais  b4 dis, cis2)  } The second movement in B major forms a quiet nocturne for the solo piano, muted strings, and wind instruments that converse with the solo piano. The third movement begins without interruption when a lone bassoon note B drops a semitone to B, the dominant of the tonic key E. The end of the second movement was written to build directly into the third. =III. Rondo: Allegro = : \\\\relative c { \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\partial 8 bes8  bes8\\\\ff( es) es([ g)] r g16( bes)  bes16( es) es4~ es es16( g)  f8 r d16( f) es8 r g,16( bes)  bes4\\\\trill~ bes16 a bes4 } The final movement of the concerto is a seven-part rondo form (ABACABA). The solo piano introduces the main theme before the full orchestra affirms the soloist's statement. The rondo's B-section begins with piano scales, before the orchestra again responds. The C-section is much longer, presenting the theme from the A-section in three different keys before the piano performs a passage of arpeggios. Rather than finishing with a strong entrance from the orchestra, however, the trill ending the cadenza dies away until the introductory theme reappears, played first by the piano and then the orchestra. In the last section, the theme undergoes variation before the concerto ends with a short cadenza and robust orchestral response.

The film tells the story of a young New York City business student, Brian Flanagan, who takes up bartending in order to make ends meet. The film stars Tom Cruise, Bryan Brown, and Elisabeth Shue. Released on 29 July 1988, by Buena Vista Pictures, Cocktail features an original music score composed by J. Peter Robinson. Despite earning overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, and winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, the film was a huge box office success, grossing more than $170 million worldwide against a budget of $20 million. Plot Brian Flanagan, having just finished his stint in the Army, heads back to New York City and meets his Uncle Pat at his bar. He talks about making a million dollars. Brian goes to many interviews but is laughed out of all the corporate jobs because he lacks a degree. Brian gets a part-time job as a bartender at night while studying for a business degree by day. Over time, he learns the tricks of the trade, including flairing, from his mentor, Doug Coughlin. His advice usually begins with \\"Coughlin's Law.\\" Brian quits college, maintaining his personal aspirations, but Doug is wary of the two starting their own bar together. Doug intends to call his bar \\"Cocktails & Dreams.\\" Eventually, Brian and Doug's bartending act becomes popular and they end up working at a trendy nightclub. As their popularity rises, Brian becomes the focus of attention from a brunette named Coral. Coral is a wealthy photographer. Doug is alarmed that Coral is coming between their partnership and bets Brian that Coral will leave by week's end. Unbeknownst to Brian, Doug tricks Coral into sleeping with him. He secures his bet by sharing a kiss with Coral in front of Brian. Coral breaks up with Brian. Brian and Doug get into a fight, ending their partnership. Three years later, Brian has taken a job in Jamaica as a bartender at a resort to raise money for his own place. He finds a romantic partner in Jordan Mooney, an aspiring artist and waitress that he meets on the beach. Doug shows up in Jamaica, now married to Kerry, a wealthy woman who openly flirts with other men. Doug bets Brian that he couldn't \\"pick up\\" a new customer named Bonnie, a wealthy older woman. Brian accepts the challenge and wins Bonnie over. As they go back to Bonnie's room, Jordan sees them. Devastated, she takes a plane back to New York City. The next morning, Brian regrets sleeping with Bonnie. He goes to find Jordan but learns that she's gone. Doug teases Brian about the situation but Brian decides to upstage Doug by returning to New York with Bonnie. He reluctantly assumes the role of kept- boy and grows annoyed by her lifestyle. They have a blow-up during an art exhibit when Brian gets into a fight with the artist. Brian and Bonnie break up. Brian shows up at the diner where Jordan works. She rejects his flirting but agrees to listen to his apology after work. They talk but Brian keeps saying the wrong things. Then, to his surprise, she tells him she is pregnant with his child, and tells him to leave. He decides to prove to her that, despite being a bartender, he would make a worthy father. Brian learns that her family is wealthy, and goes to her parents' Park Avenue penthouse to speak with her. Jordan's father attempts to buy Brian off, but he refuses the money. Jordan refuses his advances, not wanting to be hurt again. Brian meets up with Doug, who confides that his wife's money is nearly gone, lost in the commodities market. Doug is unwilling to admit to his bride the precarious position they are in. Later, Kerry makes Brian take her home when Doug is too drunk to do so. Once inside her apartment, she attempts to seduce him. Brian stops it from going any further out of respect for his friendship with Doug. Kerry is angry at being rejected and calls Brian a coward. Brian goes to check on Doug and discovers he has slashed his throat and wrists with a broken bottle. After the funeral, Kerry sends Brian a letter, which is revealed to be Doug's suicide note. Brian realizes that Doug killed himself because his life was a sham. Reeling from losing his friend to suicide, he returns to Jordan's parents' home and begs her again for forgiveness. He tells her that Doug killed himself because he was too proud to ask for help and that Brian doesn't want to make the same mistake. He promises to take care of her and their child. Brian and Jordan leave together, with her father pledging not to give a dime to the couple. Brian and Jordan get married and have their wedding reception at his Uncle Pat's bar in Queens. Uncle Pat lends Brian the money to open a neighborhood bar called \\"Flanagan's Cocktails & Dreams.\\" Brian finally achieved his dream of running his own bar. At the Grand Opening, Jordan reveals that she is pregnant with twins. Brian offers free drinks to celebrate, much to his Uncle Pat's chagrin. Cast Production =Script= The film was based on Heywood Gould's semi-autobiographical novel published in 1984. Gould had worked as a bartender in New York from 1969 to 1981 to support his writing career. Gould said he \\"met a lot of interesting people behind the bar and very rarely was it someone who started out wanting to be a bartender. They all had ambitions, some smoldering and some completely forgotten or suppressed.\\" Gould says the lead character \\"is a composite of a lot of people I met, including myself in those days. I was in my late 30s, and I was drinking pretty good, and I was starting to feel like I was missing the boat. The character in the book is an older guy who has been around and starting to feel that he's pretty washed-up.\\" Universal bought the film rights and Gould wrote the script, changing it from his novel. He says the studio put the project in turnaround \\"because I wasn't making the character likable enough.\\" Disney picked up the project \\"and I went through the same process with them. I would fight them at every turn, and there was a huge battle over making the lead younger, which I eventually did.\\" Gould later admitted that the people who wanted him to make changes \\"were correct. They wanted movie characters. Characters who were upbeat and who were going to have a happy ending and a possible future in their lives. That's what you want for a big commercial Hollywood movie. So I tried to walk that thin line between giving them what they wanted and not completely betraying the whole arena of saloons in general.\\" Tom Cruise expressed interest in playing the role, which helped get it financed. \\"There were a lot of bartenders around like Tom Cruise, younger guys who came on and were doing this for a while—and then 10 years later, still doing it,\\" said Gould. \\"It wasn't as if I was betraying the character. It was a matter of making the character more idealistic, more hopeful—he's got his life ahead of him. He turns on the charm, without the cynical bitter edge of the older guys.\\" Bryan Brown later said the original script \\"was one of the very best screenplays I had ever read. Very dark... about the cult of celebrity and everything about it.... Tom Cruise is a very sweet man, he was then and still is. But when Tom came in, the movie had to change. The studio made the changes to protect the star and it became a much slighter movie because of it.\\" =Casting= Bryan Brown was cast on the strength of his performance in F/X. =Production= Gould says the tricks involving throwing bottles was not in the book, but something he showed Cruise and Bryan Brown. They used it and it became a prominent feature of the film. =Post production= A music score was originally done by Maurice Jarre. A new score was added at the last minute. Kelly Lynch later said the film \\"was actually a really complicated story about the ’80s and power and money, and it was really re-edited where they completely lost my character's backstory—her low self-esteem, who her father was, why she was this person that she was—but it was obviously a really successful movie, if not as good as it could’ve been.\\" She claimed Disney reshot \\"about a third of the film... and turned it into flipping the bottles and this and that.... But we had a really great time. And Tom was so much fun, just a ball to work with, both on and off camera.\\" Reception =Box office= Cocktail earned $78.2 million at the North American box office, and $93.3 million globally to a total of $171.5 million worldwide, almost nine times its $20 million budget, and ranking as the eighth highest grossing film of 1988 worldwide. =Critical response= Despite its box office success, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 7% of 44 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 3.94/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"There are no surprises in Cocktail, a shallow, dramatically inert romance that squanders Tom Cruise's talents in what amounts to a naive barkeep's banal fantasy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 12 out of 100 score based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave a negative review, calling it \\"an upscale, utterly brainless variation on those efficient old B-movies of the 1930s and 40s about the lives, loves and skills of coal miners, sand hogs, and telephone linemen, among others.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was also critical, explaining that \\"the more you think about what really happens in Cocktail, the more you realize how empty and fabricated it really is.\\" \\"I was not happy with the final product,\\" said Gould. \\"It got so savaged by the critics ... I was accused of betraying my own work, which is stupid. So I was pretty devastated. I literally couldn't get out of bed for a day. The good thing about that experience is that it toughened me up.\\" In 1992, Cruise said the film \\"was not a crowning jewel\\" in his career. However, the official soundtrack single, The Beach Boys' \\"Kokomo\\", was commercially successful and topped the charts in America, Australia and Japan. The song was nominated for a Grammy and a Golden Globe. =Accolades= Cocktail \\"won\\" two Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay while Cruise was nominated as Worst Actor and Donaldson as Worst Director. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of \\"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\\". The film was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost(?) to Caddyshack II.https://web.archive.org/web/20070816011837/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1988/1988st.htm Additionally, Cruise's other film in 1988 was his co-starring role in the Best Picture-winning film Rain Man, alongside Dustin Hoffman. In doing so, he became the first (and as of 2020, only) actor to star in a Worst Picture Razzie winner & Best Picture Oscar winner in the same year. The film has gone on to attain cult film status.

Der Schwanendreher occupies a place at the core of the viola concerto repertoire, along with the concertos by Walton and Bartók. It was composed in 1935 and premiered by the composer himself at a performance in Amsterdam on 14 November 1935. Each movement is based on a separate medieval German folk song, thus, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Concerto from Old Folk Songs\\". This composition draws its title from the final movement's folk song base, \\"Aren't you the swan turner?\\". The orchestra calls for 2 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 3 horns, trumpet, trombone, timpani, harp, and a string section of 4 cellos and 3 double basses. This orchestration is interesting due to its lack of violins and violas which benefits the composition by making it easier for the solo viola to be heard. The movements are: #\\"Zwischen Berg und tiefem Tal\\": Langsam – Mäßig bewegt, mit Kraft (\\"Between mountain and deep valley\\": Slow – Moderately moving, with strength) #\\"Nun laube, Lindlein laube\\": Sehr ruhig – Fugato: \\"Der Gutzgauch auf dem Zaune sass\\" (\\"Now grow leaves, little linden tree, grow leaves\\": very calm – Fugato: \\"The Cuckoo Sat on the Fence\\") #Variationen: \\"Seid ihr nicht der Schwanendreher\\": Mäßig schnell (Variations: \\"Aren't you the swan turner?\\": Moderately fast) Meaning of title The Concerto's title, translated as \\"The Swan turner\\", comes from the name of the last and fourth German folk song used (namely in the third movement), entitled \\"Seid ihr nicht der Schwanendreher\\" (\\"Aren't you the swan turner?\\"). The original context of \\"swan turner\\" in medieval times is that of a cook's assistant who would turn the handle of a spit on which swans were roasting. However, in the context of the concerto itself (and evidenced in the text of the folk song), the meaning programmatically seems to refer to a wandering medieval minstrel, or organ grinder, who plays on an instrument such as the hurdy-gurdy (and providing embellishments and rhapsodies on the folk tunes), which has a handle shaped as a swan's neck, thus the \\"swan turner\\" being the travelling musician himself, described by the composer in the preface notes to the work.http://www.schott- music.com/shop/Sheet_Music/String_Instruments/show,32853,b.htmlhttp://gradworks.umi.com/3422035.pdf Planned British premiere The British premiere was scheduled for 22 January 1936, with the composer as soloist in London. However, just before midnight on 20 January, King George V died. The following day, from 11 am to 5 pm, Hindemith wrote Trauermusik in homage to the late king. It was scored for viola and string orchestra, and was performed that evening, in a live broadcast from a BBC studio, with Adrian Boult conducting and the composer as soloist. The scheduled premiere of Der Schwanendreher was cancelled. Trauermusik contains quotations from Symphony: Mathis der Maler and Der Schwanendreher.Michael Steinberg, The Concerto References Hindemith Compositions by Paul Hindemith Compositions for viola and orchestra 1935 compositions ","title":"Der Schwanendreher"},{"id":"607759","text":"Hocus-pocus is a generic term that may be derived from an ancient language and is currently used to refer to the actions of magicians, often as the stereotypical magic words spoken when bringing about some sort of change. It was once a common term for a magician, juggler, or other similar entertainers.  History  The earliest known English-language work on magic, or what was then known as legerdemain (sleight of hand), was published anonymously in 1635 under the title Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain. Further research suggests that \\"Hocus Pocus\\" was the stage name of a well known magician of the era. This may be William Vincent, who is recorded as having been granted a license to perform magic in England in 1619. Whether he was the author of the book is unknown.  Conjectured origins  The origins of the term remain obscure. The most popular conjecture is that it is a garbled Latin religious phrase or some form of ‘dog’ Latin. Some have associated it with similar-sounding fictional, mythical, or legendary names. Others dismiss it as merely a combination of nonsense words. In some Slavic languages, \\"pokus\\" means an \\"attempt\\" or an \\"experiment\\", as for example in Czech or Slovak language. The word is derived from the Protoslavic word \\"kusiti\\", which is itself derived from Gothic \\"kausajn\\" meaning \\"to try\\", \\"to attempt\\". This may indicate that the wording belongs to the alchemy kitchen and court of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552 – 1612). Also, hocus may mean \\"to cheat\\" in Latin or a distorted form of the word hoc, \\"this\\". Combination of the two words may give a sense, especially both meanings together \\"this attempt/experiment\\" and \\"cheated attempt/experiment\\". = Dog Latin = According to the Oxford English Dictionary the term originates from hax pax max Deus adimax, a pseudo- Latin phrase used as a magical formula by conjurors.Compact Oxford English Dictionary. http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hocuspocus Some believe it originates from a corruption or parody of the Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, which contains the phrase “Hoc est enim corpus meum”, meaning This is my body.Online Etymology Dictionary http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hocus-pocus This explanation goes back to speculations by the Anglican prelate John Tillotson, who wrote in 1694: This claim is substantiated by the fact that in the Netherlands, the words Hocus pocus are usually accompanied by the additional words pilatus pas, and this is said to be based on a post-Reformation parody of the traditional Catholic rite of transubstantiation during Mass, being a Dutch corruption of the Latin words \\"Hoc est corpus meum\\" and the credo, which reads in part, \\"sub Pontio Pilato passus et sepultus est\\", meaning under Pontius Pilate he suffered and was buried.In de Kou, Godfried Bomans en Michel van der Plas over hun roomse jeugd en hoe het hun verging, Amsterdam, 1969 In a similar way the phrase is in Scandinavia usually accompanied by filiokus, a corruption of the term filioque, from the Latin version of the Nicene Creed, meaning “and from the Son”. The variant spelling filipokus is common in Russia, a predominantly Eastern Orthodox nation, as well as certain other post-Soviet states. Additionally, the word for \\"stage trick\\" in Russian, fokus, is derived from hocus pocus.Etymological dictionary of the Russian language = Magician's name = Others believe that it is an appeal to the folkloric Norse magician Ochus Bochus: According to Sharon Turner in The History of the Anglo-Saxons, they were believed to be derived from Ochus Bochus, a magician and demon of the north. = Nonsense word = As an alternative to other theories, it may simply be pseudo-Latin with no meaning, made up to impress people: See also *Abracadabra *Barbarous names *Open Sesame References External resources * Hocus Pocus or The Whole art of Legerdemain.

A \\"Southcottian\\" movement continued in various forms after her death. Early life Joanna Southcott was born in the hamlet of Taleford, baptised at Ottery St Mary, and raised in the village of Gittisham, all in Devon. Her father, William Southcott (died 1802), ran a small farm. She did dairy work as a girl, and after the death of her mother, Hannah, went into service, first as a shop-girl in Honiton, then for a considerable time as a domestic servant in Exeter. She was eventually dismissed because a footman, whose attentions she rejected, claimed that she was \\"growing mad\\".Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, vol. 53, p. 277. Self-revelation Originally in the Church of England, in about 1792 she joined the Wesleyans in Exeter,Women Writers IV. Novelists, Essayists and Poets – R–Z (London: Jarndyce Antiquarian Booksellers, Summer 2012). Becoming persuaded that she possessed supernatural gifts, she wrote and dictated prophecies in rhyme, and then announced herself as the Woman of the Apocalypse spoken of in a prophetic passage of the Revelation (12:1–6). Coming to London at the request of William Sharp, the engraver, Southcott began selling paper \\"seals of the Lord\\" at prices varying from twelve shillings to a guinea. The seals were supposed to ensure the holders' places among the 144,000 people who would be elected to eternal life. The new Messiah and death At the age of 64 Southcott affirmed that she was pregnant and would be delivered of the new Messiah, the Shiloh of Genesis (49:10). The date of 19 October 1814 was that fixed for the birth, but Shiloh failed to appear, and it was given out that she was in a trance. She had a disorder which gave her the appearance of being pregnant and this fuelled her followers, who reached a number of around 100,000 in 1814, mainly in the London area.Robert Chamber's Book of Days, vol. 2, p. 775. Southcott died not long after. The official date of death was given as 27 December 1814, but it is likely that she died the previous day, as her followers retained her body for some time in the belief that she would be raised from the dead. They agreed to her burial only after the corpse began to decay. She was buried at the Chapel of Ease at St John's Wood in January 1815.Robert Chamber's Book of Days, vol. 2, p. 775. Legacy The \\"Southcottian\\" movement did not end with her death in 1814. Her followers are said to have numbered over 100,000, but had declined greatly by the end of the 19th century. In 1844 a lady named Ann Essam left large sums of money for \\"printing, publishing and propagation of the sacred writings of Joanna Southcott\\". The will was disputed in 1861 by her niece. Her grounds for doing so included that the writings were blasphemous and the bequest was contrary to the Statutes of Mortmain: the Court of Chancery refused to find the writings blasphemous but voided the bequest as contrary to the Statute of Mortmain.Thornton v. Howe, 54 Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1862). In 1881 there was an enclave of her followers living in the Chatham area, east of London, who were distinguished by their long beards and good manners.Robert Chambers, Book of Days, vol 2, p. 776. Southcott left a sealed wooden box of prophecies, usually known as Joanna Southcott's Box, with the instruction that it be opened only at a time of national crisis, and then only in the presence of all the 24 bishops of the Church of England at that time, who were to spend a fixed period beforehand studying Southcott's prophecies. Attempts were made to persuade the episcopate to open it during the Crimean War and again during the First World War. In 1927, the psychic researcher Harry Price claimed that he had come into possession of the box and arranged to have it opened in the presence of one reluctant prelate, the suffragan Bishop of Grantham. It was found to contain only a few oddments and unimportant papers, among them a lottery ticket and a horse-pistol. Price's claims to have had the true box have been disputed by historians and by followers of Southcott. Southcottians, denying the authenticity of the box opened in 1927, continued to press for the true box to be opened. An advertising campaign on billboards and in British national newspapers such as the Sunday Express was run in the 1960s and 1970s by one prominent group of Southcottians, the Panacea Society in Bedford (formed 1920), to try to persuade the 24 bishops to have the box opened. The Society's slogan was: \\"War, disease, crime and banditry, distress of nations and perplexity will increase until the Bishops open Joanna Southcott's box.\\" According to the Society, this true box is in their possession at a secret location for safekeeping, with its whereabouts to be disclosed only when a bishops' meeting has been arranged. Southcott prophesied that the Day of Judgement would come in the year 2004, and her followers stated that if the contents of the box had not been studied beforehand, the world would have had to meet it unprepared. Charles Dickens refers to Mrs Southcott in his description of the year 1775 at the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities.

Life De Launay was born in Paris. Her father was a painter named Cordier. He seems to have deserted her mother, who then resumed her maiden name, de Launay, which was also adopted by her daughter. She was educated at a convent at Evreux, of which Mme de La Rochefoucauld, sister of François de La Rochefoucauld, author of the Maximes, was superior. There, she became attached to Mme de Grieu, who, being appointed abbess of the convent of St Louis at Rouen, took her friend with her. Mlle de Launay lived there until 1710 in the enjoyment of the utmost consideration, and held a little court of her own, which included Brunel, the friend of Fontenelle, the sieur de la Rey and the abbé Vertot. She describes her own first passion for the marquis de Silly, the brother of a friend with whom she was visiting. Her affection was not returned, but she entered on a correspondence with him in which she plays the part of director. After the death of her patron, Mme de Grieu, poverty compelled her to enter the household of the duchesse du Maine at the Château de Sceaux in the capacity of lady-in-waiting. Her literary talent soon manifested itself in the literary court of the duchesse, and secured for her, among other friendships, the somewhat undesirable admiration of the abbé Chaulieu. The duchesse is said, on the somewhat dubious authority of her lady-in-waiting, to have been not a little jealous of her attendant. Enough, however, is known of the duchesse's imperious and capricious temper to make it improbable that her service was agreeable. Mlle de Launay, however, enjoyed a large share of her mistress' confidence and had a considerable share in drawing up the Mémoire des princes légitimes which demanded the meeting of the states-general. She was implicated in the Cellamare Conspiracy of Giulio Alberoni against Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, regent for Louis XV of France, and was sent in 1718 to the Bastille, where she remained for two years. Even here, however, she made conquests, though she was far from beautiful. Her own account of her love for her fellow prisoner, the chevalier de Ménil, and of the passion of the chevalier de Maisonrouge, her gaoler, for her, is justly famous. She returned on her liberation to the service of the duchess, who showed no gratitude for the devotion, approaching the heroic, that Mlle Delaunay had shown in her cause. She received no promotion and still had to fulfill the wearisome duties of a waiting-maid. She refused, it is said, André Dacier, the widower of a wife more famous than himself, and, in 1735, being then more than fifty, married the Baron de Staal. Her dissatisfaction with her position had become so evident that the duchess, afraid of losing her services, arranged the marriage to give Mlle Delaunay rank sufficient to allow of her promotion to be on an equality with the ladies of the court. On this footing she remained a member of the household. It was at this time that she became the friend and correspondent of Mme du Deffand. She died at Gennevilliers. Works Her Mémoires appeared about five years later, and have often been reprinted, both separately and in collections of the memoirs of the 17th and 18th centuries, to both of which the author belonged both in style and character. She has much of the frankness and seductive verve of Mme de Sévigné and her contemporaries, but more than a little alloyed with the sensibility of a later time. It may be doubted whether she does not somewhat exaggerate the discomforts of her position and her sense of them. In her lack of illusions, she was a child of the 18th century. Sainte-Beuve says that the most fit time for the reading of the Mémoires is the late autumn, under the trees of November, but her book is an extremely amusing one to read, as well as not a little instructive. The humours of the court of Sceaux are depicted as hardly any other society of the kind has ever been. \\"Dans cet art enjoué de raconter\\", says Sainte-Beuve, \\"Madame de Staal est classique\\". Besides her Mémoires Mme de Staal left two excellent short comedies, performed at the court of Sceaux, and some letters, the answers to which are in some cases extant, and show, as well as the references of contemporaries, that the writer did not exaggerate her own charm. Her Mémoires were translated by Selina Bathurst (1877) and by Cora H. Bell (1892). See the edition (1877) of her Mémoires by M. de Lescure.

Constructed in the early modern style of architecture, the house's design emphasized three primary traits: honesty of materials, variable transparency of forms, and juxtaposition of \\"industrial\\" materials and fixtures with a more traditional style of home décor. The primary materials used were steel, glass, and glass block. Some of the notable \\"industrial\\" elements included rubberized floor tiles, bare steel beams, perforated metal sheet, heavy industrial light fixtures, and mechanical fixtures. The design was a collaboration among Pierre Chareau (a furniture and interiors designer), Bernard Bijvoet (a Dutch architect working in Paris since 1927) and Louis Dalbet (craftsman metalworker). Much of the intricate moving scenery of the house was designed on site as the project developed. The historian Henry-Russel Hitchcock as well as the designer Eileen Gray have declared that the architect was in fact 'that clever Dutch engineer (Bijvoet)'(Gray). The external form is defined by translucent glass block walls, with select areas of clear glazing for transparency. Internally, spatial division is variable by the use of sliding, folding or rotating screens in glass, sheet or perforated metal, or in combination. Other mechanical components included an overhead trolley from the kitchen to dining room, a retracting stair from the private sitting room to Mme Dalsace's bedroom and complex bathroom cupboards and fittings. The program of the home was somewhat unusual in that it included a ground-floor medical suite for Dr. Jean Dalsace. This variable circulation pattern was provided for by a rotating screen which hid the private stairs from patients during the day, but framed the stairs at night. The house is notable for its splendid architecture, but it may be more well known for another reason. It was built on the site of a much older building which the patron had purchased and intended to demolish. Much to his or her chagrin, however, the elderly tenant on the top floor of the building absolutely refused to sell, and so the patron was obliged to completely demolish the bottom three floors of the building and construct the Maison de Verre underneath, all without disturbing the original top floor. Dr. Dalsace was a member of the French Communist Party who played a significant role in both anti-fascist and cultural affairs. In the mid-1930s, the Maison de Verre's double-height \\"salle de séjour\\" was transformed into a salon regularly frequented by Marxist intellectuals like Walter Benjamin as well as by Surrealist poets and artists such as Louis Aragon, Paul Éluard, Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Jacques Lipchitz, Jean Cocteau, Yves Tanguy, Joan Miró and Max Jacob. According to the American art historian Maria Gough, the Maison de Verre had a powerful influence on Walter Benjamin, especially on his constructivist - rather than expressionist - reading of Paul Scheerbart's utopian project for a future \\"culture of glass\\", for a \\"new glass environment [which] will completely transform mankind,\\" as the latter expressed it in his 1914 treatise Glass Architecture. See in particular Benjamin's 1933 essay Erfahrung und Armut (\\"Experience and Poverty\\"). American architectural historian Robert Rubin bought the house from Dalsace family in 2006 to restore it and use it for his family residence. He allows a limited number of tours to the house.

The action is set in a universe with an alternate history in which the British developed the craft of space travel during the reign of Queen Victoria. The modern day world is populated by stereotypically stoic Englishmen, and vile scheming Frenchmen who will stoop to any depth in order to thwart the ambitions and harmony of the British Empire. The title character shares his name with the Buckinghamshire village of Stoke Mandeville and its well-known hospital. The play was originally written as six half-hour episodes for BBC Radio 4, and a pilot episode was recorded, but Radio 4 decided not to go ahead with commissioning a series from two unknown writers. Instead, the script was turned into a stage play, and was first performed in Newcastle in the Black Swan Court in 2001 with a cast of just five, including the two writers, who all had to play multiple parts. After this, the play was revised for performance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and with a slightly different cast ran for two weeks in 2002 at Augustine's. It has since been performed a few more times, notably at Cambridge University in 2003, Highgate in 2004, Guildford (Surrey) in 2007 (where it was voted best event of the year by the students of the University of Surrey), Adelaide Australia 2009, and several more productions have been proposed. The play's two chief influences are Douglas Adams's The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy and the role play game Space 1889, although another is Sir Henry at Rawlinson End by Vivian Stanshall. The website (link below) contains reviews, programme notes, and many examples of the play's robust and utterly politically incorrect humour. The minimum cast for the play is five, one woman and four men, although since there are many parts, a far larger cast could be used. The running time for the Edinburgh version is one hour and fifteen minutes, which is about ideal for the Festival Fringe. Posters and fliers for the productions displayed the following statement: \\"The management wishes to assure all patrons that under no circumstances shall persons of a French nature be admitted to the auditorium.\\" Critical reaction Reaction from critics has been generally good. However, the 2002 Edinburgh production gained a poor review from The Scotsman, which awarded 2 stars. The review was written by someone who had not attended the show. Only two days before, The Scotsman had published an article by Robert McNeil, who had seen the production, praising the show. Video Version The first episode of a video version of the story appeared on YouTube on 4 July 2012. The video version stars professional actor Jamie Osborn as Graham Pennyworth. Having a very low budget, the videos were shot in a disused art gallery, with all the actors against a green-screen.

B. Reese Candy Company, a division of the Hershey Company. Kit Kat was created by by Rowntree's of York, United Kingdom, which was acquired by Nestlé in 1988. The standard bars consist of two or four pieces composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate. The original four-finger version of the bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York factory put a suggestion in the recommendation box for 'a chocolate bar that a man could take to work in his pack up'. It was launched in September 1935 in the UK as Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp, and the later two-finger version was launched in 1936. It was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, and just Kit Kat after World War II. Since 1957, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \\"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\\".  History  Use of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18th century, when mutton pies known as a Kit Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Catling. The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products, the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued. The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \\"a man could take to work in his pack\\". The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2d), and was sold in London and throughout southern England. Exhibit of British foods in the 1940s during World War II. Pictured in wartime packaging, the Kit Kat adopted its familiar red packaging after the war. Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937. The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was coloured blue. After the war the name became Kit Kat, with the original milk chocolate recipe and red packaging. Following its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line \\"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\\". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the US through the Hershey company, and in Japan through Fujiya. In June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's, giving Nestlé global control over the brand, except in the US, and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan and additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and China. left The Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States which dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with Rowntree which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002. Variants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to be developed since then. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe. Throughout the decade, Kit Kat introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets. It celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009. The traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately by . A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever since. The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three- fingered variants in Arabia, and the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs. In Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestlé also produces a Kit Kat ice cream, and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat Drumsticks. In 2010, a new £5 million manufacturing line was opened by Nestlé in York, to produce more than a billion Kit Kat bars each year.  Global confection  Map of countries where Kit Kat is marketed. Dark Red: UK (country of origin). Red: Countries with KitKat products owned by Nestlé. Light Red: Countries with KitKat products manufactured by Hershey (US). Kit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestlé: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria and Algeria. Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree. The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of low carb diets, and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury's newly formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to Kit Kat sales decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position. The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions, usually only available for a few months at a time so as not lose sales of their standard products. The strategy initially reversed the decline of the Kit Kat and has been adopted worldwide by Nestlé, Hershey, Mars, and others with similar success. Kit Kat varieties on display in Osaka, Japan This has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then. While some flavours succeeded, many failed, alienating some consumers in the process, causing Nestlé to scale back on new releases. In September 2006, Nestlé announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in their York factory and moving all Smarties production to their Hamburg factory, which had already been producing two-thirds. They stated that this move would allow for a £20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and improve Kit Kat production. As dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health benefits, in September 2006 the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark was launched in the United Kingdom as a permanent product, and packaging for the entire brand was changed. Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years previously as a limited edition, and began doing so again. Nestlé now manufactures two-finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and for the first time, Kit Kats in this format are suitable for vegans. It is not known at this date whether or not other varieties will follow suit. In 2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the United Kingdom, after Dairy Milk and Galaxy.\\"Top 10 selling chocolate bars in the UK\\". Wales Online. Retrieved 28 December 2014.  Design  The US packaging When first introduced in the United Kingdom in 1935, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945–1947. The Kit Kat logo was added in 1937. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II – a period of rationing in the United Kingdom – dark chocolate was used instead of milk chocolate during that period. Since its introduction into the US in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising has differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \\"Kit Kat Chunky\\" is known as \\"Big Kat\\". In the United Kingdom, the product was traditionally wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001 this was changed to flow wrap plastic.Suzy Bashford \\"BRAND HEALTH CHECK: Kit kat\\", Marketing, 14 June 2001 Foil and paper wrapping is still used for Kit Kats sold as part of a multipack.  Marketing and promotion  = Advertising = Kit Kat logo on a tram in Lisbon, Portugal After launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \\"the biggest little meal\\" and \\"the best companion to a cup of tea\\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \\"what active people need. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969. Since 1957, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \\"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\\". However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the \\"Have a break\\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the European Court of Justice ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the British courts. In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan \\"Make the most of your break\\", but later returned to the original slogan. Routemaster bus converted into a mobile radio station by Capital London with four varieties of Kit Kat advertised. Located in Manchester, England The United States also used the short-lived slogan, \\"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \\"That's What You Want\\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat. The \\"classic\\" American version of the \\"Gimme a Break\\" Kit Kat jingle (in use in the US since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (copy) and Michael A. Levine (music) for the DDB Advertising Agency. Versions of the original have been covered by Carrie Underwood, Shawn Colvin, and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by University of Cincinnati researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \\"earworms\\" – bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \\"Factory\\" commercial in the US was an original recording by Andrew W.K. W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \\"Gimme a break\\" slogan. Variations on the Andrew W.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and a network newsroom. However, the \\"classic\\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004. Many adverts were worldwide hits among them in 1980's with Ken Campbell in an advert with Heaven and Hell with Devil and Angel on Television. In Australia, TV ads for Kit Kat featured the classic children’s show Thunderbirds, which played off the catchphrase “Thunderbirds Are Go” but instead sees one of the members enjoying a Kit Kat “Break.” A 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \\"takes a break\\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in Channel 4's \\"100 Greatest Adverts\\" poll in 2000. In late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English football club York City F.C.. As a result, the club's home-ground, Bootham Crescent, was renamed to KitKat Crescent. The Maltese tour boat MV Lady Davinia had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008. In a 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of Chunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their favourite. Selecting from white chocolate, double chocolate, peanut butter, and orange, Peanut butter was the winner by having 47% of votes. A similar campaign occurred in 2013 with mint, coconut, hazelnut and chocolate fudge. = Association with Android = A Kit Kat bar statue at Googleplex Headquarters, United States In September 2013, it was announced that version 4.4 of Google's Android mobile operating system would be named \\"KitKat\\". Google licensed the name from Nestlé, with no money changing hands. A promotion ran in numerous countries with specially branded Android Kit Kat bars to win Nexus 7 devices and Google Play Store credit. = Fairtrade = In December 2009, it was announced that the four-finger variety of Kit Kat would use Fairtrade chocolate (at least in Britain and Ireland) from January 2010. The Fairtrade Kit Kat promotion was extended to the finger edition in January 2010. = Golden ticket draw = In the first three weeks of Big Brother Series 7 in the UK, Channel 4 conducted a promotion in conjunction with Nestlé to distribute 100 \\"golden tickets\\" randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story. Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a Big Brother housemate and bypass the standard auditions process. Golden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them, Susie Verrico, was chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, picking a ball out of a machine at random. This contest caused some controversy, with the Advertising Standards Authority saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and during the draw.  Varieties  = Flavours = Kit Kat Matcha Many varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as Valentine's Day. In Japan, Nestlé has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000, including ginger ale, soy sauce, creme brulee, green tea, sake, and banana. The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers, and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase \\"Kitto Katsu\\", roughly translating as \\"surely win.\\" The Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint. All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies & Cream. A wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from traditional merchandise (such as mugs, pens, oven gloves and tea-towels) to less common items such as coats for small dogs. Recently in Japan, Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles, and a special limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book featuring six short stories, one of which was written by Koji Suzuki, author of the Ring cycle series. In Japan, Kit Kats are also available in jars that are dispensed from vending machines. Kit Kat introduced two new flavors to the United States in 2020: Lemon Crisp and Rasberry Creme. The new flavours are available in regular sized bars or miniature bars.“Kit Kat is releasing new lemon crisp and raspberry creme flavors for Valentine's Day”. Insider.com. Retrieved 5 February 2020 = Forms = Kit Kat varieties: Pop Choc, regular and Chunky (or Big Kat) The 'standard' Kit Kat finger bars can come in a variety of presentations and nutritional values. The bars can come in a miniature form of two finger mini bars, or a larger standard four, or in some cases, three, fingered bars. The standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a 'monster Size' bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered \\"Chunky Kit Kats\\" were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours. The market for Chunky Kit Kats has also expanded to Canada. Other forms and shapes include \\"Choc'n'Go\\" individually wrapped fingers in France, a twelve-finger \\"Family Block\\" available in New Zealand and Australia, round bite-sized \\"Pop Choc\\" pieces, square \\"Kubes\\", praline-filled \\"Senses\\", a yoghurt with Kit Kat pieces, and a Kit Kat ice cream cone. In the 1980s, a Kit Kat with five shorter fingers was sold in vending machines in the UK. The Japanese Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats Custard Pudding Flavour was launched in 2014. The bar must be baked in an oven before consumption, and the surface sugar caramelises in the process. Pink coloured Kit Kat Ruby In 2015, a new luxury and giftable variant of Kit Kat called Kit Kat Rubies was launched in Malaysia. Comes with the box of 20 small bars, the Kit Kat Rubies bar made with the premium chocolate truffle cream and imported roasted hazelnut pieces. As of 2017, U.S. variants include the standard and king-size four-finger bars, standard bars covered with white or dark chocolate, snack-size orange-covered bars for Halloween, bagged wrapped one-finger miniatures (original and assorted), unwrapped minis, a redesigned Big Kat, and a king-size Big Kat (two of the new Big Kat bars).  Chocolatory  Kit Kat has opened a Chocolatory in the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia. There's also one in Sydney. The shops allows customers to use touch screens to create their own Kit Kat from a selection of chocolates and ingredients; they are made while the customers wait, and customers can mix their own flavours with some Kit Kat that has been provided in store. There are similar locations in Japan and Toronto, Canada.  Criticism and controversy  In March 2010, Kit Kat was targeted for a boycott by Greenpeace for using palm oil, which the environmental organisation claimed resulted in destruction of forest habitats for orangutans in Indonesia. A YouTube video by Greenpeace went viral and Nestlé announced a partnership with The Forest Trust to establish \\"responsible sourcing guidelines\\" and ensure that its products did not have a deforestation footprint. They aimed to achieve a fully sustainable method of palm oil harvesting by 2015. Nestlé state that 58% of palm oil purchased in 2017 was responsibly sourced.  Ingredients  Original Kit Kat ingredients unless otherwise stated, listed by decreasing weight: milk chocolate (sugar, milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, and natural flavour. = Europe = Milk chocolate (66%) (sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, dried whole milk, cocoa mass, lactose and proteins from whey, whey powder, emulsifier (sunflower lecithin), butterfat, flavouring), wheat flour, sugar, vegetable fat, cocoa mass, yeast, raising agent (sodium bicarbonate), salt, emulsifier (soya lecithin), flavourings. In 2006, the UK four-finger Kit Kat contained 233 dietary calories (kcal) (975 kilojoules). In 2009, the two-finger Kit Kat contained 107 calories. In 2013, the UK Kit Kat Chunky contained 247 calories which reduced to 207 calories in 2015.

The milk chocolate used for Kit Kats is made from whole-milk powder and Nestlé buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. Nestlé has factories in various locations in China, to supply to China and Hong Kong. During the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, where melamine was found to have tainted some milk suppliers in China, importers in Hong Kong chose to import bars manufactured in the United Kingdom.

The Herald and the Times share resources on news stories related to Florida. History A Miami Herald headline dated August 7, 1945 featuring the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan =Early history= The first edition was published September 15, 1903, as The Miami Evening Record. After the recession of 1907, the newspaper had severe financial difficulties. Its largest creditor was Henry Flagler. Through a loan from Henry Flagler, Frank B. Shutts, who was also the founder of the law firm Shutts & Bowen, acquired the paper and renamed it the Miami Herald on December 1, 1910. Although it is the longest continuously published newspaper in Miami, the earliest newspaper in the region was The Tropical Sun, established in 1891. The Miami Metropolis, which later became The Miami News, was founded in 1896, and was the Heralds oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business. During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, the Miami Herald was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising. During The Great Depression in the 1930s, the Herald came close to receivership, but recovered. On October 25, 1939, John S. Knight, son of a noted Ohio newspaperman, bought the Herald from Frank B. Shutts. Knight became editor and publisher, and made his brother, James L. Knight, the business manager. The Herald had 383 employees. Lee Hills arrived as city editor in September 1942. He later became the Heralds publisher and eventually the chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., a position he held until 1981. =Post-war history= The Miami Herald International Edition, printed by partner newspapers throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, began in 1946. It is commonly available at resorts in the Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic, and, though printed by the largest local newspaper Listín Diario, it is not available outside such tourist areas. It was extended to Mexico in 2002. The Herald won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1950, for its reporting on Miami's organized crime. Its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on Sundays. On August 19, 1960, construction began on the Herald building on Biscayne Bay. Also on that day, Alvah H. Chapman, started work as James Knight's assistant. Chapman was later promoted to Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive officer. The Herald moved into its new building at One Herald Plaza without missing an edition on March 23–24, 1963. The paper won a landmark press freedom decision in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974). In the case, Pat Tornillo Jr., president of the United Teachers of Dade, had requested that the Herald print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him, citing Florida's \\"right-to-reply\\" law, which mandated that newspapers print such responses. Represented by longtime counsel Dan Paul, the Herald challenged the law, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court unanimously overturned the Florida statute under the Press Freedom Clause of the First Amendment, ruling that \\"Governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which 'reason' tells it should not be published is unconstitutional.\\" The decision showed the limitations of a 1969 decision, Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, in which a similar \\"Fairness Doctrine\\" had been upheld for radio and television, and establishing that broadcast and print media had different Constitutional protections. Publication of a Spanish-language supplemental insert named El Herald began in 1976. It was renamed El Nuevo Herald in 1987, and in 1998 became an independent publication. =Recent history and Arthur Teele suicide= In 2003, the Miami Herald and El Universal of Mexico City created an international joint venture, and in 2004 they together launched The Herald Mexico, a short-lived English-language newspaper for readers in Mexico. Its final issue was published in May 2007. On July 27, 2005, former Miami city commissioner Arthur Teele walked into the main lobby of the Heralds headquarters and phoned Herald columnist Jim DeFede (one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day) to say that he had a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his (Teele's) wife Stephanie that he loved her, before pulling out a gun and committing suicide. This happened the day the Miami New Times, a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used cocaine with a transsexual prostitute. The day before committing suicide, Teele had had another telephone conversation with DeFede, who recorded this call without Teele's knowledge, which was illegal under Florida law. DeFede admitted to the Heralds management that he had taped the call. Although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, DeFede was fired the next day for violating the paper's code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony. Many journalists and readers of the Herald disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend DeFede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former Herald staffers, called on the Herald to reinstate DeFede, but the paper's management refused to back down. The state attorney's office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was \\"without a (living) victim or a complainant\\". On September 8, 2006, the Miami Heralds president Jesús Díaz, Jr. fired three journalists because they had allegedly been paid by the United States government to work for anti-Cuba propaganda TV and radio channels. The three were Pablo Alfonso, Wilfredo Cancio Isla and Olga Connor. Less than a month later, responding to pressure from the Cuban community in Miami, Díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists. Nevertheless, he continues to claim that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of journalistic independence. At least seven other journalists who do not work at the Herald, namely Miguel Cossio, Carlos Alberto Montaner, Juan Manuel Cao, Ariel Remos, Omar Claro, Helen Aguirre Ferre, Paul Crespo, and Ninoska Perez- Castellón, were also paid for programs on Radio Martí or TV Martí, both financed by the government of the United States through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, receiving a total of between 15,000 and 175,000 since 2001. The Miami Heralds former headquarters on Biscayne Bay in the Arts & Entertainment District of Downtown Miami; the paper moved from its waterfront headquarters in 2013 to a location in suburban Doral. The Herald building was demolished in 2014. In May 2011, the paper announced it had sold of Biscayne Bayfront land surrounding its headquarters in the Arts & Entertainment District of Downtown Miami for $236million, to a Malaysian resort developer, Genting Malaysia Berhad. McClatchy announced that the Herald and El Nuevo Herald would be moving to another location by 2013. In May 2013, the paper moved to a new building in suburban Doral. The old building was demolished in 2014. In November 2018, the Herald broke the story that \\"in 2007, despite substantial evidence that corroborated (female teenager's) stories of (sexual) abuse by Epstein, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, signed off on a secret deal for the multimillionaire, one that ensured he would never spend a day in prison.\\" Thus, the full extent of Epstein's crimes and his collaborators remained hidden and the victims unaware of this arrangement. In July 2019, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors between 2002 and 2005; reporting at the time noted how the Herald brought public attention to accusations against Epstein. On December 17, 2019 it was announced the Miami Herald would move to a six days a week format. On January 21, 2020 it was announced that the Miami Herald would close its Doral printing plant and move its printing and packaging operations to the South Florida Sun Sentinel's printing facilities in Deerfield Beach. The Herald stopped printing its own editions as of April 26, 2020.

Wishes have included asking for donations to buy medical equipment for a sick child, help with renovations to make a home wheelchair- accessible, monetary donations to an impoverished family dealing with cancer treatments, and help to an elderly resident wanting to learn how to use a computer. Readers may donate to specific causes or to the program at large. The Herald also co-sponsors spelling bees and athletic awards in South Florida. The \\"Tropic\\" section and its columnist Dave Barry run the Herald Hunt, a unique annual puzzlehunt in the Miami area. =Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards= The Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards is one of most highly regarded student awards programs in the United States. The Awards program recognizes outstanding individuals and leaders who have maintained good grades and have applied their knowledge and talents to contribute service to their schools and communities. The Silver Knight Awards program was instituted at the Miami Herald in 1959 by John S. Knight, past publisher of The Miami Herald, founder and editor emeritus of Knight-Ridder Newspapers and winner of the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. The program is open to high school seniors with a minimum 3.2 GPA (unweighted) in public, charter, private, and parochial schools in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Students may be recognized in one of 15 categories: Art, Athletics, Business, Digital and Interactive (previously New Media), Drama, English and Literature, General Scholarship, Journalism, Mathematics, Music and Dance, Science, Social Science, Speech, Vocational-Technical, and World Languages. Each school may only nominate one student per category. A panel of independent judges appointed by the Miami Herald for each category interviews the nominees in that category. Each panel selects one Silver Knight and three Honorable Mentions in its category for each of the two counties (30 Silver Knights and 90 Honorable Mentions each year). The honorees are revealed during the Silver Knight Awards ceremony, televised locally from Miami's James L. Knight Center. In 2020, Silver Knights received a $2,000 scholarship, a Silver Knight statue, an AAdvantage 25,000-mile travel certificate and a medallion (from sponsor American Airlines). Honorable Mentions each received a $500 scholarship and an engraved plaque. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 awards ceremony was live-streamed on May 28 from a video studio at the Miami Herald's newsroom; the nominees attended via Zoom video conference. The Silver Knight Awards have been given in Miami-Dade County since 1959 and in Broward County since 1984. Silver Knight Awards were given to Palm Beach County students from 1985 through 1990. The program is sponsored by organizations with ties to South Florida; the cash awards have been made possible over the years in part by the support of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation (website).

The previous headquarters, One Herald Plaza, were located on a plot in Biscayne Bay, Miami. This facility opened in March 1963. In 2011 the Genting Group, a Malaysian company, offered to pay the Miami Herald Media Company $236million for the current headquarters property. The company began scouting for a new headquarters location after finalizing the sale. The then president and publisher of the media company, David Landsberg, stated that it was not necessary at that point to be located in the city center, and remaining there would be too expensive.

At the 2013 census, Wainuiomata had a population of 16,786. Origin of name The word 'Wainui-o-mata' is a Māori name made up of the words Wai = water, Nui = big, O = of, and Mata – which could refer to a woman's name. The origins of the word are disputed, but one commonly accepted translation refers to the women who came over the Wainuiomata Hill to evade marauding tribes from the north, and who sat wailing by the stream after the slaughter of their menfolk. From this we have 'faces streaming with water' or 'tears' although it could equally refer to the large pools of water which lay over the swampy surface (face) of the northern end of the Valley, or the river itself which is known to flood the Wainui (Coast Road) valley. History Wainuiomata occupies a basin at the headwaters of the Wainuiomata River, between the eastern Hutt hills and the Orongorongo Range. There is little evidence of Māori occupation of the area before 1840, probably because it was covered in dense forest and large swamps. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake raised these swamps and encouraged European settlement. The earliest settlements grew up around the river, where timber mills supplied the Wellington region when the demand was great in the 1850s and '60s. Today this area is known as \\"The Village\\" or \\"Homedale\\". The isolated location of Wainuiomata proved a problem for early settlers. Narrow hill-routes into the settlement were the only access during the 1850s and 1860s. By the end of the 19th century there were two roads in the valley: Main Road and Fitzherbert Road (known locally as \\"Swamp Road\\").Carey. Page 107. The town's economy in these early days largely depended on timber milling from the forests around the Wainuiomata River. In the 1850s Sir William Fitzherbert started a flax-milling business in the north of the valley,Carey. Page 110. but this proved economically unviable. In 1866 the Methodist Wainuiomata Coast Road Church was built on land donated by settler Richard Prouse. The oldest Methodist Church and the third-oldest church in the Wellington Region, it was used for regular services until the congregation outgrew it and moved to the new St Stephens Church in 1957. With the clearing of the forests, sheep- and dairy-farming became an important part of the local economy. The settlement started to grow in the 1920s. In 1928 Wainui-o-Mata Development Limited formed for the purpose of developing the Wainuiomata Valley through the acquisition of 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of land, its subdivision and its sale as residential lots. An important part of the project involved the construction of the Wainuiomata Tunnel linking the Hutt Valley and Wainuiomata Valley for improving access to the new settlement. Construction of the tunnel commenced in 1932, but the Depression bought a halt to construction, with many investors in the company losing money. After World War II ended in 1945, major growth occurred due to affordable housing developments attracting many young couples, which transformed Wainuiomata into a working-class community. This influx of young families earned the community the nickname of \\"Nappy Valley\\" in the 1950s. Geography Hills surround Wainuiomata on three sides. The topography reduces local wind-flow, resulting in lower minimum temperatures in winter and higher maximum temperatures in summer than in most other parts of Wellington and the Hutt Valley. The Orongorongo Valley, accessed via the Wainuiomata Valley, features bush walks and native-forest scenery. An aerial view of the Wainuiomata Valley. The Hutt Valley and Wellington Harbour appear on the left, with Moores Valley to the right. A 360 degree panorama taken 400 feet above the Wanuiomata hills. Wellington Harbour can be seen on the far left, with Petone and the Hutt Valley towards the middle of the image. The Wainuiomata Hill road can be seen curling around the bottom right of the image as it snakes into the suburb of Wainuiomata on the right hand side. People The town is often abbreviated to Wainui by locals. Wainuiomata has a reputation for its enthusiasm for sports, particularly rugby league. The Australian NRL Grand Final in 2005 saw each team containing a former member of the Wainuiomata Rugby League Club. The town's sports enthusiasts related to an incident that attracted national media attention in April 2009 when a Palmerston North motelier banned all Wainuiomata residents. This came after a series of misdemeanours by visitors from there. The many sports-stars originating from Wainuiomata include rugby union All Blacks Piri Weepu, Neemia Tialata and Tana Umaga, as well as Leinster Rugby player Leo Auva'a. Wainuiomata also achieved prominence with the first series of the television production Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby, shot in the old Wainuiomata College with many local residents as cast members. listener.co.nz Margie Abbott, wife of former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott grew up in Wainuiomata. Government Since 1989, Wainuiomata has been part of Lower Hutt City. The Wainuiomata ward covers the suburb and the surrounding rural area, electing two councillors to the Hutt City Council. Following the 2013 local elections, the ward is represented by Campbell Barry and Margaret Willard. At the national level, Wainuiomata falls in the Hutt South general electorate and the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti Māori electorate. Lower Hutt resident and National Party MP Chris Bishop represents Hutt South. Transport The Wainuiomata Hill Road is the only major road into and out of Wainuiomata, connecting the suburb with Gracefield and Waiwhetu. Four lanes wide (two in each direction), it is one of the steepest roads in the Wellington region; on the Lower Hutt side, the road climbs 195 metres in 1.9 km, resulting in an average grade of 10.3%. Two regular bus routes serve Wainuiomata: 160 Wainuiomata North and 170 Wainuiomata South. Both bus routes travel to Lower Hutt Queensgate via Waterloo Interchange, where they connect with Hutt Valley Line train services to Wellington. Route 160 serves the northern neighbourhoods of Parkway, Arakura and Glendale, while route 170 serves the southern neighbourhoods of Fernlea and Homedale; both routes serve the shopping centre. Two peak-hour services, 80N and 80S, follow routes 160 and 170 within Wainuiomata respectively, but travel via Gracefield and Petone express to central Wellington. A branch commuter railway line (see Wainuiomata railway proposals) was proposed at times in the 20th century, but never proceeded. Education Wainuiomata has eight schools: six primary schools, an intermediate school and a secondary school. *Arakura School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) school in Arakura, and has students as of *Fernlea School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) school, and has students as of *Konini Primary School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) school in Parkway, and has students as of It was established in 2002 following the merger of Parkway School and Sun Valley School. *Pukeatua Primary School is a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in Glendale, and has students as of It was established in 2002 following the merger of Glendale School and Pencarrow School. *St Claudine Thevenet School is a state- integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1–8) school, and has students as of It was established in 2005 following the merger of St Matthew's School and St Patrick's School. *Wainuiomata High School is a state secondary (Year 9–13) school in Parkway, and has students as of It was established in 2002 following the merger of Parkway College and Wainuiomata College. *Wainuiomata Intermediate School is a state intermediate (Year 7–8) school in Parkway, and has students as of It was established in 2002 following the merger of Parkway Intermediate School and Wainuiomata Intermediate School. *Wainuiomata Primary School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) school in Homedale, and has students as of It was established in 1857 and merged with Wood Hatton School in 2002. Fire brigade Wainuiomata has a volunteer fire brigade, established in 1944 following a major house-fire in 1943. The siren blasts twice in an emergency and can be heard clearly throughout the valley. The first superintendent was Mr J.S. Dunn. The first station was built in 1945 on land opposite Wainuiomata Primary School. The Wainuiomata Development Company donated land and timber to the brigade, with other brigades and companies donating hose, standpipes and ladders. The Stokes Valley brigade supplied a Gwynne Trailer pump. In the early days any available vehicle would tow the pump and trailer to calls. Often this was a 30-seater bus, as one of the foundation members, Mr Artie Kilmister, was the local bus driver. In 1946 the brigade took delivery of its first \\"real\\" fire engine, a Ford V8 Marmon- Herrington 4-wheel-drive. This truck, an ex Air Force tender, remained in service until 1965. It had no flashing lights, only a siren and on occasions this failed: it was not unusual for members to yell from the truck \\"get out of the way\\", or words to that effect. The Wainuiomata Volunteer Fire Brigade joined the United Fire Brigades Association of New Zealand (UFBA) in 1944.

Ministry of Information The Ministry of Information was created during the First World War and then reformed for the Second World War for propaganda purposes. In the Second World War it was located at the Senate House of the University of London. During the Second World War it was infamous for having a staff of 999. The Ministry was responsible for keeping much information out of the public domain during the war years, as it was thought that this would have been harmful to the national sentiment. It also censored many press reports that were not deemed to be sufficiently patriotic, or that listed military operations to a level of detail that could be used by the enemy. The Ministry took over the General Post Office Film Unit, renaming it the Crown Film Unit. It produced documentaries such as Target for Tonight (1941), Western Approaches (1944) and London Can Take It! (1940). It also created a feature- length fictional film; 49th Parallel (1941). Following this it solely created documentaries, although it also laid down propaganda guidelines for commercial films. The Ministry was disbanded following the end of the Second World War. Laws on obscenity and sexual content Obscenity law in England and Wales is currently governed by the various Obscene Publications Acts, and Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 but obscenity laws go back much further into the English common law. The conviction in 1727 of Edmund Curll for the publication of Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock under the common law offence of disturbing the King's peace was the first conviction for obscenity in Great Britain, and set a legal precedent for other convictions.\\"The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications\\", The Erotica Bibliophile. Retrieved 29 May 2006. A defence against the charge of obscenity on the grounds of literary merit was introduced in the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The OPA was tested in the high-profile obscenity trial brought against Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover (by D. H. Lawrence) in 1960. The book was found to have merit, and Penguin Books was found not guilty – a ruling which granted far more freedom to publish explicit material.\\"1960: Lady Chatterley's Lover sold out\\", BBC News. Retrieved 29 May 2006. This trial did not establish the 'merit' defence as an automatic right; several controversial books and publications were the subject of British court cases throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. Last Exit to Brooklyn, a 1964 novel by American author Hubert Selby, Jr. was subject of a private prosecution in 1966. The distinction between legal erotic literature and illegal pornography was traditionally made in the English-speaking courts on the basis of perceived literary merit. No prosecutions of purely textual pornography took place following the Inside Linda Lovelace trial of 1976 until October 2008 when a man was charged (but later cleared) under the Obscene Publications Act for allegedly posting fictional written material to the Internet describing kidnap, rape and murder of pop group Girls Aloud (the R v Walker trial). In late August 2005, the government announced that it planned to criminalise possession of extreme pornographic material, rather than just publication, and the law came into force as Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. Under a law introduced in May 2015, not only creation but also possession of manuals giving advice how to groom or abuse children is also outlawed. Almost all adult stores in the UK are forbidden from having their goods in open display under the Indecent Displays Act 1981, which means the shop fronts are often boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no items can be visible from the street. No customer can be under eighteen years old. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced the R18-rated classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in newsagents in some places. The Ann Summers chain of lingerie and sex shops recently won the right to advertise for workers in job centres, which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the sex industry.\\"Sex toys chain wins legal fight\\", BBC News, 18 June 2003.

Stage licensing  Censorship of stage plays was exercised by the Master of the Revels in England by about 1600 until the English Civil War in 1642.Eccles, Mark (1933). \\"Sir George Buc, Master of the Revels\\", in Sisson, Charles Jasper. Thomas Lodge and Other Elizabethans, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 418–419 In 1737, partly as a result of political attacks by Henry Fielding against Robert Walpole, Parliament enacted a law that established \\"the Examiner of the Stage\\" (an official in the Lord Chamberlain's office) to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (i.e. sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain. In 1737, through the influence of the Duke of Grafton, the Shakespearian commentator Edward Capell was appointed with an annual salary of £200 as deputy-examiner of plays. This censorship by licensing requirement was finally abolished by the Theatres Act 1968. According to Rufus Osgood Mason (who gives an example of a written license from 1814): Charles Kemble, later in life, received the appointment of \\"Examiner of Plays.\\" The duties consisted in reading the plays which had been accepted by the managers of the different theatres, to see that they contained nothing objectionable either on the score of politics or morals. Those that were approved were reported to the Lord Chamberlain who issued the license. Libel law England and Wales have relatively strict libel laws (\\"defamation\\" in Scotland) in that they are often considered pro plaintiff with the defendant asked to prove that they did not commit libel. Compensation awards for libel are also unlimited, in contrast to those for personal injury. Further controversy surrounds the libel laws with regard to costs. Whilst costs can be awarded the ability both to bring and to defend libel cases is often considered to be restricted to the wealthy. Conversely it is possible to initiate a \\"no win – no fee\\" case against a wealthy individual or organisation if the individual bringing the case has insignificant assets as even if the case is lost the wealthy individual or organisation are unable to recover their costs. Typically in such cases an out of court settlement is forced upon the wealthy individual or organisation. A recent example is the case of Simon Singh's lawsuit, where author and journalist Simon Singh was sued by the British Chiropractic Association for criticism of chiropractic therapy which rested on a summary of recent scientific research. Singh has been able to pursue a legal defence because of his earnings from four best-sellers. In another case the UK based academic publisher Equinox was forced to remove a peer reviewed academic article from its publication International Journal of Speech Language and the Law. The article \\"charlatanry in forensic speech science\\" was a metastudy of lie detector research and came to the conclusion that lie detectors don't work. The Israeli manufacturer of lie detectors Nemesysco forced the publisher to remove the already published article from the online databases and the journal was also forced to publish an apology in a later issue. On 15 March 2011, a \\"Draft Defamation Bill\\" (CP3/11) was published by the Ministry of Justice with an accompanying \\"consultation paper containing provisions for reforming the law to strike the right balance between protection of freedom of speech and protection of reputation.\\" (Close date: 10 June 2011)Draft Defamation Bill: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111013041437/www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/draft- defamation-bill.htm The Defamation Act 2013 reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims. Blasphemy law Blasphemy against Christianity was long an important part of British censorship, with the unwritten common law containing an offence of blasphemous libel. Prosecutions were rare, however, the last one being the 1977 Gay News legal case Whitehouse v. Lemon. Later developments around the turn of the 21st century put the continued viability of blasphemy prosecutions in doubt.\\"Q & A: Blasphemy law\\", BBC News, 18 October 2004. Retrieved 29 May 2006.

Plays and theatres had long been licensed by the Crown prior to 1737. Licensure of a playhouse, however, only gave a general patent. The crown had no ability to censor before plays were performed. Under the provisions of the Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737 as extended by the Theatres Act 1843, the Lord Chamberlain's Office was able to censor plays. This role continued until the Theatres Act 1968 abolished the practice following several cause célèbres, and a long campaign by the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan among others.

Almost always local authorities accept the Board's recommendation for a certificate for a film. *Under the Video Recording Act 1984, almost all video recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Home Secretary. This classification is then legally binding. Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority.

The advent of the Internet access has made the act of censorship more difficult, and there has been a relaxation of censorship in recognition of this. BBFC guidelines have been relaxed further to allow the limited distribution of hardcore pornography under an R18 certificate, partially because of this, and partially because of a recognition that public attitudes have changed. Further confirmation of this change in attitude was provided by the French film Baise-moi, which was given an 18 certificate despite showing scenes of unsimulated sexual activity.

Self-regulation seeks to keep content within the bounds of what is publicly acceptable, thus preventing government intervention to bring about official regulation. Some of the areas they are concerned about include obscenity, slander and libel. There is no clear line between self-regulation in matters of expression and self-censorship. In 2019, intelligence researcher James Flynn reported an example of self-regulation resulting in the cancelled publication of a book about censorship itself. Flynn's book, In Defence of Free Speech was originally accepted by Emerald Insight but later rejected over concerns that there was a \\"significant possibility of legal action\\" under the UK's hate speech and libel laws. Douglas Murray criticized this decision and compared it to the 2006 controversy that prevented Alms for Jihad from being published in the United Kingdom. Industry self-regulatory bodies include the Advertising Standards Authority. In the wake of the Leveson Inquiry the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which had been the main industry regulator of the press in the United Kingdom since 1990, was wound up and most national newspapers now belong to the Independent Press Standards Organisation, established in 2014, refusing to sign up to IMPRESS, the Leveson-compliant alternative.

More specifically, caricature was often used to satirize these events and people and bring attention to the artists' perspectives. Although censorship laws changed based on the stability of the monarchy and their opinions of the citizens, Britain was one of the European countries with the least amount of censorship in this area. During the French Revolution, Britain was in fact the only country where such propaganda was free and legal. The most famous British caricaturists at the time included Isaac Cruikshank, James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson. Although all three caricaturists had different perspectives and opinions, they were the frontrunners in the push towards patriotism of the United Kingdom when the UK faced attack from Napoleon. =Film= =Internet= Freedom of expression and protection of privacy over the Internet is guaranteed by UK law. Nonetheless, since about 2010 there has been a shift toward increased surveillance and police measures. Combating terrorism and preventing child abuse have been widely used by state agencies and private commercial actors (e.g. Internet service providers) to justify the implementation of interception and direct filtering measures. Nevertheless, in 2010 the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) found no evidence of technical filtering in the political, social, conflict/security, or Internet tools areas. The UK openly blocks child pornography websites, for which ONI does not test.\\"Country report: United Kingdom\\", OpenNet Initiative, 18 December 2010 98.6% of UK internet traffic consume a service called the child abuse image content list which uses data provided by the Internet Watch Foundation to identify pages judged to contain indecent photographs of children.\\"IWF/BT Project CleanFeed \\", Internet Watch Foundation.

In July and again in October 2011, the UK High Court ruled that BT Retail must block access to a website (newzbin.com) which \\"provides links to pirated movies\\".\\"BT ordered to block Newzbin2 filesharing site within 14 days\\", Mark Sweney, The Guardian, 26 October 2011 In September 2011, in response to the court ruling and with encouragement from government, leading UK ISPs are reported to have privately agreed in principle to quickly restrict access to websites when presented with court orders.\\"Brit ISPs shift toward rapid pirate website blocking\\", Andrew Orlowski, The Register, 22 September 2011 In May 2012 the High Court ordered UK ISPs to block The Pirate Bay to prevent further copyright infringing movie and music downloads facilitated by the website.\\"Pirate Bay must be blocked, High Court tells ISPs\\", Matt Warman, The Telegraph, 30 April 2012\\"The Pirate Bay cut off from millions of Virgin Media customers\\", Christopher Williams, The Telegraph, 3 May 2012 Soon after, the High Court ordered UK ISPs to block other websites linking to, or endorsing online \\"piracy\\", such as KickAss Torrents (kat.ph). Since the end of 2013 a rolling program has been in place to ensure that most households in the UK have pornography and other material (such as suicide, alcohol and violence-related content) filtered from the Internet by default unless a household chooses to receive it. This follows an announcement by the Prime Minister David Cameron on 22 July 2013. In addition to Internet filtering, the UK also prosecutes those who are alleged to be violating hate speech laws online. In particular, the Communications Act 2003 outlaws the act of sending \\"by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.\\" In 2017, Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecution, announced the allocation of additional resources for enforcing it and the intent to treat online speech as equivalent to a conversation in person. In 2018, the Sentencing Council began deliberating on whether to increase the maximum sentence for suspects with many social media followers. Digital secretary Margot James also outlined a plan to increase government regulation of social networks with possible penalties including 4% of the firm's global turnover. Culture secretary Matt Hancock elaborated on this plan and likened it to the controversial German law NetzDG. He was criticized for saying that a refusal by ten technology companies to send representatives to a meeting he held gave him \\"a big impetus to drive these proposals to legislate through.\\" As of 2017, it was estimated that nine people per day were being arrested for online speech in the UK with five leading to convictions. Some regulation of the Internet is coordinated through an online police presence. The Metropolitan Police Service's Twitter account for example, which has been online since 2009, has been applauded for its responsiveness. It has also been condemned for what critics see as police intimidation. In 2016, former IT consultant Paul Perrin expressed resentment over the level of attention given to LGBT issues in the news. When an officer from an LGBT-specific account of the MPS joined the discussion, he or she allegedly revealed knowledge of Perrin's family members. Age verification Since March 2019, the Digital Economy Act 2017 has given the government power to require certain websites to implement an age verification scheme, under rules defined in the Online Pornography (Commercial Basis) Regulations 2019. , reports state that there is no firm date for the implementation of this policy, which has been beset by many technical problems. A BBC report described implementation of the scheme as being \\"in a holding pattern\\". =Literature= See also under \\"Laws on obscenity and sexual content\\" above. The Happy Land, before censorship, showing the singing, dancing members of Gladstone's government. Illustration by D. H. Friston for The Illustrated London News of 22 March 1873. In 1873, controversy over the depiction of William Ewart Gladstone, Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke, and Acton Smee Ayrton in W. S. Gilbert and Gilbert Arthur à Beckett's The Happy Land led to the play's licence being revoked by the Lord Chamberlain. A censored version of the play was eventually allowed to be performed, but uncensored scripts, with the censored portions printed in all capital letters, were printed by the theatre's manager. The play became a smash hit.The Illustrated London News, 15 March 1873, page 243 The novel Ulysses by James Joyce was banned in the United Kingdom in 1922 when it was declared obscene.\\"How to read this book\\", The Guardian (London), 11 February 2004.

It appears that this was a preface for his book Animal Farm, but it is unclear if it had been deliberately suppressed or if Orwell himself chose not to publish it. > Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during > this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome.

Orwell went on to suggest that because both the UK and the Soviet Union were members of the Allied powers at the time, this self-censorship was preventing valid criticism of the Communist regime. Orwell worked for the Ministry of Information during the war and used it as his inspiration for the Ministry of Truth in Nineteen Eighty-Four. =Radio= Censorship of music on the airwaves was in effect the power of the BBC. (A full list of songs banned on the BBC can be seen here: List of songs banned by the BBC.) Some songs were banned for containing sexually explicit lyrics, or promoting the use of drugs. Some songs were banned for political reasons such as Paul McCartney and Wings song Give Ireland Back to the Irish in the 1970s, or in the 1980s Christy Moore's, Back home in Derry since it was written by Bobby Sands. In 1949, the BBC Variety Programmes Policy Guide For Writers and Producers (commonly known as \\"the Green Book\\") was issued by the BBC to its producers and writers of comedy. Among things absolutely banned were jokes about lavatories, effeminacy in men, immorality of any kind, suggestive references to honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, ladies' underwear (e.g. ‘winter draws on’), prostitution, and the vulgar use of words such as \\"basket\\". The guidelines also stipulated that \\"..such words as God, Good God, My God, Blast, Hell, Damn, Bloody, Gorblimey, Ruddy, etc etc should be deleted from scripts and innocuous expressions substituted.\\" In April 2013, after the death of Margaret Thatcher, the song Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead from The Wizard of Oz (1939 film), rose to number two in the BBC Radio 1 UK singles chart as many people bought the song to celebrate the former PM's death. The BBC refused to air the full song however, with only a small clip being played on the hit chart show.Melanie Hall, Anti-Margaret Thatcher song Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead fails to reach number one, The Telegraph, 14 April 2013 =Television= During The Troubles in Northern Ireland the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 regularly stopped or postponed the broadcast of documentaries relating to Ireland. A Real Lives documentary for the BBC, \\"At the Edge of the Union\\" was temporarily blocked in August 1985 by direct government intervention from the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan which led to a one-day strike by the National Union of Journalists to defend the independence of the BBC. From November 1988 to September 1994,\\"Dubbing SF voices becomes the stuff of history\\" , Irish Times, 17 September 1994, as reproduced on the Strathclyde University pages of David Miller. the voices of Irish republicans and Loyalist paramilitaries were barred by the British government from British television and radio. This necessitated the use by broadcasters of an actor 'revoicing' the words which had been spoken by interviewees or at public meetings by the affected groups. The case of After Dark - \\"the most uncensorable programme in the history of British television\\"Programme notes for the academic conference, 1984: Where Are We Now?, held 23 April 2014 \\\\- is also relevant, specifically the unmade edition of the programme in 1988 with Gerry Adams. The ban was lifted a fortnight after the first Provisional Irish Republican Army ceasefire, on 16 September 1994. The ban could not be enforced for the duration of election campaigns. An international academic conference on censorship noted other \\"After Dark case histories which bear on issues of censorship include the intelligence services, drugs, freemasonry, sexSee After Dark (TV series) and List of After Dark editions...and Oliver Reed.\\" =Video games= The introduction of controversial video games featuring photo-realistic images, such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap, led to calls from the tabloid press for games to fall under the Video Recordings Act. The UK games publisher trade body ELSPA responded by introducing a voluntary age rating system in 1994. The ELSPA ratings were succeeded by PEGI in 2003. Nevertheless, although games are generally exempt from the Video Recordings Act, those depicting sexual content, or gross violence towards people or animals, must still be submitted to the BBFC for consideration. BBFC ratings are legally binding, and British law imposes stiff penalties on retailers who sell to under-aged customers. However, the Act was discovered in August 2009 to be unenforceable.Loophole over DVD age rating law, BBC News, 25 August 2009 The rating system is to be reviewed as part of the Digital Britain project. Carmageddon, in which the gameplay involved mowing down innocent pedestrians, was the first game to be refused classification in 1997, effectively banning it from sale.\\"Carmageddon smashes British censor ban\\", BBC News, 4 November 1997. Retrieved 31 May 2006. The game's publisher, SCI, had a modified version created in which the pedestrians in question were replaced by green-blooded zombies, which completed a successful appeal against the BBFC to overturn their original decision. The uncensored, unmodified version of Carmageddon was later released under an 18-certificate. In 2002 the IO Interactive game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin was withdrawn by a number of retailers due to religious sensitivities. The area in question involved a Sikh sect that were depicted as terrorists involved in arms smuggling and assassination. It also involved a section that many Sikhs believed to closely resemble the 1984 massacre at the Amritsar temple. In 2004, the parents of a murdered 14-year-old boy blamed Manhunt as having been \\"connected\\" to the murder. It was later found not to be, as the game was found in the victim's home, rather than the killer's. Leicestershire police \\"did not uncover any connections to the computer game.\\" The accusations prompted some retailers to remove the game from their shelves. Nevertheless, following this incident the sales of the game rose due to the free publicity from newspaper headlines. The sequel, Manhunt 2, released in 2007, was banned from being sold in the UK by the BBFC. On appeal to the Video Appeals Committee this ruling was overturned however the BBFC launched a successful judicial review into the VAC's decision, forcing the VAC to reconsider its judgment. On 14 March 2008, the VAC again recommended that the game be released, a position to which the BBFC agreed. The game is now available.

The owners refused, citing religious objection, and were successfully sued for £500 by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The Bakery subsequently lost an appeal against the ruling. Columnist Kenan Malik criticized compelled speech and stated that the bakers did not break the law because they did not refuse service to Lee or any other gay customer. Activist Peter Tatchell adopted this view after supporting the lawsuit previously. In October 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled unanimously the bakers did not refuse to fulfill the customer's order because of his sexual orientation and would have refused to make a cake with this message for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation. Therefore, the Court ruled there was no discrimination on the grounds of the sexual orientation. * In December 2014, 19-year old Ross Loraine was arrested and cited for making light of the 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash on Twitter. The tweet, which he deleted shortly after posting, stated that after the driver's vehicle struck pedestrians, this was \\"the most trash it has picked up in one day\\". * In March 2015, 24-year old Scott Lamont was sentenced to spend four months in jail for singing Billy Boys at a Rangers FC game.

The anonymous post insulted Mzee Mohammed, who had died that year in police custody, by calling him a \\"good for nothing, spice smoking Toxteth monkey\\". * In April 2016, Scottish YouTuber Mark Meechan uploaded a video showing how he had trained his dog to raise its paw (similar to a Nazi salute) in response to Meechan saying \\"sieg heil\\" and \\"gas the Jews\\". Meechan was arrested after sharing the video, with the video having been seen more than three millions times before it was removed by YouTube. Meechan said the video was intended to annoy his girlfriend. Meechan was supported in court by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. On 20 March 2018, the court convicted him of a hate crime under the Communications Act 2003, describing the material as \\"grossly offensive\\". Tory MP Philip Davies requested a review of freedom of expression in parliament in response to the conviction. Comedians Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel tweeted in support of Meechan. Tom Walker, Shappi Khorsandi, and Stephen Fry defended Meechan and criticized other comedians for their silence on the issue. Meechan, who plans to appeal, was sentenced to pay an £800 fine on 23 April 2018. A crowd of about 500 people protested the move in London. * In 2017, 19-year old Croxteth resident Chelsea Russell quoted a line from Snap Dogg's song \\"I'm Trippin'\\" on her Instagram page. The line, which read \\"Kill a snitch nigga, rob a rich nigga\\", was copied from a friend's page as part of a tribute to Frankie Murphy who was killed in a car accident at age 13. Hate crime investigators were alerted to the presence of the slur and charged Russell with \\"sending a grossly offensive message by means of a public electronic communications network\\". Defence lawyer Carole Clarke stated that she received a request from one of the arresting officers that the word \\"nigga\\", the subject of the trial, not be used in court. In April 2018, District Judge Jack McGarva found Russell guilty and delivered a sentence which included a £585 fine, a curfew and an ankle monitoring bracelet. However, this was overturned on appeal in February 2019. * In March 2018, Humanists UK criticized Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School for censoring references to sexual orientation and women's liberation in their class materials. A description of Roe v Wade was redacted from a history textbook and homosexuals were removed from the list of groups targeted by the Holocaust. Ofsted indicated that it would take this criticism into account when investigating the publicly funded school. * In April 2018, journalist Rod Liddle expressed indifference toward the Second Severn Crossing naming controversy. In the Sunday Times he called the Welsh name \\"something indecipherable with no real vowels, such as Ysgythysgymlngwchgwch Bryggy\\" and wrote that the bridge connected Wales to \\"the first world\\". Complaints were forwarded to the Independent Press Standards Organisation and later to the North Wales Police. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on their members to \\"rise above\\" the insensitive comments but the Welsh Language Commissioner Meri Huws stated that \\"action is needed to stop these comments\\" and opined that Liddle should be prosecuted for \\"language hate\\". Liddle subsequently pledged to make jokes about Wales in all of his future columns. * In June 2018, the television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver was not permitted to broadcast a segment about Brexit in the UK, as the clip contained scenes of debate in the House of Commons. John Oliver, calling the restriction \\"genuinely insane and frankly antidemocratic\\", replaced the clip in the UK broadcast with Gilbert Gottfried reading three- star Yelp reviews of Boise, Idaho restaurants. * In June 2018, Kingston Crown Court imposed a Criminal Behaviour Order on five members of UK drill group 1011. The order restricts them from mentioning death or injury in their songs and requires them to notify police of video uploads 24 hours in advance and performances 48 hours in advance. The men, aged between 17 and 21, had previously been arrested with police saying that they planned to attack rival group 12 World with machetes and baseball bats. The 1011 members stated that the objects were props for a music video but pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Liberty and Index on Censorship both announced opposition the order. Youth worker Ciaran Thapar criticized it as ineffective while solicitor Elena Papamichael compared it to \\"blaming rock groups for drug use.\\" * In August 2018, transgender rights activist Giuliana Kendal brought a private prosecution against feminist activist Linda Bellos for discussing the possibility of a fight between Bellos and her political opponents. * In October 2018, screenwriter Graham Linehan was given a \\"verbal harassment warning\\" for making Twitter posts that deadnamed transgender activist Stephanie Hayden. The exchange arose from a debate over whether legal recognition of a gender transition should require a medical opinion. The following December, Hayden became involved in another Twitter argument which resulted in the arrest of 38-year old graduate student Kate Scottow who reported being held for seven hours before questioning. After taking DNA and fingerprints from Scottow, police released her and obtained a court order that she refrain from deadnaming Hayden or referring to her as a man. Her phone and laptop, used for the investigation, were returned after two months. The incident has been compared to a warning that Sussex police issued and later retracted regarding a blog post by former journalist and teacher Margaret Nelson. * In January 2019, community cohesion officer Mansoor Gul questioned Lincolnshire ex-police officer Harry Miller over the fact that he had retweeted a poem that condemned gender transitions. While confirming that no crime had been committed, Gul stated that it qualified as a \\"hate incident\\" and told Miller that his employer might be displeased. Miller also reported that he heard the line \\"we need to check your thinking\\". Officials including Boris Johnson and Martin Vickers criticized the police response. Miller subsequently launched a legal challenge which concluded in February 2020. The judge's ruling condemned the police for interfering with protected speech.

It enters the English Channel at the western end of Lyme Bay, part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Permian and Triassic sandstone aquifer in the Otter Valley is one of Devon's largest groundwater sources, supplying drinking water to 200,000 people. Topography Known as the Tumbling Weir, at Ottery St Mary, water flows inwards over concentric circles, returning to the river via a tunnel. Close up of the Tumbling Weir. Bridge over River Otter, at Otterton. Fish pass on River Otter, alongside weir (top right in photo) near Otterton. Fish logo on tablet recording construction of the fish pass.The river's source is north of Otterford, where a stream feeds the Otterhead Lakes: and then through Churchstanton before entering Devon. The river flows through a predominantly rural area, with small cattle, sheep and dairy farms. The largest town in the Otter Valley is Honiton. Tourism and leisure play important roles in the economy. For much of its length, the river flows through two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) – The Blackdown Hills AONB (to the north of Honiton) and East Devon AONB (to the south of Ottery St Mary). The river passes through or by Upottery, Rawridge, Monkton, Honiton, Alfington, Ottery St Mary, Tipton St John, Newton Poppleford and Otterton. It then reaching the Otter Estuary to the east of Budleigh Salterton. The Otter Estuary Nature Reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) consisting of tidal mudflats and saltmarsh. There is no public access to the estuary itself but footpaths lead to two viewing platforms on the west and two hides one on the west and one on the east. The wintering population of wildfowl and waders includes common redshank, greenshank, dunlin, common sandpiper, ringed plover, grey plover, Eurasian curlew, common snipe, water rail, Eurasian wigeon, Eurasian teal, common shelduck, brent goose, red-breasted merganser and little grebe. Eurasian reed warbler, reed bunting and sedge warbler breed on the reserve. The Environment Agency measures the water level of the Otter and its tributaries at six or more \\"river level stations\\".River level stations The point at which the river reaches the coast () is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. A small tributary is the River Tale, with the confluence NW of Ottery St Mary. This small town (associated with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Raleigh, and an annual tar barrel rolling event) is the site of an unusual circular weir, known as the Tumbling Weir. Another small tributary is Budleigh Brook, which joins the Otter at East Budleigh. At one time there were as many as fifty watermills powered by the River Otter. One of the remaining working mills, thought to date from the 17th century, is Tracey Mill near Honiton. In the 1970s, fish ponds were dug around the mill, fed by the leat; over a million gallons of fresh water flow through these ponds every day, helping the commercial production of trout \\"without the need for antibiotics or added oxygen\\". One mill, at Dotton, is known to have operated from around 1100 to 1960, after which the building was demolished. The site was excavated by Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team, the episode \\"The Domesday Mill\\" being broadcast in 2007. This mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book. A weir diverted water to the mill's leat, supplying the vertical breast-shot wheel. Dotton (now little more than a farm) is from the mouth of the Otter, and about one mile (1.6 km) north of the village of Colaton Raleigh. At the village of Otterton (once a seaport on a larger Otter Estuary), Otterton Mill is a working watermill over 1,000 years old; it was one of the three largest mills in Devon as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is powered by water diverted through a leat. Immediately north of the leat, a fish pass (a.k.a. ladder/staircase) has been constructed beside a river-wide weir, restoring migratory fish runs to the river after a break of over 100 years.  Coleridge  The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), who was born in Ottery St Mary, wrote a sonnet entitled \\"Sonnet to the River Otter\\". At Ottery St Mary the river is spanned by a 95-metre foot and cycle bridge named Coleridge Bridge; built at a cost approaching £1m, this was officially opened on 29 August 2011. A small area of land at one end of the bridge was sold to the local authorities by Lord Coleridge, a descendant of the poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Beaver population The Otter is the only river in England known to contain a wild breeding population of beavers, a species that died out in Britain in around 1550. The origin of the population is not known; it was first noticed in 2013, apparently successfully bearing three kits the next year. Following concern from local landowners and anglers, as well as farmers worrying that the beavers could carry disease, the government announced that it would capture the beavers and place them in a zoo or wildlife park. A sport fishing industry lobbyist group, the Angling Trust, said \\"it would be irresponsible even to consider re-introducing this species into the wild without first restoring our rivers to good health.\\" This decision to immediately remove the beavers was protested by local residents and campaign groups, with environmental journalist George Monbiot describing the government and Angling Trust as \\"control freaks\\": \\"I'm an angler, and the Angling Trust does not represent me on this issue...most anglers, in my experience, have a powerful connection with nature. The chance of seeing remarkable wild animals while waiting quietly on the riverbank is a major part of why we do it.\\" The introduction of beavers to rivers has been encouraged by environmentalists, who have argued that beaver dams provide a habitat for birds and fish, reduce the strength of flooding by trapping water high up in a catchment area, away from homes further downstream, and could be a future tourist attraction. On the 28 January 2015, Natural England declared that the beavers would be allowed to remain on condition that they were free of disease and of the Eurasian species (as opposed to North American beavers, which would be invasive). These conditions were passed, and the beavers were returned to the river as part of a five-year trial scheme.http://www.devonwildlifetrust.org/river-otter-beavers In February 2020, the trial was extended by six months to August, when the government announced that the beavers, which by then numbered 15 family groups, could remain on the River Otter indefinitely. It was the first legally sanctioned reintroduction of an extinct native animal anywhere in England.

Database entry includes justification for why this species is critically endangered It is a relatively small skink (a kind of lizard): adults reach an average snout-to- vent length of about .  Description  Adult Bermuda skinks (also known as \\"rock lizards\\") have dark brown or black backs and are pinkish or light gray on the underside. Juveniles are lighter in color and have black stripes running along the sides of their bodies, which fade with age. Females are thought to retain the stripes longer than males. Adult males have larger heads. Hatchlings have bright blue tails. All have salmon orange cheeks and throat. The Bermuda skink lives predominantly in rocky coastal areas. They feed on small invertebrates such as cockroaches or woodlices, but also on small terrestrial crustaceans. While being more active during summer, the Bermuda skink does not hibernate, because the warm climate allows it to be active year-round.  Distribution and conservation status  The species occurs only in Bermuda, and exists mainly on some of the smaller islands and nature reserves on the mainland where the populations are fragmented into isolated pockets. The Bermuda skink has been listed on the IUCN Red List as critically endangered. It is threatened primarily by habitat destruction, predators introduced by humans (such as cats, rats, American crows, chickens, great kiskadees, yellow crowned night herons, cane toads, anoles,), as well as by human litter: the Bermuda skink has tiny claws on its feet, but no friction pads, and when it gets trapped in cast-away empty glass bottles or soda cans, it cannot climb out and thus starves or dies of heat stress or dehydration. The Bermuda skink is listed as protected under the 2003 Bermuda Protected Species Act.

The period notably includes the Hiberno-Scottish mission of Christianised Ireland to regions of pagan Britain and the spread of Irish cultural influence to Continental Europe. Overview At the start of the period, Ireland had emerged from a mysterious decline that archaeological evidence suggests had hit population levels and standards of living from c. 100–300 AD, called the Irish Dark Age by Thomas Charles-Edwards. The population was entirely rural and dispersed, with small ringforts the largest centres of human occupation. Some 40,000 of these are known, while there may have been as many as 50,000, and \\"archaeologists are agreed that the vast bulk of them are the farm enclosures of the well-to-do of early medieval Ireland\\". Souterrains, underground passages and chambers for hiding in or escaping through, are common. It is likely that raiding Great Britain for slaves and other loot gave an important boost to an otherwise almost entirely agricultural economy. The lakeside enclosures called crannógs continued to be used and seem especially associated with crafts. The older view that early medieval Irish farming concentrated on livestock has been overturned by pollen studies and other evidence, and it is now clear that cereal farming was increasingly important from about AD 200 onwards, with barley and oats more important crops than rye, wheat and others. Cattle were greatly prized, and cattle-raiding constituted a large part of warfare, so that cattle needed the constant presence of a herdsman in daylight hours and were put in an enclosure at night. By the end of the period the largest herds were probably those of monasteries. Generally mild Irish winters seem to have meant they were never put in roofed shelters in winter, although young calves might spend a period in the house. There was very considerable clearance of forests in the early part of the period, such that by the 9th century, large tracts of forest appear to have been rare, and the native Scots pine cleared almost to extinction; the large areas of bogland were harder for the medieval Irish to affect. By 800, small towns had started to form around some of the larger monasteries, such as Trim and Lismore, and some kings were based in them, but the foundation of larger towns by the Vikings had yet to occur. Otherwise kings lived in ringforts larger than the norm, but generally similar; however the possession of luxury objects such as elaborate Celtic brooches was much greater among royalty. The latter part of the period was the peak of the Irish contribution to Insular art, whose surviving products include illuminated manuscripts, most famously the Book of Kells, brooches, which were worn by clergy as well nobles, carved stone high crosses, and other isolated survivals of metalwork, such as the Derrynaflan and Ardagh Hoards. Early Christian history Recorded Irish history begins with the introduction of Christianity and Latin literacy, beginning in the 5th century or possibly slightly before. When compared to neighbouring Insular societies, early Christian Ireland is well documented, at least for later periods, but these sources are not easy to interpret. Many questions remain unanswered and the study of early Christian Ireland continues to produce new theories and new discoveries. Since the later 19th century, when scholars such as Kuno Meyer and Whitley Stokes applied an increasingly rigorous approach to the study of written sources, a great deal of new information has been extracted from the written material. New fields, such as paleobotany, have contributed to the debate, while the volume of archaeological evidence has increased. =Ecclesiastical history= Gallarus Oratory, one of the earliest churches built in Ireland The first reliable historical event in Irish history, recorded in the Chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine, is the ordination by Pope Celestine I of Palladius as the first bishop to Irish Christians in 431 – which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Prosper says in his Contra Collatorem that by this act Celestine \\"made the barbarian island Christian\\", although it is clear the Christianisation of the island was a longer and more gradual process. The mission of Saint Patrick is traditionally dated around the same time – the earliest date for his arrival in Ireland in the Irish annals is 432 – although Patrick's own writings contain nothing securely dateable.Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland 400–1200, Longman, 1995, pp. 1, 14–40 It is likely that Palladius' activities were in the south of Ireland, perhaps associated with Cashel, while Patrick's were later, in the north, and associated with Armagh. By the early 6th century the church had developed separate dioceses, with bishops as the most senior ecclesiastical figures, but the country was still predominantly pagan. The High Kings of Ireland continued pagan practices until the reign of Diarmait mac Cerbaill c. 558, traditionally the first Christian High King. The monastic movement, headed by abbots, took hold in the mid 6th century, and by 700 Ireland was at least nominally a Christian country, with the church fully part of Irish society. The status of ecclesiastics was regulated by secular law, and many leading ecclesiastics came from aristocratic Irish families. Monasteries in the 8th century even went to war with each other.Kathleen Hughes, \\"The church in Irish society, 400–800\\", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín (ed.), A New History of Ireland Vol 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 301–330 From the 7th century on, Irish churchmen such as Columbanus and Columba were active in Gaul, in Scotland and in Anglo-Saxon England. The mixing of Irish, Pictish and Anglo-Saxon styles created the Insular style of art, represented by the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells. Ireland's reputation for scholarship was such that many scholars travelled from Britain and the European mainland to study in Irish schools. =Political history= Eoin MacNeill identified the \\"oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland\\" as the existence in late prehistory of a pentarchy, probably consisting of the cóiceda or \\"fifths\\" of the Ulaid (Ulster), the Connachta (Connacht), the Laigin (Leinster), Mumu (Munster) and Mide (Meath), although some accounts discount Mide and split Mumu in two.Eoin MacNeill, Phases of Irish History, Dublin, 1920, pp. 98–132 However, by the dawn of history this pentarchy no longer existed. The rise of new dynasties, notably the Uí Néill in the north and midlands and the Eóganachta in the south-west, changed the political landscape. The Uí Néill, or their parent group the Connachta, reduced the former fifth of the Ulaid to counties Down and Antrim in the 4th of 5th century, establishing the tributary kingdom of the Airgíalla in the centre and the Uí Néill kingdom of Ailech in the west of the old province. Early Irish annals also show regular warfare between the Uí Néill and the Laigin in the midlands, with the Uí Néill conquering as far south as the Kildare/Offaly border, and claiming the kingship of Tara, beginning to be conceptualised as the High Kingship of Ireland. This led to a new division of the country into two-halves, Leth Cuinn, \\"Conn's half\\" after Conn of the Hundred Battles, supposed ancestor of the Uí Néill and Connachta, in the north, and Leth Moga, \\"Mug's half\\", after Mug Nuadat, supposed ancestor of the Eoganachta, in the south. Dynastic propaganda claimed this was a traditional division dating back to the 2nd century, but it probably originated in the 8th, at the height of Uí Néill power.

It had previously operated Lockheed TriStar K1, KC1 and C2s from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, between November 1984 and March 2014. History =First World War= No. 216 Squadron's beginnings can be traced back to August 1917 when No. 7 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) sent a detachment of four Handley Page O/100 to Redcar in order to fly anti-submarine missions. Moving to Manston in October, the unit was re-designated as 'A' Squadron. At the end of October, 'A' Squadron was deployed to Ochey, France, joining No. 41 Wing as a strategic night bomber squadron. On 8 January 1918, 'A' Squadron was re-designated as No. 16 Squadron (RNAS). In March, the squadron began to convert to the Handley Page O/400. On the night of 24/25 March, an aircraft from the squadron carried out an 8 and a half hour attack on Cologne. On 1 April, while operating out of Villeseneux (south east of Reims), No. 16 Squadron (RNAS) became No. 216 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. =Interwar= Between the two World Wars the squadron used Vickers Vimy, Vickers Victoria and Vickers Type 264 Valentia aircraft on transport duties around the Middle East. No. 216 Squadron had their squadron badge approved by King Edward VIII in May 1936. =Second World War= During the Second World War, with a few exceptions, such as the attacks from 17 to 21 June 1940 by a single aircraft of No. 216 Squadron on the airfields of El Adem and Tobruk,Playfair, Vol. I, page 113. the unit was principally a transport squadron, operating the Vickers Type 264 Valentia, Bristol Bombay, de Havilland DH86, Lockheed Hudson and Douglas Dakota. It spent a lengthy time deployed to Cairo from November 1942 to July 1945.Jefford 1988, p. 71 =Post-War= No. 216 Squadron leaving RAF Fayid (Egypt) for the UK in 1955. In late 1949, the Dakotas were replaced by Vickers Valettas and Handley Page Hastings transport aircraft; in 1955 the squadron moved to RAF Lyneham from RAF Fayid in Egypt to operate the De Havilland Comet C.2 jet airliner until 27 June 1975, when No. 216 Squadron disbanded after 58 years of service. The squadron reformed at RAF Honington on 1 July 1979 as a maritime strike squadron assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) with twelve Blackburn Buccaneer S.2RAF nuclear front line Order-of-Battle 1980 aircraft transferred from the Fleet Air Arm's 809 Naval Air Squadron. These aircraft had been embarked on RAF nuclear front line Order-of-Battle 1977–78 until flying off for the last time in November 1978 for a delivery flight from the carrier in the Mediterranean to RAF St Athan. Designated Buccaneer S2A by the RAF, they were equipped with twelve WE.177A nuclear bombs,RAF nuclear front line Order-of-Battle 1981 free-falling conventional HE bombs and Martel missiles for non-nuclear strike. However, on 7 February 1980, a No. XV Squadron Buccaneer crashed after a wing failed in flight during the Red Flag exercise in the USA. The resulting grounding and inspections saw the size of the Buccaneer fleet reduced, with the result that No. 216 Squadron had its assets merged with No. 12 (Bomber) Squadron barely a year after its reformation, however the squadron was not officially disbanded.Weapon overview @ www.nuclear-weapons.info/vw.htm#WE.177 Carriage =Lockheed TriStar (1984–2014)= Kemble Airfield, June 2005. Following the Falklands War, the RAF found itself lacking in the strategic transport capabilities required to sustain the expanded military presence there; this shortfall was filled initially by chartered British Airways Boeing 747s and Britannia Airways Boeing 767s. To address this, in December 1982 the RAF purchased six former British Airways Lockheed TriStar 500s. The first TriStar (ZD949) was leased back to British Airways on 29 March 1983 until November, eventually undergoing conversion at Cambridge Airport by Marshall Aerospace in 1986. In 1984, the RAF purchased a further three TriStar 500s from Pan-Am. No. 216 Squadron was reactivated on 1 November 1984 at RAF Brize Norton to operate the Lockheed TriStar. The aircraft were operated initially in the air-transport role but the fleet's role was eventually expanded to Air-to-Air Refuelling. On 24 March 1986, TriStar KC.1 ZD953 became the first aircraft to be handed over to the squadron. No. 216 Squadron deployed the TriStar fleet in support of many high- profile missions including the Gulf War (for which the aircraft received a desert paint scheme), Operation Allied Force (Kosovo), Operation Veritas and Operation Herrick (Afghanistan), Operation Telic (Iraq 2003) and Operation Ellamy (Libya). The squadron was disbanded on 20 March 2014 at RAF Brize Norton, with the last Tristar sortie being flown on 24 March. On 11 October 2017, it was announced that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II had approved the award of 'Iraq 2003-2011' and 'Libya 2011' Battle Honours to No. 216 Squadron (without the right to emblazon). =Drone Swarm (2020–present)= On 17 July 2019, at the Air & Space Power Conference, the RAF announced that No. 216 Squadron would reform to become an experimental unit that will test future drone swarm technology. The squadron is expected to reform on 1 April 2020, initially based at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. No. 216 Squadron formally stood up on 1 April 2020.

The Judicates (judicadus, logus or rennus in Sardinian, judicati in Latin, regni or giudicati sardi in Italian), in English also referred to as Sardinian Kingdoms, Sardinian Judgedoms or Judicatures, were independent states that took power in Sardinia in the Middle Ages, between the ninth and fifteenth centuries. They were sovereign states with summa potestas, each with a ruler called judge (), with the powers of a king. Historical causes of the advent of the kingdoms After a relatively brief Vandal occupation (456–534), Sardinia was a province of the Byzantine Empire from 535 until the eighth century. After 705, with the rapid Arab expansion, pirates from North Africa began to raid the island and encountered no effective opposition by the Byzantine army. In 815, Sardinian ambassadors requested military assistance from the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious. In 807, 810–812, and 821–822 the Arabs of Spain and North Africa tried to invade the island but the Sardinians resisted several attacks. This defence was so effective that in a letter in 851 Pope Leo IV asked the Iudex Provinciae (judge of the province) of Sardinia, based in Caralis, for aid in the defense of Rome. With the fall of the Exarchate of Africa, based in Carthage, in the eighth century, and especially with the emergence of the Arab presence in Sicily (827), Sardinia remained disconnected from Byzantium and had, out of necessity, become economically and militarily independent. Arms of the Kingdom of Torres Arms of the Kingdom of Arborea =The birth of the four kingdoms= The almost total absence of historical sources does not allow certainty surrounding the date of the passage from Byzantine central authority to self- government in Sardinia. It is believed that at some point the Iudex Provinciae or Archon of Sardinia, residing in Caralis, had complete control of the island. He appointed, in the most strategic area for the defense of the coast, the lociservator (lieutenant), belonging to his family, the Lacon-Gunale, who became substantially autonomous from Caralis over time; this was probably the action that precipitated the birth of the kingdoms, or judgedoms.Giuseppe Meloni, L’origine dei Giudicati The first incontrovertible source that cites the existence of four kingdoms is the epistle sent by Pope Gregory VII from Capua on October 14, 1073 to the Sardinian judges Orzocco of Cagliari, Orzocco d'Arborea, Marianus of Torres and Constantine of Gallura;Gian Giacomo Ortu, La Sardegna dei Giudici, 2005 p.45 however their autonomy was already clear in a later letter of Pope John VIII (872) in which he referred to them as principes Sardiniae (\\"princes of Sardinia\\"). The known medieval giudicati were: *Kingdom of Cagliari with capital in Santa Igia *Kingdom of Arborea with capital in Oristano, *Kingdom of Gallura with capital in Civita, *Kingdom of Torres with capital in Porto Torres, Ardara and then Sassari. Tower of Marianus II of Arborea at Oristano. Each of the four States had fortified borders to protect their political and commercial interests, as well their own laws, administration and emblems.Francesco Cesare Casula, La politica religiosa del giudicato di Torres, ne I Cistercensi in Sardegna, Nuoro, 1990 Governments The administrative organization of the judgedoms differed significantly from the feudal forms existing in the rest of medieval Europe as their institutions were closer to those of the territories of the Byzantine Empire, although with local peculiarities that some scholars consider of Nuragic derivation. In the international context of the Middle Ages, the judgedoms were characterized by semi-democratic institutions such as the Coronas de curatorias which in turn elected their own representatives to the parliamentary assizes called Corona de Logu.Francesco Cesare Casula, La politica religiosa del giudicato di Torres, ne I Cistercensi in Sardegna, Nuoro, 1990 =The Corona de Logu and the central council= The central government and the entire Judiciary were ruled substantially by the judge. The king did not have possession of the land nor was he the repository of sovereignty since this was formally held by the Corona de Logu, a council of elders (representatives of the administrative districts - Curadorias) and high priests. They appointed the ruler and attributed the supreme power to him, while maintaining the power to ratify acts and agreements related to the entire kingdom. During su Collectu (coronation ceremony) in the capital, a representative of each curadoria, members of the high clergy, the castle lords, two representatives of the capital elected by delegates from jurados Coronas de curatoria, came together. Then the judex was crowned with a mixed-elected hereditary system following the direct male line and, only in the alternative, the female line. The judge ruled on the basis of a covenant with the people (the bannus-consensus). The sovereign could be dethroned and even, in cases of serious acts of tyranny and oppression, executed legitimately by the same people, without this prejudging the inheritance of the title within the same ruling dynasty. Marianus IV of Arborea Curadorias =Judges= The judge was not an absolute ruler in the sense of later absolutism—at least in form: he could not declare war or sign a peace treaty without the consent of the Corona de Logu. However, that was composed primarily of the nobility's relatives and, therefore, linked by common interests. The succession to the throne was dynastic but in some case there was the possibility of election by the Corona De Logu. =The judicial chancellery= In the government of the territory, the Judge was assisted by the Chancellery. The sovereign authority was in fact formalized with the drafting of official acts called bullata paper, written by the statal chancellor, usually a bishop or at least a senior member of the clergy, assisted by other officials called majores. =Local administration= Curadorias The territory of various kingdoms was divided into curadorias, administrative districts of varying sizes formed by urban and rural villages, dependent on a capital which housed the curadore. These administrators, aided especially by jurados (judges) and a council the Corona de curatoria, represented the judicial authority locally and tended to the public property of the Crown. The curadore appointed for each village was part of the curadorias a majore de Bidda (the modern equivalent of a mayor) with administrative and judicial powers, and direct responsibility for the successful actions of land management. =Law= Castle of Monreale, Sardara Judicial army The Sardinian judicial armies were composed of troops made up of soldiers and free citizens, subject to periodic rotation. In an emergency forced conscription was used. The elite corps was made up of so- called bujakesos, chosen riders who served under the command of the janna de Majore, the commander in charge of the security of the sovereign. The main armaments were the sword, chain mail, the shield, the helmet, and the birrudu, a weapon similar to the ancient verutum, the Roman javelin. The militias of the ground and the infantry (birrudos) used a shorter version of this same weapon. Besides the use of spears and shields, another common weapon was the leppa, a sword with a bone handle and curved blade, between 50 and 70 cm long which was still in use, in a more contained dimension, until the end of nineteenth century. In Sardinia a type of longbow was made, and over time the use of the crossbow spread. In case of conflict judges often used mercenary troops, such as the dreaded Genoese crossbowmen. Culture =Religion= Basilica di Saccargia Christianity spread throughout most of the island in the early centuries, excluding much of the Barbagia region. At the end of the sixth century Pope Gregory I reached an agreement with Hospito, chief of the barbaricini, that guaranteed the conversion of his people from paganism to Christianity. Since Sardinia was in the political sphere of the Byzantine Empire, it developed an array of Greek and Eastern Christianity traits as a result of evangelisation by Basilian monks. Nostra Signora di Tergu Basilica of San Gavino The Sardinian Church was an autocephalous institution for five centuries, independent from both the Byzantine and the Roman Curia.Cherchi Paba F., La Chiesa Greca, Cagliari, 1962 In the eleventh century, after the schism of 1054, the judikes, according to Pope Alexander II, began a policy for the development of Western monasticism on the island, with the aim of a wider dissemination of culture but also of new techniques for cultivating the land. The immigration of monastics to the island was fueled by donated funds, and local churches were built by the giudical aristocracy. However, there were still strong ties with the Eastern liturgy. In 1092 a papal bull expressly abolished the autonomy and autocephaly of the Church of Sardinia, which was placed under the primacy of the Archbishop of Pisa. The first act of donation was made in 1064 by Barisone I of Torres who gave the Benedictine monks of Monte Cassino a large area of its territory with churches (including the Byzantine church of Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu), not far from the then capital of Ardara. For several centuries afterwards representatives of many religious orders including the monks of the Abbey of Montecassino, the Camaldolese, the Vallombrosians, the Vittorini of Marseille, the Cistercians of Bernard of Clairvaux arrived and settled in Sardinia. As a result of this, Romanesque architecture flourished in the island. =Language= Byzantine Greek was used as an administrative language during the Byzantine period, but fell into disuse. Latin, which had long been the language of the native population, developed into the Sardinian language and became the official language. It was also used in legal and administrative documents such as the condaghe, municipal statutes, and the laws of the kingdoms such as the Carta de Logu. Pisan-Genoese and Aragonese interference and end of the four kingdoms In red the Sardinian territories controlled directly by Pisa in the early 14th century, before the Aragonese invasion, green the Della Gherardesca, in blue the Giudicato of Arborea, in purple the Malaspina, yellow the Doria, in black the comune of Sassari Pisa and Genoa began to infiltrate the Judicial politics and economy in the eleventh century intervening to support the giudicati, against the Taifa of Dénia, an Iberian Muslim kingdom, which was trying to conquer the island. From the second half of the thirteenth century the autonomous existence of the kingdoms of Logudoro, Gallura and Calari ended due to the diplomatic maneuvers of Genoa and Pisa on the territory, on trade, on the episcopal curiae, and the judicial chancelleries. The Kingdom of Logudoro ended effectively in 1259 with the direct management of his territories by the Doria and the Malaspina Genoese families. Cagliari was conquered by a Pisan-Sardinian alliance in 1258 and his territory was divided between the winners. Gallura went to the Visconti family and then to Pisa in 1288. Arborea lasted longer and, between 1323 and 1326, participated in an alliance with the Crown of Aragon at the conquest of the Pisan possessions in Sardinia (the former kingdoms of Gallura and Calari). However, threatened by the Aragonese claims of suzerainty and consolidation of the rest of the island, in 1353 the Kingdom of Arborea, under Marianus IV of Arborea, broke the alliance with the Aragonese and together with the Doria declared war against the Iberians. In 1368 an Arborean offensive succeeded in nearly driving the Aragonese from the island, reducing the Kingdom of Sardinia to just the port cities of Cagliari and Alghero and incorporating everything else into their own kingdom. A peace treaty returned the Aragonese their previous possessions in 1388, but tensions continued. In 1391 the Arborean army, led by Brancaleone Doria, again conquered most of the island, subjecting it to Arborean rule. This state of affairs lasted until 1409, when the army of the Kingdom of Arborea suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the Aragonese army in the Battle of Sanluri. The Kingdom of Arborea ceased to exist in 1420, after the sale of its territories to the Aragonese by the last judge, William II of Narbonne, for 100,000 gold florins.

They credit Hotepsekhemwy with either a 25- or a 29-year rule.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt.

Hotepsekhemwy's name has been identified by archaeologists at Sakkara, Giza, Badari and Abydos from clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (Ägyptologische Abhandlungen), Vol. 45, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, Guy Brunton: Qau and Badari I, with chapters by Alan Gardiner and Flinders Petrie, British School of Archaeology in Egypt 44, London 1927: Bernard Quaritch, Tafel XIX, 25Gaston Maspero: Notes sur les objets recueillis sous la pyramide d'Ounas in: Annales du Service des Antiquités de l'Egypt (ASAE) Vol. III.

The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy is the subject of particular interest to Egyptologists and historians, as it may hint at the turbulent politics of the time. The Egyptian word \\"Hotep\\" means \\"peaceful\\" and \\"to be pleased\\" though it can also mean \\"conciliation\\" or \\"to be reconciled\\", too. So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as \\"the two powers are reconciled\\" or \\"pleasing in powers\\", which suggests a significant political meaning. In this sense, \\"the two powers\\" could be a reference to Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.Peter A. Clayton: Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign- by-reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt, Thames and Hudson, London 2006, , page 26. From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the Nebty name in the same way. It is thought that some kind of philosophic background affected that choice, since the Horus name reveals a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also indicate, that the Horus name was adopted after ascending the throne.  Family  The name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. A “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu” named Perneb might have been his son, but since the clay seals providing his name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which is attributed to two kings equally (Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb), it is uncertain whose son Perneb really was.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early dynastic Egypt: Strategy, Society and Security. Routledge, London u. a. 1999, , page 296.Peter Kaplony: Inschriften der Ägyptischen Frühzeit. Band 3, (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen Bd. 8). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, , page 96 as Obj. 367.  Identity  Bone cylinder inscribed with the serekh of Hotepsekhemwy. Hotepsekhemwy is commonly identified with the Ramesside cartouche names Bedjau from the Abydos king list, Bedjatau from Giza, Netjer-Bau from the Sakkara king list and the name Bau-hetepju from the royal canon of Turin. Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck points to the similar name Bedjatau, which appears in a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. \\"Bedjatau\\" means \\"the foundryman\\" and is thought to be a misreading of the name \\"Hotepsekhemwy\\", since the hieroglyphic signs used to write \\"Hotep\\" in its full form are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two Sekhem sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. A similar phenomenon might have occurred in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg- symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list imitates this Old Kingdom name form of “Bedjatau”. The names \\"Netjerbau\\" and \\"Bau-hetepju\\" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.Edward Brovarski: Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza. In: Annales du Service des Antiquités de l´Egypte, Vol.71, 1987, Table 1Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, , page 134.  Reign  Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Contemporary sources show that he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife, including ephemeral rulers such as Horus \\"Bird\\" and Sneferka (the latter is also thought to be an alternate name used by king Qaa for a short time). As evidence of this, Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and George Reisner point to the tomb of king Qaa, which was plundered at the end of 1st Dynasty and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The plundering of the cemetery and the unusually conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. Additionally, Helck assumes that the kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were omitted from later king lists because their struggles for the Egyptian throne were factors in the collapse of the first dynasty.Peter Kaplony: „Er ist ein Liebling der Frauen“ – Ein „neuer“ König und eine neue Theorie zu den Kronprinzen sowie zu den Staatsgöttinnen (Kronengöttinnen) der 1./2. Dynastie. In: Manfred Bietak: Ägypten und Levante. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 2006 ; page 126–127.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewußtsein ihrer Nachwelt. page 36–41. Seal impressions provide evidence of a new royal residence called \\"Horus the shining star\\" that was constructed by Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the little-known deity Netjer-Achty and founded the \\"Chapel of the White Crown\\". The white crown is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is thought to be another clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, indicating a likely source of political power.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London 1999, , page 285 & 286. Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim point out that there is no inscription from Hotepsekhemwy's reign mentioning a Sed festival, indicating the ruler cannot have ruled longer than 30 years (the Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary marking a reign of 30 years).Nabil M. A. Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty. Archaeological Society, Alexandria 1983, (Archaeological and Historical Studies 7). page 67-77.Entrance to the gallery tomb beneath the Unas passway. The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho called Hotepsekhemwy Boëthôs (apparently altered from the name Bedjau) and reported that during this ruler's reign \\"a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished\\". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two millennia after the king's actual reign – some Egyptologists think it possible that this anecdote may have been based on fact, since the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.  Tomb  The location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Egyptologists such as Flinders Petrie, Alessandro Barsanti and Toby Wilkinson believe it could be the giant underground Gallery Tomb B beneath the funeral passage of the Unas- necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Peter Munro are not convinced and think that Gallery Tomb B is instead the burial site of king Raneb, as several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there.Alessandre Barsanti in: Annales du service des antiquités de lÉgypte - Súppleménts; Volume II.

The urban areas comprise cities, towns and other conurbations (an aggregation of urban settlements) of a thousand people or more. In combination, the urban areas of the country constitute New Zealand's urban population. As of , the urban population made up % of New Zealand's total population. The Statistical Standard for Geographic Areas 2018 (SSGA18) replaced the NZSAC92 standard in 2018. There are four classes of urban area under the new standard: *Major urban areas, with a population of 100,000 or more. There are seven major urban areas. *Large urban areas, with a population of 30,000 to 99,999. There are 13 large urban areas. *Medium urban areas, with a population of 10,000 to 29,999. There are 22 medium urban areas. *Small urban areas, with a population of 1,000 to 9,999. There are 136 small urban areas. Under the New Zealand Standard Areas Classification 1992 (NZSAC92), there are three classes of urban area: *Main urban areas, with a population of 30,000 or more.

He reigned for 33 years at the end of the 30th century BC.  Identity  Abydos king list. Manetho calls Qa'a Biénechês and gives him a reign of 26 years. Other versions of copies of Manetho's epitomes give Óubiênthis and Víbenthis as hellenized names.Peter Clayton: Chronicle of the Pharaohs. Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994. p.25Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. In: Ägyptologische Abhandlungen Band 35, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 124.  Family  The parents of Qa'a are unknown, but it is thought that either his predecessor Anedjib or Semerkhet was his father, since it was tradition to leave the throne to the eldest son. If Manetho suggested correctly (remembering the tradition), Semerkhet was the father.  Reign  There is not much known about Qa'a's reign, but it seems that he reigned for a long time (around 33 years). Several stone vessel inscriptions mention a second Sed festival for Qa'a, which points to at least 33 years of reign. The first festival was usually not celebrated before 30 years of reign, and subsequent festivals could be repeated every third year. The Palermo Stone only mentions the year of coronation and some usual cultic events that were celebrated under every king. The numerous ivory tags dating to his reign also mention only typical arrangements, such as depicting and counting burial offerings and personal possessions of the king. Several mastaba tombs of high officials date into Qa'a's reign: Merka (S3505), Henuka (burial unknown), Neferef (burial also unknown) and Sabef (buried in the royal necropolis of Qa'a).P. Lacau, J. P. Lauer: La Pyramide a Degeres IV, Inscriptions Gravees sur les Vases. Cairo 1959, page 12.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/ New York 1999, , page 81–83. Ivory label of Qa'a with his serekh and Nebty name sn.  End of reign  Despite Qa'a's long and prosperous reign, evidence shows that after his death, a dynastic war between different royal houses began over the newly empty throne. In the tomb of the high official Merka, a stone vessel with the name of a king Sneferka was found. It is unclear whether \\"Sneferka\\" was an alternate name of Qa'a or if he was a separate, ephemeral ruler. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Toby Wilkinson point to a further mysterious ruler named \\"Horus Bird\\", whose name was found on vessel fragments dating to the end of the first dynasty. It is postulated that Sneferka and Horus Bird fought for power and that Hotepsekhemwy ended the fight and finally ascended the throne of Egypt, thus starting the Second Dynasty. Strong clues to that theory are traces of grave robberies and arsons found in the royal tombs of Abydos. Clay seals of Hotepsekhemwy found in Qa'a's tomb suggest that he restored the tomb or buried Qa'a, maybe in an attempt to legitimize his rule. Tomb Map of Qa'a's tomb. Note the subsidiary burial around the main chamber. Qa'a had a fairly large tomb in Abydos which measures 98.5 X 75.5 feet or 30 X 23 meters.Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006 paperback p.25; the tomb is now fully published: Eva-Maria Engel: Das Grab des Qa'a: Architektur und Inventar, Wiesbaden 2017 A long reign is supported by the large size of this ruler's burial site at Abydos. This tomb was excavated by German archaeologists in 1993 and proved to contain 26 satellite (i.e. sacrificial) burials. A seal impression bearing Hotepsekhemwy's name was found near the entrance of the tomb of Qa'a (Tomb Q) by the German Archaeological Institute in the mid-1990s.G. Dreyer et al., MDAIK 52,1996, pp.71-72, fig. 25, pl. 14a The discovery of the seal impression has been interpreted as evidence that Qa'a was buried, and therefore succeeded, by Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the second dynasty of Egypt, as Manetho states. The beautiful tomb stela of Qa'a is now on display at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The tomb of one of Qa'a's state officials at Saqqara—a certain nobleman named Merka—contained a stele with many titles. There is a second Sed festival attested. This fact plus the high quality of a number of royal steles depicting the king implies that Qa'a's reign was a fairly stable and prosperous period of time. A number of year labels have also been discovered dating to his reign at the First Dynasty burial site of Umm el-Qa'ab in Abydos. Qa'a is believed to have ruled Egypt around 2916 BCE. A dish inscribed with the name and titles of Qa'a was discovered in the tomb of Seth-Peribsen (Tomb P of Petrie).B. Porter and R.L.B. Moss.

Abingdon Abingdon in the English county of Oxfordshire (historically Berkshire) claims to be the oldest town in Britain in continuous settlement. Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age remains have been found in and around the town, and evidence of a late-Iron Age enclosure of 33 hectares known as an 'oppidum' was discovered underneath the town centre in 1991. It continued to be used as a town throughout the Roman occupation of Britain and subsequently became a Saxon settlement, named Sevekesham (or Seovechesham) at a time when most other Roman cities were being abandoned. Abingdon Abbey which gave the town its present name was founded in the seventh century. Amesbury Amesbury along with Stonehenge in Wiltshire is claimed to be Britain's oldest settlement, dating back to 8820 BC according to a project led by the University of Buckingham. The place is said to have been a transport point with the River Avon acting as a transit route. Evidence of frogs' legs being eaten as well as 31,000 flints and animal bones have also been found. Colchester Colchester claims to be Britain's oldest recorded town. Its claim is based on a reference by Pliny the Elder, the Roman writer, in his Natural History (Historia Naturalis) in 77 AD. He described Anglesey as \\"about from Camulodunum, a town in Britain\\", where Camulodunum was the Roman name for Colchester. It is claimed that this is the first known reference to any named settlement in Britain, although coins minted by Tasciovanus mention the Celtic name of the settlement, Camulodunon, as early as 20-10 BC.

Although there are scattered settlement sites, burials and artefacts in Colchester from between the fifth and ninth centuries ADFaulkner, Neil (1994). \\"Late Roman Colchester\\", in Oxford Journal of Archaeology 13(1) there is a debate over whether it could be called a “town” in this period (see ). Aside from a ninth-century reference by Nennius to a Caer Colun, the first time Colchester is explicitly mentioned in written accounts is an entry for 917 AD in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, when it is recorded that King Edward the Elder led a Saxon army from Surrey, Kent and Essex to recapture the town from a Danish army that had been encamped there since the mid to late ninth century. It is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network.Most Ancient European Towns Network at Internet Archive. Accessed 2 August 2015 Ipswich The claim of Ipswich, the county town of the English county of Suffolk, is to be the 'oldest English town', and is made in a quite specific sense. Within the Borough boundaries of modern Ipswich, and in its vicinity, there is plentiful evidence of Lower Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic, Neolithic, other prehistoric, Roman and Migration Age occupation. But the claim of Ipswich is grounded upon the fact that it never was an Iron Age or Romano-British town, but at its core was and is the oldest still continuing town to have been established and developed by the English. It has an unbroken history of community as a town since early Anglo-Saxon times. In this claim, *by 'oldest' is meant 'first originated or established', and also 'still continuing and existing on that site': *by 'English' is meant 'established (as a town) and occupied by peoples collectively identified by their use of the Old English language' (subsuming the various migrant and native peoples who coalesced in the area now called England during the 5th to 7th centuries): *by 'town' is meant, originating as a densely-occupied non-rural community comprising a full range of specialized trades and occupations, with its own industrial and domestic components, serviced by a market-place and forming a centre for mercantile activity, provisioned externally from its hinterland, and so necessarily having had some form of local governance or official organization: a town-like component related economically and politically to a wider region of agrarian occupation under a single power or collective identity. During the Migration age Germanic customs, the roots of the English language and the distinctive industrial arts and construction techniques of the northern continent were transplanted into eastern Britain. Industrial activity ceased to follow Roman models of organized provincial distribution, but (in the absence of a money currency) reflected more localized needs, or else communications between grand households and patrons. The emergence of regional powers and kingdoms was accompanied by the growth of Emporia, or regional trading-centres for the production, import and export of goods, with attendant service communities. Ipswich (Gipeswic, Yepiswyche, etc.) (in the historic Kingdom of East Anglia) is thought to have been comparable to early Hamwic, a forerunner of modern Southampton (in the historic Kingdom of Wessex), emerging as a primary community serving the kingdom's trade activity towards the Rhine (comparably to Dorestad) through the 7th and 8th centuries, as Hamwih served the north French sea routes to Quentovic. Modern Southampton however did not develop with the site of Hamwih as its centre. In Ipswich it has been shown that ancient routes linked the 7th century quayside, river-crossing and early market and pottery-making areas, which grew rapidly, enclosing a burial-ground in their midst. In the 8th century a planned grid of streets grew up over the cemetery site between the older roads, uniting the expanding districts. Dense Middle-Saxon structures fronted directly onto the made-up streets. The Viking Age ramparts erected around 900 A.D. enclosed some 52 hectares of settlement but fell well within the area already developed. In the same period a new more spacious reconstruction occurred upon the same grid, with cellared houses and surrounding yards. These streets remain the principal streets and lanes of modern Ipswich, and it is not thought that the community has ever been abandoned or deserted. The 'city' denomination of both London and York rests partly upon the importance of their Roman antecedents, and as two of the principal seats of Christian bishops in late Roman Britain. Gildas stated that trade was busy in London in his time (540s), and in the 7th century it was focused at the Anglo-Saxon centre of Aldwych. But neither these, nor anything that has been shown from the ruins of the abandoned Roman Colonia of Colchester, can be taken to represent the formation of a new township along distinctively early English principles. Ipswich makes that claim. Thatcham Thatcham in Berkshire is often said to be the oldest town in Britain, since its occupation can be traced back to a mesolithic hunting camp, which was discovered there beside a Post-glacial rebound period lake, and there is evidence of human occupation within and around Thatcham covering the past 13,000 years or more. There is strong evidence to support the case that people settled in Thatcham in the Mesolithic Age (10,000 BC – 4,000 BC). Thatcham has strong evidence that it was settled by the Romans, then Saxons, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Subsequently, it received medieval charters. Thatcham has a place in the 1990 Guinness World Records as being the strongest claimant to the longest continually inhabited settlement in the UK. It is mentioned in the 1993 Guinness World Records book as an example of a place with early prehistoric occupation with a comment on the difficulty of showing continuous habitation.

Birth and early life  Kopu was raised in Opotiki. Her family was not wealthy, and Kopu characterised her youth as containing \\"much hardship\\". In 1978, her family moved to Sydney, Australia. In Australia, Kopu became involved with community programs aimed at drug users and prostitutes, something that she continued after arriving back in New Zealand in 1986. Kopu also had considerable involvement in rehabilitation programs for criminals.  Political life  In addition to this work, Kopu was also involved in various Māori cultural and educational programs. She quickly joined Mana Motuhake, a political party based around promoting Māori interests and welfare. When Mana Motuhake joined with several other groups to establish the Alliance, Kopu became involved in the new organization. In the 1993 election, she stood as its candidate for the Eastern Māori, but was unsuccessful. In the 1996 election, the first to be conducted under the new MMP system, Kopu contested the Te Tai Rawhiti seat, and was ranked twelfth on the Alliance list. While she did not win Te Tai Rawhiti, the Alliance received enough votes for Kopu to enter parliament as a list MP. Kopu gradually came under increasing criticism, having been unemployed for nearly two decades prior to her lucrative appointment as an MP and the 'backdoor' manner in which she was seen as having attained that position. This was compounded by her apparent lack of participation – many Alliance colleagues complained that she was rarely seen in Parliament, and believed that she was not doing sufficient work. Other causes of criticism stemmed from internal tensions between different factions of Mana Motuhake. Kopu resented the criticism, and voiced the possibility of leaving the Alliance. In July 1997, Kopu finally resigned from her party. In a televised statement, she refused to talk in English and, speaking in Maori, blamed racist discrimination for her predicament, going as far as stating that \\"apartheid is alive and well in New Zealand\\". When parliamentary services entered her electorate office it was missing furniture earlier allocated to her. The police carried out an investigation and recovered the missing material. No charges were laid against Kopu. The issue was also of particular relevance due to her status as a list MP – she had been elected to parliament by virtue of her position on the Alliance list, not through any votes she had received personally, and as such, many believed that Kopu had no right to remain in parliament. Moreover, Kopu (like all other Alliance MPs) had previously signed a pledge affirming that if she ever left the party, she would resign from parliament. Kopu had, in fact, reaffirmed this pledge only a few days before she quit. The leader of the Alliance, Jim Anderton, said that Kopu's actions \\"breach[ed] every standard of morality and ethics that are known\\". Kopu defended her decision by saying that she was only doing what was best for Māori. Upon leaving the Alliance, she also received strong support from several other Māori MPs, notably Tau Henare of the New Zealand First party. Henare, who had often criticised the Alliance's (and Mana Motuhake's) approach to Māori affairs, said that Kopu was welcome to join New Zealand First, although this was later rejected by other members of the party. Kopu quickly aligned herself with the governing coalition. A hearing of parliament's privileges committee found that Kopu had not resigned from parliament, and that her pledge to the Alliance did not constitute a constructive resignation. Privileges Committee findings The dispute led to the introduction of legislation, the Electoral Integrity Act (2001) preventing what became known as waka jumping.  Independence  After spending some time as an independent, Kopu decided to establish her own political party, Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata. When she launched the party in October 1997, Kopu claimed to have 6,000 members.The Press, Christchurch 23 October 1997 The party was ostensibly based on promoting the welfare of Māori women. Many of Kopu's critics, however, claimed that the party was established primarily to ensure Kopu received more generous parliamentary funding. Mana Wahine became significant when, in 1999, the governing National Party found itself reliant on Mana Wahine's support (along with that of various former New Zealand First MPs). National, left with a precarious majority when its coalition with New Zealand First collapsed, needed as much support as it could find, and managed to obtain Kopu's backing. In the 1999 election, Kopu stood as her party's candidate in the Waiariki electorate. Eleven other Mana Wahine candidates also stood. The party had also intended to submit a party list, but Kopu failed to submit it before the deadline - stating herself that she missed the deadline by mere minutes. This eliminated the possibility of Kopu remaining in parliament as a list MP – she would need to win her electorate race in order to keep her seat. In the election, however, Kopu won only 1.7% of the vote in Waiariki, placing sixth. Moreover, the national vote for Mana Wahine candidates indicated that Kopu would not have been returned as a list MP in any case. Kopu lost her parliamentary seat.

It is on the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, close to the centre of Ireland's highest mountain range, MacGillycuddy's Reeks. Carrauntoohil is composed mainly of sandstone, whose glaciation produced distinctive features on the mountain such as the Eagle's Nest corrie and some deep gullies and sharp arêtes in its east and northeastern faces that are popular with rock and winter climbers. As Ireland's highest mountain, Carrauntoohil is popular with mountain walkers, who most commonly ascend via the Devil's Ladder route; however, Carrauntoohil is also climbed as part of longer mountain walking routes in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range, including the Coomloughra Horseshoe or the MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk of the entire mountain range. Carrauntoohil, and most of the range, is held in private ownership and is not part of any Irish national park; however, reasonable access is granted to the public for recreational use. Geology Carrauntoohil is composed of sandstone particles of various sizes which are collectively known as Old Red Sandstone. Old Red Sandstone has a purple-reddish colour (stained green in places), and has virtually no fossils; it dates from the Devonian period (410 to 350 million years ago) when Ireland was in a hot equatorial climate. The sedimentary rocks of the Iveragh Peninsula are composed of three layers that are up to thick (in ascending order): Lough Acoose Formation, Chloritic Sandstone Formation, and the Ballinskelligs Sandstone Formation. Carrauntoohil was later subject to significant glaciation during the last ice age, the result of which is deep fracturing of the rock, and the surrounding of Carrauntoohil by U-shaped valleys, sharp arêtes, and deep corries. Geography Looking directly at Carrauntoohil's Eagle's Nest corrie (in shade), surrounded by Carrauntoohil (left), The Bones and the Beenkeragh Ridge (centre, back), Beenkeragh (right), and the Hag's Tooth, and the Hag's Tooth Ridge up to Beenkeragh (right). The three levels of the Eagle's Nest corrie can be clearly seen. Carrauntoohil is the central peak of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range, and has three major ridges. A narrow rocky ridge, or arête, to the north, known as the Beenkeragh Ridge, contains the summit of The Bones (Na Cnámha), and leads to Ireland's second-highest peak, Beenkeragh (Binn Chaorach) at . The ridge westward, called the Caher Ridge, also an arête, leads to Ireland's third-highest peak, Caher at . A third and much wider unnamed south-easterly ridge, or spur, leads down to a col where sits the top of the Devil's Ladder (the classic access route for Carrauntoohil from the Hag's Glen), but then rises back up to Cnoc na Toinne , from which the long easterly ridge section of MacGillycuddy's Reeks is accessed. Carrauntoohil overlooks three U-shaped valleys, each of which containing their own lakes. To the east of Carrauntoohil is the Hag's Glen (), to the west is Coomloughra (), and to the south is Curragh More (). Carrauntoohil has a deep corrie, known as the Eagle's Nest, at its north-east face, which is accessed from the Hag's Glen, and rises up through three levels. At the top, the third level, is Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake. The Eagle's Nest gives views of the gullies on Carrauntoohil's north-east face: Curved Gully, Central Gully, and Brother O'Shea's Gully. Sometimes the term Eagle's Nest is used to refer to the small stone Mountain Rescue Hut that sits on the first level of the corrie, where the Heavenly Gates descent gully meets the Eagle's Nest corrie. Carrauntoohil is the highest mountain in Ireland on all classification scales. It is the 133rd- highest mountain, and 4th most prominent mountain, in Britain and Ireland, on the Simms classification. Carrauntoohil is regarded by the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) as one of 34 Furths, which are defined as mountains above in elevation and meeting the SMC criteria for a Munro (i.e. \\"sufficient separation\\"), and which are outside (or furth), of Scotland; this is why Carrauntoohil is also referred to as one of the thirteen Irish Munros. Carrauntoohil's larger prominence qualifies it to meet the P600 classification and the Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification. Carrauntoohil is the highest mountain in the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains. Summit The summit of Carrauntoohil In the 1950s, a wooden cross was erected on the summit, a privately owned commonage, by the local community. In 1976, the wooden cross was replaced by a steel cross. In 2014, the cross was cut down by unknown persons in protest against the Catholic Church, but it was re-erected shortly after. Because of the dangers of the steep north-eastern and eastern faces of Carrauntoohil, the Kerry Mountain Rescue Team (KMRT) have placed danger signs on the summit, and particularly above the Howling Ridge sector (the ridge between the north-east and east faces), whose initial section can be mistaken for a hill-walkers descent route. Naming Carrauntoohil is the most common and official spelling of the name, being the only version in use by Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Placenames Database of Ireland, and by Irish academic Paul Tempan, compiler of the Irish Hill and Mountain Names database (2010). Carrauntoohill has also been used in the past, for example by Irish historian Patrick Weston Joyce in 1870. Other less common spelling variations have included Carrantoohil, Carrantouhil, Carrauntouhil and Carrantuohill; all of which are anglicisations of the Irish placename. Paul Tempan's Irish Hill and Mountain Names database notes that \\"its name is shrouded in uncertainty\\", and that \\"Unlike some lesser peaks, such as Mangerton or Croagh Patrick, it is not mentioned in any surviving early Irish texts\\". The official Irish name is Corrán Tuathail, which Tempan notes is interpreted as \\"Tuathal's sickle\\", Tuathal being a male first name. Patrick Weston Joyce previously interpreted it as \\"inverted sickle\\", translating from the Irish language term \\"tuathail\\" meaning left- handed but according to PWJ, \\"is applied to everything reversed from its proper direction\\". From yet another perspective, one of the earliest written accounts of the mountain by Isaac Weld in 1812, calls it Gheraun-Tuel, and Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) calls it Garran Tual; suggesting the first element was géarán (\\"fang\\")—which is found in the names of other Kerry mountains—and that the earlier name may have been Géarán Tuathail (\\"Tuathal's fang\\"). Ownership The climber and author Jim Ryan noted in his 2006 book Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy’s Reeks that the actual mountain of Carrauntoohil, including most of the Hag's Glen, is in private ownership. The freehold is owned by four families: Donal Doona, John O'Shea, John B. Doona, and James Sullivan. Their great-grandfathers bought the land from the Irish Land Commission, \\"paying the sum of eleven shillings and two pence (70 in today's money), twice a year for many decades\\". Ryan's book commended the owners for providing access over the years, despite damage to their farms. A state-sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles. Unlike many other national mountain ranges, MacGillycuddy's Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure, and are instead completely privately owned. The ownership situation has raised concerns in light of the material rise in visitors to Carrauntoohil (and the range in general), and the erosion and lack of infrastructure that other state-owned sites have been able to address. In 2019 the Irish Times reported that the MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Forum, a cross-body group of landowners, commercial users and public access and walking groups set up in 2014 with the aim of \\"protecting, managing and sustainably developing the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks mountain range, while halting and reversing the obvious and worsening path erosion\\", had achieved some success laying down new pathways in the Hag's Glen approach to Carrauntoohil; however, the Irish Times still wondered, \\"Should the Kerry reeks be a national park?\\" Recreation =Visitors= Separate statistics do not exist for visitors or ascensions of the stand-alone peak of Carrauntoohil, however, it was recorded that over 125,000 accessed the range in 2017, and 140,000 accessed the range in 2018, the majority of which are related to Carrauntoohil. The attraction of the mountain has led to many accidents and fatalities over the years, and by the 50th anniversary of the KMRT in 2017, they recorded having attended more than 40 fatalities in the range noting that many were \\"in the immediate Carrauntoohil area\\". Accidents on the mountain have been attributed to bad weather, late departures combined with darkness on the way down and falling rocks in eroded areas. =Mountain walking= Carrauntoohil (r) from Hag's Glen, with the Devil's Ladder path to the col between Carrauntoohil (r) and Cnoc na Toinne (l) visible in the distance The straightforward route is via the Devil's Ladder, which starts at Cronin's Yard () in the north-east, moves into the Hag's Glen, continues along between Lough Gouragh and Lough Calee, until the Devil's Ladder, a worn path from the glen to the col between Carrauntoohil and Cnoc na Toinne is visible. No special climbing equipment is needed, but caution is advised as the Devil's Ladder has become unstable with overuse; alternatives to the ladder include the Bothar na Gige Zig Zag track (the north-east spur of Cnoc na Toinne ). The full route back to Cronin's Yard is and takes 4–5 hours. Other popular, but more serious, routes to Carrauntoohil from the Hag's Glen are via the Hag's Tooth Ridge up to Beenkeragh, and then across the Beenkeragh Ridge to Carrauntoohil; or via the Eagle's Nest route to Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake, and up to the summit via Brother O'Shea's Gully or Curved Gully. Heavenly Gates on the east face. The 450 metre Howling Ridge rock-climb starts at the Heavenly Gates. Instead of descending via the Devil's Ladder, some climbers use a route known as the Heavenly Gates, which starts above the col of the Devil's Ladder but takes a small stone path that cuts across the east-face of Carrauntoohil, through a narrow gap, known as the Heavenly Gates (see photo), and then heads diagonally down a deep gully to the base of the first level of the Eagle's Nest corrie, where the Mountain Rescue Hut is situated. This route, however, is hazardous, difficult to find as it is not marked, and particularly dangerous in poor visibility; it has been the source of several serious accidents on Carrauntoohil. Climbing up Brother O'Shea's Gully with the Eagle's Nest (third level), and Lough Cummeenoughter below. A strenuous undertaking is the Coomloughra Horseshoe, which takes 6–8 hours and is described as \\"one of Ireland’s classic ridge walks\\". It starts from the north-west up the Hydro-Track (), and is usually done clockwise, first climbing Skregmore , and then to Beenkeragh , across the famous Beenkeragh Ridge, at the centre of which is The Bones , and on to the summit of Carrauntoohil itself. The horseshoe is completed by continuing to Caher , Caher West Top , and descending to the starting point. Carrauntoohil is also climbed as part of the full MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk, a 12- to 14-hour, traverse of the entire Reeks range. =Rock and winter climbing= Eagle's Nest and Lough Cummenoughter in winter Although the Reeks are not particularly known for their advanced rock climbing (e.g. unlike Ailladie in Clare, or Fair Head in Antrim), the east face of Carrauntoohil, looking into the Hag's Glen, and the north-east face, looking into Brothers O'Shea's Gully, have a number of multi-pitch, mixed route, rock climbing routes. The most well-known is the Howling Ridge (climbing grade Very Difficult, or V-Diff), which starts at the base of the gap of Heavenly Gates, and takes the arête between Carrauntoohil's east and north-east faces. These same east and north- east faces are also used for winter climbing, conditions permitting, and seven routes of climbing grade V are marked amongst almost eighty routes in total.

The sunrise problem can be expressed as follows: \\"What is the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow?\\" The sunrise problem illustrates the difficulty of using probability theory when evaluating the plausibility of statements or beliefs. According to the Bayesian interpretation of probability, probability theory can be used to evaluate the plausibility of the statement, \\"The sun will rise tomorrow.\\" We just need a hypothetical random process that determines whether the sun will rise tomorrow or not. Based on past observations, we can infer the parameters of this random process, and from there evaluate the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow.  One sun, many days  The sunrise problem was first introduced in the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace, who treated it by means of his rule of succession.Chung, K. L. & AitSahlia, F. (2003). Elementary probability theory: with stochastic processes and an introduction to mathematical finance. Springer. pp. 129–130. . Let p be the long-run frequency of sunrises, i.e., the sun rises on 100 × p% of days. Prior to knowing of any sunrises, one is completely ignorant of the value of p. Laplace represented this prior ignorance by means of a uniform probability distribution on p. Thus the probability that p is between 20% and 50% is just 30%. This must not be interpreted to mean that in 30% of all cases, p is between 20% and 50%. Rather, it means that one's state of knowledge (or ignorance) justifies one in being 30% sure that the sun rises between 20% of the time and 50% of the time. Given the value of p, and no other information relevant to the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow, the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow is p. But we are not \\"given the value of p\\". What we are given is the observed data: the sun has risen every day on record. Laplace inferred the number of days by saying that the universe was created about 6000 years ago, based on a young-earth creationist reading of the Bible. To find the conditional probability distribution of p given the data, one uses Bayes theorem, which some call the Bayes–Laplace rule. Having found the conditional probability distribution of p given the data, one may then calculate the conditional probability, given the data, that the sun will rise tomorrow. That conditional probability is given by the rule of succession. The plausibility that the sun will rise tomorrow increases with the number of days on which the sun has risen so far. Specifically, assuming p has an a-priori distribution that is uniform over the interval [0,1], and that, given the value of p, the sun independently rises each day with probability p, the desired conditional probability is: : \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Sun rises tomorrow} \\\\mid \\\\text{It has risen } k \\\\text{ times previously}) = \\\\frac{\\\\int_0^1 p^{k+1}\\\\,dp}{\\\\int_0^1 p^k \\\\,dp}= \\\\frac{k+1}{k+2}. By this formula, if one has observed the sun rising 10000 times previously, the probability it rises the next day is 10001/10002 \\\\approx 0.99990002. Expressed as a percentage, this is approximately a 99.990002 \\\\% chance. However, Laplace recognized this to be a misapplication of the rule of succession through not taking into account all the prior information available immediately after deriving the result: Jaynes & Bretthorst note that Laplace's warning had gone unheeded by workers in the field.ch 18, pp 387–391 of Jaynes, E. T. & Bretthorst, G. L. (2003). Probability Theory: The Logic of Science. Cambridge University Press. A reference class problem arises: the plausibility inferred will depend on whether we take the past experience of one person, of humanity, or of the earth. A consequence is that each referent would hold different plausibility of the statement. In Bayesianism, any probability is a conditional probability given what one knows. That varies from one person to another.  One day, many suns  Alternatively, one could say that a sun is selected from all the possible stars every day, being the star that one sees in the morning. The plausibility of the \\"sun will rise tomorrow\\" (i.e., the probability of that being true) will then be the proportion of stars that do not \\"die\\", e.g., by becoming novae, and so failing to \\"rise\\" on their planets (those that still exist, irrespective of the probability that there may then be none, or that there may then be no observers). One faces a similar reference class problem: which sample of stars should one use. All the stars? The stars with the same age as the sun? The same size? Mankind's knowledge of star formations will naturally lead one to select the stars of same age and size, and so on, to resolve this problem. In other cases, one's lack of knowledge of the underlying random process then makes the use of Bayesian reasoning less useful. Less accurate, if the knowledge of the possibilities is very unstructured, thereby necessarily having more nearly uniform prior probabilities (by the principle of indifference). Less certain too, if there are effectively few subjective prior observations, and thereby a more nearly minimal total of pseudocounts, giving fewer effective observations, and so a greater estimated variance in expected value, and probably a less accurate estimate of that value.

The settlement of Okuru is located on the coast south-west of Haast. The rarest subspecies of kiwi, the Haast tokoeka, is only found in the mountains of the Haast region. History European settlement of the area dates back to the 1870s. The remoteness of the area initially limited access to seagoing vessels, with some rough tracks from the north and east. The present Haast township was originally a New Zealand Ministry of Works road construction camp, which expanded into a permanent township when the opening of the Haast Pass in 1962 made the region more accessible. The road through the pass to Wanaka was upgraded in 1966.A Wheel on Each Corner, The History of the IPENZ Transportation Group 1956-2006 - Douglass, Malcolm; IPENZ Transportation Group, 2006, Page 12 In 1990 the Haast area was included as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, giving international recognition as a location of significant natural value to Te Wahipounamu - The South West New Zealand World Heritage Area.

The civilian model Ju 86B could carry ten passengers. Two were delivered to Swissair and five to Deutsche Luft Hansa. In addition a single civilian Ju 86Z was delivered to Sweden's AB Aerotransport.\\"Tp 9 - Junkers Ju 86Z-7 (1940-1958).\\" Avrosys.nu. Retrieved: 23 July 2009. Design and development In 1934, a specification for a modern twin-engined aircraft, capable of operating both as a high-speed airliner for the German airline Luft Hansa and as a medium bomber for the nascent Luftwaffe, was issued to both Junkers and Heinkel. Five prototypes were ordered from each company; the Junkers Ju 86 and Heinkel He 111.Green and Swanborough 1982, p. 15. Junkers' design was a low-winged twin-engined monoplane, of all-metal stressed skin construction. Unlike most of Junkers' previous designs, it discarded the typical corrugated skinning in favour of smooth metal skinning which helped to reduce drag. The craft was fitted with a narrow track retractable-main gear conventional undercarriage with a fixed tailwheel, and twin fins and rudders. It was intended to be powered by Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, which although heavy, gave better fuel consumption than conventional petrol engines.Smith and Kay 1972, pp. 370–371. Ju 86 cutaway diagram The only complete Junkers Ju 86 remaining (1976) The design featured the distinctive Junkers doppelflügel control surfaces on the wing, similar to those on the Junkers Ju 52. These were hinged below the wing's trailing edge, with the outboard section on each side functioning as an aileron, and the inner section functioning as a wing flap. The bomber aircraft had a crew of four; a pilot, navigator, radio operator/bombardier and gunner. Defensive armament consisted of three machine guns, situated at the nose; at a dorsal position; and within a retractable ventral position. Bombs were carried vertically in four fuselage cells behind the cockpit.Green and Swanborough 1982, p. 18. The airliner version replaced the bomb cells with seating for ten passengers, with fuel tanks being moved from the fuselage to the wings. Jumo 205s were unavailable when the first prototype airframe was completed. Instead, the bomber- configured Ju 86ab1 was fitted with Siemens SAM 22 radial engines and flew for the first time on 4 November 1934. The second prototype, also a bomber, flew in January 1935. The third Ju 86, the first civil prototype, flew on 4 April 1935.Green and Swanborough 1982, p. 17. Production of pre-series military and civil aircraft started in late 1935, with full production of the Ju 86A-1 bomber commencing in April 1936. Production quickly switched to the improved Ju 86D with a modified tail cone to improve stability.Green and Swanborough 1982, p. 19. Early use of the Jumo-powered Ju 86 bomber in the Spanish Civil War showed that it was inferior to the He 111, with the diesel engines being unsuitable for rough treatment during combat;Dressel and Griel 1994, p.22. and production plans were cut back. One Ju 86 had already been converted to use radial engines as a testbed for possible export versions, and this showed improved reliability. Production switched to a version powered by the BMW 132 engine, the Ju 86E, with production continuing until 1938.Green and Swanborough 1982, pp. 27–28. Civil variants, introduced in 1936, were designated Ju 86Z in three different models differing in their engines. The Jumo-engined Ju 86Z-1 (corresponding to the former B-0 or C-1) was sold to Swissair (one), Airlines of Australia (one), and LAN-Chile (three). The BMW 132H-powered Ju 86Z-2 was sold to DLH (two) and the para-military Manchukuo Air Transport (five or more). The Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet-engined Ju 86Z-7 was delivered to AB Aerotransport (ABA) of Sweden (one, for use as a mail carrier), Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (three), and South African Airways - SAA - (17). The ABA aircraft was later transferred to the Swedish Air Force, with which it served, under the designation Tp 9, until 1958. South African Airways' original intention was to have its Ju 86s powered by 745 hp Rolls- Royce Kestrels. Six aircraft for SAA, flown with these engines, were refitted with Hornets before delivery, and the remainder were also Hornet-powered. Hungarian Ju-86K-2's, 1941 The Ju 86K was an export model, also built under license in Sweden by Saab as the B 3 with (905 hp) Bristol Mercury XIX radial engines. Several aircraft remained in service with the Swedish Air Force until 1958.\\"B 3 - Junkers Ju 86K (1936-1958).\\" Avrosys.nu. Retrieved: 23 July 2009.

Operational history A Ju 86P high- altitude reconnaissance aircraft, with Jumo 207 turbocharged diesel powerplants. The bomber was field-tested in the Spanish Civil War, where it proved inferior to the He 111. Four Ju 86D-1s arrived in Spain in early February 1937, but after a few sorties one of them was shot down on 23 February by Republican fighters with the loss of three crewmen killed and one captured. A replacement aircraft was sent from Germany, but in the summer of 1937 another was lost in an accident, and the three remaining aircraft were sold to the Nationalist air forces. Ju 86s were again used in the 1939 invasion of Poland, but retired soon after. In January 1940, the Luftwaffe tested the prototype Ju 86P with a longer wingspan, pressurized cabin, Junkers Jumo 207A-1 turbocharged two-stroke, opposed-piston diesel engines and a two- man crew. The Ju 86P could fly at heights of 12,000 m (39,000 ft) and higher on occasion, where it was felt to be safe from enemy fighters. The British Westland Welkin and Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9PD were developed specifically to counter this threat.James 1982, p. 115. At the outbreak of the Second World War, South Africa's Ju 86Zs were militarised and armed as bombers with defensive guns and external bomb racks. These aircraft were initially used for coastal patrols along with the sole Ju 86K-1, playing an important role in the interception of the German blockade runner SS Watussi in December 1939. In May 1940, they were used to re-equip No. 12 Squadron SAAF, which was deployed in the East African Campaign from June 1940. It flew its first bombing missions on 14 June 1940.Green 1968, p. 41. As more modern aircraft became available, the South African Ju 86s were passed from squadron to squadron, seeing their last use with No. 22 Squadron SAAF, which used it along with the Avro Anson in the coastal reconnaissance role, finally retiring its Ju 86s in September 1942.Green 1968, p. 42. Satisfied with the trials of the new Ju 86P prototype, the Luftwaffe ordered that some 40 older-model bombers be converted to Ju 86P-1 high-altitude bombers and Ju 86P-2 photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Those operated successfully for some years over Britain, the Soviet Union and North Africa. In August 1942, a modified Supermarine Spitfire V shot one down over Egypt at an altitude of some 14,500 m (49,000 ft); when two more were lost, Ju 86Ps were withdrawn from service in 1943. Junkers developed the Ju 86R for the Luftwaffe, using larger wings and new engines capable of even higher altitudes - up to 16,000 m (52,500 ft) - but production was limited to prototypes. Surviving aircraft The only remaining complete Junkers Ju 86, displayed at the Swedish Air Force Museum Only one Junkers Ju 86 is known to exist today. The aircraft was built in Germany and sold to Sweden in 1938. Before it was retired from Swedish service in 1958, the aircraft was used in the 1955 movie Des Teufels General.

The khanate covered contemporary Tatarstan, Mari El, Chuvashia, Mordovia, and parts of Udmurtia and Bashkortostan; its capital was the city of Kazan. It was one of the successor states of the Golden Horde, and it came to an end when it was conquered by the Tsardom of Russia. Geography and population The territory of the khanate comprised the Muslim Bulgar-populated lands of the Bolğar, Cükätäw, Kazan, and Qaşan duchies and other regions that originally belonged to Volga Bulgaria. The Volga, Kama and Vyatka were the main rivers of the khanate, as well as the major trade ways. The majority of the population were Kazan Tatars. Their self-identity was not restricted to Tatars; many identified themselves simply as Muslims or as \\"the people of Kazan\\". Islam was the state religion. The local feudal nobility consisted of ethnic Bulgars, but the court and body guard of the Kazan khans were composed of steppe Tatar (Kipchaks, and later of Nogais) that lived in Kazan. According to the Ginghizide tradition, the local Turkic tribes were also called Tatars by the steppe nobility and, later, by the Russian elite. Part of the higher nobility hailed from the Golden Horde. It included members of four leading noble families: Arghin, Barin, Qipchaq, and Shirin. Peoples subject to the khan included the Chuvash, Mari, Mordva, Mishar Tatars, Udmurt, and Bashkir. The Permians and some of the Komi tribes were also incorporated into the Khanate. The Mishars had arrived during the period of the Golden Horde and gradually assimilated the resident Finnic Mordvins and Burtas. Their territory was governed by former steppe Tatars. Some Mishar duchies were never controlled from Kazan and instead gravitated towards the Qasim Khanate or Muscovite Russia. Most of the khanate territory was covered by forests, and only the southern part adjoined the steppe. The main population of the steppes were the nomadic Manghites, also known as Nogais, who sometimes recognized the rule of the Kazan khan, but more often raided agricultural Tatars and Chuvash, as they had done in the Golden Horde period. Later, Nogais were transplanted and replaced with Kalmyks. More recently, this area was settled by Tatars, Chuvash and Russians, who erected defensive walls to guard the southern border. Since the khanate was established, Tatar Cossack troops defended the khanate from the Nogais. Russian sources indicate that at least five languages were used in the Kazan khanate. The first and foremost was the Tatar language, including the Middle dialect of the Kazan Tatars and the Western dialect of the Mishars. Its written form (Old Tatar language) was the favoured language of the state. The Chuvash language was a descendant of the Bolgar language, spoken by the pagan Chuvash people. The Bolgar language also strongly influenced the Middle dialect of Tatar language. The other three were probably the Mari language, the Mordvin languages and the Bashkir language, likewise developed from the Bolgar and Kipchak languages. History The former territories of Volga Bulgaria (Kazan Ulus or Kazan Duchy) may have regained a degree of independence within the disintegrating Golden Horde by the turn of the 15th century. The principality was self-governed and maintained a dynasty of Bolgar rulers. Whatever the status of this proto-state, the founder of the khanate was Ulugh Muhammad, who assumed the title of khan and usurped the throne of Kazan with some help from local nobility in 1437 or 1438. It has been suggested that the transfer of power from the local Bolgar dynasty to Muhammad was finalized by his son Maxmud in 1445. Throughout its history, the khanate was prone to civil turmoil and struggles for the throne. The khans were replaced 19 times in 115 years. There were a total of fifteen reigning khans, some ascending the throne multiple times. The Khan was often elected from the Gengizides by vernacular nobility and even by the citizens themselves. Regarding the history of the khanate, there is a scarcity of sources. Not only no single document of the khanate survived the Russian conquest, but even the documents of early Russian colonial administration (Prikaz Kazanskogo Dvortsa) were all destroyed during the Time of Troubles. =Early history= During the reign of Ulugh Muhammad and his son Maxmud, Kazan forces raided Muscovy and its subject lands several times. Vasily II of Moscow engaged in the Great Feudal War against his cousins, was defeated in a battle near Suzdal, and was forced to pay ransom to the Kazan khan. In July 1487, Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow occupied Kazan and seated a puppet leader, Möxämmädämin, on the Kazan throne. After that, the Kazan Khanate became a protectorate of Moscow, and Russian merchants were allowed to trade freely throughout its territory. Supporters of a union between the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate tried to exploit the population's grievances to provoke revolts (in 1496, 1500, and 1505), but with negligible results. In 1521, Kazan emerged from the dominance of Moscow, concluding a mutual aid treaty with the Astrakhan Khanate, the Crimean Khanate and the Nogay Horde. The combined forces of khan Muhamed Giray and his Crimean allies then attacked Muscovy. =The final decade= Map of the Khanate of Kazan, 1540s The reinforcement of Crimea displeased the pro- Moscow elements of the Kazan Khanate, and some of these noblemen provoked a revolt in 1545. The result was the deposition of Safa Giray. A Moscow supporter, Şahğäli, occupied the throne. Following that year, Moscow organized several campaigns to impose control over Kazan, but the attempts were unsuccessful. With the help of the Nogays, Safa Giray returned to the throne. He executed 75 noblemen, and the rest of his opposition escaped to Russia. In 1549 he died, and his 3-year-old son Ütämeşgäräy was recognized as khan. His regent and the de facto ruler of the khanate was his mother Söyembikä. The administration of the ulan Qoşçaq gained a degree of independence under her rule. At that time Safa Giray's relatives (including Devlet I Giray) were in Crimea. Their invitation to the throne of Kazan was vitiated by a large portion of vernacular nobility. Under Qoşçaq's government relations with Russia continued to worsen. A group of disgruntled noblemen at the beginning of 1551 invited a supporter of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, Şahğäli, for the second time. At the same time the lands to the east of the Volga River (Taw yağı) were ceded to Russia. Ütämeşgäräy, along with his mother, was sent to a Moscow prison. Şahğäli occupied the Kazan throne until February 1552. Anti-Moscow elements in the Kazan government exiled Şahğäli and invited the Astrakhan prince Yadegar Mokhammad, along with the Nogays, to aid them. =Downfall= In August 1552, forces of Ivan the Terrible, operating from the Russian castle of Sviyazhsk, laid siege to Kazan. The Russians defeated the Tatar inland troops, burnt Archa and some castles. On October 3, after two months of siege and destruction of the citadel walls, the Russians entered the city. Some defenders managed to escape but most were put to the sword. Yadegar Moxammad was imprisoned and the population was slaughtered. The Kazan Chronicle reports about 110,000 killed, both civilians and garrison. After the fall of Kazan, territories such as Udmurtia and Bashkortostan joined Russia without a conflict. The administration of the khanate was wiped out; pro-Moscow and neutral nobles kept their lands, but others were executed. Tatars were then resettled far away from rivers, roads and Kazan. Free lands were settled by Russians and sometimes by pro-Russian Tatars. Orthodox bishops such as Germogen forcibly baptized many Tatars. =Resistance= Part of the population continued to resist Russian rule until 1556. Rebel governments were formed in Chalem and Mishatamaq, but as the Nogays under Ğäli Äkräm often raided the agricultural population, the coalition went to ruin. After a brutal repression against the Kazan rebels, their commanders were executed. By some estimates, the population of the former khanate declined by several thousands during the wars. The administration, known as the Kazan Palace's Office undertook the forced Russification and Christianization of the Tatars and other peoples. The term Tsardom of Kazan was in use until 1708 when the Kazan Governorate was formed. Economics Whether the khanate had its own flag is still unclear. Nevertheless, the Dutchman Carlus (Carel) Allard noted that Caesar of Tataria used two flags, and Zilant was pictured on the first. The Khanate's urban population produced clay ware, wood and metal handiworks, leather, armor, ploughs and jewels. The major cities included Qazan, Arça, Cükätaw, Qaşan, Çallı, Alat and Cöri. The urban population also traded with the people of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia. In the 16th century, Russia became the main trading partner of Kazan, and the khanate shared the economic system of Moscow. The major markets were the Taşayaq Bazaar in Kazan and the Markiz Isle fair on the Volga River. Agricultural landownership was based on the söyurğal and hereditary estates. Society The khan governed the state. He based his actions on decisions and consultations of a cabinet council, or Diwan. The nobility comprised the ranks of bäk (beg), ämir (emir), and morza. Military estates consisted of the uğlan (ulan), bahadir, içki (ichki). Muslim clergy also played a major role. They were divided into säyet (seid), şäyex (sheikh), qazí (qazi), and imams. The ulema, or clergy, played a judicial role, and maintained the madrassas (schools) and maktabs (libraries). The majority of the population comprised qara xalıq (black people),The designation \\"black\\" in Turkic culture was often used to refer to commoners, and not intended as a racial designation; on this point see also Khazars a free Muslim population who lived on state land. The feudal lands were mostly settled by çura (serfs). Prisoners of war were usually sold to Turkey or into Central Asia. Occasionally they were sold within the Khanate as slaves (qol) and sometimes were settled on feudal lands to become çura later. The Muslim and non-Muslim population of the Khanate had to pay the yasaq. Administration and military Tatar soldiers The Khanate was divided into 5 daruğa: Alat, Arça, Gäreç, Cöri and Nuğay. The term daruğa translates as \\"direction\\". They replaced the \\"duchies\\" that the khanate originated from. Some feudal lords sporadically asserted independence from Kazan, but such attempts would be promptly suppressed. The military of the khanate consisted of armament and men from the darughas and subject lands, khan guards, and the troops of the nobility. The number of soldiers was never constant, ranging from 20,000 to 60,000 in number. Often, troops from Nogay, the Crimea and Russia also served the Kazan khans. Fire-arms (arquebuse) were used for defending the walls of Kazan. Culture The Söyembikä Tower in Kazan possibly displays some features of medieval Kazan architecture. In general, the culture of the Kazan Khanate descended from that of Volga Bulgaria. Cultural elements of the Golden Horde were also present in noble circles. A large part of the urban population was literate. Large libraries were present in mosques and madrassahs. Kazan became a center of science and theology. Although Islamic influence predominated, lay literature also developed. The most prominent Old Tatar language poets were Möxämmädyar, Ömmi Kamal, Möxämmädämin, Ğärifbäk, and Qolşärif. Möxämmädyar renovated the traditions of Kazan poetry, and his verses were very popular. The city of Bolghar retained its position as a sacred place, but had this function only, due to the emergence of Kazan as a major economic and political center in the 1430s. The architecture of the khanate is characterized by white-stone architecture and wood carvings.

The punishments are carried in accordance with the degree of evil one has done during his life.Tom Fulks Heresy? the Five Lost Commandments Strategic Book Publishing 2010 page74 In the Quran, Jahannam is also referred as al-Nar ('The Fire'), Jaheem ('Blazing Fire'), Hutamah ('That which Breaks to Pieces'), Haawiyah ('The Abyss'), Ladthaa , Sa’eer ('The Blaze'), Saqar , also the names of different gates to hell. Just like the Islamic heavens, the common belief holds that Jahannam coexists with the temporary world.Christian Lange Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions BRILL 978-90-04-30121-4 p. 12 Suffering in hell is both physical and spiritual, and varies according to the sins of the condemned. As described in the Quran, Hell has many levels (each one more severe than the one above it); each for a specific group of sinners); a blazing fire, boiling water, and the Tree of Zaqqum. Not all Muslims and scholars agree whether hell is an eternal destination or whether some or even all of the condemned will eventually be forgiven and allowed to enter paradise. Sources =Pre-Quranic= \\"Jahannam\\" is the Arab rendering of \\"Gehinnom\\" (mediated through Aramaic \\"Gehinnam\\"), a Valley in Jerusalem, mentioned multiple times in the Old Testament as an accursed place where child sacrifices took place. In the gospels, Jesus talks about \\"Gehenna\\" (Greek rendering) as a place \\"where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched\\". (Mark 9:48) In the Babylonian Talmud, written around 500 CE, Gehinnom has become a transcendental place of post-mortem punishment of the wicked. =Quran= Most of how Muslims picture and think about Jahannam comes from the Quran, according to scholar Einar Thomassen, who found nearly 500 references to Jahannam/hell (using a variety of names) in the Quran. Jahannam appears in the Quran 77 times, Al-Jaheem 23 times. The David Collection Copenhagen\\" The Quran uses a number of different terms and phrases to refer to hell. Al-nar (the fire) is used 125 times, jahannam 77 times, jaheem (blazing flames) 26 times. One collection of Quranic descriptions of hell include \\"rather specific indications of the tortures of the Fire\\": flames that crackle and roar; fierce, boiling waters scorching wind, and black smoke, roaring and boiling as if it would burst with rage. Its wretched inhabitants sigh and wail, their scorched skins are constantly exchanged for new ones so that they can taste the torment anew, drink festering water and though death appears on all sides they cannot die. They are linked together in chains of 70 cubits, wearing pitch for clothing and fire on their faces, have boiling water that will be poured over their heads, melting their insides as well as their skins, and hooks of iron to drag them back should they try to escape, their remorseful admissions of wrongdoing and pleading for forgiveness are in vain. The description of Jahannam as a place of blazing fire appears in almost every verse in the Quran describing hell. Jahannam is described as being located below heaven,verse 7:50 states \\"The companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: ‘Pour down to us water or anything that God doth provide’\\". having seven gates, each for a specific group or at least a different \\"portion\\" or \\"party\\" of sinners. The Quran also mentions wrongdoers having \\"degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds\\" which some scholars believe refers to the seven gates. The one mention of levels of hell is that hypocrites will be found in its very bottom. The Quran mentions three different sources of food in hell: # Ḍari‘, a dry desert plant that is full of thorns and fails to relieve hunger or sustain a person (88:6); # ghislin, which is only mentioned once (in 69:36, which states that it is the only nourishment in hell); # zaqqum is mentioned three times. = Hadith = Muhammad, Buraq and Gabriel observe \\"shameless women\\" being punished in Hell for prostitution. Hadith literature give expanded details and descriptions of Jahannam. For example, it is perceived to be so deep that if a stone were thrown into it, it would fall for 70 years before reaching the bottom. The breadth of each of Hell's walls is equivalent to a distance covered by a walking journey of 40 years. Malik in Hadith quotes Mohammed as saying that the fire of Jahannam was seventy times greater than fire on earth. He also described that fire as \\"blacker than tar\\". In book 87 Hadith 155, \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" of Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad talked of angels each with \\"a mace of iron\\" who guarded hell, and then expanded on the Quran's discourse describing Jahannam by recounting it as a place that > \\"was built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, > and beside each post there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein > many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized therein > some men from the Quraish\\". Some prominent people in, or destined to arrive in, hell mentioned in the Hadith and Quran are: Fir'awn (viz., the pharaoh of The Exodus, mentioned in Surah Yunus (specifically Q10:90-92), the wives of Nuh and Lut (mentioned in Surah At-Tahrim, specifically Q:66-10), and Abu Lahab and his wife (who were contemporaries and enemies of Muhammad and mentioned in Surah Al-Masadd, specifically Q:111). According to Muhammad, the majority of the inhabitants of hell will be women, due to an inclination for gossip, conjecture and idle chatter.https://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/22 (Volume 2, Book 2, Sahih al-Bukhari number 22)https://muflihun.com/bukhari/6/301 (Volume 1, Book 6, Sahih al- Bukhari number 301) https://www.islamicnet.com/inet/hadith- ebook/hadith.html?page=muslim%2F036.6596.html Sahih Muslim https://muflihun.com/bukhari/62/124 (Book 62, Sahih al-Bukhari number 124 However, other hadith imply that the majority of people in paradise will be women.Sahih Muslim 5062,http://sunnah.com/muslim/53/16 Al-Qurtubi reconciled the hadith that stated that the majority of the inhabitants of Jahannam would be women by suggesting that many of the women that will form the majority in Hell will be among the sinners that would stay there merely temporarily and would then be brought out of Hell into Paradise; thereafter the majority of the people of Paradise would be women.at-Tadhkirah, al-Qurtubî, p. 475 Other people mentioned in Hadith include, but are not limited to, the mighty, the proud and the haughty. According to one hadith, out of every one thousand people entering into the afterlife, nine hundred and ninety-nine of them will end up in the fire. (Volume 4, Book 55, Hadith number 567) There are a few scholarly interpretations of this Hadith. One view is that the idea of these Hadiths is to, rather than state a particular number, convey the notion that there will be a large disparity between the number of nonbelivers and believers who enter Jahannam. Sahih Muslim quotes Muhammad as saying that suicides would reside in Jahannam forever. According to Hadith collector Muwatta Imam Malik (Imam Malik), Muhammad said: \\"Truly a man utters words to which he attaches no importance, and by them he falls into the fire of Jahannam.\\" Al-Bukhari in book 72:834 added to the list of dwellers in Jahannam: \\"The people who will receive the severest punishment from Allah will be the picture makers\\". Use of utensils made of precious metals could also land its users in Jahannam: \\"A person who drinks from a silver vessel brings the fire of Jahannam into his belly\\". As could starving a cat to death: \\"A woman was tortured and was put in Hell because of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger.\\" At least one hadith indicates the importance of faith in avoiding hell, stating: \\"... no one will enter Hell in whose heart is an atom's weight of faith.” The Hadiths (the corpus of the reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) introduce punishments, reasons and revelations not mentioned in the Quran. In both Quranic verses and hadiths, \\"the Fire\\" (Jahannam) is \\"a gruesome place of punishment that is always contrasted with Jannah, \\"the Garden\\" (paradise). Whatever characteristic \\"the Garden offered, the Fire usually offered the opposite conditions.\\"Rustomji, The Garden and the Fire, 2009: p.117-8 Several hadith describes a part of hell that is extremely cold rather than hot, known as Zamhareer. According to Bukhari, lips are cut by scissors. Other traditions added flogging. A Uighur manuscript also mentions drowning, stoning and falling from heights.Christian Lange Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions BRILL 978-90-04-30121-4 p. 16 Based on hadiths, the sinners are thought to carry signs in accordance with their sins.Christian Lange Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions BRILL 978-90-04-30121-4 p. 12-13 = Eschatological manuals = In addition to the Quran and hadith are \\"Eschatological manuals\\". These were written after the other two sources and developed descriptions of Jahannam \\"in more deliberate ways\\". While the Quran and hadith tend to describe punishments that nonbelievers are forced to give themselves, the manuals illustrate external and more dramatic punishment, through devils, scorpions, and snakes. Manuals dedicated solely to the subject of Jahannam include Ibn Abi al-Dunya's Sifat al-nar, and al-Maqdisi's Dhikr al-nar. Other manuals—such as texts by al-Ghazali and the 12th-century scholar Qadi Ayyad -- \\"dramatise life in the Fire\\", and present \\"new punishments, different types of sinners, and the appearance of a multitude of devils,\\" to exhort the faithful to piety. His hell has a structure with a specific place for each type of sinners. Sufi mystic and philosopher Ibn Arabi, ca. 1238.

Al Ghazali, in his book The Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife, describes and discusses the \\"wrongdoer\\" and graphic, sometimes violent scenes of Jahannam. According to theologian Al-Ghazali, Afterlife will start with the \\"Day of the Arising\\" and a trumpet blast which will wake the dead from their graves. \\"The Perspiration\\" —when all created beings, including men, angels, jinn, devils and animals gather and sweat unshaded from the sun—will follow. Sinners and nonbelievers will suffer and sweat longer on this day, which lasts for \\"50,000 years\\". God will judge each soul, accept no excuses, and examine every act and intention—no matter how small. It is believed those whose good deeds outweigh the bad will be assigned to Jannah (heaven), and those whose bad deeds outweigh the good to Jahannam. Finally the souls will traverse over hellfire via the bridge of sirat. For sinners, it is believed the bridge will be thinner than hair and sharper than the sharpest sword, impossible to walk on without falling below to arrive at their destination. According to Leor Halevi, between the moment of death and the time of their burial ceremony, \\"the spirit of a deceased Muslim takes a quick journey to Heaven and Hell, where it beholds visions of the bliss and torture awaiting humanity at the end of days\\". In 'The Soul's Journey After Death, Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, a theologian in the 14th century, writes explicitly of punishments faced by sinners and unbelievers in Jahannam. These are directly related to the wrongdoer's earthly transgressions. In hell, the inmates are tormented by Zabaniyya. Jahannam is depicted as an abyss with scorching winds and the As- Sirat bridge above. Its gates are guarded by Maalik and his subordinated angels. From the depth of Jahannam grows Zaqqum, a tree with fruits looking like the heads of demons. and talk of a road that leads to hell. =Locating hell= Traditionally, the layers of hell were thought of corresponding with the layers of earth. Scholars thought about different ideas, where the entrance to hell could be located. Some believed the sulphourus well in Hadramawt, allegedly haunted by the souls of the wicked, to be the entrance to the underworld. Others considered the entrance in the valley of Hinnom. In a Persian work, the entry to hell is located in a gorge called Wadi Jahannam in Afghanistan. =Eternal or temporary= Several verses in the Quran mention the eternal nature of hell or both heaven and hell. , the damned will linger in hell for ages.Christian Lange Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions Cambridge University Press 2015 page 53 Two verses in the Quran (6:128 and 11:107) emphasize that consignment to hell is horrible and eternal — but include the caveat \\"except as God (or your Lord) wills it\\". Some scholars considered this an escape from the eternity of hell.Mouhanad Khorchide, Sarah Hartmann Islam is Mercy: Essential Features of a Modern Religion Verlag Herder GmbH 2014 page chapter 2.5 Quran (10:107) suggests that Jahannam will be destroyed some day,F. E. Peters The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition, Volume II: The Words and Will of God Princeton University Press 2009 page 145 so that its inhabitants may either be rehabilitated or cease to exist. The concept of hell's annihilation is referred to as fanāʾ al-nār. The Ulama were not in agreement on whether abodes in hell last forever or not. Egyptian Hanafi author al-Tahawi writes that God punishes the sinners in proportions to their offense in accordance with his justice, afterwards release them in accordance with his mercy. Ahmad ibn Hanbal argues, the eternity of hell and paradise are proven by the Quran, although earths and heavens will perish. For Muʿtazilis, the eternity of paradise and hell posed a major problem, since they regard solely God as eternal.Jane Dammen McAuliffe Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān Volume 3 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 418-419 Ibn Taymiyya, during his lifetime controversial, but important scholar in contemporary scholarship, argued for a limited abode in hell, based on the Quran and God's attribute of mercy.Christian Lange Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions Cambridge University Press, 2016 p. 170 The common belief among Muslims is that duration in hell is temporary for Muslims but not for others,A F Klein Religion Of Islam Routledge 2013 page 92 thus combining the concept of an eternal hell with that of the Christian Catholic concept of purgatory.John Renard The Handy Islam Answer Book Visible Ink Press 2015 =Sentience= Some scholars like al-Ghazali and the thirteenth-century Muslim scholar Al-Qurtubi describe hell as a gigantic sentient being, rather than a place. In Paradise and Hell-fire in Imam al Qurtubi, Qurtubi writes, \\"On the Day of Judgment, hell will be brought with seventy thousand reins. A single rein will be held by seventy thousand angels...\\". Based on verse 67:7 and verse 50:30 Jahannam inhales and has \\"breaths\\". Islamicity notes \\"the animalistic nature\\" of \\"The Fire\\" in Quranic verse 25:12: \\"When the Hellfire sees them from a distant place, they will hear its fury and roaring\\". According to a hadith, God will ask Jahannam, if it is full and Jahannam answers: \\"Are there any more (to come)?\\" =Traditional position= Jahannam is traditionally divided into seven stages. According to one common tradition the layers of hell are: # A fire for sinners among the Muslims # Inferno interim for the sinner among the Christians # Provisional destination for sinners among the Jewish # The burning fire for renegades # A place for witches and fortunetellers # Furnace for the disbelievers # A bottomless abyss for hypocrites, like the Pharaoh and people who disbelieves after Isa's table or Muslims who are outwardly believers but inwardly infidels. The seven layers of earth, refer to the different stages of the underworld, the place of hell before the Day of Resurrection: # A dim (surface), inhabited by mankind and jinn. # Basit (plain), the prison of winds, from where the winds come from. # Thaqil (region of distress), the antechamber of hell, in which dwell men with the mouth of a dog, the ears of a goat and the cloven hoof of an ox. # Batih (place of torrents or swamps), a valley through which flows a stream of boiling sulphur to torment the wicked. The dweller in this valley have no eyes and in place of feet, have wings. # Hayn (region of adversity), in which serpents of enormous size devour the infidels. # Masika/Sijjin (store or dungeon), the office where sins are recorded and where souls are tormented by scorpions of the size of mules. # As-Saqar (place of burning) and Athara (place of damp and great cold) the home of Iblis, who is chained in the midst of the rebel angels, his hand fastened one in front of and the other behind him, except when set free by God to chastise his demons.Miguel Asin Palacios Islam and the Divine Comedy Routledge 2013 ISBN 978-1-134-53650-4 page 88-89Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes Dictionary of Islam Asian Educational Services 1995 p. 102 = Sufism = Sufis developed a metaphyisical reinterpretation of Jahannam. Hell is still a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the Jahannam. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the sharia as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are psychological states of the soul manifestated after its separation from the body.Rom Landau The Philosophy of Ibn 'Arabi Routledge 2013 In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God or to do good in fear of hell. =Ahmadiyya= According to Ahmadiyya Islam, afterlife places are images of man's own spiritual life during lifetime, the fire a manifestation of his sins. The main purpose of Jahannam is therefore regarded to purge man from his evil deeds. Punishment therefore exists for perpetual spiritual advancement of human. Muslims and Non-Muslims both may enter or avoid hell depending on their deeds.alislam.orgHazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Teachings of Islam: A discussion on the philosophy of spiritual development in Islam Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam Lahore USA 2011 Comparison with other religions = Christianity = Bible Some of the Quranic parables describing the sufferings in hell resemble those of the Christian New Testament.J. Harold Ellens Heaven, Hell, and the Afterlife: Eternity in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam [3 volumes]: Eternity in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam ABC-CLIO 2013 page 31 :The Bible states: ::\\"And he gave a cry and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue, for I am cruelly burning in this flame.\\" ::\\"And in addition, there is a deep division fixed between us and you, so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so, and no one may come from you to us.\\" ::\\"Unhappy are you who are full of food now: for you will be in need. Unhappy are you who are laughing now: for you will be crying in sorrow.\\" :Resemble the Quran stating: ::\\"And the companions of the Fire will call to the companions of Paradise, \\"Pour upon us some water or from whatever Allah has provided you.\\" They will say, \\"Indeed, Allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers.\\" ::\\"And between them will be a partition, and on [its] elevations are men who recognize all by their mark. And they call out to the companions of Paradise, \\"Peace be upon you.\\" They have not [yet] entered it, but they long intensely.\\" ::\\"So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn.\\" The Book of Revelation describes a \\"lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death\\", which most Christians believe to be a description of Hell, comparable to Jahannam as \\"the fire\\". While the Quran describes Jahannam as having seven levels, each for different sins, the Bible (as regards the issue of levels), speaks of the \\"lowest Hell (Sheol)\\". It also refers to a \\"bottomless pit\\", comparable to the lowest layer of Jahannam in most Sunni traditions. Christian popular culture Satan is trapped in the frozen central zone in the Ninth Circle of Hell, Inferno, Canto 34. Like Hell often depicted in Christian culture in Islam, hell is the seat of the devil. Al-Tha'alibis (961–1038) in his Qisas Al-AnbiyaRobert Lebling Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar I.B.Tauris 2010 and Al-Suyutis Al-Hay’a as-samya fi l-hay’a as-sunmyaANTON M.

HEINEN BEIRUT 1982 p. 143 describe Iblis as chained to the bottom of hell, commanding his hosts of demons from there. Also in the poetries of Al-Ma'arri, Iblis is the king of Jahannam. These depictions of Iblis as lord of hell simultaneously chained at its very bottom influenced Dante's representation of LuciferJane Dammen McAuliffe Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān Volume 3 Georgetown University, Washington DC p. 419 and gave rise to the Christian depiction of hell as the seat of the devil. Inferno by Dante also shares the Islamic idea of dividing hell into multiple \\"circles\\". According to the Divine Comedy, each layer corresponding to another sin with Satan inside a frozen area at the very bottom.Miguel Asin Palacios Islam and the Divine Comedy Routledge, 16.10.2013 As evident from late Ottoman poetry, the notion of Iblis ruling hell, remained in Islamic tradition until modern times. In one of Ğabdulla Tuqay's works, Iblis' current abode in hell is compared to working in factories during Industrial Revolution. When Iblis gets weary about hell, he remembers his time in heaven.Michael Friederich Ghabdulla Tuqaj (1886-1913): ein hochgelobter Poet im Dienst von tatarischer Nation und sowjetischem Sozialismus Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1998 p. 160 (German) One should note, even if Iblis is assumed as the temporary ruler of Jahannam, his reign depends on the power of God and hell is still a place of punishment even for the devil.William A. Young The World's Religions: Worldviews and Contemporary Issues Pearson Prentice Hall 2005 p. 236 As with Christian popular understanding of hell, ʿKitāb al-ʿAẓama, a popular cultural work, describes hell inhabited not only by the Zabaniyya, but also by devils (shayatin), dwelling in the fourth layer of hell and rise from coffins to torture the sinners.Christian Lange Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions BRILL 978-90-04-30121-4 p. 149 Christian Liberalism In modern times some Christians and Christian denominations (such as Universalism) have rejected the concept of hell as a place of suffering and torment for sinners on the grounds that it is incompatible with a loving God. There are also symbolic and more merciful interpretations of hell among Muslims.Mouhanad Khorchide, Sarah Hartmann Islam is Mercy: Essential Features of a Modern Religion Verlag Herder GmbH 2014 page chapter 2.4 Muslims Mouhanad Khorchide and Faheem Younus write that since the Quran states that God has \\"prescribed to himself mercy\\", and \\"... for him whose scales (of good deeds) are light. Hell will be his mother,\\"Quran 101:9-10 suffering in Jahannam is not a product of vengeance and punishment, but a temporary phenomenon as the sinner is \\"transformed\\" in the process of confronting the truth about themselves. The idea of annihilation of hell was already introduced earlier by traditionalistic scholars, such as Ibn Taimiyya.Lange, Christian, editor. Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions. Brill, 2016. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1w3. chapter 1 p. 12 = Judeo-Islamic sources = Arabic texts written by Jews in Judeo-Arabic script (particularly those which are identified with the Isra'iliyyat genre in the study of hadith) also feature descriptions of Jahannam (or Jahannahum). These seem to have been strongly influenced by the Islamic environment in which they were composed, and may be considered as holding many of the same concepts as those today identified with Islamic eschatology. A Judeo-Arabic version of a popular narrative known as The Story of the Skull (whose earliest version is attributed to Ka'ab al-Ahbar) offers a detailed picture of the concept of Jahannam. Here, Malak al-Mawt (the Angel of Death) and a number of sixty angels seize the soul of the dead and begin torturing him with fire and iron hooks. Two black angels named Nākir and Nakīr (identified with Munkar and Nakir in Islamic eschatology) strike the dead with a whip of fire and take him to the lowest level of Jahannam. Then, they order the Earth to swallow and crush the dead inside its womb, saying: \\"Seize him and take revenge, because he has stolen Allāh's wealth and worshipped others than Him\\". Following this, the dead is brought before the dais of God where a herald calls for throwing the dead into Jahannam. There he is put in shackles sixty cubits long and into a leather sackcloth full of snakes and scorpions. The Judeo-Arabic legend in question explains that the dead is set free from the painful perogatory after twenty-four years. In a final quote alluding to Isaiah 58.8, the narrative states that \\"nothing will help Man on the last day except good and loving actions, deeds of giving charity to widows, orphans, the poor and the unfortunate.\\" Some Jewish sources such as Jerahmeel provide descriptive detail of hell-like places, divided into multiple levels; usually Sheol, which is translated as a grave or pit, is the place where humans descend upon death. = Zoroastrianism = Like Zoroastrianism, Islam holds that on Judgement Day all souls will pass over a bridge over hell (As-Sirāt in Islam, Chinvat Bridge in Zorastrianism) which those destined for hell will find too narrow and fall below into their new abode. = Hinduism = In case of a finite hell, as a circulation of beginning and reset, the cosmology resembles to a hinduistic notion of an eternal cosmic process of generation, decay and destruction.Jean Holm, John Bowker Sacred Place Bloomsbury Publishing 2001 page 112 =Buddhism= Some descriptions of Jahannam resemble Buddhist descriptions of Naraka from Mahayana sutras in regard of destroying inhabitants of hell physically, while their consciousness still remains and after once the body is destroyed, it will regenerate again, thus the punishment will repeat.Rulu Teachings of the Buddha AuthorHouse 2012 page 147 However, according to Buddhism belief, the inhabitants are able to gain good Karma and in certain circumstances leave hell again.

The westernmost point of the bay is marked by the headland of Jackson Head; in the northeast the end of the bay is less well defined, but the small alluvial fan of the Turnbull and Okuru Rivers might be considered its farthest point. The small Open Bay Islands lie five kilometres off the coast at this point. The bay marks a major change in the terrain of the west coast. To the north, narrow fertile plains lie between the mountains and the sea, allowing for moderately intensive farming of livestock. To the south, the coastal plains disappear as the land becomes steeper and more mountainous. Within 60 kilometres, the first of the deep glacial valleys that further south become the fjords of Fiordland start to become evident, with Lake McKerrow at the foot of the Hollyford Track. The bay marks the farthest southern extent of the West Coast's road network: the small road which meanders along the coast from Haast, 32 kilometres to the northeast, terminates at the sleepy fishing village of Jackson Bay, close to Jackson Head. This was the site of the landing of the early settlers of the area, and is close to the mouth of the Arawhata (or Arawata) River.

It was begun in 1821 as an agricultural fair, but did not have a regular schedule until 1869 when hat manufacturers Rundle and White helped form the Danbury Farmers and Manufacturers Society. From then until its closing, the fair was open for ten days every October. The fair took up 142 acres (0.57 km²) of what Rundle and White had hoped would be a Danbury Pleasure Park. Admission was 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for children. The fair offered everything from tobacco, pears, and home-brewed wines to hats, boots, saddles, carriages, wagons, churns, and stoves. In 1895, more than 1000 people were employed by the fair. In 1932, a race track was built on the fairgrounds for the midget car and stock car races that had replaced the earlier harness races. When the fair's owner John Leahy died in 1974, the organization fell into disarray. The last day of the fair was October 12, 1981, with an estimated 400,000 people having attended that year. All of the rides, attractions, and holdings were auctioned off. The Danbury Fair Mall was built on the fairgrounds by the Wilmorite Corporation. Photos of the fair and original signs used to be found in the mall's food court. The fair featured large fiberglass sculptures of characters such as Uncle Sam and Paul Bunyan.Photo of fair showing Paul Bunyan and the Farmer Many of these were purchased after the fair was closed, and continue to exist (Photo of Uncle Sam at Magic Forest in Lake George, New York). The sculpture of Uncle Sam is 38 feet tall and is claimed to be the tallest Uncle Sam in the world. The Uncle Sam statue was recently returned to its home in Danbury Connecticut in 2019 and is located at the Railway Museum. The sculpture of Paul Bunyan was manufactured by International Fiberglass, which mass-produced identical sculptures to sell to stores such as tire or muffler shops (thus the sculptures are generally referred to as Muffler Men). The Danbury Fair Paul Bunyan was eventually painted like a \\"hippy\\" and moved to Max Yasgur's Farm in Bethel, New York (home of annual Woodstock reunions).Sightings of the Hippie Muffler Man It has since returned to Danbury.

Building on the work of James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright he invented the spinning mule, a machine that revolutionized the industry worldwide.  Early life  Samuel Crompton was born in 10 Firwood Fold, Bolton, Lancashire to George and Betty Crompton (née Elizabeth Holt of Turton). His father was a caretaker at nearby Hall i' th' Wood. Samuel had two younger sisters. While he was a boy he lost his father and had to contribute to the family resources by spinning yarn, learning to spin on James Hargreaves's spinning jenny. The deficiencies of the Jenny imbued him with the idea of devising something better, which he worked on in secret for five or six years. The effort absorbed all his spare time and money, including that which he earned by playing the violin at the Bolton theatre. On 16 February 1780 at Bolton Parish Church, Crompton married Mary Pimlott (or Pimbley). They had eight children including George Crompton (born 8 January 1781), who followed in the family business. Spinning mule The only surviving example of a spinning mule built by the inventor Samuel Crompton, in Bolton Museum. About 1779, Samuel Crompton succeeded in producing a mule-jenny, a machine which spun yarn suitable for use in the manufacture of muslin. It was known as the muslin wheel or the Hall i' th' Woodwheel, from the name of the house in which he and his family now lived. The mule-jenny later became known as the spinning mule. There was a strong demand for the yarn which Crompton was making at Hall i' th' Wood but he lacked the means to take out a patent. The prying into his methods forced Crompton to choose between destroying his machine or making it public. He adopted the latter alternative after promises by a number of manufacturers to pay him for the use of the mule but all he received was about £60. He then resumed spinning on his own account, but with indifferent success. The mule-jenny twisted the rovings using rollers in the manner of Arkwright's frame, while the spindle carriage moved back and forth 54 inches to stretch the thread, and then to gather it in the spinning spindles in the manner of Hargreaves jenny. The mule's importance was that it could spin thread better than could be done by hand, which led to ever finer thread. Coarse thread (40s) sold for 14 shillings per pound whilst (80s) spun on his mule sold at 42 shillings a pound. The Hall ith' Wood near Bolton. (where Samuel Crompton invented the first Spinning Mule) ...respectfully dedicated to the Cotton Spinners of Lancashire.\\" Lithograph by F. Jones (Day & Son, Lithographers to the Queen), after Selim Rothwell. As the mule was unpatented others soon manufactured it. The machine was constructed in iron, power was applied to assist the inward motion in 1790 and by 1834 it was fully automatic or self-acting. A survey in 1812 showed there were between 4 and 5 million mule spindles in use. Crompton received no royalties for his invention. In 1800, a sum of £500 was raised for his benefit by subscription, and when in 1809, Edmund Cartwright, the inventor of the power loom, obtained £10,000 from parliament, Crompton was determined to apply for a grant. In 1811, he toured the manufacturing districts of Lancashire and Scotland to collect evidence showing how extensively his mule was being used, and in 1812 parliament awarded him £5000. With the aid of this money, Crompton started a business as a bleacher and then as a cotton merchant and spinner, but without success. In 1824, some friends and members (including Isaac and Benjamin Dobson, Benjamin Hick, John Kennedy and Peter Rothwell) of Bolton's Black Horse \\"prosecution\\" Club, bought him an annuity of £63 without his knowledge. Crompton died at his house in King Street, Bolton on 26 June 1827, and was buried at the parish church of St Peter's.

Career Drafted by both the Detroit Lions of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Chargers of the AFL, Faison signed with the Chargers as a first-round pick immediately after the conclusion of the East–West Shrine Game on December 31, 1960. The 6-foot-5, 260 pound Faison had been an All-American at Indiana University, playing on both offense and defense. After entering the pro ranks, he worked with Chargers' assistant coach Chuck Noll to continually blow past opposing offensive lineman on his way to smashing American Football League quarterbacks. Faison was a member of the original \\"Fearsome Foursome\\" (the Chargers' defensive line) from 1961–66. The \\"Foursome\\" was made up of Faison and Chargers Hall of Fame linemate Ernie Ladd, with alternate members of the group including Bob Petrich, Ron Nery, George Gross, Bill Hudson and Henry Schmidt. Despite often being double and triple-teamed, Faison was chosen as the American Football League Rookie of the Year and All-AFL in 1961. He missed the early portion of the 1962 season, after suffering a knee injury, then reported late the following year after a contract dispute. The contract problems would resurface in 1965, but his performance remained good enough to continue a string of five consecutive All-Star seasons in the league from 1961 to 1965. On January 15, 1966, Faison and Ladd were dealt to the Houston Oilers as part of a five-player trade, but four days later, the trade was nullified because of tampering by Oilers' owner Bud Adams. In response, Faison looked to the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts, but eventually signed a three-year $90,000 contract with the Chargers on July 29. The bitter contract problems, coupled with Faison's back problems, continued to linger until October 18 when Faison was released by the Chargers. In announcing the dismissal, Gillman bitterly noted that Faison, \\"has a long way to go to become average.\\" One day later, the expansion Miami Dolphins signed Faison for the remainder of the year. On June 27, 1967, Faison was involved in a seven-player trade that sent him to the Denver Broncos, but 10 days later, the team returned him to the Dolphins, who then placed him on waivers on July 24. Faison's release led him to file a lawsuit against Miami on October 6, citing breach of contract. Claiming that his three-year contract entitled him to the remaining $60,000 over two years, Faison was ultimately unsuccessful in his lawsuit. A member of the Chargers Hall of Fame, Faison was also inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame in 1990. In his post-playing career, Faison briefly dabbled in acting, including a pair of appearances in The Beverly Hillbillies. He then returned to California as an educator and football coach, and while at Lincoln High School, he served as head coach during the era of future Pro Football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen before eventually serving as the school's principal. He later coached P.E. at Muirlands Junior High School in La Jolla. It was there that he coined the term \\"grabasser\\" for unruly students. Faison later went on to become the Vice Principal at University City High School in San Diego. Earl Faison is a member of The Pigskin Club Of Washington, D.C. National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll. In 1997, Faison was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Faison was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.

It is the northernmost settlement of any real size on the West Coast, and is located northeast by road from Westport. There is no other connecting road to the town - the road north ends at the Kohaihai River some from Karamea, at the southwestern end of the Heaphy Track. The population was 375 in the 2013 census, a decline of 48 from 2006. The name Karamea is Maori – despite local jokes suggesting it was named by an Italian for his love – and is thought to either mean \\"red ochre\\" or be a corruption of Kakarataramea, \\"the smell of speargrass leaves\\". Karamea Bight, the large bay formed by the curve of coastline north for from Cape Foulwind, is part of the Tasman Sea. The Karamea River flows into the Karamea Bight just south of the main township, and there is a large lagoon that completely clears of water at low tide, and completely fills with water at high tide. The Oparara River runs through the area, and the Oparara Basin Arches, large natural river tunnels, are a well-known tourist destination, though tourism in the area is limited compared to most other parts of New Zealand. Karamea township offers local services including a general store, supermarket, petrol pumps, information centre, cafe, hotel, camping ground, motels, backpackers, art & craft shop, and a community library, the Karamea War Memorial Library. Little Wanganui, a small dairy farming village south of Karamea, includes a surfing beach and a river popular for whitebaiting and fishing. It includes a small tavern, community hall and volunteer fire brigade. Golden Bay Air flies to Karamea Aerodrome from Nelson and Takaka. History Maori occupation in this area seems to have been mainly seasonal. The first Europeans and Chinese would have been early gold-miners in the 1860s. The first true settlement of the area took place in 1874 when the (then) fine harbour and sea provided the only means of contact with the outside world. This original settlement was on the South Terrace but poor soil forced the inhabitants down to the river valley. One side of the river (Umere) was known as the Land of Promise, the other side (Arapito) as the Promised Land. Farming was to become a major industry, but timber, flax and gold mining also provided a means to a living. The 1929 Murchison earthquake caused the silting up of the harbour and cut the community's road link for about two years. Dairying remains a major industry of Karamea. Sphagnum moss, possum control, fishing, fine furniture production, horticultural tomato growers and a plant nursery also provide income, while the service industry employs approximately a quarter of the workforce. Fruit grown in the area includes tamarillo, which can be grown here due to the area's mild and frost-free microclimate. Tourism Tourists visit Karamea all year round to enjoy the many scenic attractions in the region, which is enveloped by the Kahurangi National Park. Tourism is a fast-growing segment of the local economy, and the region is often said to be \\"New Zealand's best-kept secret\\". One end of the Heaphy Track, one of New Zealand's nine \\"Great Walks\\", is at the Kohaihai River, about north of Karamea. The western end of the Wangapeka Track is near Karamea. The Oparara Basin with the Oparara Arches, Honeycomb Hill Cave and rainforest walks are also a popular attraction. Education Karamea Area School is a coeducational composite school (years 1–13), with a decile rating of 5 and a roll of 93. The school celebrated 125 years of settlement and schooling in 2000.

It was promoted as \\"a behind-the-scenes account of how and why President [George W.] Bush decided to go to war against Iraq\\".Woodward, Bob (18 April 2004). \\"Behind Diplomatic Moves, Military Plan Was Launched.\\" The Washington Post (via WashingtonPost.com). Retrieved 8 September 2018. The book's chief contention, which provides the rationale for its title, is that President Bush planned from early in his presidency to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force, rather than making any serious effort to use diplomacy or other means. The book describes White House deliberations implying that if Saddam were removed from power without a military invasion, Iraq would need a foreign-implemented regime change. It focuses mainly on President Bush, Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and CIA Director George Tenet, as well as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair. Other fixtures are White House advisers such as Karen Hughes and Karl Rove. Content Plan of Attack picks up where Woodward's previous work, Bush at War, left off, focusing on the decision-making that led up to the U.S.-led war in Iraq. As a result of the broad access Woodward was granted to the White House and to interview Bush administration officials, the book is able to paint a realistic picture of what happened behind the scenes. Woodward's own approach is to resist making judgements about the war itself, but rather try to describe the decision-making process. As a result of refraining to interpret the story that he presents, Woodward has been described as being both opposed to the Bush administration by some, as well as an apologist of the administration by others. Woodward describes in Plan of Attack a small group of administration officials including Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who were urging the President to go to war in Iraq beginning shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Secretary of State Colin Powell and General Tommy Franks are described as being part of a group within the government more skeptical of the plan to invade Iraq. In the narrative, President George W. Bush is described as having been intent on exercising a policy of regime change with regard to Iraq immediately after 9/11, a perspective that remained largely unchanged throughout the debates that would follow. Secretary of State Colin Powell is depicted as being increasingly at odds with members of the Bush administration, and even goes as far as to reject some of the evidence put forward on weapons of mass destruction. However, by the end of the book, Powell ultimately endorses the invasion, a decision which is not entirely explained, other than to suggest Powell may have lined up with the President out of a sense of duty. The Bush administration's own view of Plan of Attack is interesting. When the book was published the administration denied many of the accounts in the book, but the Bush/Cheney re-election campaign listed Woodward's book as recommended reading nevertheless. The Kerry/Edwards campaign also listed the book as recommended reading. Book versus individual accounts * Bob Woodward says Bush decided that the United States would invade Iraq on January 11, 2003. In interviews, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice have stated the decision was much later – not until March. Paul O'Neill, on the other hand, stated that the decision was made in January 2001, well before even the September 11 attacks.Julian Borger,\\"Bush decided to remove Saddam 'on day one'\\", The Guardian, January 12, 2004. *In the book, CIA director George Tenet is noted as responding to skepticism that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction by leaping out of his chair and exclaiming \\"It's a slam dunk case!\\" Later, Tenet is forced to admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing. In 2007, during an interview on 60 Minutes, Tenet claimed that his words were taken out of context.Ex-CIA chief says \\"slam dunk\\" Iraq quote misused. Reuters. 2007-04-26. Retrieved 2019-02-02. * Woodward portrays Secretary of State Colin Powell as reluctant to go to war and often at odds with other Bush administration officials. Powell has stated for the record that he was always fully supportive of the administration and its efforts to invade Iraq, although he wanted tens or hundreds of thousands more soldiers on the ground. * General Tommy Franks calls Pentagon official Douglas Feith \\"the fucking stupidest guy on the face of the earth\\". In his biography, American Soldier, General Franks clarified the context of this phrase by stating that he was talking to his subordinates who were upset with Rumsfeld.

They use air blown through nozzles to shape the airflow over the rear edge of the wing, directing the flow downward to increase the lift coefficient. There are a variety of methods to achieve this airflow, most of which use jet exhaust or high-pressure air bled off of a jet engine's compressor and then redirected to follow the line of trailing- edge flaps. Blown flaps may refer specifically to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like upper surface blowing or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as powered lift, which also includes various boundary layer control systems, systems using directed prop wash, and circulation control wings. Internal blown flaps were used on some land and carrier-based fast jets in the 1960s, including the Lockheed F-104, Blackburn Buccaneer and certain versions of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21. They generally fell from favour because they imposed a significant maintenance overhead in keeping the ductwork clean and various valve systems working properly, along with the disadvantage that an engine failure reduced lift in precisely the situation where it is most desired. The concept reappeared in the form of upper and lower blowing in several transport aircraft, both turboprop and turbofan. Mechanism In a conventional blown flap, a small amount of the compressed air produced by the jet engine is \\"bled\\" off at the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing. There, it is forced through slots in the wing flaps of the aircraft when the flaps reach certain angles. Injecting high energy air into the boundary layer produces an increase in the stalling angle of attack and maximum lift coefficient by delaying boundary layer separation from the airfoil. Boundary layer control by mass injecting (blowing) prevents boundary layer separation by supplying additional energy to the particles of fluid which are being retarded in the boundary layer. Therefore, injecting a high velocity air mass into the air stream essentially tangent to the wall surface of the airfoil reverses the boundary layer friction deceleration thus the boundary layer separation is delayed.Aerodynamics for Engineering Students, E.L. Houghton & P.W. Carpenter, Elsevier The lift of a wing can be greatly increased with blowing flow control. With mechanical slots the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control pressure to the freestream total head. Blowing with a small proportion of engine airflow (internal blown flap) increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the jet flap), produces supercirculation,http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/rm/3304.pdf p.1 or forced circulationhttp://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf p.22 up to the theoretical potential flow maximum. Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust. Development of the general concept continued at NASA in the 1950s and 60s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The externally blown flap arranges the engine to blow across the flaps at the rear of the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the Coandă effect. The similar upper-surface blowing system arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coandă effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these \\"powered lift\\" systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain. A more recent and promising blow-type flow control concept is the counter-flow fluid injection which is able to exert high-authority control to global flows using low energy modifications to key flow regions. In this case the air blow slit is located at the pressure side near the leading edge stagnation point location and the control air-flow is directed tangentially to the surface but with a forward direction. During the operation of such a flow control system two different effects are present. One effect, boundary layer enhancement, is caused by the increased turbulence levels away from the wall region thus transporting higher-energy outer flow into the wall region. In addition to that another effect, the virtual shaping effect, is utilized to aerodynamically thicken the airfoil at high angles of attack. Both these effects help to delay or eliminate flow separation.Control of High-Reynolds-Number Turbulent Boundary Layer Separation Using Counter-Flow Fluid Injection, B.E. Wake, G. Tillman, S.S. Ochs, J.S. Kearney, 3rd AIAA Flow Control Conference, 2006 In general, blown flaps can improve the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 produces a coefficient of lift of about 2.45,\\"Aerodynamic issues in the Design of High-Lift Systems for Transport Aircraft\\" Figure 1. Trends in Boeing Transport High Lift System Development, Agard CP-365 external blowing (upper surface blowing on a YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal blowing (jet flap on Hunting H.126) to 9. http://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf p.18 History Williamshttp://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0209.pdf states some flap blowing tests were done at the R.A.E. before the Second World War and that extensive tests were done during the war in Germany including flight tests with Arado 232, Do-24 and Bf 109 aircraft. Lachmann states the Arado and Dornier aircraft used an ejector-driven single flow of air which was sucked over part of the trailing edge span and blown over the remainder. The ejector was chemically powered using high pressure vapour. The Bf 109 used engine- driven blowers for flap blowing. Rebuffet and Poisson- Quintonhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093899.pdf describe tests in France at O.N.E.R.A. after the war with combined sucking at le of first flap section and blowing at second flap section using a jet engine compressor bleed ejector to give both sucking and blowing. Flight testing was done on a Breguet Vultur aircraft.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850024795.pdf Tests were also done at Westland Aircraft by W.H. Paine after the war with reports dated 1950 and 1951. In the United States a Grumman F9F Panther was modified with flap blowing based on work done by John Attinello in 1951. Engine compressor bleed was used. The system was known as \\"Supercirculation Boundary Layer Control\\" or BLC for short.\\"U.S. Naval Air Superiority Development of Shipborne Jet Fighters 1943-1962\\" Tommy H. Thomason, Midland Publishing, Hincklet 2007, , page 81 Between 1951 and 1955 Cessna did flap blowing tests on Cessna 309 and 319 aircraft using the Arado system.\\"Cessna Wings for the World, the Single-Engine Development Story\\" by William D. Thompson, 1991 During the 1950s and 60s, fighter aircraft generally evolved towards smaller wings in order to reduce drag at high speeds. Compared to the fighters of a generation earlier, they had wing loadings about four times as high; for instance the Supermarine Spitfire had a wing loading of and the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had the \\"very high\\" loading of , whereas the 1950s-era F-104 Starfighter had . One serious downside to these higher wing loadings is at low speed, when there isn't enough wing left to provide lift to keep the plane flying. Even huge flaps could not offset this to any large degree, and as a result many aircraft landed at fairly high speeds, and were noted for accidents as a result. The major reason flaps were not effective is that the airflow over the wing could only be \\"bent so much\\" before it stopped following the wing profile, a condition known as flow separation. There is a limit to how much air the flaps can deflect overall. There are ways to improve this, through better flap design; modern airliners use complex multi-part flaps for instance. However, large flaps tend to add considerable complexity, and take up room on the outside of the wing, which makes them unsuitable for use on a fighter. The principle of the jet flap, a type of internally blown flap, was proposed and patented in 1952 by the British National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) and thereafter investigated by the NGTE and the Royal Aircraft Establishment.Flight International 1963 p454 The concept was first tested at full-scale on the experimental Hunting H.126. It reduced the stall speed to only , a number most light aircraft cannot match. The jet flap used a large percentage of the engine exhaust, rather than compressor bleed air, for blowing.http://cafefoundation.org/v2/pdf_tech/Drag.Reduction/NASA.Synergistic.Airframe.1998.pdf Buccaneer pictured with the blowing slots visible on the leading edges. The extended flaps are contributing to the Coanda airflow over the wing. One of the first production aircraft with blown flaps was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter which entered service in January 1958.\\"United States Army and Air Force Fighter 1916-1961\\" produced by D.A. Russell, Harleyford Publications Limited, Letchworth 1961, Library of Congress Card No.61-16739(United States) page 132 After prolonged development problems, the BLCS proved to be enormously useful in compensating for the Starfighter's tiny wing surface. The Lockheed T2V SeaStar, with blown flaps, had entered service in May 1957 but was to have persistent maintenance problems with the BLCS which led to its early retirement.American Military Training Aircraft' E.R.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 had blown flaps. PetrovICAS Archive states long-term operation of these aircraft showed high reliability of the BLC systems. The TSR-2, which was cancelled before it entered service, had full-span blown flaps.\\"TSR2 with Hindsight\\" edited by Air Vice-Marshal A F C Hunter CBE AFC DL, Royal Air Force Historical Society 1998, , page 181 Starting in the 1970s the lessons of air combat over Vietnam changed thinking considerably. Instead of aircraft designed for outright speed, general maneuverability and load capacity became more important in most designs. The result is an evolution back to larger planforms to provide more lift. For instance the F-16 has a wing loading of , and uses leading edge extensions to provide considerably more lift at higher angles of attack, including approach and landing. Some later combat aircraft achieved the required low-speed characteristics using swing-wings. Internal flap blowing is still used to supplement externally blown flaps on the Shin Meiwa US-1A. Some aircraft currently (2015) in service that require a STOL performance use external flap blowing and, in some cases, also use internal flap blowing on flaps as well as on control surfaces such as the rudder to ensure adequate control and stability at low speeds. External blowing concepts are known as the \\"externally blown flap\\" (used on the C-17 Globemaster ), \\"upper surface blowing\\" (used on the An-72 and An-74) and \\"vectored slipstream\\", or \\"over the wing blowing\\", used on the An-70 and the Shin Meiwa US-1A and ShinMaywa US-2.

He worked for a succession of the sultans of Zanzibar. Tippu Tip traded in slaves for Zanzibar's clove plantations. As part of the large and lucrative ivory trade, he led many trading expeditions into Central Africa, constructing profitable trading posts deep into the region. He bought the ivory from local suppliers and resold it for a profit at coastal ports. Early life Tippu Tip in The Illustrated London News. Front cover of 7 December 1889 issue. It is believed that Tippu Tip was born around 1832 on Zanzibar, based on descriptions of his age at points in his life. Tippu Tip's mother, Bint Habib bin Bushir, was a Muscat Arab of the ruling class. His father and paternal grandfather were coastal Arabs of the Swahili Coast who had taken part in the earliest trading expeditions to the interior. His paternal great-grandmother, wife of Rajab bin Mohammed bin Said el Murgebi, was the daughter of Juma bin Mohammed el Nebhani, a member of a respected Muscat (Oman) family, and a Bantu woman from the village of Mbwa Maji, a small village south of what would later become the German capital of Dar es Salaam.Brode, 7-8 Throughout his lifetime Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi was more commonly known as Tippu Tib, which translates to \\"the gatherer together of wealth\\". According to him, he was given the nickname Tippu Tip after the \\"tiptip\\" sound that his guns gave off during expeditions in Chungu territory. At a relatively young age, Tippu Tip led a group of about 100 men into Central Africa seeking slaves and ivory. After plundering several large swathes of land, he returned to Zanzibar to consolidate his resources and recruit for his forces. Following this he returned to mainland Africa. Later life Portrait of Tippu Tip, House of Wonders Museum, Stone Town, Zanzibar. Tippu Tip built a trading empire, using the proceeds to establish clove plantations on Zanzibar. Abdul Sheriff reported that when he left for his twelve years of \\"empire building\\" on the mainland, he had no plantations of his own. By 1895, he had acquired \\"seven 'shambas' [plantations] and 10,000 slaves\\".Sheriff, 108 He met and helped several famous western explorers of the African continent, including David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley.Stanley, H. M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, Vol. One , Vol. Two Between 1884 and 1887 he claimed the Eastern Congo for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, Bargash bin Said el Busaidi. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar's interests in Congo, he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King Leopold II of Belgium at Stanley Falls, al-Murjabī went to the Belgian consul at Zanzibar to assure him of his \\"good intentions\\". Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. =Governor of the Stanley Falls District= In early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. Both Leopold and Sultan Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.Bennett and Brode At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing Emin Pasha (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of Equatoria (a region of Ottoman Egypt, today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the Bahr el Ghazal area as a result of the Mahdi uprising in Sudan. Tippu Tip travelled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard, a disaster for which Stanley attempted to place the blame on Tippu Tip. =Congo–Arab War= After his tenure as governor, the Congo–Arab War broke out. Both sides fought with armies consisting mostly of local African soldiers fighting under the command of either Arab or European leaders. When Tippu Tip left the Congo, the authority of King Leopold's Free State was still very weak in the Eastern parts of the territory and the power lay largely with local Arabic or Swahili strongmen. Amongst these were Tippu Tip's son Sefu bin Hamid and a trader known as Rumaliza in the area close to Lake Tanganyika. In 1892, Sefu bin Hamed attacked Belgian ivory traders, who were seen as a threat to the Arab-Swahili trade. The Free State government sent a force under commander Francis Dhanis to the East. Dhanis had an early success when the African warlord Ngongo Lutete changed sides from Sefu's to his. The better armed and organised Belgian force defeated their opponents in several fights until the death of Sefu on 20 October 1893, and finally forcing also Rumaliza to flee to German territory in 1895. =Death= House of Tippu Tip in Stone Town, Zanzibar City After returning to Zanzibar around 1890/91, Tippu Tip retired. He set out to write an account of his life, which is the first example of the literary genre of autobiography in the Bantu Swahili language. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907.Tippoo Tib, The story of his career in Central Africa, narrated from his own accounts by Dr. Heinrich Brode, London, Edward Arnold 1907 Tippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of malaria (according to Brode) in his home in Stone Town, the main town on the island of Zanzibar.

It was published in late 1673 and closely followed by English, German, French and Dutch translations. Adapted and abridged version were also followed where only original chapters on shamanism and religion was preserved but the others replaced with tales on magic, sorcery, drums and heathenism. The book uses \\"Lap\\" mainly to notice that Samis are still pagan and it is concluded that Lap is a word introduced by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1150 - 1220) to distinguish Sami peoples living near the ocean (coast-fenni) and in the woodland (lapp-fenni). It was aimed to meet rumors, or as the council Magnus De La Gardie saw as degrading propaganda, from (particular German) pamphlets claiming the Swedes had used \\"Sami magic\\" on the European battlefields. The book was not until 1956 (after 300 years) fully translated to Swedish (as Lappland, Acta Lapponica 8, Uppsala 1956).

It is also a compendium of software construction techniques, which include techniques from naming variables to deciding when to write a subroutine. Summary McConnell defines the main activities in construction as detailed design, construction planning, coding and debugging, unit testing, integration and integration testing. Although he does not dismiss the value of other aspects of software development such as requirements and documentation, McConnell emphasises the construction of software due to several reasons. Within the view of the book, construction is a large part of software development, as the central activity within software development and can significantly improve the productivity of a programmer when focus is directed towards it; in addition, the source code is seen as defining the operation of the software, with documentation implicated when code and documentation are opposed. Lastly, the book contends that construction is the exclusive activity which is guaranteed to remain completed. The techniques of a good programmer are also given throughout the book. The whole part seven of the book is about software craftsmanship (layout, style, character, themes and self- documentation). The other six parts of the book are: laying the foundation, creating high-quality code, variables, statements, code improvements and system considerations. Reception Code Complete has received outstanding reviews, being widely regarded as one of the leading must-reads for software developers. It won a Jolt Award in 1993.Jolt winners 1993 It is rated favorably on several lists such as Goodreads, Amazon and some independent blogs.

It lies North of Adelaide at the junction of the Oodnadatta Track and the Birdsville Track, above sea level. Marree is an important service centre for the large sheep and cattle stations in northeast South Australia as well as a stopover destination for tourists traveling along the Birdsville or Oodnadatta Tracks. The area is the home of the Dieri Aboriginal people. At the 2011 census, the Marree census district which includes the entire northeastern corner of South Australia had a population of 634, with 70% of the population being male. The town of Marree has a population of approximately 150 persons. The major areas of employment are mining, agriculture and accommodation services. The town was home to Australia's first mosque, which was made of mud brick and built by the Afghan cameleers employed at Marree's inception. At the turn of the 20th century the town was divided in two, with Europeans on one side and Afghans and Aborigines on the other. History and Etymology Initially the area was known as Herrgott (or Hergott) Springs but when the town was surveyed in 1883 4 km South of the springs in preparation for the coming of the railway it was given the name Marree. The first European to explore the area was Edward John Eyre, who passed through in 1840. In 1859, explorer John McDouall Stuart visited the area together with the German botanist and accomplished bushman Joseph Herrgott, who discovered the springs which Stuart named after him. Herrgott had previously taken part of B. H. Babbage's expedition to Lake Torrence. He died only years afterwards, 1861, 36 years old.The Germans in Australia By Jurgen Tampke, Jürgen Tampke, Cambridge University Press, 2006, page 51https://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/hergott-joseph.html Marree is said to be derived from the indigenous word for possum. However the railway station itself was given the name Hergott Springs and the town remained known as such. The railway station's name was eventually changed to Marree in 1917 due to anti-German sentiment after World War I. The historic Marree Hotel and Marree Fettlers' Cottages are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Parts of The Inbetweeners 2, a 2014 British comedy film set in Australia, were filmed in Marree. Early transportation Former Commonwealth Railways NSU class locomotive at Marree railway station The Central Australia Railway reached the town in 1883 and the first train ran in January 1884. The town became a major railhead for the cattle industry. In the 1920s the railway was extended north from the town to Alice Springs. After opening in 1929 it became the route of the passenger train which became known as The Ghan. In 1957, a standard gauge line was built south from Marree on a flatter alignment to facilitate the movement of coal from the Leigh Creek Coalfield to Port Augusta. That made Marree a break-of-gauge on The Ghan service because the remainder of the line was still narrow gauge. In 1980 the narrow gauge line from Marree to Alice Springs closed when the Adelaide to Alice Springs line was rebuilt much further west. In 1986 the standard gauge line to Marree was closed north of the coal mine and the town lost its railway connection completely.The Dual Gauge Yards at Marree Reid, Graeme Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May 1997 pp147-156 Marree was also the home of Tom Kruse, one of the men who drove the mail trucks from Marree to Birdsville in Queensland, a distance of some 700 kilometres. This route crosses some of the most challenging sandy and stony desert country in Australia, and it was a remarkable feat for fully loaded trucks to make the run at all. A collection of hundreds of photographs, documents and memorabilia from Kruse's Birdsville mail run are on display at the Marree Hotel. Marree Man Marree's Camel Cup The name \\"Marree\\" was referred to briefly around the world when in 1998, a chalk figure recently etched into the landscape 60 km west of Marree was discovered, dubbed the \\"Marree Man\\". Calls were made to turn it into a state icon but the unimpressed local population preferred to let it fade naturally back into the landscape. Governance July 2010 Marree is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia and the state’s Far North region. In the absence of a local government authority, the community in Marree receives municipal services from a state government agency, the Outback Communities Authority. Climate Like much of inland Australia, Marree has a very hot and dry climate in a desert environment. Temperatures above have been recorded in every month from October to April and rainfall is extremely erratic, falling mostly in brief heavy downpours experienced usually between one and five times per year, or when cold fronts in winter manage to penetrate far north enough into the Tirari Desert.

John Stuart Mill articulated this principle in On Liberty, where he argued that \\"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\" An equivalent was earlier stated in France's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 as, \\"Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.\\"  Definition  The belief \\"that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of others\\" has become one of the basic principles of libertarian politics. The harm principle was first fully articulated by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) in the first chapter of On Liberty (1859), where he argued that: Even if a self-regarding action results in harm to oneself, it is still beyond the sphere of justifiable state coercion. Harm itself is not a non-moral concept. The infliction of harm upon another person is what makes an action wrong. Harm can also result from a failure to meet an obligation. Morality generates obligations. Duty may be exacted from a person in the same way as a debt, and it is part of the notion of duty that a person may be rightfully compelled to fulfill it.  Broader definitions of harm  In the same essay, Mill further explains the principle as a function of two maxims: The second of these maxims has become known as the social authority principle. However, the second maxim also opens the question of broader definitions of harm, up to and including harm to the society. The concept of harm is not limited to harm to another individual but can be harm to individuals plurally, without specific definition of those individuals. This is an important principle for the purpose of determining harm that only manifests gradually over time—such that the resulting harm can be anticipated, but does not yet exist at the time that the action causing harm was taken. It also applies to other issues—which range from the right of an entity to discharge broadly polluting waste on private property, to broad questions of licensing, and to the right of sedition.  Modern examples  = In US libertarianism = The United States Libertarian Party includes a version of the harm principle as part of its official party platform. It states: = Critique of Harm Principle = Scholars have argued that the harm principle doesn't provide a narrow scope of which actions count as harmful towards oneself or the population and it cannot be used to determine whether people can be punished for their actions by the state. A state can determine whether an action is punishable by determining what harm the action causes. If a morally unjust action occurs but leaves no indisputable form of harm, there is no justification for the state to act and punish the perpetrator for their actions.The harm principle has an ambiguous definition of what harm specifically is and what justifies a state to intervene. Scholars have also said that the harm principle does not specify on whether the state is justified with intervention tactics. This ambiguity can lead to a state defining what counts as a harmful self-regarding action at their own discretion. This freedom might allow for an individual's own liberty and rights to be in danger. It would not be plausible for a state to intervene with an action that will negatively affect the population more than an individual. The harm principle scope of usage has been described as too wide to directly follow and implement possible punishment by a state.

The lunar crater Alfraganus is named after him. Copernicus is said to have used al- Farghani’s calculation of the diameter of the Earth in his own calculations. Life He was involved in the calculation of the diameter of the Earth by the measurement of the meridian arc length, together with a team of scientists under the patronage of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Ma'mūn in Baghdad. Later he moved to Cairo, where he composed a treatise on the astrolabe around 856. There he also supervised the construction of the large Nilometer on the Rawda Island (in Old Cairo) in the year 861.

Works His textbook Kitāb fī Jawāmiʿ ʿIlm al-Nujūm ( A Compendium of the Science of the Stars) or Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions, written about 833, was a descriptive summary of Ptolemy's Almagest, while using the findings and revised values of earlier Islamic astronomers. It was translated into Latin in the 12th century and remained very popular in Europe until the time of Regiomontanus. Dante Alighieri's knowledge of Ptolemaic astronomy, which is evident in his Divina Commedia as well as other works such as the Convivio, seems to have been drawn from his reading of Alfraganus.Mary A.

In the 17th century the Dutch orientalist Jacob Golius published the Arabic text on the basis of a manuscript he had acquired in the Near East, with a new Latin translation and extensive notes. In the 15th century, Christopher Columbus used al-Farghani's estimate for the Earth's circumference as the basis for his voyages to America. However, Columbus mistook al-Farghani's 7091-foot Arabic mile to be a 4856-foot Roman mile, causing him to underestimate the Earth's circumference, believing he could take a shortcut to Asia.Douglas McCormick (2012), Columbus’s Geographical Miscalculations, IEEES.

The poet, interested in the theory of color, reported in his Zweiter römischer Aufenthalt (\\"Second stay in Rome\\"), \\"At the moment I am engaged in something from which I learn a great deal; I have found and sketched a landscape that a clever artist, Dies, colored in my presence; thus eyes and mind grow ever more accustomed to color and harmony.\\" During the Rome visit, Dies also composed music, though later on he apparently destroyed all that he had written, and none of it survives today. At one point, Jacques-Louis David, then composing his Oath of the Horatii (1784) at Rome, wished to take him to Paris. But Dies had reasons for not accepting the offer. He was courting a young Roman whom he subsequently married. Meanwhile, he had made the acquaintance of the engraver Giovanni Volpato, for whom he executed numerous drawings, and this no doubt suggested the plan, which he afterwards carried out, of publishing, in partnership with Jacob Wilhelm Mechau, Johann Christian Reinhart and Johann Friedrich Frauenholz,Prange (2007) the series of plates known as the Collection de vues pittoresques de l'Italie, published in seventy-two sheets at Nuremberg in 1799. According to Gotwals, \\"In May, 1796, Dies apparently eloped with a young girl to Salzburg.\\" The following year he moved to Vienna, and lived there on the produce of his brush as a landscape painter, and on that of his pencil or graver as a draughtsman and etcher. He also taught landscape painting at the Imperial and Royal Academy, and later, in his final post, was gallery director to Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II. During this time his physical condition grew worse, and he even lost the use of one of his hands. As biographer Dies was a great admirer of the music of Joseph Haydn and during his Vienna years he undertook to meet the composer and write his biography. He obtained an introduction from his fellow artist Anton Grassi, who had made a number of busts of Haydn. Over the course of three years during Haydn's old age (starting 15 April 1805, ending 8 August 1808), Dies made a series of 30 visits to the frail and ailing composer, even though Haydn was convinced no one would be interested in his life story. On a number of occasions Haydn was unable to see him, but frequently Dies was admitted and was able to interview him. In 1810, one year after Haydn's death, Dies published a biography based on what he learned in his visits (see References below). This work is organized around the sequence of visits, reporting each in turn. It continues to serve as a substantial source of information on the composer's life. Compared with another biography written at the same time by Georg August Griesinger, Dies's work is almost certainly less accurate and is more likely to have been sentimentalized and embellished, which he himself alludes to in the introduction of his book: > In order not to leave out of the picture the most interesting phase of > Haydn's life, I meanwhile made unhesitating use of several articles from the > Leipzig Musikalische Zeitung, without entirely suppressing my own untutored > opinions., quoted in For instances of probable embellishment, see Mathias Haydn and Haydn and Mozart; for an apparent outright blunder, see Rebecca Schroeter. Dies's translator Vernon Gotwals, comparing Dies to Griesinger, concludes: > It is now clear that for facts about Haydn one will turn first to the > Biographische Notizen of Griesinger, but that reliance upon that source > alone would deprive Haydn's portrait of many authentic details, mixed > inescapably with some imaginary ones. Dies's Biographische Nachrichten is > the work of a sentimental artist who fancied himself a \\"universal man\\" but > whose approach to the problem of biography was that of his time and place. Death In 1787, he accidentally swallowed of lead acetate. He never recovered from the ensuing lead poisoning, which caused the loss of one of his hands, and eventually died in Vienna on 28 December 1822. Assessment Dies is perhaps better known today from his acquaintanceship (e.g. Goethe, Haydn) than from his own merits as an artist or writer. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition gives harsh opinions of Dies's work as an artist: *\\"[In Rome] he became a bold executant in water-colours and in oil, though he failed to acquire any originality of his own.\\" *\\"Lord Bristol, who encouraged him as a copyist, predicted that he would be a second Salvator Rosa. However, Dies did not have the creativity necessary to become a great artist.\\" *\\"With so many irons in the fire Dies naturally lost the power of concentration.\\" *\\"From two pictures now in the Belvedere gallery, and from numerous engraved drawings from the neighborhood of Tivoli, we gather that Dies was never destined to rise above a respectable mediocrity. He followed Salvator Rosa's example in imitating the manner of Claude Lorraine. But Salvator adapted the style of Claude, whilst Dies did no more than copy it.\\" Gotwals writes, \\"Friedrich Noack in his article in the Thieme and Becker Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden Künstler [\\"General lexicon of graphic artists\\"], describes Dies's work as clumsy, mediocre, and prosaic. Gotwals adds, concerning Dies's writing, that \\"his literary style is hardly better.\\" Gallery File:Dies Albert Chr Forum Romanum.JPGThe Roman Forum (1787) Image:Albert Christoph Dies 001.jpgView of the Leopoldinentempel (1807) Image:Albert Christoph Dies 002.jpgGarden Façade, Esterházy Palace (1812) File:Dies Landschaft m d Erziehung d Jupiter.JPGLandscape with the raising of Jupiter See also * List of German painters Notes References =Citations= =Sources= *.

Tyramine acts as a catecholamine releasing agent. Notably, it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in only non-psychoactive peripheral sympathomimetic effects following ingestion. A hypertensive crisis can result, however, from ingestion of tyramine-rich foods in conjunction with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  Occurrence  Tyramine occurs widely in plantsT. A. Smith (1977) Phytochemistry 16 9–18. and animals, and is metabolized by various enzymes, including monoamine oxidases. In foods, it often is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation or decay. Foods that are fermented, cured, pickled, aged, or spoiled have high amounts of tyramine. Tyramine levels go up when foods are at room temperature or go past their freshness date. Specific foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include: * strong or aged cheeses: cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan; Stilton, Gorgonzola or blue cheeses; Camembert, feta, Muenster. Cheeses made from pasteurized milk are lower in tyramine: American, ricotta, cottage, farmer's, and cream cheese. Other dairy products are also lower in tyramine: yogurt, fresh milk, sour cream, soy cheese, soy milk, Harvati cheese, Brie. * meats that are cured, smoked, or processed, such as salami, pepperoni, dry sausages, hot dogs, bologna, bacon, corned beef, pickled or smoked fish, caviar, aged chicken livers, soups or gravies made from meat extract. Some meat products are lower in tyramine: fresh or frozen meat, poultry, and fish; eggs; canned meats or fish freshly opened; luncheon meats except salami. * pickled or fermented foods: sauerkraut, kimchi, tofu (especially stinky tofu), pickles, miso soup, bean curd, tempeh * condiments: soy, shrimp, fish, miso, teriyaki, and bouillon-based sauces. Lower in tyramine: ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salad dressing; vegemite, Pro-mite, marmite * drinks: beer (especially tap or home-brewed), vermouth, red wine, sherry, liqueurs. Lower in tyramine: decaffeinated coffee, tea or soda; club soda; fresh or soy milk; bourbon; gin; rum; vodka * beans, vegetables, and fruits: soybeans and soybean products, snow peas, broad (fava) beans and their pods; raw onions; oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, tangerines, pineapple. Lower in tyramine: most fresh, canned or frozen vegetables; raisins. Raspberries and avocados have moderate levels. * chocolate and mistletoe Most breads (except sourdough), pasta, grains, sweets, and desserts are low in tyramine.  Physical effects and pharmacology  Evidence for the presence of tyramine in the human brain has been confirmed by postmortem analysis. Additionally, the possibility that tyramine acts directly as a neuromodulator was revealed by the discovery of a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine, called TAAR1. The TAAR1 receptor is found in the brain, as well as peripheral tissues, including the kidneys. Tyramine binds to both TAAR1 and TAAR2 as an agonist in humans. Tyramine is physiologically metabolized by monoamine oxidases (primarily MAO-A), FMO3, PNMT, DBH, and CYP2D6. Table 5: N-containing drugs and xenobiotics oxygenated by FMO Human monoamine oxidase enzymes metabolize tyramine into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. If monoamine metabolism is compromised by the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and foods high in tyramine are ingested, a hypertensive crisis can result, as tyramine also can displace stored monoamines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, from pre-synaptic vesicles. Tyramine is considered a “false neurotransmitter,” as it enters noradrenergic nerve terminals and displaces large amounts of norepinephrine, which enters the blood stream and causes vasoconstriction. The first signs of this effect were discovered by a British pharmacist who noticed that his wife, who at the time was on MAOI medication, had severe headaches when eating cheese. For this reason, it is still called the \\"cheese effect\\" or \\"cheese crisis,\\" although other foods can cause the same problem.E. Siobhan Mitchell \\"Antidepressants\\" , chapter in Drugs, the Straight Facts, edited by David J. Triggle. 2004, Chelsea House Publishers Most processed cheeses do not contain enough tyramine to cause hypertensive effects, although some aged cheeses (such as Stilton) do.Tyramine-restricted Diet 1998, W.B. Saunders Company. A large dietary intake of tyramine (or a dietary intake of tyramine while taking MAO inhibitors) can cause the tyramine pressor response, which is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. The increased release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from neuronal cytosol or storage vesicles is thought to cause the vasoconstriction and increased heart rate and blood pressure of the pressor response. In severe cases, adrenergic crisis can occur. Although the mechanism is unclear, tyramine ingestion also triggers migraine attacks in sensitive individuals. Vasodilation, dopamine, and circulatory factors are all implicated in the migraines. Double-blind trials suggest that the effects of tyramine on migraine may be adrenergic. Research reveals a possible link between migraines and elevated levels of tyramine. A 2007 review published in Neurological Sciences presented data showing migraine and cluster diseases are characterized by an increase of circulating neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (including tyramine, octopamine, and synephrine) in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and dopaminergic system. People with migraine are over-represented among those with inadequate natural monoamine oxidase, resulting in similar problems to individuals taking MAO inhibitors. Many migraine attack triggers are high in tyramine. If one has had repeated exposure to tyramine, however, there is a decreased pressor response; tyramine is degraded to octopamine, which is subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Therefore, after repeated tyramine exposure, these vesicles contain an increased amount of octopamine and a relatively reduced amount of norepinephrine. When these vesicles are secreted upon tyramine ingestion, there is a decreased pressor response, as less norepinephrine is secreted into the synapse, and octopamine does not activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. When using a MAO inhibitor (MAOI), an intake of approximately 10 to 25 mg of tyramine is required for a severe reaction, compared to 6 to 10 mg for a mild reaction. Biosynthesis Biochemically, tyramine is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine via the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase.Tyrosine metabolism - Reference pathway, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Tyramine can, in turn, be converted to methylated alkaloid derivatives N-methyltyramine, N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), and N,N,N-trimethyltyramine (candicine). File:Tyramine.svgTyramine File:Methyltyramine.svgN-Methyltyramine File:Dimethyltyramine.svgN,N-Dimethyltyramine (hordenine) File:Candicine.svgN,N,N-Trimethyltyramine (candicine) In humans, tyramine is produced from tyrosine, as shown in the following diagram. Chemistry In the laboratory, tyramine can be synthesized in various ways, in particular by the decarboxylation of tyrosine. Tyrosine decarboxylation Legal status =United States= Tyramine is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States and is therefore legal to buy, sell, or possess.§1308.11 Schedule I  Status in Florida  Tyramine is a Schedule I controlled substance, categorized as a hallucinogen, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the state of Florida without a license at any purity level or any form whatsoever. The language in the Florida statute says tyramine is illegal in \\"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of [tyramine] or that contains any of [its] salts, isomers, including optical, positional, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, if the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation.\\" This ban is likely the product of lawmakers overly eager to ban substituted phenethylamines, which tyramine is, in the mistaken belief that ring-substituted phenethylamines are hallucinogenic drugs like the 2C series of psychedelic substituted phenethylamines. The further banning of tyramine's optical isomers, positional isomers, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers where they exist, means that meta-tyramine and phenylethanolamine, a substance found in every living human body, and other common, non-hallucinogenic substances are also illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. Given that tyramine occurs naturally in many foods and drinks (most commonly as a by-product of bacterial fermentation), e.g. wine, cheese, and chocolate, Florida's total ban on the substance may prove difficult to enforce.

The Pilot ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) was one of the first computers built in the United Kingdom. It was built at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the early 1950s. It was also one of the earliest stored-program computers, joining other UK designs like the Manchester Mark 1 and EDSAC of the same era. One of the earliest general-purpose computers, it was designed by Alan Turing, who left NPL before the construction was completed. History Pilot ACE was a preliminary version of the full ACE, which was also designed by Alan Turing. After Turing left NPL (in part because he was disillusioned by the lack of progress on building the ACE), James H. Wilkinson took over the project. Donald Davies, Harry Huskey and Mike Woodger were involved with the design. The Pilot ACE ran its first program on 10 May 1950, and was demonstrated to the press in November 1950. Although originally intended as a prototype, it became clear that the machine was a potentially useful resource, especially given the lack of other computing devices at the time. After some upgrades to make operational use practical, it went into service in late 1951 and saw considerable operational service over the next several years. One reason the ACE was useful is that it was able to perform floating-point arithmetic necessary for scientific calculations. Wilkinson tells the story of how this came to be. The Pilot ACE was built without hardware for multiplication or division, in contrast to other computers at that time. The ACE started out using fixed-point multiplication and division implemented as software. It soon became apparent that fixed-point arithmetic was a bad idea because the numbers quickly went out of range. It only took a short time to write new software so that the ACE could do floating-point arithmetic. After that, James Wilkinson became an expert and wrote a book on rounding errors in floating-point calculations, which eventually sold well. Pilot ACE used approximately 800 vacuum tubes. Its main memory consisted of mercury delay lines with an original capacity of 128 words of 32 bits each, which was later expanded to 352 words. A 4096-word drum memory was added in 1954. Its basic clock rate, 1 megahertz, was the fastest of the early British computers. The time to execute instructions was highly dependent on where they were in memory (due to the use of delay-line memory). An addition could take anywhere from 64 microseconds to 1024 microseconds. The machine was so successful that a commercial version of it, named the DEUCE, was constructed and sold by the English Electric Company. Pilot ACE was shut down in May 1955, and was given to the Science Museum, where it remains today. See also * List of vacuum tube computers References Bibliography * James H.

Victorian values emerged in all classes and reached all facets of Victorian living. The values of the period—which can be classed as religion, morality, Evangelicalism, industrial work ethic, and personal improvement—took root in Victorian morality. Current plays and all literature—including old classics like Shakespeare—were cleansed of naughtiness, or \\"bowdlerized\\". Contemporary historians have generally come to regard the Victorian era as a time of many conflicts, such as the widespread cultivation of an outward appearance of dignity and restraint, together with serious debates about exactly how the new morality should be implemented. The international slave trade was abolished, and this ban was enforced by the Royal Navy. Slavery was ended in all the British colonies, child labour was ended in British factories, and a long debate ensued regarding whether prostitution should be totally abolished or tightly regulated. Homosexuality remained illegal. Slavery Opposition to slavery was the main evangelical cause from the late 18th century, led by William Wilberforce (1759–1833). The cause organized very thoroughly, and developed propaganda campaigns that made readers cringe at the horrors of slavery. The same moral fervor and organizational skills carried over into most of the other reform movements.Seymour Drescher, Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery (2009) pp 205–44. Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, only four years after the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire. The anti-slavery movement had campaigned for years to achieve the ban, succeeding with a partial abolition in 1807 and the full ban on slave trade, but not slave ownership, which only happened in 1833. It took so long because the anti-slavery morality was pitted against powerful economic interests which claimed their businesses would be destroyed if they were not permitted to exploit slave labour. Eventually, plantation owners in Caribbean received £20 million in cash compensation, which reflected the average market price of slaves. William E. Gladstone, later a famous reformer, handled the large payments to his father for their hundreds of slaves. The Royal Navy patrolled the Atlantic Ocean, stopping any ships that it suspected of trading African slaves to the Americas and freeing any slaves found. The British had set up a Crown Colony in West Africa—Sierra Leone—and transported freed slaves there. Freed slaves from Nova Scotia founded and named the capital of Sierra Leone \\"Freetown\\".Howard Temperley, British antislavery, 1833–1870 (1972). Abolishing cruelty =Cruelty to animals= William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton and Richard Martin introduced the first legislation to prevent cruelty to animals, the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822; it pertained only to cattle and it passed easily in 1822.James C. Turner, Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind (2000) p 39. In the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 \\"fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals\\" was made a criminal offence. The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be used. It prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid. It prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts. The law was extended to the rest of England and Wales in 1854. Dog-pulled carts were often used by very poor self-employed men as a cheap means to deliver milk, human foods, animal foods (the cat's-meat man), and for collecting refuse (the rag-and-bone man). The dogs were susceptible to rabies; cases of this horrible deadly disease among humans had been on the rise. They also bothered the horses, which were economically much more vital to the city. Evangelicals and utilitarians in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals persuaded Parliament it was cruel and should be illegal; the Utilitarian element added government inspectors to provide enforcement. The owners had no more use for their dogs, and killed them.M. B. McMullan, \\"The Day the Dogs Died in London\\" The London Journal: A Review of Metropolitan Society Past and Present (1998) 23#1 pp 32–40 https://doi.org/10.1179/ldn.1998.23.1.32. Chapter: 'A Left-handed Blow: Writing the History of Animals' by Erica Fudge Cart dogs were replaced by people with handcarts. Historian Harold Perkin writes: =Child labour= Evangelical religious forces took the lead in identifying the evils of child labor, and legislating against them. They were angered at the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle- class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. Reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward. The campaign that led to the Factory Acts was spearheaded by rich philanthropists of the era, especially Lord Shaftesbury, who introduced bills in Parliament to mitigate the exploitation of children at the workplace. In 1833 he introduced the Ten Hours Act 1833, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen mills must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights.Georgina Battiscombe, Shaftesbury: A Biography of the Seventh Earl 1801–1885 (1988) pp. 88–91. The Factory Act of 1844 said children 9–13 years could work for at most 9 hours a day with a lunch break. Additional legal interventions throughout the century increased the level of childhood protection, despite the resistance from the laissez-faire attitudes against government interference by factory owners. Parliament respected laissez-faire in the case of adult men, and there was minimal interference in the Victorian era. Unemployed street children suffered too, as novelist Charles Dickens revealed to a large middle class audience the horrors of London street life.Amberyl Malkovich, Charles Dickens and the Victorian Child: Romanticizing and Socializing the Imperfect Child (2011) Sexuality Historians Peter Gay and Michael Mason both point out that modern society often confuses Victorian etiquette for a lack of knowledge. For example, people going for a bath in the sea or at the beach would use a bathing machine. Despite the use of the bathing machine, it was still possible to see people bathing nude. Typical middle-class brides likely knew nothing about sex and learned about their husbands' expectations for it on their wedding night; the experience was often traumatic. Contrary to popular conception, however, Victorian society recognised that both men and women enjoyed copulation. Verbal or written communication of sexual feelings was also often proscribed so people instead used the language of flowers. However, they also wrote explicit erotica, perhaps the most famous being the racy tell-all My Secret Life by the pseudonym Walter (allegedly Henry Spencer Ashbee), and the magazine The Pearl, which was published for several years and reprinted as a paperback book in the 1960s. Victorian erotica also survives in private letters archived in museums and even in a study of women's orgasms. Some current historians now believe that the myth of Victorian repression can be traced back to early twentieth- century views, such as those of Lytton Strachey, a homosexual member of the Bloomsbury Group, who wrote Eminent Victorians. =Homosexuality= The enormous expansion of police forces, especially in London, produced a sharp rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy at midcentury.Sean Brady, Masculinity and Male Homosexuality in Britain, 1861–1913 (2005). Male sexuality became a favorite subject of study especially by medical researchers whose case studies explored the progression and symptoms of institutionalized subjects. Henry Maudsley shaped late Victorian views about aberrant sexuality. George Savage and Charles Arthur Mercier wrote about homosexuals living in society. Daniel Hack Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine covered sexual perversion. All these works show awareness of continental insights, as well as moral disdain for the sexual practices described.Ivan Crozier, \\"Nineteenth-century British psychiatric writing about homosexuality before Havelock Ellis: The missing story.\\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 63#1 (2008): 65–102. Simeon Solomon and poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, as they contemplated their own sexual identities in the 1860s, fastened on the Greek lesbian poet Sappho. They made Victorian intellectuals aware of Sappho, and their writings helped to shape the modern image of lesbianism.Elizabeth Prettejohn, \\"Solomon, Swinburne, Sappho.\\" Victorian Review 34#2 (2008): 103–128. online The Labouchere Amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, for the first time, made all male homosexual acts illegal. It provided for two years' imprisonment for males convicted of committing, or being a party to public or private acts of homosexuality. Lesbian acts—still scarcely known—were ignored.F. Barry Smith, \\"Labouchere's amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment bill.\\" Australian Historical Studies 17.67 (1976): 165–173. When Oscar Wilde was convicted of violating the statute, and imprisoned for such violations, in 1895, he became the iconic victim of English puritanical repression.Ari Adut, \\"A theory of scandal: Victorians, homosexuality, and the fall of Oscar Wilde.\\" American Journal of Sociology 111.1 (2005): 213–248 online =Prostitution= A victim of Jack the Ripper Prostitution had been a factor in city life for centuries. The reformers started mobilizing in the late 1840s, major news organisations, clergymen, and single women became increasingly concerned about prostitution, which came to be known as \\"The Great Social Evil\\".Judith R. Walkowitz, Prostitution and Victorian society: Women, class, and the state (1982). Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely (in his landmark study, Prostitution, William Acton reported that the police estimated there were 8,600 in London alone in 1857). While the Magdalene Asylums had been reforming prostitutes since the mid-18th century, the years between 1848 and 1870 saw a veritable explosion in the number of institutions working to \\"reclaim\\" these \\"fallen women\\" from the streets and retrain them for entry into respectable society—usually for work as domestic servants. The theme of prostitution and the \\"fallen woman\\" (any woman who has had sexual intercourse out of marriage) became a staple feature of mid-Victorian literature and politics. In the writings of Henry Mayhew, Charles Booth, Charles Dickens and others, prostitution began to be seen as a social problem. When Parliament passed the first of the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1864 (which allowed the local constabulary in certain defined areas to force any woman suspected of venereal disease to submit to its inspection), Josephine Butler's crusade to repeal the CD Acts yoked the anti-prostitution cause with the emergent feminist movement. Butler attacked the long- established double standard of sexual morality.Nancy Boyd, Three Victorian Women Who Changed Their World: Josephine Butler, Octavia Hill, Florence Nightingale (1982) Prostitutes were often presented as victims in sentimental literature such as Thomas Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs, Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Mary Barton, and Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. The emphasis on the purity of women found in such works as Coventry Patmore's The Angel in the House led to the portrayal of the prostitute and fallen woman as soiled, corrupted, and in need of cleansing.George Watt, The fallen woman in the nineteenth-century English novel (1984) This emphasis on female purity was allied to the stress on the homemaking role of women, who helped to create a space free from the pollution and corruption of the city. In this respect, the prostitute came to have symbolic significance as the embodiment of the violation of that divide. The double standard remained in force. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 allowed for a man to divorce his wife for adultery, but a woman could only divorce for adultery combined with other offences such as incest, cruelty, bigamy, desertion, etc., or based on cruelty alone. The anonymity of the city led to a large increase in prostitution and unsanctioned sexual relationships. Dickens and other writers associated prostitution with the mechanisation and industrialisation of modern life, portraying prostitutes as human commodities consumed and thrown away like refuse when they were used up. Moral reform movements attempted to close down brothels, something that has sometimes been argued to have been a factor in the concentration of street- prostitution.Judith R. Walkowitz, \\"Male vice and feminist virtue: feminism and the politics of prostitution in nineteenth-century Britain.\\" History Workshop (1982) 13:79–93. in JSTOR The extent of prostitution in London in the 1880s gained national and global prominence through the highly publicised murders attributed to Whitechapel-based serial killer Jack the Ripper, whose victims were exclusively prostitutes living destitute in the East End. Given that many prostitutes were living in poverty as late as the 1880s and 1890s, offering sex services was a source of desperate necessity to fund their meals and temporary lodging accommodation from the cold, and as a result prostitutes represented easy prey for criminals as they could do little to personally protect themselves from harm.  Crime and police After 1815, there was widespread fear of growing crimes, burglaries, mob action, and threats of large-scale disorder. Crime had been handled on an ad-hoc basis by poorly organized local parish constables and private watchmen, supported by very stiff penalties, including hundreds of causes for execution or deportation to Australia. London, with 1.5 million people—more than the next 15 cities combined—over the decades had worked out informal arrangements to develop a uniform policing system in its many boroughs. The Metropolitan Police Act 1829, championed by Home Secretary Robert Peel, was not so much a startling innovation, as a systemization with expanded funding of established informal practices.Norman Gash, Mr. Secretary Peel: the life of Sir Robert Peel to 1830 (1961) pp. 487–98. It created the Metropolitan Police Service, headquartered at Scotland Yard.J.L. Lyman, \\"The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829: An Analysis of Certain Events Influencing the Passage and Character of the Metropolitan Police Act in England,\\" Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science (1964) 55#1 pp. 141–154 online London now had the world's first modern police force. The 3000 policemen were called \\"bobbies\\" (after Peel's first name). They were well-organized, centrally directed, and wore standard blue uniforms. Legally they had the historic status of constable, with authority to make arrests of suspicious persons and book offenders before a magistrate court. They were assigned in teams to specified beats, especially at night. Gas lighting was installed on major streets, making their task of surveillance much easier. Crime rates went down. An 1835 law required all incorporated boroughs in England and Wales to establish police forces. Scotland, with its separate legal system, was soon added. By 1857 every jurisdiction in Great Britain had an organized police force, for which the Treasury paid a subsidy. The police had steady pay, were selected by merit rather than by political influence, and were rarely used for partisan purposes. The pay scale was not high (one guinea a week in 1833), but the prestige was especially high for Irish Catholics, who were disproportionately represented in every city where they had a large presence.Clive Emsley, \\"Police\\" in James Eli Adams, ed., Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era (2004) 3:221–24.Clive Emsley, Crime and Society in England, 1750–1900 (5th ed. 2018) pp 216-61. Causation Intellectual historians searching for causes of the new morality often point to the ideas by Hannah More, William Wilberforce, and the Clapham Sect. Perkin argues this exaggerates the influence of a small group of individuals, who were \\"as much an effect of the revolution as a cause.\\" It also has a timing problem, for many many predecessors had failed. The intellectual approach tends to minimize the importance of Nonconformists and Evangelicals—the Methodists, for example, played a powerful role among the upper tier of the working class. Finally, it misses a key ingredient: instead of trying to improve an old society, the reformers were trying to lead Britain into a new society of the future.Perkin, The Origins of Modern English Society, pp 280–81. Victorian era movements for justice, freedom, and other strong moral values made greed, and exploitation into public evils. The writings of Charles Dickens, in particular, observed and recorded these conditions.Daniel Bivona, \\"Poverty, pity, and community: Urban poverty and the threat to social bonds in the victorian age.\\" Nineteenth-Century Studies 21 (2007): 67–83. Peter Shapely examined 100 charity leaders in Victorian Manchester. They brought significant cultural capital, such as wealth, education and social standing. Besides the actual reforms for the city they achieved for themselves a form of symbolic capital, a legitimate form of social domination and civic leadership. The utility of charity as a means of boosting one's social leadership was socially determined and would take a person only so far.Peter Shapely, \\"Charity, Status and Leadership: Charitable Image and the Manchester Man\\" Journal of Social History 32#1 (1998), pp. 157–177 online References Further reading Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience (1853) * Adams, James Eli, ed.

As its leader, he became the voice of a large part of the dispossessed Algerian youth. Career Madani was born at Diyar Ben Aissa, Sidi Okba, now in Biskra Province. In his youth he joined the National Liberation Front (FLN) and participated in the first day of the Algerian War of Independence, 1 November 1954, by planting a bomb at an Algiers radio facility, but was arrested by the French on 17 November 1954, and remained in jail until independence in 1962. After studying for a doctorate in educational psychology in London from 1975 to 1978, he became a professor of educational sciences at the University of Algiers. Madani grew critical of the FLN's socialist orientation, and in 1989, after the Algerian Constitution was changed to allow multiparty democracy, he co-founded the democratic Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which rapidly grew to enjoy success in the ensuing local elections. Madani contended that the Islamic essence of November 1954 was betrayed by the Charters of Tripoli and Algeria, along with other charters upheld by Houari Boumediene and Chadli Bendjedid. Political positions Madani advocated, on the one hand, the \\"stepwise\\" introduction of Sharia (Islamic Law) and called Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the dominant religious movement in Saudi Arabia, the \\"avant-garde of the reform- oriented Muslim world\\". On the other hand, he declared that his party had no intention to impose the wearing of the veil or to ban women from driving. He named the liberal Muslim reformer Muhammad Abduh as part of the same \\"avant- garde\\" as Abd al-Wahab. In a 1990 interview he said he wanted to suppress \\"usury\\" in banking and to substantially reduce taxes, while he avoided answering a question about the financing of development projects. In 1990, the Algerian Government pushed a new electoral law which was unanimously condemned by all Algerian opposition parties. Protesting against this law, Dr. Abbassi helped organize a general strike and massive peaceful demonstrations in Algiers. An attack by armed forces ended the protest. After the strike, Dr. Abbassi was arrested and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment following charges of threatening state security. The UN Human Rights Committee investigated the arrest made by the military court of Blida, during its 89th session in New York in 2007. The committee concluded that the trial and sentencing of Dr. Abbassi by the military court constituted a violation of article 14 of the Covenant. Retirement Politically, he was widely considered to represent the moderate wing of FIS, contrasted with Ali Belhadj's more hardline views. His positions included free markets, early Islamic education, Arabization of education and government, segregation of the sexes, and sharia-based law. He expressed support for democracy, but with the reservation that it could not override Sharia law. In January 2011, Agence France-Presse announced, in connection with ongoing demonstrations in Algeria, that Madani had fled to Qatar. Madani died on 24 April 2019.

These are mainly slim, small to medium-sized species. The upperparts tend to be pale brown and the underparts are often a shade of pink. Many have a characteristic black-and-white patch on the neck and monotonous cooing songs. The heartland of this genus is Africa, but several species occur in tropical South Asia. As a group, this genus is highly successful; many species are abundant in a range of habitats in the tropics and two now have a much more extensive distribution. The Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) naturally expanded out of its original range of the warmer temperate regions from southeastern Europe to Japan to colonise the rest of Europe, reaching as far west as Great Britain by 1960 and Ireland soon after. It has also been introduced into the U.S. and, as of 1999, it had been reported from 22 states and was still spreading rapidly. Taxonomy The genus Streptopelia was introduced in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The name is from the Ancient Greek streptos meaning \\"collar\\" and peleia meaning \\"dove\\". Also in 1855, the English zoologist George Robert Gray designated the type species as Streptopelia risoria, the Barbary dove. Although Streptopelia risoria has been confirmed as a valid name by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the Barbary dove may be a domesticated form of the African collared dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea). A DNA sequence analysis has concluded that the genus consists of three distinct lineages. One contains the laughing dove and the spotted dove, which have long been recognized as having distinct morphology and behavior. The second group contains most of the other species, except for the Malagasy turtle dove and the pink pigeon, which appear to be the surviving species of an endemic Madagascar/Mascarenes radiation and have at times been placed in other genera. The two-species lineages appear to be each other's closest relatives and cannot be firmly assigned to either Columba or Streptopelia (although overall they seem to be close to the latter). Thus, it might be best to split the two minor lineages off as distinct genera, namely Spilopelia for the first (which, although not having priority over Stigmatopelia, which occurs earlier on the page, is chosen on the first reviser principle) and Nesoenas for the second.  Species  The Spilopelia group (here: spotted dove, S. chinensis) has a multi-spotted neck pattern, unlike other Old World doves The Nesoenas group (here: Malagasy turtle dove, N. picturatus/S. picturata) has a reddish hue and no conspicuous neck pattern; they are found in the Madagascar region The genus contains 13 species: * European turtle dove Streptopelia turtur * Dusky turtle dove, Streptopelia lugens * Adamawa turtle dove, Streptopelia hypopyrrha * Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis * Sunda collared dove, Streptopelia bitorquata * Eurasian collared dove, Streptopelia decaocto * African collared dove, Streptopelia roseogrisea * White-winged collared dove, Streptopelia reichenowi * Mourning collared dove, Streptopelia decipiens * Red-eyed dove, Streptopelia semitorquata * Ring-necked dove, Streptopelia capicola * Vinaceous dove, Streptopelia vinacea * Red collared dove, Streptopelia tranquebarica The genera Spilopelia and Nesoenas were formerly placed in Streptopelia, but have since been separated out to make the genus monophyletic.

When he was six years old an accident to his foot incapacitated him for ten years,https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bilderdijk_willem.htm and he developed habits of continuous and concentrated study. His parents were ardent partisans of the House of Orange-Nassau, and Bilderdijk grew up with strong monarchical and Calvinistic convictions. After studying at Leiden University, Bilderdijk obtained his doctorate in law in 1782, and began to practise as an advocate at The Hague. Three years later he contracted an unhappy marriage with Rebecca Woesthoven. He refused in 1795 to take the oath to the administration of the new Batavian Republic, and was consequently obliged to leave the Netherlands. He went to Hamburg, and then to London, where his great learning procured him consideration. There he had as a pupil (1776–1830), the daughter of the Dutch painter Heinrich Wilhelm Schweickhardt and herself a poet. When he left London in June 1797 for Braunschweig, this lady followed him, and after he had formally divorced his first wife (1802) they were married. In 1806 he was persuaded by his friends to return to the Netherlands, where the Batavian Republic had been replaced by a monarchy, the first king being Louis Bonaparte, a brother of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Louis Napoleon received Bilderdijk kindly and made him his librarian, and a member and eventually president (1809–1811) of the Royal Institute. Bilderdijk also taught the king Dutch, although on one occasion he told his people that he was the \\"Konijn van 'Olland\\" (\\"rabbit of 'Olland\\"), rather than \\"Koning van Holland\\" (\\"King of Holland\\"), because he had difficulty mastering the pronunciation.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bilderdijk_willem.htm After the abdication of Louis Napoleon Bilderdijk suffered great poverty; on the accession of William I of the Netherlands in 1813 he hoped to be made a professor, but was disappointed and became a history tutor at Leiden. He continued his vigorous campaign against liberal ideas to his death, which took place at Haarlem on 18 December 1831. Bilderdijk was the founder of the spiritual movement \\"Het Réveil\\", which tried to give a Christian answer to the ideals of the French Revolution. Among his disciples were Abraham Capadose, Willem de Clercq, Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, and especially Isaac da Costa, who called his teacher \\"anti-revolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian, anti- Loevesteinish, anti-liberal\\".

Educated at Highgate School, University College London and Trinity College, Cambridge, Tansley taught at these universities and at Oxford, where he served as Sherardian Professor of Botany until his retirement in 1937. Tansley founded the New Phytologist in 1902 and served as its editor until 1931. He was a pioneer of the science of ecology in Britain, being heavily influenced by the work of Danish botanist Eugenius Warming, and introduced the concept of the ecosystem into biology. Tansley was a founding member of the first professional society of ecologists, the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, which later organised the British Ecological Society, and served as its first president and founding editor of the Journal of Ecology. Tansley also served as the first chairman of the British Nature Conservancy. Tansley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1915, and knighted in 1950. The New Phytologist publishes regular Tansley Reviews, while the New Phytologist Trust awards a Tansley Medal, both named in his honour. Early life and education Tansley was born in London to businessman George Tansley and his wife Amelia. Although a successful businessman, George Tansley's passion had been education after he started attending classes at the Working Men's College when he was 19. George Tansley later went on to be a volunteer teacher, retiring from his business in 1884 to dedicate himself to teaching at the college. He married Amelia Lawrence in 1863 and had two children – the older a daughter, Maud, followed by Arthur seven years later, in 1871. Tansley's interest in science was sparked by one of his father's fellow volunteer- teachers, who was described as \\"an excellent and enthusiastic field botanist\\". After attending preparatory school from the ages of 12 to 15, he enrolled in Highgate School. Unhappy with the science teaching, which he considered \\"farcically inadequate\\", he switched to University College London in 1889 and studied at the faculty of Biological science, where he was heavily influenced by Ray Lankester and F. W. Oliver. In 1890 Tansley attended Trinity College, Cambridge. After completing Part I of Tripos in 1893, he returned to University College London as an assistant to Oliver, a position he retained until 1907. In 1894 he returned to Cambridge and completed Part II of Tripos, and received a degree with first class honours. Professional career Tansley taught and conducted research at University College London from 1893 until 1907. In 1907 he took a Lecturer position at the University of Cambridge. During the First World War, with very little teaching going on at the university, Tansley took a position as a clerk with the Ministry of Munitions. In 1923 he resigned his position at Cambridge and spent a year in Vienna studying psychology under Sigmund Freud. When he returned to Britain in 1924 Tansley was appointed acting chairman of the British Empire Vegetation Committee. After four years away from a formal academic position in botany, Tansley was appointed Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford in 1927, where he remained until his retirement in 1937. Major contributions Tansley's early publications focused on palaeobotany, especially fern evolution. Tansley founded the botany journal New Phytologist in 1902 to serve as \\"a medium of easy communication and discussion between British botanists on all matters . . . including methods of teaching and research\\". It was named after The Phytologist, a botanical magazine published between 1842 and 1863. In establishing this journal, Tansley's aim was to provide a venue for the publication of \\"notes and suggestions\\"; existing botanical journals only published records of completed research. He remained editor of the journal until 1931. Tansley's introduction to ecology came in 1898 when he read Warming's Plantesamfund (in its German translation, Lehrbuch der ökologischen Pflanzengeographie). Reading the book provoked him to \\"[go] out into the field to see how far one could match the plant communities Warming had described for Denmark in the English countryside\\". In 1903 he learned of the work done by the Smith brothers in mapping the vegetation of Scotland and Yorkshire. The work was initiated by Robert Smith and continued by his brother, William Gardner Smith (in conjunction with Charles Edward Moss) after Robert's death. In 1904 Tansley suggested the formation of a central body for the systematic survey and mapping of the British Isles. This led to the establishment of the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation by Tansley, Moss, William Smith and T. W. Woodhead, with the support of Marcel Hardy, F. J. Lewis, Lloyd Praeger and W. M. Rankin. These eight formed the original committee, with Tansley as its leader. F. W. Oliver later joined the group as its ninth member. The name of the group was later shortened to the British Vegetation Committee. The aim of the group was to coordinate ongoing studies and standardise the methodology being used. The committee met twice more in 1905 and produced a six-page pamphlet, Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation. In 1911 Tansley, in conjunction with the British Vegetation Committee, organised the first International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE). He was inspired by a plant geography tour of Switzerland organised by Swiss botanist Carl Schröter in 1908, which introduced him not only to vegetation types, but also to botanists from other countries. The connections made between Tansley and American ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements helped build a philosophical and methodological link between British and American plant ecology. Other attendees included Schröter, Swedish botanist Carl Lindman, and German botanists Oscar Drude and Paul Graebner. Tansley's book Types of British Vegetation was prepared with an eye to serving as a guide to the vegetation for the attendees of the first IPE. The second IPE in 1913 was hosted by Cowles. This brought Tansley to America. In 1913, the British Vegetation Committee organised the British Ecological Society (BES), the first-ever professional society of ecologists. Tansley served as its first president, and was first editor of the Journal of Ecology, a position he held for 21 years. In 1915 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1923 he was elected president of the Botanical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. At the Imperial Botanical Congress in 1924 he was appointed chairman of the British Empire Vegetation Committee. He served as president of the BES a second time in 1938. William S. Cooper considered Tansley's most influential publications synthesised individual studies into a whole. In 1935 Tansley published \\"The use and abuse of vegetational terms and concepts\\" in which he introduced the ecosystem concept.The term ecosystem was actually coined by Arthur Roy Clapham, who came up with the word at Tansley's request. (Willis 1997) In the 1930s ecological thinking was dominated by the work of Clements, who thought of ecological communities as organisms, and associations as superorganisms. Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment, regarding ecosystems as the basic units of nature. Tansley's interest in teaching led to the production of the Elements of Plant Ecology in 1922, which was followed by Practical Plant Ecology in 1923 and Aims and methods in the study of vegetation in 1926, coauthored with Thomas Ford Chipp. The last book, edited for the British Empire Vegetation Committee, was extremely influential not just in defining ecological methods but in highlighting the need for a complete inventory of the empire's \\"vegetational assets\\". With this information, it would be possible to efficiently manage the vast natural resources of the empire. Tansley's most comprehensive work, The British Islands and Their Vegetation was published in 1939. In recognition of this achievement, he was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1941. During the Second World War Tansley became committed to conservation, and this continued through post-war reconstruction. He chaired a committee of the BES that formulated a policy on nature reserves and led to the formation of the Nature Conservancy, which he also chaired. Tansley's conservation work was the basis cited for his knighthood in 1950. Tansley was introduced to psychology by a former student, Bernard Hart, who worked as a doctor in mental hospitals near London. While working for the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War, he had a dream which was described as \\"one of the major turning points in his life\\" – from this dream came Tansley's interest in Freud and psychoanalysis. In 1920 he published The New Psychology and its Relation to Life, one of the first books that attempted to introduce the ideas of Freud and Carl Jung to a general audience. The book was a bestseller, selling 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom and 4,000 in the United States. In 1922 Tansley spent three months with Freud, and the following year he moved his family to Vienna for a year.

As with many of the 5th-7th century Yngling Kings of Uppland, his historicity is contested. Ingjald is mentioned in medieval historiographical sources including Ynglinga saga, Historia Norvegiæ, Hervarar saga, Upplendinga Konungum, Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar and Íslendingabók. The setting of Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar is roughly the 7th century. Johannes Magnus in his 16th-century list of kings places Ingjald (Ingevallus, Ingellus) in AD 883.  Ynglinga saga  Snorri Sturluson gave an extensive account on the life of Ingjald in the Ynglinga saga which is part of the Heimskringla. = Youth = The Ynglinga saga, a part of the Heimskringla relates that the viceroy of Fjädrundaland was named Ingvar and he had two sons, Alf and Agnar, who were of the same age as Ingjald. Svipdag the Blind was the viceroy of Tiundaland, the province of Uppsala where the Tings and the Yule (Midwinter) sacrifices were held (see the Temple at Uppsala). One midwinter, when Ingjald and Alf were six years old, many people had assembled at Uppsala for the sacrifices. Alf and Ingjald played, but Ingjald found that he was the weaker boy and became so angry that he almost started to cry (which was strange because people named Ingjald were known to be stronger than average). His foster-brother Gautvid led him to his foster-father Svipdag the Blind and told Svipdag about Ingjald's lack of manliness and strength. Svipdag said that it was a shame and the next day he gave Ingjald a roasted wolf's heart to eat. From that day, Ingjald became a very ferocious person and had a bad disposition and breath. Anund arranged a marriage for his son Ingjald with Gauthild, the daughter of the Geatish king Algaut, who was the son of Gautrek the Mild and the grandson of Gaut. Gautrek consented as he believed that Ingjald had inherited his father's disposition. Gauthild's maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Närke. = The deceit = Snorri Sturluson relates that when his father Anund had died, Ingjald became the king of Sweden. The kings at Uppsala were the foremost among the kings of the various provinces since Odin ruled the country, and they were the supreme chiefs of the other kingdoms since the death of Agne and Sweden was divided between Erik and Alrik. The descendants of these two kings had spread, cleared land and settled new territories, until there were several petty kings. In honour of his own ascendance to the throne, Ingjald invited the kings, the jarls and other important men to a grand feast in a newly built hall, just as large and sumptuous as the one in Uppsala. It was called the hall of the seven kings and had seven high seats. Algaut the Geatish king of West Götaland, King Ingvar of Fjädrundaland with his two sons Agnar and Alf, King Sporsnjall of Nerike and King Sigvat of Attundaland came but not King Granmar of Södermanland. The kings filled all seven seats but one. All the prominent people of Sweden had seats, except for Ingjald's own court whom he had sent to his old hall in Uppsala. According to the custom of the time, for those who inherited kings and jarls, Ingjald rested at the footstool until the Bragebeaker was brought in. Then he was supposed to stand up, take the beaker and make solemn vows, after which he would ascend his father's high seat. However, when the beaker was brought in, he took a bull's horn and made the solemn vow that he would enlarge his own kingdom by half towards all the four- quarters, towards which he pointed his horn, or die. When all the prominent guests were drunk, he ordered Svipdag's sons, Gautvid and Hylvid, to arm themselves and their men and to leave the building. Outside, they set fire to the building which burnt down and those who tried to escape were killed. Thus Ingjald made himself the sole ruler of the domains of the murdered kings. = Wars = Granmar won allies in his son-in-law the sea-king Hjörvard of the Ylfings and his father-in-law Högne the Geatish king of East Götaland. They successfully withstood Ingjald's invasion where Ingjald realised that the men from the provinces he had conquered were not loyal to him. After a long standstill there was peace for as long as the three kings lived. However, one night Ingjald and his men surrounded a farm where Granmar and Hjörvard were at a feast and burnt the house down. He later disposed of five more kings, and he thus earned the name Illråde (ill-ruler) as he fulfilled his promise. Snorri Sturluson tells that it was a common saying that Ingjald killed twelve kings by deceiving them that he only wished for peace, and that he thus earned his cognomen Illråde (ill-ruler or ill-adviser). = Downfall = Ingjald and his daughter Åsa Ingjald had two children, a son Olof Trätälja and a daughter Åsa. His daughter had inherited her father's psychopathic disposition. She married King Guðröðr of Skåne. Before she murdered her husband she managed to make him kill his own brother Halfdan the Valiant, the father of the great Ivar Vidfamne. In order to avenge his father, Ivar Vidfamne gathered a vast host and departed for Sweden, where he found Ingjald at Ræning. When Ingjald and his daughter realized that it was futile to resist, they set the hall on fire and succumbed in the flames.  Ynglingatal and Historia Norwegiae  The citation from Ynglingatal does not appear to describe Ingjald as an evil king. It calls his life a brave life frœknu fjörvi: {  :Ok Ingjald :í fjörvan trað :reyks rösuðr :á Ræningi, :þá er húsþjófr :hyrjar leistum :goðkonung :í gegnum steig. :Ok sá urðr :allri þjóðu :sjaldgætastr :með Svíum þótti, :er hann sjálfr :sínu fjörvi :frœknu fyrstr :um fara vildi.  :With fiery feet devouring flame :Has hunted down a royal game :At Raening, where King Ingjald gave :To all his men one glowing grave. :On his own hearth the fire he raised, :A deed his foemen even praised; :By his own hand he perished so, :And life for freedom did forego.\\"  } The Historia Norwegiæ presents a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, older than Snorri's quotation (continuing after Anund): {  Post istum filius suus Ingialdr in regem sublimatur, qui ultra modum timens Ivarum cognomine withfadm regem tunc temporis multis formidabilem se ipsum cum omni comitatu suo cenaculo inclusos igne cremavit.

After a history of equipment with numerous different aircraft types, the squadron most recently operated the Tornado F3 until 2005 when it was disbanded. It was reactivated in 2006 to operate the Typhoon F2, receiving its first aircraft (serial number ZJ931) on 9 October 2006. History =World War I= No. 11 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Netheravon in Wiltshire on for \\"fighting duties\\", receiving two seat pusher Vickers Gunbus fighters in June, and deploying to France on 25 July 1915.Ashworth 1989, pp. 51–52 The squadron's Gunbusses were soon pressed into service, with Second Lieutenant G. S. M. Insall being awarded a Victoria Cross for an action on 7 November 1915 in which he forced down and destroyed a German Aviatik observation aircraft.Guttman 2009, pp. 19–20. The Gunbus was already obsolete however, and was initially supplemented by a mixture of Bristol Scouts and Nieuport 16s until replaced by the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b of similar layout, but slightly higher performance, in June 1916.Franks, 2000, p.28 These in turn were replaced by Bristol Fighters in August 1917, these being used both for offensive patrols over German-held territory and for ground attack for the remainder of the war. The Squadron was disbanded at the end of 1919.Ashworth 1989, p.52. No. 11 Squadron numbered 19 flying aces in its ranks during the war. Among them were Victoria Cross winner Lionel Rees, as well as Andrew Edward McKeever, future Air Commodore John Stanley Chick, Eugene Coler, Albert Ball VC, Frederick Libby, Ronald Maudit, John Quested, Herbert Sellars, Donald Beard, Stephen Price and Hugh Hay Thomas Frederick Stephenson. The twin Eagles on the Squadron's crest, awarded in May 1937, represent the two-seated fighters operated in the First World War.Ashworth 1989, p.51. =Between the Wars= The Squadron reformed at RAF Andover in January 1923 as a day bomber squadron equipped with Airco DH.9As, soon moving to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk. In April 1924, these were replaced by the Fairey Fawn despite the fact that they offered little improvement in performance over the DH.9A, moving with them to RAF Netheravon in May that year. The unpopular Fawns were replaced by Hawker Horsleys in November 1926, in use until December 1928, when the squadron handed the Horsleys to 100 Squadron and was posted to Risalpur in India (now in Pakistan), flying Westland Wapitis in Army co-operation and carrying out punitive air raids against rebelling tribal forces.Lewis 1959, p.17. It replaced its Wapitis with Hawker Harts in February 1932, operations continuing as before. On 31 May 1935, the 1935 Quetta earthquake devastated the city of Quetta and the surrounding area. No. 11 Squadron, along with other RAF squadrons in the region, were used to aid the relief effort following the disaster.Delve 1985, p. 50. The squadron received Blenheim I monoplane bombers in July 1939, moving to Singapore the next month, just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe. =World War II= A left In April 1940 the squadron moved to India, and was briefly based at Karachi before was ordered to transfer to Aden due to the increasing likelihood of war with Italy.Moyes 1964, p. 65.Shores 1996, pp. 13–14. The first of the squadron's Blenheims reached Aden on 19 June 1940, nine days after Italy declared war on Britain,Shores 1996, pp. 17, 22. and flew its first combat mission of the war on 19 June.Shores 1996, p. 24. The squadron was heavily engaged in the early months of the Eastern Africa campaign, attacking Italian targets in Italian East Africa.Shores 1996, pp. 27, 31, 40, 54–57, 59. In early 1941 the squadron was sent to reinforce the Royal Air Force squadrons in Greece, fighting in the Greek Campaign first against the Italians and then the Germans. The few surviving aircraft and crews were evacuated to Crete and then on to Palestine. After reforming, the squadron served in the Syrian Campaign against the Vichy French and later took part in the Anglo-Soviet operation to secure the Persian oilfields for the Allies. After returning to Egypt the squadron took part in Operation Crusader. Redeployed to Colombo, Ceylon in early 1942, the squadron was involved in attacks on Japanese shipping. During 1943, the Squadron re- equipped with Hurricanes and moved to Burma in the ground attack role, supporting the Fourteenth Army. By January 1943, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel, or Australians serving in the RAF, made up almost 90% of the aircrews in the squadron (even though it was not officially an RAAF \\"Article XV squadron\\"). At the time, the Australian personnel included the commanding officer, Wing Commander Harley Stumm.George Odgers, 1968 (orig. 1957), Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

Reforming in Germany during October 1949, they flew Mosquitos, Vampires and Venoms. The Squadron again disbanded in 1957, but reformed in January 1959 with Meteor night fighters. Javelins replaced the Meteors one year later and the Squadron was based at RAF Geilenkirchen West Germany equipped with this type until another disbandment in 1966. Reforming in early 1967, No. 11 Squadron spent the next 21 years flying Lightnings, until May 1988. By that time it was one of the last two squadrons equipped with this aircraft and was based at RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire. From August 1988 the squadron operated the twin seat Panavia Tornado F3 from RAF Leeming. In February 2003 it was announced that some of No. 11 Squadron's Tornado F3s had been modified to carry the ALARM missile (as EF3s) to widen their capabilities to include suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD). Following the publication of the Future Capabilities study on 21 July 2004, XI(F) squadron disbanded in October 2005. The RAF announced that 11 Squadron would be the second front line squadron to re-equip with the Typhoon but would now be based at RAF Coningsby. The Squadron stood up at Coningsby on 29 March 2007, dropping the (F) designation in recognition of its new tasking as the Royal Air Force's lead Typhoon multi-role squadron. In March 2011, 11 Squadron (assisted by some 29(R) Squadron personnel and additional aircraft supplied by 29(R) and 3(F) Squadrons) deployed to Gioia Del Colle, Bari, Italy, to help police the no-fly zone imposed by Resolution 1973 over Libya as part of Operation Ellamy. In 2013 the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean again, this time RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, as part of 121 EAW providing air defence of Cyprus under the auspices of Operation Luminous. XI(F) Squadron resumed the use of its '(F)' Fighter status during its centenary year, with celebrations taking place on 7 and 8 May 2015 in the form of a formal dinner with the Squadron Association, and a parade complete with flypast. During February 2018, the squadron participated in Exercise Red Flag 18-1, the world's largest and most complex air combat exercise run by the US Air Force. For the duration of the exercise the squadron's Typhoons operated from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

The nucleus is situated at the base of the brain, adjacent to the optic chiasm. In humans, the SON contains about 3,000 neurons. Function The cell bodies produce the peptide hormone vasopressin, which is also known as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This chemical messenger travels via the bloodstream to its target cells in the papillary ducts in the kidneys, enhancing water reabsorption. In the cell bodies, the hormones are packaged in large, membrane-bound vesicles that are transported down the axons to the nerve endings. The secretory granules are also stored in packets along the axon called Herring bodies. Similar magnocellular neurons are also found in the paraventricular nucleus. =Signaling= Each neuron in the nucleus has one long axon that projects to the posterior pituitary gland, where it gives rise to about 10,000 neurosecretory nerve terminals. The magnocellular neurons are electrically excitable: In response to afferent stimuli from other neurons, they generate action potentials, which propagate down the axons. When an action potential invades a neurosecretory terminal, the terminal is depolarised, and calcium enters the terminal through voltage-gated channels. The calcium entry triggers the secretion of some of the vesicles by a process known as exocytosis. The vesicle contents are released into the extracellular space, from where they diffuse into the bloodstream. =Regulation of supraoptic neurons= Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is released in response to solute concentration in the blood, decreased blood volume, or blood pressure. Some other inputs come from the brainstem, including from some of the noradrenergic neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract and the ventrolateral medulla. However, many of the direct inputs to the supraoptic nucleus come from neurons just outside the nucleus (the \\"perinuclear zone\\"). Of the afferent inputs to the supraoptic nucleus, most contain either the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA or the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, but these transmitters often co-exist with various peptides. Other afferent neurotransmitters include noradrenaline (from the brainstem), dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. =The supraoptic nucleus as a \\"model system\\"= The supraoptic nucleus is an important \\"model system\\" in neuroscience. There are many reasons for this: Some technical advantages of working on the supraoptic nucleus are that the cell bodies are relatively large, the cells make exceptionally large amounts of their secretory products, and the nucleus is relatively homogeneous and easy to separate from other brain regions. The gene expression and electrical activity of supraoptic neurons has been studied extensively, in many physiological and experimental conditions. These studies have led to many insights of general importance, as in the examples below. Morphological plasticity in the supraoptic nucleus Anatomical studies using electron microscopy have shown that the morphology of the supraoptic nucleus is remarkably adaptable. For example, during lactation there are large changes in the size and shape of the oxytocin neurons, in the numbers and types of synapses that these neurons receive, and in the structural relationships between neurons and glial cells in the nucleus. These changes arise during parturition, and are thought to be important adaptations that prepare the oxytocin neurons for a sustained high demand for oxytocin. Oxytocin is essential for milk let-down in response to suckling. These studies showed that the brain is much more \\"plastic\\" in its anatomy than previously recognized, and led to great interest in the interactions between glial cells and neurons in general. =Stimulus-secretion coupling= In response to, for instance, a rise in the plasma sodium concentration, vasopressin neurons also discharge action potentials in bursts, but these bursts are much longer and are less intense than the bursts displayed by oxytocin neurons, and the bursts in vasopressin cells are not synchronised. It seemed strange that the vasopressin cells should fire in bursts. As the activity of the vasopressin cells is not synchronised, the overall level of vasopressin secretion into the blood is continuous, not pulsatile. Richard Dyball and his co-workers speculated that this pattern of activity, called \\"phasic firing\\", might be particularly effective for causing vasopressin secretion. They showed this to be the case by studying vasopressin secretion from the isolated posterior pituitary gland in vitro. They found that vasopressin secretion could be evoked by electrical stimulus pulses applied to the gland, and that much more hormone was released by a phasic pattern of stimulation than by a continuous pattern of stimulation. These experiments led to interest in \\"stimulus-secretion coupling\\" - the relationship between electrical activity and secretion. Supraoptic neurons are unusual because of the large amounts of peptide that they secrete, and because they secrete the peptides into the blood. However, many neurons in the brain, and especially in the hypothalamus, synthesize peptides. It is now thought that bursts of electrical activity might be generally important for releasing large amounts of peptide from peptide- secreting neurons. =Dendritic secretion= Supraoptic neurons have typically 1-3 large dendrites, most of which projecting ventrally to form a mat of process at the base of the nucleus, called the ventral glial lamina. The dendrites receive most of the synaptic terminals from afferent neurons that regulate the supraoptic neurons, but neuronal dendrites are often actively involved in information processing, rather than being simply passive receivers of information. The dendrites of supraoptic neurons contain large numbers of neurosecretory vesicles that contain oxytocin and vasopressin, and they can be released from the dendrites by exocytosis. The oxytocin and vasopressin that is released at the posterior pituitary gland enters the blood, and cannot re- enter the brain because the blood–brain barrier does not allow oxytocin and vasopressin through, but the oxytocin and vasopressin that is released from dendrites acts within the brain. Oxytocin neurons themselves express oxytocin receptors, and vasopressin neurons express vasopressin receptors, so dendritically-released peptides \\"autoregulate\\" the supraoptic neurons. Francoise Moos and Phillipe Richard first showed that the autoregulatory action of oxytocin is important for the milk-ejection reflex. These peptides have relatively long half-lives in the brain (about 20 minutes in the CSF), and they are released in large amounts in the supraoptic nucleus, and so they are available to diffuse through the extracellular spaces of the brain to act at distant targets. Oxytocin and vasopressin receptors are present in many other brain regions, including the amygdala, brainstem, and septum, as well as most nuclei in the hypothalamus. Because so much vasopressin and oxytocin are released at this site, studies of the supraoptic nucleus have made an important contribution to understanding how release from dendrites is regulated, and in understanding its physiological significance. Studies have demonstrated that secretin helps to facilitate dendritic oxytocin release in the SON, and that secretin administration into the SON enhances social recognition in rodents. This enhanced social capability appears to be working through secretin's effects on oxytocin neurons in the SON, as blocking oxytocin receptors in this region blocks social recognition. =Co-existing peptides= Vasopressin neurons and oxytocin neurons make many other neuroactive substances in addition to vasopressin and oxytocin, though most are present only in small quantities. However, some of these other substances are known to be important. Dynorphin produced by vasopressin neurons is involved in regulating the phasic discharge patterning of vasopressin neurons, and nitric oxide produced by both neuronal types is a negative-feedback regulator of cell activity. Oxytocin neurons also make dynorphin; in these neurons, dynorphin acts at the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary as a negative feedback inhibitor of oxytocin secretion. Oxytocin neurons also make large amounts of cholecystokinin as well as the cocaine and amphetamine regulatory transcript (CART).

The large range extends from southern India and Sri Lanka eastwards to southern China, Indonesia and the Philippines. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the green imperial pigeon in his six volume Ornithologie. He used the French name Le pigeon ramier des Moluques and the Latin Palumbus moluccensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the green imperial pigeon which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba aenea and cited Brisson's work. Brisson believed his specimen had come from the Maluku Islands but the species does not occur there and in 1918 the type locality was designated as the island of Flores in Indonesia. The specific name aenea is from the Latin aeneus meaning \\"of a bronze colour\\" or \\"coppery\\". This species is now placed in the genus Ducula that was introduced by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836. Twelve subspecies are recognised: * D. a. sylvatica (Tickell, 1833) – north India and Nepal to south China to Thailand, and Indochina * D. a. pusilla (Blyth, 1849) – south India, Sri Lanka * D. a. andamanica Abdulali, 1964 – Andaman Islands * D. a. consobrina (Salvadori, 1887) – islands of West Sumatra except Enggano Island * D. a. oenothorax (Salvadori, 1892) – Enggano Island * D. a. polia (Oberholser, 1917) – Malay Peninsula to Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands * D. a. palawanensis (Blasius, W, 1888) Banggi Island (north Borneo) to Palawan and nearby islands (southwest Philippines) * D. a. fugaensis (Hachisuka, 1930) – north Philippines (Calayan, Camiguin and Fuga Island) * D. a. nuchalis (Cabanis, 1882) – north Luzon (north Philippines) * D. a. aenea (Linnaeus, 1766) – Philippines (other than northern Luzon and Palawan) * D. a. intermedia (Meyer, AB & Wiglesworth, 1894) – Talaud Islands and Sangihe Islands * D. a. paulina Bonaparte, 1854 – Sulawesi, Togian, Banggai and Sula Islands The subspecies D. a. oenothorax is sometimes treated as a distinct species, the Enggano imperial pigeon (Ducula oenothorax). The Nicobar imperial pigeon (Ducula nicobarica) was formerly treated as conspecific. Description The green imperial pigeon is a large, plump pigeon, 45 cm in length. Its back, wings and tail are metallic green. The head and underparts are white, apart from maroon undertail coverts. Sexes are similar. The bird's call is deep and resonant, and is often the first indication of the presence of this treetop species. Distribution and habitat D. a. paulina at San Diego Zoo, USA This is a forest species which is a widespread resident breeding bird in tropical southern Asia from India east to Indonesia. It has several subspecies, including the distinctive Celebes form, chestnut-naped imperial pigeon (Ducula aenea paulina). Behaviour and ecology This is an arboreal dove, feeding on plant material in the tree canopy. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It builds a stick nest in a tree and lays a single white egg. The birds are not very gregarious, but will form small flocks.

He apparently died circa 700 CE, in Karelia, at a place called Karjálabotnar (Finnish Karjalanpohja), which may have been the modern Kurkiyoki (Russian Куркиёки; Finnish Kurkijoki; Swedish Kronoborg), in the Lakhdenpokhsky District (Finnish Lahdenpohja) of Russia. 12th and 13th century sources like Heimskringla and Hervarar saga, attributed to Ivar Vidfamne kingship of a wider, historically-unlikely empire that included parts of Norway, Saxony and England.Ivar Vidfamne in: Ivar Vidfadme in: Salmonsens Konversations Leksikon (Danish), Anden Udgave, Bind XII (1922), p. 731 & p. 732 However, no such figure was mentioned in medieval Saxon or English sources regarding the 8th and 9th centuries.  Ivar in the sagas  The Ynglinga saga and Sögubrot make clear that his homeland was Scania. The sagas say that the Danish lands were divided into two kingdoms at the time, namely Scania and Zealand. Scania was ruled by a set of brothers, Guðröðr and Halfdan the Valiant, sons of a Gothic princess called Hervor (or Hild). Hervor's husband was Harald the Old, son of Valdar, son of Roar (Hroðgar) of the house of Skjöldung (Scylding).Flateyarbók, cited in Ellehøj (1965), p. 93. While Guðröðr married Åsa, daughter of the Swedish king Ingjald Illruler, Halfdan's queen was Moald Digra, an aunt of the Anglo-Saxon aristocrat Kinrik (Cynric).Saga Ólafs Konúngs Tryggvasonar, Vol. 1 (1825). Copenhagen: Popp, Chapter 61, p. 110-1. According to Hversu Noregr byggðist and Njáls saga he had a son Ivar, and the same paternity is stated in Ynglinga saga and Hervarar saga. However, Queen Åsa was not content with the state of things, and therefore incited Guðröðr to kill his brother. Later, she murdered her own husband. The Ynglinga saga implies that Ivar had to flee Scania after the murder of his father. After the demise of Guðröðr, he however returned home, while Åsa had to flee to her father in Sweden. Ivar hastily gathered an army and approached Sweden to exact revenge on the murderous queen. King Ingjald was at a feast in Raening with his daughter when he heard that Ivar's army was in the neighbourhood. Ingjald and Åsa then committed suicide by burning themselves and their drunk retainers in the feast hall.Heimskringla, Ynglinga saga, Chapter 43-44 The Ynglinga saga, Historia Norwegiæ, Hervarar saga and Upplendinga Konungum tell that Ivar conquered Svearike after Ingjald's suicide, and later returned to take Denmark. Apart from the Danish lands, he conquered \\"a great deal of Saxland, all the East Country (Austrríki), and a fifth part of England\\".Heimskringa, Ynglinga saga, Chapter 45 Map showing the attributed extent of Ivar Vidfamne's realms. The kingdom of Ivar Vidfamne (outlined in red) and other territories paying him tribute (outlined in purple), as it may be interpreted from the stories about Ivar Vidfamne in the sagas. In that way Ivar conquered much of Scandinavia and parts of north Germany and England (sometimes specified as Northumbria), earning the cognomen Vidfamne (Wide-fathoming).Ellehøj (1965), p. 92. Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated Värmland under its king Olof Trätälja.Heimskringa, Ynglinga saga, Chapter 47 According to Hversu, Njal's saga, the Lay of Hyndla and Sögubrot, Ivar had a daughter named Auðr the Deep- Minded. Sögubrot depicts Ivar in the first place as king of Sweden. It relates that he gave Auðr in marriage to king Hrœrekr Ringslinger of Zealand, in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Hrœrek's brother Helgi the Sharp. Hrœrekr and Auðr had the son Harald Wartooth. Through cunning intrigues, Ivar made Hrœrekr kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Hrœrekr. However, Auðr arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Auðr went to Garðaríki with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king Ráðbarðr, with Harald's consent but not Ivar's. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand.Sögubrot, Chapter 1-2 When Ivar learnt that Auðr had married without his permission, he marshaled a great leidang from Denmark and Sweden and led the fleet to Gardariki to attack Ráðbarðr. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Raðbarð's kingdom, Karelia (Karjálabotnar), he had a strange dream and asked his foster father Hord to interpret it. A discussion ensued that ended in Hord likening the megalomaniac Ivar to the Midgard Serpent. The furious Ivar threw himself overboard in order to get at Hord, who was standing at the shore, and was never seen again. Hord also disappeared in the waves, and it is implied that he was no else than Odin in disguise. After Ivar's demise the chiefs of his fleet convened and agreed that they had no feud with Ráðbarðr, and sailed back to their own lands. Harald Wartooth then returned to Zealand and Scania to assume power over the Danish lands. He subsequently conquered back the territories held by his illustrious grandfather.Sögubrot, Chapter 2-4 The Hervarar saga does not mention any daughter named Auðr. Instead it mentions an Alfhild in the same genealogical position. Ivar gave her to Valdar whom Ivar made subking of Denmark, and she gave birth to Harald Wartooth and Randver, father of Sigurd Ring. In the Lay of Hyndla, dated to the 12th century, Ivar, Auðr, Hrœrekr and Harald appear. Raðbarðr also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them. Strangely, the comprehensive Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus does not mention Ivar Vidfamne, and rather makes Harald Wartooth the son of a Halfdan, himself the son of a Scanian chief called Borkar.Nerman (1925), p. 246. Interpretations The archaeologist Birger Nerman (1925) argued for the historicity of Ivar and a comprehensive but loosely structured Baltic realm in the late 7th century.Nerman (1925), p. This idea has not been pursued by later archaeologists and historians who regard his historical existence as uncertain.Gillingstam (1973/75), p. 55 The story of Guðröðr being murdered by his queen Åsa seems to replicate another story in the Ynglinga saga, about the Vestfold king Gudrød the Hunter who met a similar fate at the hands of his queen Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder. According to some sagas, Ivar Vidfamne was the great-great-great-grandfather of the historical 9th century viking leader Ivar the Boneless.The family line, that links them, is in some sagas listed as follows: Ivar Vidfamne, daughter Auðr the Deep-Minded, grandson Randver, great grandson Sigurd Hring, great great grandson Ragnar Lodbrok, great great great grandson - Ivar the Boneless. Reflecting on this purported lineage, historian Kirsten Møller has hypothesised that Ivar Vidfamne may have been a completely fictitious figure, created around the time of Ivar the Boneless.Kirsten Møller, 1997, Vikingeætten . That is, the dissemination of a figure such as Ivar Vidfamne, ruling over a vast empire more than a century earlier, would served to justify the dynastic and territorial ambitions of Ivar the Boneless and his family.

Anatomically, it is adjacent to the third ventricle and many of its neurons project to the posterior pituitary. These projecting neurons secrete oxytocin and a smaller amount of vasopressin, otherwise the nucleus also secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). CRH and TRH are secreted into the hypophyseal portal system and act on different targets neurons in the anterior pituitary. PVN is thought to mediate many diverse functions through these different hormones, including osmoregulation, appetite, and the response of the body to stress. Location The paraventricular nucleus lies adjacent to the third ventricle. It lies within the periventricular zone and is not to be confused with the periventricular nucleus, which occupies a more medial position, beneath the third ventricle. The PVN is highly vascularised and is protected by the blood–brain barrier, although its neuroendocrine cells extend to sites (in the median eminence and in the posterior pituitary) beyond the blood–brain barrier. Neurons The PVN contains magnocellular neurosecretory cells whose axons extend into the posterior pituitary, parvocellular neurosecretory cells that project to the median eminence, ultimately signalling to the anterior pituitary, and several populations of other cells that project to many different brain regions including parvocellular preautonomic cells that project to the brainstem and spinal cord. =Magnocellular neurosecretory neurons= Magnocellular neurons of the PVN and SON project to the posterior pituitary The magnocellular cells in the PVN elaborate and secrete two peptide hormones: oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are packaged into large vesicles, which are then transported down the unmyelinated axons of the cells and released from neurosecretory nerve terminals residing in the posterior pituitary gland. Similar magnocellular neurons are found in the supraoptic nucleus which also secrete vasopressin and a smaller amount of oxytocin. =Parvocellular neurosecretory neurons= The axons of the parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN project to the median eminence, a neurohemal organ at the base of the brain, where their neurosecretory nerve terminals release their hormones at the primary capillary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system. The median eminence contains fiber terminals from many hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons, secreting different neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, including vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), dopamine (DA) and somatostatin (growth hormone release inhibiting hormone, GIH) into blood vessels in the hypophyseal portal system. The blood vessels carry the peptides to the anterior pituitary gland, where they regulate the secretion of hormones into the systemic circulation. The parvocellular neurosecretory cells include those that make: * Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which regulates ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland * Vasopressin, which also regulates ACTH secretion (vasopressin and CRH act synergistically to stimulate ACTH secretion) * Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which regulates TSH and prolactin secretion =Centrally-projecting neurons= As well as neuroendocrine neurons, the PVN contains interneurons and populations of neurons that project centrally (i.e., to other brain regions). The centrally- projecting neurons include * Parvocellular oxytocin cells, which project mainly to the brainstem and spinal cord. These neurons are thought to have a role in gastric reflexes and penile erection, * Parvocellular vasopressin cells, which project to many points in the hypothalamus and limbic system, as well as to the brainstem and spinal cord (these are involved in blood pressure and temperature regulation), and brown fat thermogenesis. * Parvocellular CRH neurons, which are thought to be involved in stress-related behaviors. Afferent inputs The PVN receives afferent inputs from many brain regions and different parts of the body, by hormonal control. Among these, inputs from neurons in structures adjacent to the anterior wall of the third ventricle (the \\"AV3V region\\") carry information about the electrolyte composition of the blood, and about circulating concentrations of such hormones as angiotensin and relaxin, to regulate the magnocellular neurons. Inputs from the brainstem (the nucleus of the solitary tract) and the ventrolateral medulla carry information from the heart and stomach. Inputs from the hippocampus to the CRH neurones are important regulators of stress responses. Inputs from neuropeptide Y-containing neurons in the arcuate nucleus coordinate metabolic regulation (via TRH secretion) with regulation of energy intake. Specifically, the projections from the arcuate nucleus seem to exert their effect on appetite via MC4R-expressing oxytocinergic cells of the PVN. Inputs from suprachiasmatic nucleus about levels of lighting (circadian rhythms). Inputs from glucose sensors within the brain stimulate release of vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone from parvocellular neurosecretory cells.

The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were formally abolished in England and Wales in 2008. Equivalent laws remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland but have not been used for many years. In 2020, the Scottish Government committed to removing Scotland's from statute in recognition of the fact that blasphemy laws are used to carry about human rights abuses around the world. England and Wales The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. See also Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. =Ecclesiastical offences= The offence of blasphemy was originally part of canon law. In 1378, at the command of Pope Gregory XI, persecution of John Wycliffe and the Lollards was undertaken. However, the only punishment available to the bishops at the time was excommunication. The clergy, dissatisfied with this, forged an Act of parliament, without the assent of the Lords or Commons, enabling the arrest and imprisonment of heretics. In the following year an attempt was made by Parliament to repeal the Act, which prompted a series of prosecutions, and the repeal failed. Not satisfied with their new powers, further were sought and granted under King Henry IV in 1400. These new powers allowed the bishops to arrest and imprison all preachers of heresy, all schoolmasters infected with heresy, and all owners and writers of heretical books. On refusal to abjure (solemnly renounce) or relapse after abjuration, the heretic could be handed over to civil officers, to be taken to a high place before the people and there be burnt, so that their punishment might strike fear in the hearts and minds of others. In April, 1399, William Sawyer was convicted of heresy and put to penance by his bishop. He was again arrested on 12 February 1400, as a relapsed heretic and was convicted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Sawyer was burnt on 2 March, eight days before the power to inflict such punishment was granted. There is a long list of those burnt, or hanged and burnt, between 1414 and 1506. In the 17th century, blasphemy was declared a common law offence by the Court of King's Bench, punishable by the common law courts. In 1656, the Quaker James Naylor was sentenced by the Second Protectorate Parliament to flogging, to be pilloried, branded on the forehead and the piercing of his tongue by a red-hot poker, and thereafter kept in prison on hard labour indefinitely. In sentencing Naylor, the judge, Lord Commissioner Whitelock, makes the distinction between heresy and blasphemy. =Common law offences= From the 16th century to the mid-19th century, blasphemy against Christianity was held as an offence against common law. When formulating his new Church of England's doctrines in the 1530s, Henry VIII made it an offence to say or print any opinion that contradicted the Six Articles (1539).Temperman & Koltay, p. 121. Blasphemy was also used as a legal instrument to persecute atheists, Unitarians, and others. Ever since 1838, blasphemy was considered to be only a crime against beliefs of the Church of England. All blasphemies against God, including denying his being or providence, all contumelious reproaches of Jesus Christ, all profane scoffing at the Holy Scriptures, and exposing any part thereof to contempt or ridicule, were punishable by the temporal courts with death, imprisonment, corporal punishment and fine. In 1656, two weavers, William Bond and Thomas Hibbord were indicted in Wiltshire for atheistic statements. In May of the same year, Alexander Agnew, known as \\"Jock of Broad Scotland\\", was convicted and hanged for blasphemy in Dumfries. Taylor's CaseTaylor's Case (1676) 1 Vent 293, (1676) 86 ER 189, (1676) 3 Keb 607 in 1676 was the first reported case of the common law offence of blasphemy.The Law Commission.

They desired it might be taken notice of, that they laid their stress upon the word general, and did not intend to include disputes between learned men on particular controverted points.\\"R v Woolston (1729) 2 Str 834, (1729) 93 ER 881 In 1841 Edward Moxon was found guilty of the publication of a blasphemous libel (Percy Bysshe Shelley's Queen Mab), the prosecution having been instituted by Henry Hetherington, who had previously been condemned to four months imprisonment for a similar offence, and wished to test the law under which he was punished. In the case of Cowan v Milbourn (1867) the defendant had broken his contract to let a lecture-room to the plaintiff, on discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that the character of Christ is defective, and his teaching misleading, and that the Bible is no more inspired than any other book, and the Court of Exchequer Chamber held that the publication of such doctrine was blasphemy, and the contract therefore illegal. On that occasion, the court reaffirmed the dictum of Lord Chief Justice Hale, that Christianity is part of the laws of England. The commissioners on criminal law (sixth report) remarked that although the law forbade all denial of the being and providence of God or the Christian religion, it is only when irreligion assumes the form of an insult to God and man that the interference of the criminal law took place. The dictum \\"if the decencies of controversy are observed, even the fundamentals of religion may be attacked without the writer being guilty of blasphemy\\" was followed in R v Boulter (1908) 72 JP 188. In the case of Bowman v Secular Society [1917] AC 406, Lord Sumner, echoing Hale's remarks in Taylor, summarized the position using the Latin phrase, deorum injuriae diis curae, \\"offences to the gods are dealt with by the gods\\": blasphemy is an offence against the (Christian) state, and is prohibited because it tends to subvert (Christian) society; offence to God as such is outside the reach of the law. The last person in Britain to be sent to prison for blasphemy was John William Gott on 9 December 1921. He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets entitled Rib Ticklers, or Questions for Parsons and God and Gott. In these pamphlets Gott satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem () comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour despite suffering from an incurable illness, and died shortly after he was released. The case became the subject of public outrage. In a 1949 speech Lord Denning placed the blasphemy laws in the past, saying that \\"The reason for this law was because it was thought that a denial of Christianity was liable to shake the fabric of society, which was itself founded upon Christian religion. There is no such danger to society now and the offence of blasphemy is a dead letter\\". In 1977, however, the case Whitehouse v Lemon (involving the periodical Gay News publishing James Kirkup's poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name) demonstrated that the offence of blasphemous libel, long thought to be dormant, was still in force. During the House of Lords appeal Lord Scarman said that \\"I do not subscribe to the view that the common-law offence of blasphemous libel serves no useful purpose in modern law. ... The offence belongs to a group of criminal offences designed to safeguard the internal tranquillity of the kingdom.\\" The following cases, in particular, were approved by the House of Lords in Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd: * R v Hetherington (1841) 4 St Tr (NS) 563, (1841) 5 JP 496, (1841) 4 Jur 529 * Shore v Wilson (1842) 9 Cl & F 524 * R v Ramsay and Foote (1883) 15 Cox 231, (1883) 48 LT 733 * Bowman v Secular Society Ltd [1917] AC 406, 33 TLR 376, 86 LJ Ch 117 Lord Scarman saidWhitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] AC 617 at 665, HL that in his judgement the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in article 214 of Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, Ninth Edition, 1950, which reads: The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the courts to interpret the law in a way that is compatible with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The offence of blasphemous libel is believed by some to be contrary to the freedom of speech provisions in the Convention. However, just before the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, a claim that the blasphemy law is inconsistent with article 10 of the Convention (providing for freedom of expression) was rejected in the case of Wingrove v UK (1997); a case brought by solicitor Mark Stephens. The Court decided that it was within the state's margin of appreciation for a restriction on free speech. When the BBC decided to broadcast Jerry Springer: The Opera in January 2005, they received over 63,000 complaints by offended Christian viewers who objected to the show's portrayal of Christian icons (including one scene depicting Jesus professing to be \\"a bit gay\\"). The fundamentalist group Christian Voice sought a private blasphemy prosecution against the BBC, but the charges were rejected by City of Westminster magistrates' court. Christian Voice applied to have this ruling overturned by the High Court, but the application was rejected, the court finding that the common law blasphemy offences specifically did not apply to stage productions (section 2(4) of the Theatres Act 1968) and broadcasts (section 6 of the Broadcasting Act 1990). Religion to which the offences relate In R v Gathercole (1838), the defendant was convicted of criminal libel for publishing an attack on a Roman Catholic nunnery. Alderson B., in his direction to the jury, said that \\"a person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is therefore a part of the constitution of the country. In the like manner, and for the same reason, any general attack on Christianity is the subject of a criminal prosecution, because Christianity is the established religion of the country.\\"R v Gathercole (1838) 2 Lew CC 237 at 254, (1838) 168 ER 1140 at 1145 In Bowman v Secular Society Ltd (1917), Lord Sumner said that this was a \\"strange dictum\\" because insulting a Jew's religion was no less likely to provoke a fight than insulting an episcopalian's religion.Bowman v Secular Society Ltd [1917] AC 406 at 460 The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920.The Welsh Church Act 1914, section 1; the Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act 1919, section 2 In 1985, the Law Commission said that the effect of this was that that Church was no longer \\"the form established by law\\" nor \\"part of the constitution\\" of the Principality of Wales, within the meaning of those expressions in the dictum from R v Gathercole set out above. They said that, at that date, there was no authority as to the effect of this, if any, on the law of blasphemy in Wales.The Law Commission, Offences against religion and public worship, Working paper no. 79, 1981, p.32, note 133 In Whitehouse v Lemon (as Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] when it reached the Law Lords), Lord Scarman said that the offence did not protect the religious beliefs and feelings of non-Christians.

Number of prosecutions Before 1883, prosecutions were \\"much more common\\".Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 1999, para 27-1 at p.2251 In the years 1883 to 1922 there were five prosecutions.Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] AC 617 at 635, HL, per Lord Diplock There was an unsuccessful private prosecution in 1971.The Law Commission, Offences gainst religion and public worship, Working Paper No 79, page 18, note 67 The next successful prosecution was in 1977. Individual prosecutions, arrests and failures to prosecute In England the last prominent 19th-century prosecution for blasphemy was the case of R v Ramsey and Foote,R v Ramsey and Foote (1883) 48 LT 739 when the editor, publisher and printer of The Freethinker were sentenced to imprisonment. In 1908, police court proceedings were taken against Harry Boulter for blasphemy uttered at a meeting at Highbury Corner, Hyde Park. An orator with links to the Rationalist movement he was jailed for a month in June 1909 and in November 1911 he was sentenced to three months for repeating the offence. In February 1925, the Glasgow-based radical Guy Aldred was arrested in Hyde Park and charged with blasphemy and sedition. In 1988, British author Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses was published. Many Muslims considered the book to blaspheme against Islam, and Iranian clerical leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for Rushdie's death, \\"along with all the editors and publishers aware of its contents\\". Consequently, the government was petitioned for Rushdie to be prosecuted for blasphemy. No charges were laid because, as a House of Lords select committee stated, the law only protects the Christian beliefs as held by the Church of England. The Rushdie case stimulated debate on this topic, with some arguing the same protection should be extended to all religions, while others claimed the UK's ancient blasphemy laws were an anachronism and should be abolished. Despite much discussion surrounding the controversy, the law was not amended. Michael Newman, a secondary school science teacher and an atheist, was arrested under England’s blasphemy law for selling Wingrove's blasphemous video Visions of Ecstasy in February 1992 in Birmingham. He was forced to resign from his school position due to protests from Christian parents. As a result, he became a subject of discussion in the media, including an appearance on Channel Four’s CommentChannel 4, Comment, 7:50pm[18/08/1992] programme in England.Warren Allen Smith. Who's Who in Hell, A Handbook and International Directory for Humanists, Freethinkers, Naturalists, Rationalists, and Non- Theists, New York: Barricade Books[2000] Proposals to amend the law and protests The Law Commission published a report in 1985 on Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship. The report noted that \\"there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute\\". The authors added that \\"it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit.\\" The Commission concluded \\"that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement\\".The Law Commission No. 145 \\"Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship\\". HC 442 1984-85. A minority report sought to create a replacement offence such that citizens should not purposely \\"insult or outrage the religious feelings of others\\". In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of the poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name by James Kirkup took place on the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square and failed to lead to any prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It suggested Jesus was a homosexual. An earlier reading in 1977 had led to prosecution. Outraged Christians tried to drown out the 2002 reading. \\"We have won an important victory for free speech and the right to protest\\", declared human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. \\"No one was arrested. The police didn't even take our names and addresses. The blasphemy law is now a dead letter. If the authorities are not prepared to enforce the law, they should abolish it\\". A trial would have involved all those who read and published the poem, including several of Britain's leading writers, academics and MPs. After the event, Tatchell said \\"The blasphemy law gives the Christian religion privileged protection against criticism and dissent. No other institution enjoys such sweeping powers to suppress the expression of opinions and ideas.\\"Farewell George Melly (1927-2007), the freethinker On 15 May 2002 the House of Lords appointed a select committee \\"to consider and report on the law relating to religious offenses\\". The committee's first report was published in April 2003; it summarised the state of the law in this area, and found that the present law on blasphemy was unlikely to result in successful prosecution. The committee found no consensus on whether a new law against blasphemy was required, but concluded that any law should apply to all faiths. Home Secretary David Blunkett responded with plans to criminalise incitement to religious hatred, which became the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, and he suggested the blasphemy law might be repealed once the new law was in force. Abolition In January 2008, a spokesman for prime minister Gordon Brown announced that the government would consider supporting the abolition of the blasphemy laws during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The government consulted the Church of England and other churches before reaching a decision. The move followed a letter written to The Daily Telegraph at the instigation of MP Evan Harris and the National Secular Society and was signed by leading figures including Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, who urged that the laws be abandoned. On 5 March 2008, an amendment was passed to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales. The peers also voted for the laws to be abandoned during March. The Act received royal assent on 8 May 2008,Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, see section 79 and Part 5 of Schedule 28. and the relevant section came into force on 8 July 2008.JURIST – Paper Chase: UK House of Lords votes to abolish criminal blasphemy Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 , section 153: Commencement =Statutory offences= An Act of Edward VI (the Sacrament Act 1547) set a punishment of imprisonment for reviling the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It was repealed by the First Statute of Repeal in 1553 and revived again in 1558. The interregnum Parliament in 1650, \\"holding it to be [its] duty, by all good ways and means to propagate the Gospel in this Commonwealth, to advance Religion in all Sincerity, Godliness, and Honesty\\" passed \\"An Act against several Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions, derogatory to the honor of God, and destructive to humane Society\\", known as the Blasphemy Act of 1650 and intended to punish those \\"who should abuse and turn into Licentiousness, the liberty given in matters of Conscience\\".August 1650: An Act against several Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions, derogatory to the honor of God, and destructive to humane Society, accessed 15 April 2016 Profane cursing and swearing was made punishable by the Profane Oaths Act 1745, which directed that the offender be brought before a justice of the peace, and fined an amount that depended on his social rank. It was repealed by section 13 of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Those denying the Trinity were deprived of the benefit of the Toleration Act 1688. The Blasphemy Act 1697 enacted that if any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, should by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, deny that the members of the Holy Trinity were God, or should assert that there is more than one god, or deny the Christian religion to be true, or the Holy Scriptures to be of divine authority, he should, upon the first offence, be rendered incapable of holding any office or place of trust, and for the second incapable of bringing any action, of being guardian or executor, or of taking a legacy or deed of gift, and should suffer three years imprisonment without bail. An Act of 1812–1813 excepted from these enactments \\"persons denying as therein mentioned respecting the Holy Trinity\\". =Relationship between the common law and statutory offences= A person offending under the Blasphemy Act 1697 was also indictable at common law. In Rex v Carlile,R v Richard Carlile (1819) 1 St Tr NS 1387, (1819) 3 B & Ald 161, (1819) 106 ER 621 Mr Justice Best said: Scotland By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment for blasphemy was death, a penalty last imposed on Thomas Aikenhead in Edinburgh in 1697. By an Act of 1825, amended in 1837, blasphemy was made punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. The last prosecution for blasphemy in Scotland was in 1843 when bookseller Thomas Paterson was sentenced at Edinburgh High Court to fifteen months in prison for selling profane placards, According to the 18th–19th century legal writer David Hume (nephew of the philosopher), Scots law distinguished between blasphemy, which was uttered in passion generally in the heat of the moment, and other offences which involved the propagation of ideas contrary to religion. It is blasphemy, Hume wrote The Human Rights Act 1998 applies in Scotland as well as England and Wales, and therefore poses similar challenges to the existing Scottish blasphemy laws as those described above. Additionally, some legal commentators believe that, owing to the long time since successful prosecution, blasphemy in Scotland is no longer a crime, although blasphemous conduct might still be tried as a breach of the peace. In 2005, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service considered a complaint under the blasphemy law regarding the BBC transmission of Jerry Springer: The Opera, but did not proceed with charges. On 24 April 2020, the Scottish Government published a new bill that seeks to reform hate crime legislation to provide better protection against race, sex, age and religious discrimination, and would also decriminalise blasphemy. Humanists UK, which campaigns against blasphemy laws, welcomed the bill. Northern Ireland Blasphemy and blasphemous libel continue to be offences under the common law of Northern Ireland. On 5 November 2009 in the House of Lords an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill was moved, which would have abolished these offences in Northern Ireland, but following a brief debate the amendment was withdrawn. In March 2019, Northern Ireland Humanists, part of Humanists UK, launched a campaign to abolish blasphemy laws in Northern Ireland, following on from the referendum result in Ireland and other recent international efforts to repeal blasphemy laws.

Caillié had been preceded at Timbuktu by a British officer, Major Gordon Laing, who was murdered in September 1826 on leaving the city. Caillié was therefore the first to return alive. Caillié was born in western France in a village near the port of Rochefort. His parents were poor and died while he was still young. At the age of 16 he left home and signed up as a member of the crew on a French naval vessel sailing to Saint-Louis on the coast of modern Senegal in western Africa. He stayed there for several months and then crossed the Atlantic to Guadeloupe on a merchantman. He made a second visit to West Africa two years later when he accompanied a British expedition across the Ferlo Desert to Bakel on the Senegal River. Caillié returned to Saint- Louis in 1824 with a strong desire to become an explorer and visit Timbuktu. In order to avoid some of the difficulties experienced by the earlier expeditions, he planned to travel alone disguised as a Muslim. He persuaded the French governor in Saint-Louis to help finance a stay of 8 months with the nomadic people in the Brakna Region of southern Mauritania where he learned Arabic and the customs of Islam. He failed to obtain further funding from either the French or the British governments, but encouraged by the prize of 9,000 francs offered by the Société de Géographie in Paris for the first person to return with a description of Timbuktu, he decided to fund the journey himself. He worked for a few months in the British colony of Sierra Leone to save some money, then travelled by ship to Boké on the Rio Nuñez in modern Guinea. From there in April 1827 he set off across West Africa. He arrived in Timbuktu a year later and stayed there for two weeks before heading across the Sahara Desert to Tangier in Morocco. On his return to France, he was awarded the prize of 9,000 francs by the Société de Géographie and, helped by the scholar Edme-François Jomard, published an account of his journey. In 1830, he was awarded the Gold Medal by the Société de Géographie. Caillié married and settled near his birthplace. He suffered from poor health and died of tuberculosis aged 38. Early life René Caillié was born on 19 November 1799 in Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon, a village in the department of Deux-Sèvres in western France. His father, François Caillé, had worked as a baker but four months before René was born he was accused of petty theft and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour in a penal colony at Rochefort. He died there in 1808, at the age of 46. René's mother, Élizabeth née Lépine, died three years later in 1811 at the age of 38. After her death, René and his 18-year-old sister, Céleste, were cared for by their maternal grandmother. First trips to Africa In the introduction to his Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo, Caillié described how as a teenager he had been fascinated by books on travel and exploration: > ... and as soon as I could read and write, I was put to learn a trade, to > which I soon took a dislike, owing to the reading of voyages and travels, > which occupied all my leisure moments. The History of Robinson Crusoe, in > particular, inflamed my young imagination : I was impatient to encounter > adventures like him; nay, I already felt an ambition to signalize myself by > some important discovery springing up in my heart. Caillié left home at the age of 16 with 60 francs that he had inherited from his grandmother. He made his way to the port of Rochefort, from Mauzé-sur-le- Mignon on the River Charente. There he signed up as a crew member on the Loire, a French naval storeship that was to accompany the frigate Méduse and two other vessels on a voyage to reclaim the French colony of Saint-Louis from the British under the terms of the 1814 and 1815 Paris Treaties. The four ships left their anchorage near the Île d'Aix at the mouth of the Charente River in June 1816. The Méduse went ahead of the Loire and was wrecked on the Bank of Arguin off the coast of present-day Mauritania. A few survivors were picked up by the other vessels. The shipwreck received a large amount of publicity and was the subject of a famous oil painting, The Raft of the Medusa, by Théodore Géricault. When the three remaining French ships arrived at Saint-Louis they found that the British governor was not ready to hand over the colony so the ships continued southwards and moored off the island of Gorée, near Dakar. Caillié spent some months in Dakar, then only a village, before returning by ship to Saint-Louis. There he learned that an English expedition led by Major William Gray was preparing to leave from the Gambia to explore the interior of the continent. Caillié wished to offer his services and set off along the coast with two companions. He intended to cover the on foot but found the oppressive heat and lack of water exhausting. He abandoned his plan at Dakar and instead obtained a free passage on a merchantman across the Atlantic to Guadeloupe. Caillié found employment for six months in Guadeloupe. While there he read Mungo Park's account of his exploration of the Middle Niger in present-day Mali. Park had been the first European to reach the Niger River and visit the towns of Ségou, Sansanding and Bamako. An account of his first trip had been published in French in 1799. Park made a second expedition beginning in 1805 but was drowned in descending the rapids on the Niger, near Bussa, in present-day Nigeria. An account of the second trip had been published in English in 1815. Caillié returned to Bordeaux in France and then travelled to Senegal where he arrived at end of 1818. He made a journey into the interior to the pre-colonial state of Bundu to carry supplies for a British expedition but he fell ill with fever and was obliged to return to France. In 1824 he returned to Senegal for the third time with the desire to visit the African interior. The Paris-based Société de Géographie was offering a 9,000-franc reward to the first European to see and return alive from Timbuktu, believing it to be a rich and wondrous city. He spent eight months with the Brakna Moors living north of the Senegal River, learning Arabic and being taught, as a convert, the laws and customs of Islam. He laid his project of reaching Timbuktu before the governor of Senegal, but receiving no encouragement went to Sierra Leone where the British authorities made him superintendent of an indigo plantation. Having saved £80 he joined a Mandingo caravan going inland. He was dressed as a Muslim, and gave out that he was an Arab from Egypt who had been carried off by the French to Senegal and was desirous of regaining his own country. Journey to Timbuktu Dressed in Arab clothing Starting from Kakondy near Boké on the Rio Nuñez on 19 April 1827, Caillié travelled east along the hills of Fouta Djallon, passing the head streams of the Senegal River and crossing the Upper Niger at Kurussa (now Kouroussa). Caillié reached Kankan in present-day Guinea on 17 June 1827 travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts. He stayed there for a month. The town was an important commercial centre with a market held three times a week. Instead of having a surrounding mud wall, the town was defended by quickset hedges. Caillié was advised not to travel north along the Milo River as the town of Kankan was fighting for control of the Bouré gold producing area around Siguiri and the Tinkisso River. Instead Caillié left the town heading east in the direction of Minignan in the Ivory Coast. He wished to visit Djenné but wanted to avoid the town of Ségou on the Niger River as Ségou was at war with Djenné. He also feared that he might be recognised as a Christian in Ségou as Mungo Park had visited the town in 1796. Continuing eastwards he reached the Kong highlands, where at the village of Tiémé in present-day Ivory Coast, he was detained for five months (3 August 18279 January 1828) by illness. Resuming his journey in January 1828 he went north- east and reached the city of Djenné, where he stayed 11–23 March. Djenné lies north of the Bani River to which it is connected by a narrow channel that is only navigable in the wet season. Caillié confused the Bani with the Niger River (which he referred to as the Dhioliba). The Bani joins the Niger downstream from Djenné at Mopti (Caillié's Isaca). From Djenné he continued his journey to Timbuktu on a boat transporting merchandise and 20 slaves. After two days they arrived at the village of Kouna where the cargo was transferred to a larger vessel. The boat crossed Lac Débo and then followed the more easterly and smaller branch of the river, the Bara-Issa. At the busy port of Sa they were joined by 30 or 40 other vessels also heading for Timbuktu as travelling in a flotilla provided some degree of protection against bandits. He arrived in Timbuktu on 20 April 1828. In 1550 Leo Africanus described the inhabitants of Timbuktu as being very rich with a king that possessed large quantities of gold. The perception of Timbuktu as a very wealthy city had been fuelled by various accounts published in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Caillié recorded his first impression of the town: \\"I had formed a totally different idea of the grandeur and wealth of Timbuctoo. The city presented, at first view, nothing but a mass of ill looking houses, built of earth.\\" He compared it unfavourably with Djenné: > ... afterwards I took a turn round the city. I found it neither so large nor > so populous as I had expected. Its commerce is not so considerable as fame > has reported. There was not as at Jenné [Djenné] a concourse of strangers > from all parts of the Soudan. I saw in the streets of Timbuctoo only the > camels, which had arrived from Cabra [Kabara] laden with the merchandise of > the flotilla, a few groups of the inhabitants sitting on mats, conversing > together, and Moors lying asleep in the shade before their doors. In a word > everything had a dull appearance. Djinguereber and Sidi Yahya mosques After spending a fortnight in Timbuktu, Caillié left the city on 4th May 1828 accompanying a caravan of 600 camels heading north across the Sahara Desert. After six days the caravan reached Araouane, a village north of Timbuktu that acted as an entrepôt in the trans- Sahara trade. When the caravan left Araouane on 19th May it included 1,400 camels and 400 men. It was transporting slaves, gold, ivory, gum, ostrich feathers, clothing and cloth. Caillie reached Fez on 12 August. From Tangier he returned by frigate to Toulon in France. Caillié had been preceded at Timbuktu by a British officer, Major Gordon Laing, who was murdered in September 1826 on leaving the city. Caillié was the first to return alive. He was awarded the prize of 9,000 francs offered by the Société de Géographie to the first traveller to gain exact information of Timbuktu, and in 1830 along with Laing was awarded the society's gold medal. He also received the Order of the Legion of Honour, a pension and other distinctions, and it was at the public expense that his Journal d'un voyage à Temboctou et à Jenné dans l'Afrique Centrale, etc. (edited by Edme-François Jomard) was published in three volumes in 1830. The next European to visit Timbuktu was the German explorer Heinrich Barth who arrived in 1853. When describing the Djinguereber Mosque Barth wrote: > It was here especially that I convinced myself, not only of the trustworthy > character of Caillié's report in general, of which I had already had an > opportunity of judging, but also the accuracy with which, under very > unfavourable circumstances in which he was placed, he has described the > various objects that fell under his observation. However, Barth criticised Caillié's picture of Timbuktu showing detached houses \\"while, in reality, the streets are entirely shut in, as the dwellings form continuous and uninterrupted rows. No European visited Djenné until April 1893 when French troops under the command of Louis Archinard occupied the town. Death and legacy Caillié died of tuberculosis on 17 May 1838, at La Gripperie-Saint-Symphorien, in the department of Charente-Maritime where he owned the manor L'Abadaire. Caillié is remarkable for his approach to exploration. In a period when large-scale expeditions supported by soldiers and employing black porters were the norm, Caillié spent years learning Arabic, studying the customs and Islamic religion before setting off with a companion and later on his own, travelling and living as the natives did. His opinion of Timbuktu was very different from that of Laing, who described it as a wondrous city. Caillié stated that it was a small, unimportant and poor town with no hint of the fabled reputation that had preceded it. Works *. *. Google books: Volume 1, Volume 2. *.

The Star of Bethlehem is shown as a comet above the child. Giotto witnessed an appearance of Halley's Comet in 1301. The Star of Bethlehem, or Christmas Star,. appears only in the nativity story of the Gospel of Matthew where \\"wise men from the East\\" (Magi) are inspired by the star to travel to Jerusalem. There, they meet King Herod of Judea, and ask him: Herod calls his scribes and priests who quote to him that a verse from the Book of Micah interpreted as a prophecy, states that the Jewish Messiah would be born in Bethlehem to the south of Jerusalem. Secretly intending to find and kill the Messiah in order to preserve his own kingship, Herod invites the wise men to return to him on their way home. The star leads them to Jesus' home in the town, where they worship him and give him gifts. The wise men are then given a divine warning not to return to Herod, so they return home by a different route. Many Christians believe the star was a miraculous sign. Some theologians claimed that the star fulfilled a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link the star to unusual celestial events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus,. a comet, or a supernova.\\"Star of Bethlehem.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. Some modern scholars do not consider the story to be describing a historical event but a pious fiction created by the author of the Gospel of Matthew.For example, Paul L. Maier, \\"Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem\\", in Chronos, Kairos, Christos II, Mercer University Press (1998), 171; Geza Vermes, The Nativity: History and Legend, London, Penguin, 2006, p22; E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, 1993, p.85; Aaron Michael Adair, \\"Science, Scholarship and Bethlehem's Starry Night\\", Sky and Telescope, Dec. 2007, pp. 26–29 (reviewing astronomical theories). The subject is a favorite at planetarium shows during the Christmas season.. However, most ancient sources and Church tradition generally indicate that the wise men visited Bethlehem sometime after Jesus’ birth. The visit is traditionally celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in western Christianity.. Matthew's account describes Jesus with a broader Greek word παιδίον (paidion), which can mean either \\"infant\\" or \\"child\\", rather than the more specific word for infant βρέφος (bréphos), possibly implying that some time has passed since the birth.

So he asks his advisors where the Messiah would be born.. They answer Bethlehem, birthplace of King David, and quote the prophet Micah.. Matthew's version is a conflation of and . The king passes this information along to the Magi.. Matthew's account suggests that the Magi knew from the star that the \\"king of the Jews\\" had been born before they arrived in Jerusalem. They present Jesus with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and as verse 11 describes: \\"they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him\\". In a dream, they are warned not to return to Jerusalem, so they leave for their own country by another route.. When Herod realizes he has been tricked, he orders the execution of all male children in Bethlehem \\"two years old and younger,\\" based on the age the child could be in regard to the information the magi had given him concerning the time the star first appeared. This is presented as a fulfillment of a prophecy and echoes the killing of firstborn by pharaoh in . Joseph, warned in a dream, takes his family to Egypt for their safety. The Gospel links the escape to a verse from scripture, which it interprets as a prophecy: \\"Out of Egypt I called my son.\\" The original is from .

Explanations =Pious fiction= Many scholars who see the gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction..Markus Bockmuehl, This Jesus (Continuum International, 2004), page 28; ; ; Believable Christianity: A lecture in the annual October series on Radical Christian Faith at Carrs Lane URC Church, Birmingham, October 5, 2006. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew is the only one of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy.Nikkos Kokkinos, \\"The Relative Chronology of the Nativity in Tertullian\\", in Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman and others, eds., Chronos, Kairos, Christos II, Mercer University Press (1998), page 125–6.

The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already lives in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus: apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium, Oxford University Press 1999, page 38. Adoration of the Magi, by Jean Fouquet (15th century). The Star of Bethlehem can be seen in the top right. The soldiers and castle in the background may represent the Battle of Castillon (1453). Matthew's description of the miracles and portents attending the birth of Jesus can be compared to stories concerning the birth of Augustus (63 BC).Augustus' mother was said to have become pregnant by the god Apollo and there was a \\"public portent\\" indicating that a king of Rome would soon be born. (). Linking a birth to the first appearance of a star was consistent with a popular belief that each person's life was linked to a particular star.Nolland, p. 110. Pliny the Elder, Natural History, II vi 28. Magi and astronomical events were linked in the public mind by the visit to Rome of a delegation of magi at the time of a spectacular appearance of Halley's Comet in AD 66, about the time the Gospel of Matthew was being composed. This delegation was led by King Tiridates of Armenia, who came seeking confirmation of his title from Emperor Nero. Ancient historian Dio Cassius wrote that, \\"The King did not return by the route he had followed in coming,\\" a line similar to the text of Matthew's account, but written some time after the completion of Matthew's gospel. =Fulfillment of prophecy= The ancients believed that astronomical phenomena were connected to terrestrial events - As Above, So Below. Miracles were routinely associated with the birth of important people, including the Hebrew patriarchs, as well as Greek and Roman heroes.. The Star of Bethlehem is traditionally linked to the Star Prophecy in the Book of Numbers: > I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A Star shall come out of > Jacob; A Scepter shall rise out of Israel, And batter the brow of Moab, And > destroy all the sons of tumult. Although possibly intended to refer to a time that was long past, since the kingdom of Moab had long ceased to exist by the time the Gospels were being written, this passage had become widely seen as a reference to the coming of a Messiah. It was, for example, cited by Josephus, who believed it referred to Emperor Vespasian. Translated by: William Whiston. . Origen, one of the most influential early Christian theologians, connected this prophecy with the Star of Bethlehem: Origen suggested that the Magi may have decided to travel to Jerusalem when they \\"conjectured that the man whose appearance had been foretold along with that of the star, had actually come into the world\\".. Book I, Chapter LX. The Magi are sometimes called \\"kings\\" because of the belief that they fulfill prophecies in Isaiah and Psalms concerning a journey to Jerusalem by gentile kings.France, R.T., The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary, p. 84. See and . Isaiah mentions gifts of gold and incense. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament probably used by Matthew, these gifts are given as gold and frankincense,Isaiah 60:6 (Septuagint). similar to Matthew's \\"gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\\" The gift of myrrh symbolizes mortality, according to Origen. While Origen argued for a naturalistic explanation, John Chrysostom viewed the star as purely miraculous: \\"How then, tell me, did the star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and shed, unless it left that height and came down, and stood over the very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting when he said, \\"Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.\\". =Astronomical object= Although magi (Greek μαγοι) is usually translated as \\"wise men,\\" in this context it probably means 'astronomer'/'astrologer'.Raymond Edward Brown, An Adult Christ at Christmas: Essays on the Three Biblical Christmas Stories, Liturgical Press (1988), p. 11. The involvement of astrologers in the story of the birth of Jesus was problematic for the early Church, because they condemned astrology as demonic; a widely cited explanation was that of Tertullian, who suggested that astrology was allowed 'only until the time of the Gospel'.S. J. Tester, A History of Western Astrology, (Boydell & Brewer, 1987), page 111–112. Planetary conjunction In 1614, German astronomer Johannes Kepler determined that a series of three conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Professor Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces.Minnesota Astronomy Review Volume 18 – Fall 2003/2004 Audio Version of Star of Bethlehem by Karlis Kaufmanis Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.Simo Parpola, \\"The Magi and the Star,\\" Bible Review, December 2001, pp. 16-23, 52, and 54. In 6 BC, there were conjunctions/occultations (eclipses) of Jupiter by the Moon in Aries. \\"Jupiter was the regal 'star' that conferred kingships - a power that was amplified when Jupiter was in close conjunctions with the Moon. The second occultation on April 17 coincided precisely when Jupiter was 'in the east', a condition mentioned twice in the biblical account about the Star of Bethlehem.\\" In 3–2 BC, there was a series of seven conjunctions, including three between Jupiter and Regulus and a strikingly close conjunction between Jupiter and Venus near Regulus on June 17, 2 BC. \\"The fusion of two planets would have been a rare and awe-inspiring event\\", according to Roger Sinnott.Sinnott, Roger, \\"Thoughts on the Star of Bethlehem\\", Sky and Telescope, December 1968, pp. 384–386. Another Venus–Jupiter conjunction occurred earlier in August, 3 BC. These events however occurred after the generally accepted date of 4 BC for the death of Herod. Since the conjunction would have been seen in the west at sunset it could not have led the magi south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. Comet Other writers highly suggest that the star was a comet. Halley's Comet was visible in 12 BC and another object, possibly a comet or nova, was seen by Chinese and Korean stargazers in about 5 BC.Colin Humphreys, 'The Star of Bethlehem', in Science and Christian Belief 5 (1995), 83–101. This object was observed for over seventy days, possibly with no movement recorded. Ancient writers described comets as \\"hanging over\\" specific cities, just as the Star of Bethlehem was said to have \\"stood over\\" the \\"place\\" where Jesus was (the town of Bethlehem). However, this is generally thought unlikely as in ancient times comets were generally seen as bad omens.Mark Kidger, Astronomical Enigmas: Life on Mars, the Star of Bethlehem, and Other Milky Way Mysteries, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), page 61. The comet explanation has been recently promoted by Colin Nicholl. His theory involves a hypothetical comet which could have appeared in 6 BC.Colin R. Nicholl. 2015. The Great Christ Comet: Revealing the True Star of Bethlehem. Crossway. Supernova A recent (2005) hypothesis advanced by Frank Tipler is that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy. Although it is difficult to detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernova remnants have been detected in Andromeda. The Christmas Star As A Supernova In Aquila Another theory is the more likely supernova of February 23 4 BC, which is now known as PSR 1913+16 or the Hulse-Taylor Pulsar. It is said to have appeared in the constellation of Aquila, near the intersection of the winter colour and the equator of date. The nova was recorded in China, Korea, and Palestine.http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1978JRASC..72...65M/0000066.000.html =The Sparkling Star in Aquila in 4 BC= A nova or comet was recorded in China in 4 BC. \\" In the reign of Ai-ti, in the third year of the Chien-p'ing period.

This identifies the date when it was first observed in China. It was also recorded in Korea. \\"In the fifty-fourth year of Hyokkose Wang, in the spring, second month, day chi-yu, a po-hsing appeared at Hoku\\" (Samguk Sagi, The Historical Record of the Three Kingdoms). The Korean is particularly corrupt because Ho (1962) points out that \\" the chi-yu day did not fall in the second month that year but on the first month\\" (February 23) and on the third month (April 24). The original must have read \\"day chi-yu, first month\\" (February 23) or \\"day chi-yu, third month\\" (April 24). The latter would coincide with the date in the Chinese records although professor Ho suggests the date was \\"probably February 23, 4 BC.\\"....http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph- iarticle_query?bibcode=2005JRASC..99...87M&db;_key=AST&page;_ind=1&data;_type=GIF&type;=SCREEN_VIEW&classic;=YES Heliacal rising A zodiac from a 6th-century mosaic at a synagogue in Beit Alpha, Israel The Magi told Herod that they saw the star \\"in the East,\\" or according to some translations, \\"at its rising\\",Matthew 2:2. New Revised Standard Version. which may imply the routine appearance of a constellation, or an asterism. One theory interprets the phrase in Matthew 2:2, \\"in the east,\\" as an astrological term concerning a \\"heliacal rising.\\" This translation was proposed by EdersheimEdersheim, Alfred. The Life and times of Jesus the Messiah. Peabody, (MA: Hendrickson, 1993), several references, chapter 8. and Heinrich Voigt, among others. The view was rejected by the philologist Franz Boll (1867–1924). Two modern translators of ancient astrological texts insist that the text does not use the technical terms for either a heliacal or an acronycal rising of a star. However, one concedes that Matthew may have used layman's terms for a rising. Double occultation on Saturday (Sabbath) April 17, 6 BC  Astronomer Michael R. Molnar argues that the \\"star in the east\\" refers to an astronomical event with astrological significance in the context of ancient Greek astrology.Weintraub, David A., \\"Amazingly, astronomy can explain the biblical Star of Bethlehem\\", Washington Post, December 26, 2014 He suggests a link between the Star of Bethlehem and a double occultation of Jupiter by the moon on March 20 and April 17 of 6 BC in Aries, particularly the second occultation on April 17..For a similar interpretation, see Minnesota Astronomy Review Volume 18 – Fall 2003/2004 Occultations of planets by the moon are quite common, but Firmicus Maternus, an astrologer to Roman Emperor Constantine, wrote that an occultation of Jupiter in Aries was a sign of the birth of a divine king.. He argues that Aries rather than Pisces was the zodiac symbol for Judea, a fact that would affect previous interpretations of astrological material. Molnar's theory was debated by scientists, theologians, and historians during a colloquium on the Star of Bethlehem at the Netherlands’ University of Groningen in October 2014. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich supports Molnar's explanation but noted technical questions.Govier, Gordon. \\"O Subtle Star of Bethlehem\\", Christianity Today, Vol. 58, No. 10, Pg 19, December 22, 2014 \\"The gospel story is one in which King Herod was taken by surprise,\\" said Gingerich. \\"So it wasn’t that there was suddenly a brilliant new star sitting there that anybody could have seen [but] something more subtle.\\" Astronomer David A. Weintraub says, \\"If Matthew’s wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn’t guide them; it only told them when to set out.\\" There is an explanation given that the events were quite close to the sun and would not have been visible to the naked eye..  Royal celestial signs centered on the cycle of MUL.BABBAR/Jupiter  Another theory connects the star to a series of highly symbolic, but generally unspectacular celestial events involving the planet Jupiter.Barthel, Peter and Van Kooten, George, eds. The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi: Interdisciplinary Perspectives from Experts on the Ancient Near East, the Greco-Roman World, and Modern Astronomy, (Leiden: Brill, 2015), p. 4.Hutchison, Dwight, “Matthew’s Magi Never Visually Followed a Star Anywhere, But …” Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, Volume 71 Number 3, September 2019, pp. 162-175. Babylonian astronomers usually referred to the planet as MUL.BABBAR, meaning the \\"White Star.\\"Sachs, Abraham, and Hunger, Hermann Astronomical Diaries and Related Texts from Babylonia, (Vienna: Verlag Der OÌsterreichischen Akademie Der Wissenschaften, 1988-2014), MUL.BABBAR is used throughout the series, Vol. I-VII (see examples in Vol. III pages: 12, 26, 30, 34, 40, 42).Evans, James The History & Practice of Ancient Astronomy. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 321. A series of symbolically royal celestial events, which were centered on the planet's annual cycle,Jupiter's synodic cycle is composed of the following: heliacal rising, the first station, the acronycal rising, second station, and heliacal setting. See Swerdlow, N. M. The Babylonian Theory of the Planets, (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1998),24. could have been associated with Judaism and the Messiah. D. Hutchison has made a thorough analysis of the symbolically royal astronomical events visible from Babylonia.Elchert, Ken, “Prophecy, Jupiter, and the Dead Sea Scrolls,” Griffith (Observatory) Observer, Vol. 82, N° 6, June 2018, pp. 10-11.Hutchison, pp. 167-172. According to the theory, the star was not a guiding light. Matthew's wise men never visually followed anything, anywhere, at any moment. The star was given to inform, not to guide. The Magi were not present with the shepherds at the time of Jesus's birth. They arrived in Judea about a year and a half after the first celestial signs.Hutchison, pp. 164-165.Barthel and Van Kooten, p. 4. After an initial series of celestial signs involving the star, the wise men journeyed from the East to Judea and Bethlehem in the daytime. However, after their arrival in Bethlehem, the wise men made a new, unexpected association with the star. The star “preceded” the men from the East in a manner similar to how Jesus preceded his disciples to Galilee after his resurrection, not visually, but chronologically (Matthew 26:32, 28:7).Hutchison, pp. 172-173. The star did not indicate a specific house,See Hutchison in Barthel and Van Kooten, p. 4 and p. 115. but after a careful search, the Magi discovered the child who was about one year old.

The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court.

Religious interpretations =Eastern Orthodoxy= Russian icon of the Nativity. The Star of Bethlehem is depicted at the center top as a dark semicircle, with a single ray coming down. In the Orthodox Church, the Star of Bethlehem is interpreted as a miraculous event of symbolic and pedagogical significance, regardless of whether it coincides with a natural phenomenon; a sign sent by God to lead the Magi to the Christ Child. This is illustrated in the Troparion of the Nativity: > Your birth, O Christ our God, dawned the light of knowledge upon the earth. > For by Your birth those who adored stars were taught by a star to worship > You, the Sun of Justice, and to know You, Orient from on High. O Lord, glory > to You. In Orthodox Christian iconography, the Star of Bethlehem is often depicted not as golden, but as a dark aureola, a semicircle at the top of the icon, indicating the Uncreated Light of Divine grace, with a ray pointing to \\"the place where the young child lay\\" (). Sometimes the faint image of an angel is drawn inside the aureola. Simon the Athonite founded the monastery of Simonopetra on Mount Athos after seeing a star he identified with the Star of Bethlehem.Venerable Simon the Myrrh-gusher of Mt Athos at oca.org, accessed 31 October 2017. =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints= LDS members believe that the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world over. In the Book of Mormon, which they believe contains writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear as a sign that Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the fulfillment of this prophecy.; =Jehovah's Witnesses= Members of Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the \\"star\\" was a vision or sign created by Satan, rather than a sign from God. This is because it led the pagan astrologers first to Jerusalem where King Herod consequently found out about the birth of the \\"king of the Jews\\", with the result that he attempted to have Jesus killed.Jesus—The Way, the Truth, the Life, ch. 7: Astrologers Visit Jesus =Seventh-day Adventist= In The Desire of Ages, Ellen White states \\"That star was a distant company of shining angels, but of this the wise men were ignorant.\\"The Desire of Ages, pp. 60. Depiction in art Woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld, 1860 Paintings and other pictures of the Adoration of the Magi may include a depiction of the star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the tapestry of the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel. The colourful star lantern known as a paról is a cherished and ubiquitous symbol of Christmas for Filipinos, its design and light recalling the star. In its basic form, the paról has five points and two \\"tails\\" that evoke rays of light pointing the way to the Christ Child, and candles inside the lanterns have been superseded by electric illumination. In the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, a silver star with 14 undulating rays marks the location traditionally claimed to be that of Jesus' birth. In quilting, a common eight-pointed star design is known as the Star of Bethlehem.

Early life Harding was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 5, 1799, a son of George Harding and Mary (née Hudd) Harding. His father was one of four brothers who emigrated from England to Canada and then to Philadelphia where he became a ship's carpenter and acquired significant property. Career After being educated in the local schools, Harding learned the printing trade from the publisher Enos Bronson. After first starting his career in the office of the United States Gazette he started his own business in 1815 at the age of 16. Eleven years later, in November 1829, he purchased the Pennsylvania Inquirer newspaper from John Norvell and John R. Walker. About the same time he began printing Bibles and became the largest publisher of Bibles in the U.S. Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson, Harding attempted to simultaneously support Jackson while also defending the directors of the Bank of the United States, which Jackson fiercely opposed. Harding later switched support (and his newspaper's editorial stance) to the anti-Jackson faction within the Democratic-Republican Party and in 1836 supported the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison for president. After this, Harding's newspaper became an advocate for the cause of the Whig party, until it was weakened by internal divisions in 1852. Harding also manufactured paper at a manufacturing plant in Trenton, New Jersey in what was the largest paper mill in the United States, along with a large iron works in Trenton. Harding merged the Pennsylvania Inquirer with the Daily Courier in 1839, and for a while the paper was known as The Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier. In 1845, it was called The Pennsylvania Inquirer and National Gazette. Harding retired from publishing in 1859, succeeded by his son William White Harding, who changed the paper's name to the present The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1860. At the time of his death he was Collector of United States Internal Revenue for the First District. Personal life Harding was married to Maria Wilson (1798–1862), a daughter of Dr. Wilson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Together, they were the parents of six children, including: * George Harding (1827–1902), who became a patent lawyer and argued several cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and who married Charlotte Ludlow Kenner (1839–1890). * William White Harding (1830–1889), who succeeded his father as publisher of the paper who married Catharine Badger Hart (1838–1924). * James Barclay Harding (1830–1865), who married Georgiana Maria Gallagher (1838–1905). His wife died on June 2, 1862. Harding died on August 21, 1865 at the residence of his eldest son in Chestnut Hill. In his obituary in The New York Times, he was referred to as \\"one of the oldest and best known publishers in the United States.\\" =Descendants= Through his son William, he was a grandfather of Jessie Harding Morris (1865–1952), wife of Alfred Hennen Morris, and J.

Theo completed an apprenticeship in his mother's store, while Karl worked in a delicatessen shop. Karl served in the Wehrmacht during World War II and was wounded on the Eastern Front. After the war, the brothers jointly took over their mother's business and founded Albrecht KG. In 1960, the brothers had a disagreement over whether to stock cigarettes. While Theo wanted to sell them, Karl believed they would attract shoplifters. As a result, they divided their stores into two parts, with Theo retaining all stores north of the Ruhr, while Karl retained all stores south of the Ruhr.

Looking back towards Polzeath from the thumb The South West Coast Path runs from Daymer Bay in the South through Polzeath and up to Pentire Head in the North. Geography The catchment surrounding Polzeath is approximately 40,900 hectares and is drained by several streams. The Polzeath Brook stream rises near St Minver to the east, and with several tributaries drains farmland before flowing through the middle of the Valley Caravan Park campsite and into the sea across Polzeath beach. The Trenant Stream is 900m long and also crosses the beach, this time entering from the north east corner. There is also a small stream one and a half kilometres long, which flows onto Pentireglaze beach (also known as Baby Bay) which is at the northern end of Polzeath beach but is separated from it at high tide by Slipper Point. Shilla Mill at the edge of Polzeath, stands at the confluence of the streams. Built around 1590 it ceased working as a mill in 1885 and was converted into a house. History In 1911 a Methodist chapel was built on the road towards Trebetherick at Chapel Corner. The original building was demolished in 1932 when the village street was widened and a new chapel was opened on 15 April 1933. Since 2006 the chapel has been called the Tubestation and is an active church with services every Sunday. The rest of the week it is a surfers cafe. https://tubestation.org/ Until 1934 the main street through the village crossed the stream by means of a ford and a footbridge was provided for pedestrians although this was sometimes washed away by winter storms. For vehicles the road surface stopped short of the ford and cars splashed through the water on a sandy area occasionally causing vehicles to become stuck in the sand. In 1934 the current road bridge was built with a low wall separating the road from the sandy beach. The winter storms of 2014 changed the topography of the beach creating a sand bar up to 1m high located at approximately the high tide mark, a feature that was not previously recorded. This was gradually washed away so that by 2019 the beach had returned to the even slope visible in pictures up to 2014.

Dutch-language literature is the produce of Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, the Netherlands Antilles and of formerly Dutch-speaking regions, such as French Flanders, South Africa, and Indonesia. The Dutch East Indies, as Indonesia was called under Dutch colonization, spawned a separate subsection in Dutch-language literature.Nieuwenhuys, Rob Mirror of the Indies: A History of Dutch Colonial Literature - translated from Dutch by E. M. Beekman (Publisher: Periplus, 1999) Beekman E.M. Fugitive dreams: an anthology of Dutch colonial literature (Publisher: University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, 1988) Conversely, Dutch-language literature sometimes was and is produced by people originally from abroad who came to live in Dutch-speaking regions, such as Anne Frank and Kader Abdolah. In its earliest stages, Dutch-language literature is defined as those pieces of literary merit written in one of the Dutch dialects of the Low Countries. Before the 17th century, there was no unified standard language; the dialects that are considered Dutch evolved from Old Frankish. A separate Afrikaans literature started to emerge during the 19th century, and it shares the same literary roots as contemporary Dutch, as Afrikaans evolved from 17th-century Dutch. The term Dutch literature may either indicate in a narrow sense literature from the Netherlands, or alternatively Dutch-language literature (as it is understood in this article). Until the end of the 11th century, Dutch literature, like literature elsewhere in Europe, was almost entirely oral and in the form of poetry. In the 12th and 13th century, writers starting writing chivalric romances and hagiographies for noblemen. From the 13th century, literature became more didactic and developed a proto-national character, as it was written for the bourgeoisie. With the close of the 13th century a change appeared in Dutch literature. The Flemish and Hollandic towns began to prosper and a new sort of literary expression began. Around 1440, literary guilds called rederijkerskamers (\\"Chambers of Rhetoric\\") arose which were usually middle-class in tone. Of these chambers, the earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle plays for the people. Anna Bijns (c. 1494–1575) is an important figure who wrote in modern Dutch. The Reformation appeared in Dutch literature in a collection of Psalm translations in 1540 and in a 1566 New Testament translation in Dutch. The best-known of all Dutch writers is the Catholic playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679). During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Low Countries had gone through major political upheaval. The most prominent writers were Willem Bilderdijk (1756–1831), Hiëronymus van Alphen (1746–1803), and Rhijnvis Feith (1753–1824). Piet Paaltjens (ps. of François Haverschmidt, 1835–1894) is one of the very few readable nineteenth-century poets, representing in Dutch the Romantic vein exemplified by Heine. A new movement called Tachtigers or \\"Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty\\", after the decade in which it arose. One of the most important historical writers of the 20th century was Johan Huizinga, who is known abroad and translated in different languages and included in several great books lists. During the 1920s, a new group of writers who distanced themselves from the ornate style of the Movement of 1880 arose, led by Nescio (J.H.F. Grönloh, 1882–1961). During WW II, influential writers included Anne Frank (whose diary was published posthumously) died in a German concentration camp, as did crime fiction writer, journalist and poet Jan Campert. Writers who had lived through the atrocities of the Second World War reflected in their works on the changed perception of reality. Obviously many looked back on their experiences the way Anne Frank had done in her Diary, this was the case with Het bittere kruid (The bitter herb) of Marga Minco, and Kinderjaren (Childhood) of Jona Oberski. The renewal, which in literary history would be described as \\"ontluisterend realisme\\" (shocking realism), is mainly associated with three authors: Gerard Reve, W.F. Hermans and Anna Blaman. Reve and Hermans are often cited together with Harry Mulisch as the \\"Big Three\\" of Dutch postwar literature. Old Dutch texts (500–1150) Around 500 AD, Old Frankish evolved to Old Dutch, a West Germanic language that was spoken by the Franks and to a lesser extent by people living in the regions conquered by the Franks. Until the end of the 11th century, Dutch literature - like literature elsewhere in Europe - was almost entirely oral and in the form of poetry, as this helped troubadours remembering and reciting their texts. Scientific and religious texts were written in Latin and as a consequence most texts written in the Netherlands were written in Latin rather than Old Dutch. Extant Dutch texts from this period are rare. In the earliest stages of the Dutch language, a considerable degree of mutual intelligibility with most other West Germanic dialects was present, and some fragments and authors can be claimed by both Dutch and German literature. Examples include the 10th-century Wachtendonck Psalms, a West Low Franconian translation of some of the Psalms on the threshold of what is considered Dutch, and the 12th-century County of Loon poet Henric van Veldeke (1150 – after 1184). =The Leiden Willeram= The Leiden Willeram is the name given to a manuscript containing a Low Franconian version of the Old High German commentary on Song of Solomon by the German abbot Williram of Ebersberg (ultimately by Isidore of Seville). Until recently, based on its orthography and phonology the text of this manuscript was believed by most scholars to be Middle Franconian, that is Old High German, with some Limburgic or otherwise Franconian admixtures. But in 1974, the German philologist Willy Sanders proved in his study Der Leidener Willeram that the text actually represents an imperfect attempt by a scribe from the northwestern coastal area of the Low Countries to translate the East Franconian original into his local vernacular. The text contains many Old Dutch words not known in Old High German, as well as mistranslated words caused by the scribe's unfamiliarity with some Old High German words in the original he translated, and a confused orthography heavily influenced by the Old High German original. For instance, the grapheme is used after the High German tradition where it represents Germanic t shifted to . Sanders also proved that the manuscript, now in the University Library of Leiden University, was written at the end of the 11th century in the Abbey of Egmond in modern North Holland, whence the manuscript's other name Egmond Willeram. =Hebban olla vogala= The oldest known poetry was written by a West-Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England around 1100: hebban olla vogala nestas bagunnan hinase hic enda thu wat unbidan we nu (\\"All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for\\"). According to professor Luc de Grauwe the text could equally well be Old English, more specifically Old Kentish, though there is no consensus on this hypothesis. At that time, Old (West) Dutch and Old English were very similar. =The Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible= Another important source for Old Dutch is the so-called Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible (Dutch: Rijnlandse Rijmbijbel and German: Rheinische Reimbibel). This is a verse translation of biblical histories, attested only in a series of fragments, which was composed in a mixed dialect containing Low German, Old Dutch and High German (Rhine-Franconian) elements.David A. Wells, The \\"Central Franconian Rhyming Bible\\" (\\"Mittelfränkische Reimbibel\\"): An early-twelfth- century German verse homiliary. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2004. It was likely composed in north-west Germany in the early 12th century, possibly in Werden Abbey, near Essen. Middle Dutch literature (1150–1500) In the 12th and 13th century, writers starting writing chivalric romances and hagiographies (i.e. stories about the lives of saints) for paying noblemen. From the 13th century, literature became more didactic and developed a proto-national character. The primary audience was no longer the nobility, but the bourgeoisie. The growing importance of the Southern Low Countries resulted in most works being written in Brabant, Flanders and Limburg. In the first stages of Dutch literature, poetry was the predominant form of literary expression. It was both in the Low Countries and the rest of Europe that courtly romance and poetry were popular literary genres during the Middle Ages. One Minnesanger was the aforementioned Van Veldeke, the first Dutch-language writer known by name, who also wrote epic poetry and hagiographies.http://users.telenet.be/gaston.d.haese/heinric_van_veldeken.html The chivalric romance was a popular genre as well, often featuring King Arthur or Charlemagne as protagonist. As the political and cultural emphasis at the time lay in the southern provinces, most of the works handed down from the early Middle Ages were written in southern Low Franconian dialects such as Limburgish, Flemish and Brabantic. The first Dutch language writer known by name is Van Veldeke, who wrote courtly love poetry, and epics. Beatrice of Nazareth (1200–1268) was the first known prose writer in the Dutch language, the author of the Seven Ways of Holy Love. The Brussels friar Jan van Ruusbroec (better known in English as the Blessed John of Ruysbroeck, 1293/4–1381) followed Beatrice in taking prose out of the economic and political realms and using it for literary purposes. He wrote sermons filled with mystic thought. A number of the surviving Dutch language epic works, especially the courtly romances, were copies from or expansions of earlier German or French efforts, but there are examples of truly original works (such as the anonymous Karel ende Elegast) and even Dutch-language works that formed the basis for version in other languages (such as the morality play Elckerlijc that formed the basis for Everyman (play)). Another genre popular in the Middle Ages was the fable, and the most elaborate fable produced by Dutch literature was an expanded adaptation of the Reynard the Fox tale, Vanden vos Reynaerde (\\"Of Reynard the Fox\\"), written around 1250 by a person only identified as Willem. Until the 13th century, the Middle Dutch language output mainly serviced the aristocratic and monastic orders, recording the traditions of chivalry and of religion, but scarcely addressed the bulk of the population. With the close of the 13th century a change appeared in Dutch literature. The Flemish and Hollandic towns began to prosper and to assert their commercial supremacy over the North Sea, and these cities won privileges amounting almost to political independence. With this liberty there arose a new sort of literary expression. Jacob van Maerlant The most important exponent of this new development was Jacob van Maerlant (~1235–~1300), a Flemish scholar who worked in Holland for part of his career. His key works are Der Naturen Bloeme (\\"The Flower of Nature\\", c. 1263), a collection of moral and satirical addresses to all classes of society, and De Spieghel Historiael (\\"The Mirror of History\\", c. 1284). Van Maerlant straddles the cultural divide between the northern and southern provinces. Up until now, the northern provinces had produced little of worth, and this would largely remain the case until the fall of Antwerp during the Eighty Years' War shifted focus to Amsterdam. He is sometimes referred to as the \\"father of Dutch poetry\\", \\"a title he merits for productivity if for no other reason.\\" Around 1440, literary guilds called rederijkerskamers (\\"Chambers of Rhetoric\\") arose. These guilds, whose members called themselves Rederijkers or \\"Rhetoricians\\", were in almost all cases middle-class in tone, and opposed to aristocratic ideas and tendencies in thought. Of these chambers, the earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle plays for the people. Soon their influence grew until no festival or procession could take place in a town unless the Chamber patronized it. The Chambers' plays very rarely dealt with historical or even Biblical personages, but entirely with allegorical and moral abstractions and were didactic in nature. The most notable examples of Rederijker theatre include Mariken van Nieumeghen (\\"Mary of Nijmegen\\") and Elckerlijc (which was translated into English as Everyman). At the close of the early period, Anna Bijns (c. 1494–1575) stands as a transitional figure. Bijns was an Antwerp schoolmistress and lay nun whose main targets were the faith and character of Luther. In her first volume of poetry (1528) the Lutherans are scarcely mentioned and focus lies on her personal experience of faith, but in that of 1538 one finds sharp words for the Lutherans on every page. With the writings of Bijns, the period of Middle Dutch closes and the modern Dutch begins (see also History of the Dutch language). Renaissance and the Golden Age (1550–1670) The first ripples of the Reformation appeared in Dutch literature in a collection of Psalm translations printed at Antwerp in 1540 under the title of Souter-Liedekens (\\"Psalter Songs\\"). For the Protestant congregations, Jan Utenhove printed a volume of Psalms in 1566 and made the first attempt at a New Testament translation in Dutch. Very different in tone were the battle songs sung by the Reformers, the Gueux songs. The famous songbook of 1588, Een Geusen Lied Boecxken (\\"A Gueux Songbook\\"), was full of heroic sentiment. Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde (1538–1598) was one of the leading spirits in the war of Dutch independence and an intimate friend of William I, Prince of Orange. The lyrics to Wilhelmus van Nassouwe, the current Dutch national anthem and an apology of the Prince's actions composed around 1568, are ascribed to Marnix. His chief work was 1569's Biëncorf der Heilige Roomsche Kercke (Beehive of the Holy Roman Church), a satire of the Roman Catholic church. Marnix occupied the last years of his life in preparing a Dutch version of the Bible, translated directly from the original; at his death only Genesis was completed. In 1619 the Synod of Dort placed the unfinished work in the hands of four theologians, who completed it. This translation formed the starting point for the Statenvertaling or \\"States' Translation\\", a full Bible translation into Dutch ordered by the Synod. In order to be intelliglible to all Dutchmen, the Statenvertaling included elements of all main Dutch dialects and so became the cornerstone of modern standard Dutch. Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert (1522–1590) was the Low Countries' first truly humanist writer. In 1586 he produced his original masterpiece, the Zedekunst (\\"Art of Ethics\\"), a philosophical treatise in prose. Coornhert's humanism unites the Bible, Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius in one grand system of ethics. By this time, the religious and political upheaval in the Low Countries had resulted in the 1581 Act of Abjuration, deposing their king, Philip II of Spain and the subsequent eighty years' struggle to confirm that declaration. As a result, the southern provinces, some of which had supported the declaration, were separated from the northern provinces as they remained under Spanish rule. Ultimately, this would result in the present-day states of Belgium (south) and the Netherlands (north). After Antwerp had fallen into Spanish hands in 1585, Amsterdam became the centre of all literary enterprise as all intelligentsia fled towards the north. This meant both a cultural renaissance in the north and a sharp decline in the south at the same time, regarding the level of Dutch literature practised. The north received a cultural and intellectual boost whereas in the south, Dutch was largely replaced by French as the language of culture and administration. Poem written by Joost van den Vondel, 17th century. P.C. Hooft In Amsterdam, a circle of poets and playwrights formed around Maecenas-like figure Roemer Visscher (1547–1620), which would eventually be known as the Muiderkring (\\"Circle of Muiden\\") after the residence of its most prominent member, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (1581–1647), writer of pastoral and lyric poetry and history. From 1628 to 1642 he wrote his masterpiece, the Nederduytsche Historiën (\\"History of the Netherlands\\"). Hooft was a purist in style, modelling himself (in prose) after Tacitus. He is considered one of the greatest historians, not merely of the Low Countries, but of Europe. His influence in standardising the language of his country is considered enormous, as many writers conformed themselves to the stylistic and grammatical model Hooft devised. Other members of his Circle included Visscher's daughter Tesselschade (1594–1649, lyric poetry) and Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero (1585–1618, romantic plays and comedies), whose best-known piece is De Spaansche Brabanber Jerolimo (\\"Jerolimo, the Spanish Brabanter\\"), a satire upon the refugees from the south. A versatile poet loosely associated with the Circle of Muiden was the diplomat Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687), perhaps best known for his witty epigrams. Huygens' style was bright and vivacious and he was a consummate artist in metrical form. Joost van den Vondel The best- known of all Dutch writers is the Catholic playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), who mainly wrote historical and biblical tragedies. In 1625 he published what seemed an innocent study from the antique, his tragedy of Palamedes, or Murdered Innocence, but which was a thinly veiled tribute to Johan van Oldebarnevelt, the Republic's Grand Pensionary, who had been executed in 1618 by order of stadtholder Maurice of Nassau. Vondel became in a week the most famous writer in the Netherlands and for the next twelve years, until the accession of stadtholder Frederick Henry, had to maintain a hand-to- hand combat with the Calvinists of Dordrecht. In 1637 Vondel wrote of his most popular works on the occasion of the opening of a new Amsterdam theatre: Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, a play on a local historical figure loosely modeled on material from the Aeneid that is still staged to this day. In 1654 Vondel brought out what most consider the best of all his works, the tragedy of Lucifer, from which it is said Milton drew inspiration. Vondel is considered the typical example of Dutch intelligence and imagination at their highest development. A similar school to that in Amsterdam arose in Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland, led by Jacob Cats (1577–1660). In Cats the genuine Dutch habit of thought, the utilitarian and didactic spirit reached its zenith of fluency and popularity. During early middle life he produced the most important of his writings, his didactic poems, the Maechdenplicht (\\"Duty of Maidens\\") and the Sinne- en Minnebeelden (\\"Images of Allegory and Love\\"). In 1624 he moved from Middelburg to Dordrecht, where he soon after published his ethical work called Houwelick (\\"Marriage\\"); and this was followed by an entire series of moral pieces. Cats is considered somewhat dull and prosaic by some, yet his popularity with the middle classes in the Netherlands has always been immense. As with contemporary English literature, the predominant forms of literature produced in this era were poetry and drama, Coornhert (philosophy) and Hooft (history) being the main exceptions. In another prose genre, Johan van Heemskerk (1597–1656) was the leading man of a new vogue blown over from France: the romance. In 1637 he produced his Batavische Arcadia (\\"Batavian Arcadia\\"), the first original Dutch romance, in its day extremely popular and widely imitated. Another exponent of this genre was Nikolaes Heinsius the Younger, whose Mirandor (1695) resembles but precedes Lesage's Gil Blas. The period from 1600 to 1650 was the blossoming time in Dutch literature. During this period the names of greatest genius were first made known to the public and the vigour and grace of literary expression reached their highest development. It happened, however, that three men of particularly commanding talent survived to an extreme old age, and under the shadow of Vondel, Cats and Huygens sprang up a new generation which sustained the great tradition until around 1670, when decline set in sharply. 1670–1795 After the great division of the Low Countries into the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands formalised in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), \\"Dutch literature\\" almost exclusively meant \\"Republican literature\\", as the Dutch language fell into disfavour with the southern rulers. A notable exception was the Dunkirk writer Michiel de Swaen (1654–1707), who wrote comedies, moralities and biblical poetry. During his lifetime (1678) the Spanish lost Dunkirk to the French and so De Swaen is also the first French-Flemish writer of importance. Betje Wolff (top) and Aagje Deken The playwrights of the time followed the French model of Corneille and others, led by Andries Pels (d. 1681). A well- known poet of this period was Jan Luyken (1649–1712). A writer who revived especially an interest in literature was Justus van Effen (1684–1735). He was born at Utrecht and was influenced by Huguenot émigrés who had fled for the Republic after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Van Effen wrote in French for a great part of his literary career but, influenced by a visit to London where the Tatler and Spectator were on the rise, from 1731 began to publish his Hollandsche Spectator (\\"Dutch Spectator\\") magazine, which his death in 1735 soon brought to a close. Still, what he composed during the last four years of his life is considered by many to constitute the most valuable legacy to Dutch literature that the middle of the 18th century left behind. The year 1777 is considered a turning point in the history of letters in the Netherlands. It was in that year that Elizabeth “Betje” Wolff (1738–1804), a widow lady in Amsterdam, persuaded her friend Agatha “Aagje” Deken (1741–1804), a poor but intelligent governess, to throw up her situation and live with her. For nearly thirty years these women continued together, writing in combination. In 1782 the ladies, inspired partly by Goethe, published their first novel, Sara Burgerhart, which was enthusiastically received. Two further, less successful novels appeared before Wolff and Deken had to flee France, their country of residence, due to persecution by the Directory. The last years of the 18th century were marked by a general revival of intellectual force. The romantic movement in Germany made itself deeply felt in all branches of Dutch literature and German lyricism took the place hitherto held by French classicism, in spite of the country falling to French expansionism (see also History of the Netherlands). The 19th century During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Low Countries had gone through major political upheaval. The Spanish Netherlands had first become the Austrian Netherlands before being annexed by France in 1795. The Republic saw a revolution inspired and backed by France that led to the Batavian Republic and Kingdom of Holland vassal states before actual French annexation in 1810. After Napoleon's downfall in the Southern Netherlands village of Waterloo, the northern and southern provinces were briefly united as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This period lasted until 1830 only, when the southern provinces seceded to form Belgium. It had little influence in literature, and in the new state of Belgium, the status of the Dutch language remained largely unchanged as all governmental and educational affairs were conducted in French. Against this backdrop, the most prominent writer was Willem Bilderdijk (1756–1831), a highly intellectual and intelligent but also eccentric man who lived a busy, eventful life, writing great quantities of verse. Bilderdijk had no time for the emerging new romantic style of poetry, but its fervour found its way into the Netherlands nevertheless, first of all in the person of Hiëronymus van Alphen (1746–1803), who today is best remembered for the verses he wrote for children. Van Alphen was an exponent of the more sentimental school along with Rhijnvis Feith (1753–1824), whose romances are steeped in Weltschmerz. In Hendrik Tollens (1780–1856) some the power of Bilderdijk and the sweetness of Feith were combined. Tollens wrote nationalistic romances and lyrics celebrating the great deeds of Dutch history and today is best known for his poem \\"Wien Neêrlands Bloed\\" (\\"To Those in Whom Dutch Blood Flows\\"), which was the Dutch national anthem until it was superseded in 1932 by Marnix' \\"Wilhelmus\\". A poet of considerable talent, whose powers were awakened by personal intercourse with Tollens and his followers, was A. C. W. Staring (1767–1840). His poems are a blend of romanticism and rationalism. The Dutch language of the north resisted the pressure of German from the outside and from within broke through its long stagnation and enriched itself, as a medium for literary expression, with a multitude of fresh and colloquial forms. At the same time, no very great genius arose in the Netherlands in any branch of literature. For the thirty or forty years preceding 1880 the course of literature in the Netherlands was smooth and even sluggish. The Dutch writers had slipped into a conventionality of treatment and a strict limitation of form from which even the most striking talents among them could scarcely escape. Poetry and a large part of prose was dominated by the so-called school of ministers, as the leading writers all were or had been Calvinist ministers. As a result, many of their products emphasized Biblical and bourgeois domestic values. A prime example is Nicolaas Beets (1814–1903), who wrote large quantities of sermons and poetry under his own name but is chiefly remembered today for the humorous prose sketches of Dutch life in Camera Obscura (1839), which he wrote during his student days under the pseudonym of Hildebrand. A poet of power and promise was lost in the early death of P.A. de Genestet (1829–1861). His narrative poem \\"De Sint-Nicolaasavond\\" (\\"Eve of Sinterklaas\\") appeared in 1849. Although he left no large contemporary impression, Piet Paaltjens (ps. of François Haverschmidt, 1835–1894) is considered one of the very few readable nineteenth-century poets, representing in Dutch the pure Romantic vein exemplified by Heine. Multatuli (E. Douwes Dekker) Under the influence of romantic nationalism, writers in Belgium began to reconsider their Flemish heritage and move for a recognition of the Dutch language. Charles De Coster laid the foundations for a native Belgian literature by recounting the Flemish past in historic romances but wrote his works in French. Hendrik Conscience (1812–1883) was the first to write about Flemish subjects in the Dutch language and so is considered the father of modern Flemish literature. In Flemish poetry, Guido Gezelle (1830–1899) is an important figure. An ordained journalist-cum-ethnologist, Gezelle celebrated his faith and his Flemish roots using an archaic vocabulary based on Medieval Flemish, somewhat to the detriment of readability. See also the article on Flemish literature. After the restoration in 1815 to the Dutch state of the Dutch East Indies, works of literature continued to be produced there. With the rise of social consciousness regarding the administration of the colonies and the treatment of their inhabitants, an influential voice rose from the Indies in the form of Multatuli (ps. of Eduard Douwes Dekker, 1820–1887), whose Max Havelaar (1860) is a scathing indictment of colonial mismanagement and one of the few nineteenth-century prose works still widely considered readable today. The principles of the 1830–1880 period were summed up in Conrad Busken-Huet (1826–1886), leading critic of the day; he had been during all those years the fearless and trusty watch-dog of Dutch letters as he understood them. He lived just long enough to become aware that a revolution was approaching, not to comprehend its character; but his accomplished fidelity to literary principle and his wide knowledge have been honoured even by the most bitter of the younger school. In November 1881 Jacques Perk (born 1860) died. He was no sooner dead, however, than his posthumous poems, and in particular a cycle of sonnets called Mathilde, were published (1882) and awakened extraordinary emotion. Perk had rejected all the formulas of rhetorical poetry, and had broken up the conventional rhythms. There had been heard no music like his in the Netherlands for two hundred years. A group of young men collected around his name and were joined by the poet-novelist-dramatist Marcellus Emants (1848–1923). Emants had written a symbolical poem called \\"Lilith\\" in 1879 that had been stigmatised as audacious and meaningless; encouraged by the admiration of his juniors, Emants published in 1881 a treatise in which the first open attack was made on the old school. Louis Couperus The next appearance was that of Willem Kloos (1857–1938), who had been the editor and intimate friend of Perk, and who now led the new movement. His violent attacks on recognized authority in aesthetics created a considerable scandal. For some time the new poets and critics found a great difficulty in being heard, but in 1884 they founded a review, De Nieuwe Gids (\\"The New Guide\\"), which was able to offer a direct challenge to the old guard's periodicals. The new movement was called Tachtigers or \\"Movement of (Eighteen-)Eighty\\", after the decade in which it arose. The Tachtigers insisted that style must match content, and that intimate and visceral emotions can only be expressed using an intimate and visceral writing style. Prime influences of the Tachtigers were U.K. poets such as Shelley and the French naturalists. Leading representatives of theTachtigers are: *Willem Kloos *Albert Verwey *Frederik van Eeden *Marcellus Emants *Lodewijk van Deyssel *Herman Gorter Around the same time, Louis Couperus (1863–1923) made his appearance. His boyhood years were spent in Java, and he had preserved in all his nature a certain tropical magnificence. His first literary efforts were lyrics in the Tachtigers style, but Couperus proved far more important and durable as a novelist. In 1891 he published Noodlot, which was translated into English as Footsteps of Fate and which was greatly admired by Oscar Wilde. Couperus continued to pour out one important novel after another until his death in 1923. Another talent for prose was revealed by Frederik van Eeden (1860–1932) in De kleine Johannes (\\"Little Johnny\\", 1887) and in Van de koele meren des doods (\\"From the Cold Pools of Death\\", 1901), a melancholy novel. After 1887 the condition of modern Dutch literature remained comparatively stationary, and within the last decade of the 19th century was definitely declining. In 1889 a new poet, Herman Gorter (1864–1927) made his appearance with an epic poem called Mei (\\"May\\"), eccentric both in prosody and in treatment. He held his own without any marked advance towards lucidity or variety. Since the recognition of Gorter, however, no really remarkable talent made itself prominent in Dutch poetry except P.C. Boutens (1870–1943), whose Verzen (\\"Verses\\") in 1898 were received with great respect. Kloos collected his poems in 1894. The others, with the exception of Couperus, showed symptoms of sinking into silence. The entire school, now that the struggle for recognition was over, rested on its triumphs and soon limited itself to a repetition of its old experiments. The leading dramatist at the close of the century was Herman Heijermans (1864–1924), a writer of strong realistic and socialistic tendencies who single-handedly brought Dutch theatre into the modern time. His fishermen's tragedy Op Hoop van Zegen (\\"Trusting Our Fate in the Hands of God\\"), which is still staged, remains his most popular play. The 20th century In common with the rest of Europe, the Netherlands of the nineteenth century effectively remained unchanged until World War I (1914–1918). Belgium was invaded by the German Empire; the Netherlands faced severe economic difficulties owing to its policy of neutrality and consequent political isolation, wedged as it was between the two warring sides. Both the Belgian and Dutch societies emerged from the war pillarised, meaning that each of the main religious and ideological movements (Protestant, Catholic, Socialist and Liberal) stood independent of the rest, each operating its own newspapers, magazines, schools, broadcasting organizations and so on in a form of self-imposed, non-racial segregation. This in turn affected literary movements, as writers gathered around the literary magazines of each of the four \\"pillars\\" (limited to three in Belgium, as Protestantism never took root there). One of the most important historical writers of the 20th century was Johan Huizinga, who is known abroad and translated in different languages and included in several great books lists. His written works were influenced by the literary figures of the early 20th century. * Hendrik Marsman * Adriaan Roland Holst * J. van Oudshoorn * Arthur van Schendel * Hendrik de Vries * Jacobus van Looy =New Objectivity and the Forum Group (1925–1940)= During the 1920s, a new group of writers who distanced themselves from the ornate style of the Movement of 1880 arose, claiming it to be too self-centered and distanced from real life. Their movement was called \\"Nieuwe Zakelijkheid\\", or New Objectivity. An isolated forerunner is the figure of Nescio (J.H.F. Grönloh, 1882–1961), who published his few short stories in the 1910s. A prime example of New Objectivity is F. Bordewijk (1884–1965), whose short story Bint (1931) and terse writing epitomise the style. An offshoot of the New Objectivity movement centered on the Forum magazine, which appeared in the years 1932–1935 and was edited by the leading Dutch literary critic Menno ter Braak (1902–1940) and the novelist Edgar du Perron (1899–1940). Writers associated at one point or other with this modernist magazine include Belgian writers Willem Elsschot and Marnix Gijsen and Dutch writers J. Slauerhoff, Simon Vestdijk and Jan Greshoff. =Second World War and Occupation (1940–1945)= The Second World War marked an abrupt change in the Dutch literary landscape. Casualties of the start of the German occupation included Du Perron (heart attack), Ter Braak (suicide) and Marsman (drowned while trying to escape to the United Kingdom); many other writers were forced into hiding or rounded up in Nazi concentration camps, such as Vestdijk. Many writers ceased publishing as a consequence of refusing to join the German- installed Kultuurkamer (Chamber of Culture), which intended to regulate cultural life in the Netherlands. Jewish-born writer Josef Cohen escaped prosecution by converting to Christianity; aspiring writer Anne Frank (whose diary was published posthumously) died in a German concentration camp, as did crime fiction writer, journalist and poet Jan Campert, who was arrested for aiding Jews and died in 1943 in Neuengamme. His poem De achttien dooden (\\"The eighteen dead\\"), written from the point of view of a captured resistance member awaiting his execution, has become the most famous example of war- related Dutch literature. =Modern times (1945-present)= Hella S. Haasse Writers who had lived through the atrocities of the Second World War reflected in their works on the changed perception of reality. Obviously many looked back on their experiences the way Anne Frank had done in her Diary, this was the case with Het bittere kruid (The bitter herb) of Marga Minco, and Kinderjaren (Childhood) of Jona Oberski. The renewal, which in literary history would be described as \\"ontluisterend realisme\\" (shocking realism), is mainly associated with three authors: Gerard Reve, W.F. Hermans and Anna Blaman. Idealism seems to have disappeared from their prose, now marked by the description of raw reality, inhumanity, with great attention to physicality and sexuality. An obvious example is \\"De Avonden\\" (The evenings) of Gerard Reve, analysing the disillusionment of an adolescent during the \\"wederopbouw\\", the period of rebuilding after the destruction of World War II. In Flanders, Louis Paul Boon and Hugo Claus were the main representatives of this new literary trend. Harry Mulisch in 2010 *Netherlands: Vijftigers, Lucebert, Hans Lodeizen, Jules Deelder, J.

It is responsible for controlling circadian rhythms. The neuronal and hormonal activities it generates regulate many different body functions in a 24-hour cycle. The mouse SCN contains approximately 20,000 neurons. The SCN interacts with many other regions of the brain. It contains several cell types and several different peptides (including vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and neurotransmitters. Neuroanatomy The SCN is situated in the anterior part of the hypothalamus immediately dorsal, or superior (hence supra) to the optic chiasm (CHO) bilateral to (on either side of) the third ventricle. The nucleus can be divided into ventrolateral and dorsolateral portions, also known as the core and shell, respectively. These regions differ in their expression of the clock genes, the core expresses them in response to stimuli whereas the shell expresses them constitutively. In terms of projections, the core receives innervation via three main pathways, the retinohypothalamic tract, geniculohypothalamic tract, and projections from some Raphe nuclei. Dorsomedial SCN is mainly innervated by the core and also by other hypothalamic areas. Lastly, its output is mainly to the subparaventricular zone and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus which both mediate the influence SCN exerts over circadian regulation of the body. Circadian effects Different organisms such as bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, show genetically based near-24-hour rhythms. Although all of these clocks appear to be based on a similar type of genetic feedback loop, the specific genes involved are thought to have evolved independently in each kingdom. Many aspects of mammalian behavior and physiology show circadian rhythmicity, including sleep, physical activity, alertness, hormone levels, body temperature, immune function, and digestive activity. The SCN coordinates these rhythms across the entire body, and rhythmicity is lost if the SCN is destroyed. For example, total time of sleep is maintained in rats with SCN damage, but the length and timing of sleep episodes becomes erratic. The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing \\"slave oscillators,\\" which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue. The SCN receives input from specialized photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract. Neurons in the ventrolateral SCN (vlSCN) have the ability for light-induced gene expression. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in the retina have a direct connection to the ventrolateral SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract. When the retina receives light, the vlSCN relays this information throughout the SCN allowing entrainment, synchronization, of the person's or animal's daily rhythms to the 24-hour cycle in nature. The importance of entraining organisms, including humans, to exogenous cues such as the light/dark cycle, is reflected by several circadian rhythm sleep disorders, where this process does not function normally. Neurons in the dorsomedial SCN (dmSCN) are believed to have an endogenous 24-hour rhythm that can persist under constant darkness (in humans averaging about 24 hours 11 min). A GABAergic mechanism is involved in the coupling of the ventral and dorsal regions of the SCN. The SCN sends information to other hypothalamic nuclei and the pineal gland to modulate body temperature and production of hormones such as cortisol and melatonin. Circadian rhythms of endothermic (warm-blooded) and ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates A thermographic image of an ectothermic snake wrapping around the hand of an endothermic human Information about the direct neuronal regulation of metabolic processes and circadian rhythm-controlled behaviors is not well known among either endothermic or ectothermic vertebrates, although extensive research has been done on the SCN in model animals such as the mammalian mouse and ectothermic reptiles, in particular, lizards. The SCN is known to be involved not only in photoreception through innervation from the retinohypothalamic tract but also in thermoregulation of vertebrates capable of homeothermy, as well as regulating locomotion and other behavioral outputs of the circadian clock within ectothermic vertebrates. The behavioral differences between both classes of vertebrates, when compared to the respective structures and properties of the SCN and various other nuclei proximate to the hypothalamus, provide insight into how these behaviors are the consequence of differing circadian regulation. Ultimately, many neuroethological studies must be done to completely ascertain the direct and indirect roles of the SCN on circadian- regulated behaviors of vertebrates. =The SCN of endotherms and ectotherms= In general, external temperature does not influence endothermic animal behavior or circadian rhythm because of the ability of these animals to keep their internal body temperature constant through homeostatic thermoregulation; however, peripheral oscillators (see Circadian rhythm) in mammals are sensitive to temperature pulses and will experience resetting of the circadian clock phase and associated genetic expression, suggesting how peripheral circadian oscillators may be separate entities from one another despite having a master oscillator within the SCN. Furthermore, when individual neurons of the SCN from a mouse were treated with heat pulses, a similar resetting of oscillators was observed, but when an intact SCN was treated with the same heat pulse treatment the SCN was resistant to temperature change by exhibiting an unaltered circadian oscillating phase. In ectothermic animals, particularly the ruin lizard Podacris sicula, temperature has been shown to affect the circadian oscillators within the SCN. This reflects a potential evolutionary relationship among endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates, in how ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to affect their circadian rhythms and behavior and endotherms have an evolved SCN to essentially ignore external temperature and use photoreception as a means for entraining the circadian oscillators within their SCN. In addition, the differences of the SCN between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates suggest that the neuronal organization of the temperature-resistant SCN in endotherms is responsible for driving thermoregulatory behaviors in those animals differently from those of ectotherms, since they rely on external temperature for engaging in certain behaviors. =Behaviors controlled by the SCN of vertebrates= Significant research has been conducted on the genes responsible for controlling circadian rhythm, in particular within the SCN. Knowledge of the gene expression of Clock (Clk) and Period2 (Per2), two of the many genes responsible for regulating circadian rhythm within the individual cells of the SCN, has allowed for a greater understanding of how genetic expression influences the regulation of circadian rhythm-controlled behaviors. Studies on thermoregulation of ruin lizards and mice have informed some connections between the neural and genetic components of both vertebrates when experiencing induced hypothermic conditions. Certain findings have reflected how evolution of SCN both structurally and genetically has resulted in the engagement of characteristic and stereotyped thermoregulatory behavior in both classes of vertebrates. *Mice: Among vertebrates, it is known that mammals are endotherms that are capable of homeostatic thermoregulation. Mice have been shown to have some thermosensitivity within the SCN, although the regulation of body temperature by mice experiencing hypothermia is more sensitive to whether they are in a bright or dark environment; it has been shown that mice in darkened conditions and experiencing hypothermia maintain a stable internal body temperature, even while fasting. In light conditions, mice showed a drop in body temperature under the same fasting and hypothermic conditions. Through analyzing genetic expression of Clock genes in wild-type and knockout strains, as well as analyzing the activity of neurons within the SCN and connections to proximate nuclei of the hypothalamus in the aforementioned conditions, it has been shown that the SCN is the center of control for circadian body temperature rhythm. This circadian control, thus, includes both direct and indirect influence of many of the thermoregulatory behaviors that mammals engage in to maintain homeostasis. *Ruin lizards: Several studies have been conducted on the genes expressed in circadian oscillating cells of the SCN during various light and dark conditions, as well as effects from inducing mild hypothermia in reptiles. In terms of structure, the SCNs of lizards have a closer resemblance to those of mice, possessing a dorsomedial portion and a ventrolateral core. However, genetic expression of the circadian-related Per2 gene in lizards is similar to that in reptiles and birds, despite the fact that birds have been known to have a distinct SCN structure consisting of a lateral and medial portion. Studying the lizard SCN because of the lizard's small body size and ectothermy is invaluable to understanding how this class of vertebrates modifies its behavior within the dynamics of circadian rhythm, but it has not yet been determined whether the systems of cold-blooded vertebrates were slowed as a result of decreased activity in the SCN or showed decreases in metabolic activity as a result of hypothermia. Other signals from the retina eskinogram showing the influence of light and darkness on circadian rhythms and related physiology and behavior through the SCN in humans The SCN is one of many nuclei that receive nerve signals directly from the retina. Some of the others are the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the superior colliculus, the basal optic system, and the pretectum: * The LGN passes information about color, contrast, shape, and movement on to the visual cortex and itself signals to the SCN. * The superior colliculus controls the movement and orientation of the eye. * The basal optic system also controls eye movements. * The pretectum controls the size of the pupil. Gene expression The circadian rhythm in the SCN is generated by a gene expression cycle in individual SCN neurons. This cycle has been well conserved through evolution and in essence is similar in cells from many widely different organisms that show circadian rhythms. =Fruitfly= In the fruitfly Drosophila, the cellular circadian rhythm in neurons is controlled by two interlocked feedback loops. * In the first loop, the bHLH transcription factors clock (CLK) and cycle (CYC) drive the transcription of their own repressors period (PER) and timeless (TIM). PER and TIM proteins then accumulate in the cytoplasm, translocate into the nucleus at night, and turn off their own transcription, thereby setting up a 24-hour oscillation of transcription and translation. * In the second loop, the transcription factors vrille (VRI) and Pdp1 are initiated by CLK/CYC. PDP1 acts positively on CLK transcription and negatively on VRI. These genes encode various transcription factors that trigger expression of other proteins. The products of clock and cycle, called CLK and CYC, belong to the PAS-containing subfamily of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, and form a heterodimer. This heterodimer (CLK-CYC) initiates the transcription of PER and TIM, whose protein products dimerize and then inhibit their own expression by disrupting CLK-CYC-mediated transcription. This negative feedback mechanism gives a 24-hour rhythm in the expression of the clock genes. Many genes are suspected to be linked to circadian control by \\"E-box elements\\" in their promoters, as CLK-CYC and its homologs bind to these elements. The 24-hour rhythm could be reset by light via the protein cryptochrome (CRY), which is involved in the circadian photoreception in Drosophila. CRY associates with TIM in a light-dependent manner that leads to the destruction of TIM. Without the presence of TIM for stabilization, PER is eventually destroyed during the day. As a result, the repression of CLK-CYC is reduced and the whole cycle reinitiates again. =Mammals= The oscillator genes and proteins involved in the mammalian circadian oscillator In mammals, circadian clock genes behave in a manner similar to that of flies. CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) was first cloned in mouse and BMAL1 (brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like 1) is the primary homolog of Drosophila CYC. Three homologs of PER (PER1, PER2, and PER3) and two CRY homologs (CRY1 and CRY2) have been identified. TIM has been identified in mammals; however, its function is still not determined. Mutations in TIM result in an inability to respond to zeitgebers, which is essential for resetting the biological clock. Recent research suggests that, outside the SCN, clock genes may have other important roles as well, including their influence on the effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine. Electrophysiology Neurons in the SCN fire action potentials in a 24-hour rhythm. At mid-day, the firing rate reaches a maximum, and, during the night, it falls again. How the gene expression cycle (so-called the core clock) connects to the neural firing remains unknown. Many SCN neurons are sensitive to light stimulation via the retina, and sustainedly firing action potentials during a light pulse (~30 seconds) in rodents. The photic response is likely linked to effects of light on circadian rhythms. In addition, focal application of melatonin can decrease firing activity of these neurons, suggesting that melatonin receptors present in the SCN mediate phase-shifting effects through the SCN.

The strategy appears among birds, insects and fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own, using brood mimicry, for example by having eggs that resemble the host's (egg mimicry). Brood parasitism relieves the parasitic parents from the investment of rearing young or building nests for the young, enabling them to spend more time on other activities such as foraging and producing further offspring. Bird parasite species mitigate the risk of egg loss by distributing eggs amongst a number of different hosts. As this behaviour damages the host, it often results in an evolutionary arms race between parasite and host as the pair of species coevolve. The strength of defenses and counter-adaptation rely on the host/parasitic species' ability to evolve; some host species have very strong rejection defenses resulting in the parasitic species evolving to have very close mimicry. In other species, hosts do not show rejection defenses and as a result, the parasitic species will show no evolved trait (example: egg mimicry). Birds goldeneye often lays its eggs in the nests of other females. In many monogamous bird species, there are extra-pair matings resulting in males outside the pair bond siring offspring and used by males to escape from the parental investment in raising their offspring. This form of cuckoldry is taken a step further when females of the goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) often lay their eggs in the nests of other individuals. Intraspecific brood parasitism is seen in a number of duck species, where females often lay their eggs in the nests of others. A Eurasian reed warbler raising a common cuckoo. A black-collared starling feeding an Asian koel. Interspecific brood-parasites include the indigobirds, whydahs, and honeyguides in Africa, cowbirds, Old World cuckoos, black-headed ducks, and some New World cuckoos in the Americas. Seven independent origins of obligate interspecific brood parasitism in birds have been proposed. While there is still some controversy over when and how many origins of interspecific brood parasitism have occurred, recent phylogenetic analyses suggest two origins in Passeriformes (once in New World cowbirds: Icteridae, and once in African Finches: Viduidae); three origins in Old World and New World cuckoos (once in Cuculinae, Phaenicophaeinae, and in Neomorphinae- Crotophaginae); a single origin in Old World honeyguides (Indicatoridae); and in a single species of waterfowl, the black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla). Most avian brood parasites are specialists which parasitize only a single host species or a small group of closely related host species, but four out of the five parasitic cowbirds (all except the screaming cowbird) are generalists which parasitize a wide variety of hosts; the brown-headed cowbird has 221 known hosts. They usually lay only one egg per nest, although in some cases, particularly the cowbirds, several females may use the same host nest. The common cuckoo presents an interesting case in which the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, including the reed warbler and dunnock, but individual females specialize in a single species. Genes regulating egg coloration appear to be passed down exclusively along the maternal line, allowing females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of the species they specialize in. Females generally parasitize nests of the species which raised them. Male common cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, which maintains sufficient gene flow among the different maternal lines to prevent speciation. The mechanisms of host selection by female cuckoos are somewhat unclear, though several hypotheses have been suggested in attempt to explain the choice. These include genetic inheritance of host preference, host imprinting on young birds, returning to place of birth and subsequently choosing a host randomly (\\"natal philopatry\\"), choice based on preferred nest site (nest-site hypothesis), and choice based on preferred habitat (habitat-selection hypothesis). Of these hypotheses the nest-site selection and habitat selection have been most supported by experimental analysis. =Adaptations for parasitism= Four clutches of reed warbler eggs, each containing one (larger) cuckoo egg Among specialist avian brood parasites, mimetic eggs are a nearly universal adaptation. The generalist brown-headed cowbird may have evolved an egg coloration mimicking a number of their hosts. Size may also be important for the incubation and survival of parasitic species; it may be beneficial for parasitic eggs to be similar in size to the eggs of the host species. The eggshells of brood parasites are often thicker than those of the hosts. For example, the eggs of cuckoos are about thicker than those the great reed warbler. The function of this thick eggshell is debated. One hypothesis, the puncture resistance hypothesis, states that the thicker eggshells serve to prevent hosts from breaking the eggshell, thus killing the embryo inside. This is supported by a study in which marsh warblers damaged their eggs more often when attempting to break cuckoo eggs, but incurred less damage when trying to puncture great reed warbler eggs put in the nest by researchers. Another hypothesis is the laying damage hypothesis, which postulates that the eggshells are adapted to damage the eggs of the host when the former is being laid, and prevent the parasite's eggs from being damaged when the host lays its eggs. In support of this hypothesis, eggs of the shiny cowbird parasitizing the house wren and the chalk-browed mockingbird and the brown- headed cowbird parasitizing the house wren and the red-winged blackbird damaged the host's eggs when dropped, and sustained little damage when host eggs were dropped on them. Most avian brood parasites have very short egg incubation periods and rapid nestling growth. In many brood parasites, such as cuckoos and honeyguides, this short egg incubation period is due to internal incubation periods up to 24 hours longer in cuckoos than hosts. Some non- parasitic cuckoos also have longer internal incubation periods, suggesting that this longer internal incubation period was not an adaptation following brood parasitism, but predisposed birds to become brood parasites. This is likely facilitated by a heavier yolk in the egg providing more nutrients. Being larger than the hosts at growth is a further adaptation to being a brood parasite. =Mafia hypothesis= There is a question as to why the majority of the hosts of brood parasites care for the nestlings of their parasites. Not only do these brood parasites usually differ significantly in size and appearance, but it is also highly probable that they reduce the reproductive success of their hosts. The \\"mafia hypothesis\\" evolved through studies in an attempt to answer this question. This hypothesis revolves around host manipulations induced by behaviors of the brood parasite. Upon the detection and rejection of a brood parasite's egg, the host's nest is destroyed and nestlings injured or killed. This threatening response indirectly enhances selective pressures favoring aggressive parasite behavior that may result in positive feedback between mafia-like parasites and compliant host behaviors. There are two avian species that have been speculated to portray this mafia- like behavior: the brown-headed cowbird of North America, Molothrus ater, and the great spotted cuckoo of Europe, Clamator glandarius. The great spotted cuckoo lays the majority of its eggs in the nests of the European magpie, Pica pica. It repeatedly visits the nests that it has parasitised, a precondition for the mafia hypothesis. An experiment was run by Soler et al. from April to July 1990 – 1992 in the high-altitude plateau Hoya de Guadix, Spain. They observed the effects of the removal of cuckoo eggs on the reproductive success of the magpie and measured the magpie's reaction; the egg was considered accepted if it remained in the nest, ejected if gone in between visits, or abandoned if eggs were present but cold. If any nest contents were gone between consecutive visits, the nests were considered to have been depredated. The magpie's reproductive success was measured by number of nestlings that survived to their last visit, which was just before the nestling had been predicted to fledge from the nest. The results from these experiments show that after the removal of the parasitic eggs from the great spotted cuckoo, these nests are predated at much higher rates than those where the eggs were not removed. Through the use of plasticine eggs that model those of the magpie, it was confirmed that the nest destruction was caused by the great spotted cuckoo. This destruction benefits the cuckoo, for the possibility of re-nesting by the magpie allows another chance for the cuckoo egg to be accepted. A similar experiment was done in 1996–2002 by Hoover et al. on the relationship between the parasitic brown-headed cowbird and a host, the prothonotary warbler, Protonotaria citrea. In their experiment, researchers manipulated the cowbird egg removal and cowbird access to the warbler's predator–proof nests. They found that 56% of egg-ejected nests were predated upon, in comparison to 6% of non-ejected nests when cowbirds were not prevented from getting to the hosts' nest; nearly all nests protected from cowbirds fledged warblers successfully. Of the nests that were rebuilt by hosts that had previously been predated upon, 85% of those were destroyed. The number of young produced by the hosts that ejected eggs dropped 60% compared to those that accepted the cowbird eggs. =Nest-site hypothesis= In this hypothesis, female cuckoos select a group of host species with similar nest sites and egg characteristics to her own. This population of potential hosts is monitored and a nest is chosen from within this group. Research of nest collections has illustrated a significant level of similarity between cuckoo eggs and typical eggs of the host species. A low percentage of parasitized nests were shown to contain cuckoo eggs not corresponding to the specific host egg morph. In these mismatched nests a high percent of the cuckoo eggs were shown to correlate to the egg morph of another host species with similar nesting sites. This has been pointed to as evidence for nest- site selection. A criticism of the hypothesis is that it provides no mechanism by which nests are chosen, or which cues might be used to recognize such a site. =Parental- care parasitism= Parental-care parasitism emphasizes the relationship between the host and the parasite in brood parasitism. Parental-care parasitism occurs when individuals raise offspring of other unrelated individuals. The host are the parents of offspring and the parasites are individuals who take advantage of either the nest or eggs within the family construct. Such dynamics occur when the parasites attempt to reduce their parental investment so they can invest the extra energy into other endeavors. Cost to the hosts Given the harm that avian brood parasites can do to their hosts' reproductive success, hosts have come up with various defenses against this unique threat. Given that the cost of egg removal concurrent with parasitism is unrecoverable, the best strategy for hosts is to avoid parasitism in the first place. This can take several forms, including selecting nest sites which are difficult to parasitize, starting incubation early so they are sitting on the nests when parasites visit them early in the morning, and aggressively defending their territory. Despite providing intensive parental care, in Prothonotary Warblers, where conspecific brood parasitism occurs, there was no cost for host females in terms of annual survival probability. Hosts reject offspring The host may be the one that ultimately ends up raising offspring after they return from foraging. Once parasitism has occurred, the next most optimal defense is to eject the parasitic egg. According to parental investment theory, the host can possibly adopt some defense to protect their own eggs if they distinguish which eggs are not theirs. Recognition of parasitic eggs is based on identifying pattern differences or changes in the number of eggs. This can be done by grasp ejection if the host has a large enough beak, or otherwise by puncture ejection. Ejection behaviour has some costs however, especially when host species have to deal with mimetic eggs. Hosts may mistake one of their own eggs for a parasite's on occasion and eject it, and may damage their own eggs while trying to eject a parasite's egg. Among hosts not exhibiting parasitic egg ejection, some abandon parasitized nests and start over again. However, at high enough parasitism frequencies, this becomes maladaptive as the new nest will most likely also be parasitized. Some host species modify their nests to exclude the parasitic egg, either by weaving over the egg or in some cases rebuilding a new nest over the existing one. For instance, American coots may kick the parasites' eggs out, or build a new nest beside the brood nests where the parasites’ babies starve to death. In the Western Bonelli's warbler Phylloscopus bonelli, a small host, experimental parasitism revealed that small dummy parasitic eggs were always ejected, whilst with large dummy parasitic eggs nest desertion more frequently occurred. Cost to the parasites While parental-care parasitism significantly increased the breeding number of the parasite, only about half of the parasite eggs survived. Parasitism for the individual (the brood parasite) also has significant drawbacks. As an example, the parasitic offspring of the bearded tits, Panurus biarmicus, compared to the offspring in non-parasitic nests, tend to develop much more slowly and often don't reach full maturity. Parasitic females however can adopt either floater traits or nesting traits. Floater females are entirely dependent on others to raise their eggs because they do not have their own nests. Hence, they reproduce significantly less because the hosts reject their ‘intruder’ eggs or they may just miss the egg- laying period of the bird they are trying to pass their eggs to. Nesting females who have their own nests may also be parasitic due to temporary situations like sudden loss of nests, or they lay surplus eggs, which overload their parental care ability. Hosts raise offspring Sometimes hosts are completely unaware that they are caring for a bird that is not their own. This most commonly occurs because the host cannot differentiate the parasitic eggs from their own. It may also occur when hosts temporarily leave the nest after laying the eggs. The parasites lay their own eggs into these nests so their nestlings share the food provided by the host. It may occur in other situations. For example, female eiders would prefer to lay eggs in the nests with one or two existing eggs of others because the first egg is the most vulnerable to predators. The presence of others’ eggs reduces the probability that a predator will attack her egg when a female eider leaves the nest after laying the first egg. Sometimes, the parasitic offspring kills the host nest- mates during competition for resources. As an example, the parasite offspring of the cowbird chick kill the host nest-mates if food intake for each of them is low, but do not do so if the food intake is adequate, as a result of their interactions with co-inhabitants of the nest. Fish =Mouthbrooding parasites= Synodontis multipunctatus A mochokid catfish of Lake Tanganyika, Synodontis multipunctatus, is a brood parasite of several mouthbrooding cichlid fish. The catfish eggs are incubated in the host's mouth, and—in the manner of cuckoos—hatch before the host's own eggs. The young catfish eat the host fry inside the host's mouth, effectively taking up virtually the whole of the host's parental investment. =\\"Nest\\" parasites= A cyprinid minnow, Pungtungia herzi is a brood parasite of the percichthyid freshwater perch Siniperca kawamebari, which live in the south of the Japanese islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku, and in South Korea. Host males guard territories against intruders during the breeding season, creating a patch of reeds as a spawning site or \\"nest\\". Females (one or more per site) visit the site to lay eggs, which the male then defends. The parasite's eggs are smaller and stickier than the host's. 65.5% of host sites were parasitised in a study area. Insects =Kleptoparasites= A cuckoo bee from the genus Nomada There are many different types of cuckoo bees, all of which lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees, but they are normally referred to as kleptoparasites (Greek: klepto-, to steal), rather than as brood parasites, because the immature stages are almost never fed directly by the adult hosts. Instead, they simply take food gathered by their hosts. Examples of cuckoo bees are Coelioxys rufitarsis, Melecta separata, Nomada and Epeoloides. Kleptoparasitism in insects is not restricted to bees; several lineages of wasp including most of the Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites. The cuckoo wasps lay their eggs in the nests of other wasps, such as those of the potters and mud daubers. =True brood parasites= True brood parasitism is rare among insects. Cuckoo bumblebees (the subgenus Psithyrus) are among the few insects which, like cuckoos and cowbirds, are fed by adult hosts. Their queens kill and replace the existing queen of a colony of the host species then use the host workers to feed their brood. Nest of Polistes dominula, host to the cuckoo wasp Polistes sulcifer A true brood-parasitic wasp is Polistes sulcifer. This paper wasp has lost the ability to build its own nest, and relies on its host, Polistes dominula, to raise its brood. The adult host feeds the parasite larvae directly, unlike typical kleptoparasitic insects. Host insects are sometimes tricked into bringing offspring of another species into their own nests, as with the parasitic butterfly, Phengaris rebeli, and the host ant Myrmica schencki. The butterfly larvae release chemicals that confuse the host ant into believing that the P. rebeli larvae are actually ant larvae. Thus, the M. schencki ants bring back the P. rebeli larvae to their nests and feed them, much like the chicks of cuckoos and other brood-parasitic birds. This is also the case for the parasitic butterfly, Niphanda fusca, and its host ant Camponotus japonicus. The butterfly releases cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that mimic the CHCs of the host male ant. The ant then brings the third instar larva back into its own nest and raises them until pupation.

Though the titular Soviet head of state, Shvernik had less power than Joseph Stalin as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Biography Shvernik was born in 1888 in St. Petersburg in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity.Герои Страны He joined the Bolsheviks in 1905. In 1924 he became a People's Commissar in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and became a full member of the Central Committee of the party in 1925. In 1927 he was demoted and sent to the Urals to head the local party organization. Stalin found him a loyal supporter of his policy of rapid industrialisation and moved him back to Moscow in 1929 making him chairman of the Metallurgist Trade Union. He resumed his rise in the party becoming a member of the Orgburo and the party Secretariat. He also served as first secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions from July 1930 to March 1944. As such, Shvernik presided over the 1931 Menshevik Trial, in which fourteen Russian economists came up for trial on charges of treason. During the Second World War, Shvernik was responsible for evacuating Soviet industry away from the advancing Wehrmacht. He was Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities from 1938 to 1946. He was Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR from 1943 to 1946. In 1946 he became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, succeeding Mikhail Kalinin. He only became a member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee (then named the Presidium of the Party's Central Committee) in 1952 but was demoted in 1953 when the body was reduced in size. Following the death of Stalin, Shvernik was removed as titular president of the USSR and replaced by Kliment Voroshilov on 15 March 1953. Shvernik returned to his work as the chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. In 1956, after his work in the Pospelov Commission, which was the basis of Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\" denouncing Stalinism, Khrushchev recommended Shvernik for the post of chairman of the Party Control Committee and later put him in charge of rehabilitating the victims of Stalin's purges (Shvernik Commission). In 1957, Shvernik again became a full member of the Presidium and remained on the body until he retired in 1966.

Wars without international legality (i.e. not out of self- defense nor sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council) can be considered wars of aggression; however, this alone usually does not constitute the definition of a war of aggression; certain wars may be unlawful but not aggressive (a war to settle a boundary dispute where the initiator has a reasonable claim, and limited aims, is one example). In the judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which followed World War II, \\"War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\\" Article 39 of the United Nations Charter provides that the UN Security Council shall determine the existence of any act of aggression and \\"shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security\\". The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court refers to the crime of aggression as one of the \\"most serious crimes of concern to the international community\\", and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, the Rome Statute stipulates that the ICC may not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted. At the Kampala Review Conference on 11 June 2010, a total of 111 State Parties to the Court agreed by consensus to adopt a resolution accepting the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime. The relevant amendments to the Statute, however has not been entered into force yet as of May 14, 2012. Possibly the first trial for waging aggressive war is that of the Sicilian king Conradin in 1268. The phrase is distinctly modern and diametrically opposed to the prior legal international standard of \\"might makes right\\", under the medieval and pre-historic beliefs of right of conquest. Since the Korean War of the early 1950s, waging such a war of aggression is a crime under the customary international law.. Definitions The origin of the concept, Maguire argues, emerged from the debate on Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919: \\"Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\\" Maguire argues: =The Convention for the Definition of Aggression= Two Conventions for the Definition of Aggression were signed in London on 3 and 4 July 1933. The first was signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey and Yugoslavia, and came into effect on 17 February 1934, when it was ratified by all of them but Turkey. The second was signed by Afghanistan (ratified 20 October 1933), Estonia (4 December), Latvia (4 December), Persia (16 November), Poland (16 October), Romania (16 October), the Soviet Union (16 October) and Turkey, which ratified both treaties on 23 March 1934. Finland acceded to the second convention on 31 January 1934. The second convention was the first to be registered with the League of Nations Treaty Series on 29 March 1934, while the first was registered on 26 April. As Lithuania refused to sign any treaty including Poland,Lithuanian authorities regarded Polish rule over the Vilnius Region as a military occupation of its constitutional capital. she signed the definition of aggression in a separate pact with the Soviet Union on 5 July 1933, also in London, and exchanged ratifications on 14 December. It was registered in the Treaty Series on 16 April 1934. The signatories of both treaties were also signatories of the Kellogg–Briand Pact prohibiting aggression, and were seeking an agreed definition of the latter. Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia were members of the Little Entente, and their signatures alarmed Bulgaria, since the definition of aggression clearly covered its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization.S. A. H., \\"Bulgaria and the Balkan Entente\\", Bulletin of International News, 15, 16 (1938), 4. Both treaties base their definition on the \\"Politis Report\\" of the Committee of Security Questions made 24 March 1933 to the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, in answer to a proposal of the Soviet delegation. The Greek politician Nikolaos Politis was behind the inclusion of \\"support for armed bands\\" as a form of aggression.Leon Romaniecki, \\"The Soviet Union and International Terrorism\\", Soviet Studies, 26, 3 (1974), 420. Ratifications for both treaties were deposited in Moscow, as the convention was primarily the work of Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet signatory.P. Zadeikis, \\"An Aspect of the Lithuanian Record of Independence\\", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 232 (1944), 50. The convention defined an act of aggression as follows: * Declaration of war upon another State. * Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another State. * Attack by its land, naval or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another State. * Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State. * Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to take, in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection. The League prerogative under that convention to expel a League member found guilty of aggression was used by the League Assembly only once, against the Soviet government itself, on December 14, 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Finland.League of Nations Assembly resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet governmentLeague of Nations Council resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet government Primary documents: *Text of the Convention of 3 July *Text of the Convention of 4 July *Text of the Convention of 5 July =The Nuremberg Principles= In 1945, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal defined three categories of crimes, including crimes against peace.

See: Nuremberg Trials: \\"The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939.\\" For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting World War II. One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or – it seems – the enforcement of the criminal law of jus cogens. It has made formal declaration of war uncommon after 1945. Reading the Tribunal's final judgment in court, British alternate judge Norman Birkett said: Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \\"substituting power for principle\\" at Nuremberg. \\"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,\\" he wrote. \\"Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\\"Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal, H. K. Thompson, Jr. and Henry Strutz, (Torrance, Calif.: 1983). =The United Nations Charter= The relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations mentioned in the RSICC article 5.2 were framed to include the Nuremberg Principles. The specific principle is Principle VI.a \\"Crimes against peace\\", which was based on the provisions of the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal that was issued in 1945 and formed the basis for the post World War II war crime trials. The Charters provisions based on the Nuremberg Principle VI.a are: =The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)= The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 2, 1947, included a clear definition of aggression. Article 9 stated: > In addition to other acts which the Organ of Consultation may characterize > as aggression, the following shall be considered as such: =Further discussions on defining aggression= The discussions on definition of aggression under the UN began in 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War. As the western governments, headed by Washington, were in favor of defining the governments of North Korea and the People's Republic of China as aggressor states, the Soviet government proposed to formulate a new UN resolution defining aggression and based on the 1933 convention. As a result, on November 17, 1950, the General Assembly passed resolution 378, UN General Assembly Resolution 378 (V) on the Duties of States in the Event of the Outbreak of Hostilities which referred the issue to be defined by the International Law Commission. The commission deliberated over this issue in its 1951 session and due to large disagreements among its members, decided \\"that the only practical course was to aim at a general and abstract definition (of aggression)\\".Yearbook of the ILC 1951, vol. 2, p. 132. However, a tentative definition of aggression was adopted by the commission on June 4, 1951, which stated: > Aggression is the use of force by a State or Government against another > State or Government, in any manner, whatever the weapons used and whether > openly or otherwise, for any reason or for any purpose other than individual > or collective self-defence or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation > by a competent organ of the United Nations.UN Doc. A/CN.4/L.13, in Yearbook > of the ILC 1951, vol. 1, p. 116, fn. 1. =General Assembly Resolution 3314= On December 14, 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 3314, which defined the crime of aggression. This definition is not binding as such under international law, though it may reflect customary international law. This definition makes a distinction between aggression (which \\"gives rise to international responsibility\\") and war of aggression (which is \\"a crime against international peace\\"). Acts of aggression are defined as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an act of aggression and a war of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression. The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are notably vague, as it is unclear what level of \\"involvement\\" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the Sierra Leone Civil War and the Yugoslav Wars, were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition. The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.Ingrid Detter Delupis, The Law of War, pp. 69–70. Cambridge University Press, 2000 Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.L. F. Damrosch, \\"Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures\\", p. 202. Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses, Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998 While this Definition of Aggression has often been cited by opponents of conflicts such as the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, it has no binding force in international law. The doctrine of Nulla poena sine lege means that, in the absence of binding international law on the subject of aggression, no penalty exists for committing acts in contravention of the definition. It is only recently that heads of state have been indicted over acts committed in wartime, in the cases of Slobodan Milošević of Serbia and Charles Taylor of Liberia. However, both were charged with war crimes, i.e. violations of the laws of war, rather than with the broader offence of \\"a crime against international peace\\" as envisaged by the Definition of Aggression. The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The United Nations Charter empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the United Nations Security Council but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it \\"in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression\\".Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence, p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003 The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argue that the Definition of Aggression has had \\"no visible impact\\" on the deliberations of the Security Council.M. C. Bassiouni and B. B. Ferencz, \\"The Crime against Peace\\", International Criminal Law, I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999) =Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court= The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists the crime of aggression as one of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute states that \\"The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\\" Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law. Article 5.

Some texts recorded his surname as Sun (孫) instead of Xun, either because the two surnames were homophones in antiquity or because Xun was a naming taboo during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han (73–48 BC), whose given name was Xun. Herbert Giles and John Knoblock both consider the naming taboo theory more likely. Nothing is known of his lineage, and the early years of Xunzi's life are shrouded in mystery. Accounts of when he lived conflict; he is said to have met a King Kuai of Yan during the time of Mencius, while Liu Xiang states that he lived more than a hundred years after Mencius. The Sima Qian records that he was born in Zhao, and Anze County has erected a large memorial hall at his supposed birthplace. It is recounted that at the age of fifty he went to the state of Qi to study and teach at the Jixia Academy. The Shi Ji states that he became a member of the academy during the time of King Xiang of Qi, discounting the story of his being a teacher of Han Fei, but its chronology would give him a lifetime of 137 years. After studying and teaching in Qi, Xunzi is said to have visited the state of Qin, possibly from 265 BC to 260 BC,John H. Knoblock. Early China, Vol. 8 (1982–83), p.34. The Chronology of Xunzi's Works. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23351544 and praised its governance, and debated military affairs with Lord Linwu (臨武君) in the court of King Xiaocheng of Zhao. Later, Xunzi was slandered in the Qi court, and he retreated south to the state of Chu. In 240 BC Lord Chunshen, the prime minister of Chu, invited him to take a position as Magistrate of Lanling (蘭陵令), which he initially refused and then accepted. However, Lord Chunshen was assassinated In 238 BC by a court rival and Xunzi subsequently lost his position. He retired, remained in Lanling, a region in what is today's southern Shandong province, for the rest of his life and was buried there. The year of his death is unknown, David R.

Ancient and Early Medieval Chinese Literature (vols. 3 & 4). https://books.google.com/books?id=OWLPBAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA1759 though if he lived to see the ministership of his supposed student Li Si, as recounted, he would have lived into his nineties, dying shortly after 219 BC.John H. Knoblock. Early China, Vol. 8 (1982–83), p.34. The Chronology of Xunzi's Works. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23351544 Philosophy Xunzi witnessed the chaos surrounding the fall of the Zhou dynasty and rise of the Qin state which upheld \\"doctrines focusing on state control, by means of law and penalties\\" (Chinese Legalism). Like Shang Yang, Xunzi believed that humanity's inborn tendencies were evil and that ethical norms had been invented to rectify people. His variety of Confucianism therefore has a darker, more pragmatic flavour than the optimistic Confucianism of Mencius, who tended to view humans as innately good, though like most Confucians he believed that people could be refined through education and ritual.Robins, Dan, \\"Xunzi\\", 2. The Way of the Sage Kings, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/xunzi/ However, he believed that only an elite could accomplish this.Robins, Dan, \\"Xunzi\\", 4. Education and Punishment, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N.

Xunzi: Books 7-16. https://books.google.com/books?id=DNqmAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA172 Therefore, unlike other Confucians, Xunzi allowed that penal law could play a legitimate, though secondary, role in the state.(R.

Indiana University, Early Chinese Thought [B/E/P374]. http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Legalism.pdf He rejects the Book of Lord Shang and Zhuangzi's claims that the way changes with the times, saying the way had been invented by the sages. To this end he seems to have taken up the Mohists' argumentative strategies and conception of models (Fa) (which the Legalists had also taken up), saying \\"the Ru model themselves after the former kings\\". Unlike the Legalists, he places little emphasis on general rules, advocating the use of particular examples as models. Ultimately, he refused to admit theories of state and administration apart from ritual and self-cultivation, arguing for the gentleman, rather than the measurements promoted by the Legalists, as the wellspring of objective criterion. His ideal gentleman (junzi) king and government, aided by a class of erudites (Ru), are \\"very close to that of Mencius\\", but without the tolerance of feudalism (since he rejected hereditary titles and believed that an individual's status in the social hierarchy should be determined only by their own merit).Burton Watson 2003.

History The dance may have been of Guatemalan and Mexican origin evolved from a Spanish dance with Arab influences, danced with a lively double line of couples with castanets. A dance called zarabanda is first mentioned in 1539 in Central America in the poem Vida y tiempo de Maricastaña, written in Panama by Fernando de Guzmán Mejía.Richard Hudson and Meredith Ellis Little, \\"Sarabande\\", Grove Music Online, edited by Deane Root (accessed 6 December 2016).José Luis Rodríguez Pittí, Panamá blues (Panama: El Hacedor, 2010): . The dance seems to have been especially popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, initially in the Spanish colonies, before moving across the Atlantic to Spain. The Jesuit priest Juan de Mariana thought it indecent, describing it in his Tratato contra los juegos públicos (Treatise Against Public Amusements, 1609) as \\"a dance and song so loose in its words and so ugly in its motions that it is enough to excite bad emotions in even very decent people\\".Jane Bellingham, \\"Sarabande\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). A character in an entremés by Cervantes alluded to the dance's notoriety by saying that hell was its \\"birthplace and breeding place\\" (in ). It was banned in Spain in 1583 but was nevertheless still performed and frequently cited in literature of the period (for instance, by Lope de Vega). It spread to Italy in the 17th century, and to France, where it became a slow court dance. The sarabande theme is reflected throughout much of classical music, especially in baroque era. The music of French baroque composer Jean-Marie LeClair's works born 1697, for example: Sonata for 2 violins, viola de gamba, and harpsichord in E minor; Op.1/7 BuxWV 258, an extraordinary work with this sarabande style, most likely influencing later baroque composers such as George Frideric Handel and J.S.Bach who also have notable works using the same theme. Baroque musicians of the 18th century wrote suites of dance music written in binary form that typically included a sarabande as the third of four movements. It was often paired with and followed by a jig or gigue.Percy A. Scholes (ed.), The Oxford Companion to Music (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1977), p. 911. J.S. Bach sometimes gave the sarabande a privileged place in his music, even outside the context of dance suites; in particular, the theme and climactic 25th variation from his Goldberg Variations are both sarabandes. The anonymous harmonic sequence known as La Folia appears in pieces of various types, mainly dances, by dozens of composers from the time of Mudarra (1546) and Corelli through to the present day.Giuseppe Gerbino and Alexander Silbiger, \\"Folia\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001); Elaine Sisman, \\"Variations, §3: Variation Types\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). The theme of the fourth-movement Sarabande of Handel's Keyboard suite in D minor (HWV 437) for harpsichord, one of these many pieces, appears prominently in the film Barry Lyndon. The sarabande was revived in the 19th and early 20th centuries by the German composer Louis Spohr (in his Salonstücke, Op. 135 of 1847), Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (in his Holberg Suite of 1884), French composers such as Debussy and Satie, and in England, in different styles, Vaughan Williams (in Job: A Masque for Dancing), Benjamin Britten (in the Simple Symphony), Herbert Howells (in Six Pieces for Organ: Saraband for the Morning of Easter), and Carlos Chávez in the ballet La hija de Cólquide. The sarabande inspired the title of Ingmar Bergman's last film Saraband (2003). The film uses the sarabande from J. S. Bach's Fifth Cello Suite, which Bergman also used in Cries and Whispers (1971).Ingmar Bergman Saraband – Sources of inspiration  References   Further reading  *Carvajal, Mara Lioba Juan. 2007.

The Inquirer has the sixteenth-largest average weekday U.S. newspaper circulation, and has won eighteen Pulitzer Prizes. Early life Moses Annenberg was born in East Prussia (German Empire) in 1877 to a Lithuanian Jewish family. He left Germany and immigrated to Chicago in 1900. Career Annenberg began his career as a Chicago newspaper salesman at the Chicago Tribune, then, for the Hearst Corporation. He eventually built a fortune and the successful publishing company that became Triangle Publications, Inc., owning, among other publications, the Daily Racing Form. During the Roosevelt administration, he was indicted for tax evasion on August 11, 1939, for income tax evasion for the years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936 totaling $3,258,809.97 in income taxes evaded. On April 4, 1940, Annenberg pleaded guilty to the 1936 income tax evasion count in the indictment that charged him with evading $1.2 million in taxes ($ million today).

Its campus was bounded by today's Gilbert, Yale, Park, and Chapel Streets. Its board intended it to be \\"a great central theological institution at Cincinnati — soon to become the great Andover or Princeton of the West.\\" However, the founding and first years of Lane were difficult and contentious, culminating in a mass student exodus over the issue of slavery, or more specifically whether students were permitted to discuss the topic, the first major academic freedom incident in America. Cincinnati was quite racist and unsettled, and the trustees immediately prohibited further discussion of the topic, to avoid repercussions. Being on the border of the South, a lot of fugitive slaves and freedmen went through Cincinnati, including James Bradley, who would participate in the debates discussed below. Their competition for jobs had led to the anti-abolitionist Cincinnati riots of 1829 and would soon produce the Cincinnati riots of 1836. Inauguration \\"The founding of Lane Seminary was accomplished after years of sometimes disparate efforts on the part of a large number of people.\\" The Presbyterian tradition was to have educated clergy, and there was no seminary serving the vast and increasingly populated lands west of the Allegheny Mountains. The denomination was on record as early as 1825 saying such a seminary was needed. In 1829 there were only 8,000 ministers to serve a population of 12,000,000, two thousand more churches than ministers, and only 200 ministers per year were being trained. While there were local efforts to have the new seminary in Cincinnati, the Presbyterian General Assembly decided in 1827 to locate it in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The western synods refused to accept this, finding it too far away. In the summer of 1828 Ebenezer Lane, a New Orleans businessman, \\"made known his interest in setting up a theological seminary near Cincinnati based on the manual labor system.\\" He and his brother Lane pledged $4,000 for the new school, on condition that it be in Cincinnati and follow the manual labor model. After this, their connection with the Seminary was minimal; Ebenezer was not even happy that it carried his name. The land was donated by Kemper Seminary. \\"Walnut Hill was a pretty little village, quite distant from Cincinnati, the first stopping-place for the stage on the Madisonville or some other northern Ohio route.\\" \\"\\"The location of Lane Seminary is in the midst of a most beautiful landscape. There is just enough, and just the right admixture of hills and dale, forest and field, to give it the effect we love in gazing upon a calm and quiet scene of beauty,\\" wrote a visiting minister in 1842. A board was set up in October 1828, and the Ohio General Assembly issued a charter on February 11, 1829, specifying that the manual labor system would be \\"the fundamental principle\\" of the Seminary. The Rev. George C. Beckwith was appointed to a professorship in April, accepted in August, and arrived in Cincinnati in the following November. He \\"had 3 or 4 students during the winter.\\" In July, 1830, Beckwith visited the Oneida Institute and wrote back to Cincinnati that manual labor worked well and that the farmers and mechanics of the neighborhood approved of it. He resigned in August, 1830. \\"At that time [1830], the seminary consisted of some woods and one foundation for a building.\\" In January, 1831, George Washington Gale, president of the Oneida Institute, recommended a steward to supervise the Seminary farm; in February the trustees made the appointment. But in the winter of 1830-31, \\"Lane Seminary was in a state of suspended animation. There were no teachers and apparently only two students, Amos Dresser and Horace Bushnell, who had come out from the Oneida Institute and had been given special permission by the trustees to occupy rooms in the lonesome Seminary building.\\" Bushnell, who on his arrival in 1830 \\"found [at the embrionic Lane] no theology\\", slept \\"on a study-table, with his books for a pillow\\". In 1834, the manual labor department contained six printing presses, operated by 20 students, and had printed 150,000 copies of \\"Webster's spellling books\\", for a bookstore. 30 students were employed in cabinet making, and total enrollment, before the mass walkout described below, was about 100. The Oneida Institute and Lane Theodore Dwight Weld, leader of the Lane Rebels By coincidence, the local efforts to set up a seminary fit with the desires of the Tappan philanthropists, Arthur and Lewis, to found a seminary in what was then the growing west of the new country. The charismatic Theodore D. Weld had been one of the first Oneida students, first studying and working on George Washington Gale's farm, then at Gale's Oneida Institute of Science and Industry from its opening in 1827 through 1830. When he left Oneida, he was hired by the new Manual Labor Society, funded by the same Tappan brothers that had funded Oneida, \\"to find a site for a great national manual labor institution...where training for the western ministry could be provided for poor but earnest young men who had dedicated their lives to the home missionary cause in the 'vast valley of the Mississippi'\\". Weld himself was seeking to continue his preparation for a career as minister. \\"Cincinnati was the logical location. Cincinnati was the focal center of population and commerce in the Ohio valley.\\" In the pre-railroad era, Cincinnati was the most accessible city in what was then the west of the United States. Weld stopped at Cincinnati twice on his manual labor lecture and scouting tour: in February and March, 1832, and in the following September. On the earlier visit he delivered several lectures and supported the call to famous revivalist Charles Grandison Finney to come west; Finney declined, though he did come three years later, as professor and later president of the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute. Weld's second choice — and it was his choice, because the Tappans relied on his recommendations — was Lyman Beecher, father of Henry Ward Beecher, who would graduate from Lane, and Harriet Beecher Stowe; Lane had been trying to recruit him since February 1831. Lane, Weld concluded, would do as a manual labor theological school, if Beecher would come. \\"Such an institution would undoubtedly attract many of Weld's associates who had been disappointed in the failure to establish theological instruction at the Oneida Institute.\\" Beecher did come, as President and as \\"Chair of Systematic Theology\\", motivated by the promise of a $20,000 subvention for Lane from \\"Tappan\\". Beecher, along with professor Thomas J. Biggs, future president of Cincinnati College, began as president December 26, 1832; this is when \\"Lane actually began operation.... Before that time, staff was slight and housing meager.\\" The house the Beecher family lived in is now known as the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. \\"Lane was Oneida moved west.\\" Early in June 1833, Weld, Robert L. Stanton, and \\"six other young Finneyites\\" arrived in Cincinnati, having completed their journey by river from Rochester and Oneida. \\"They were promptly admitted to the seminary on the recommendation of two other 'Oneidas' [Porter and Weed] already in attendance.\\" However, although technically enrolled as a student, Weld was the de facto head of Lane; \\"He...told the trustees what appointments to make.\\" \\"Many of the students considered him the real leader of Lane\\", their \\"patron saint\\". \\"In the estimation of the class, he was president. He took the lead of the whole institution. The young men had, many of them, been under his care, and they thought he was a god.\\" The tempo of the seminary was sharply stepped up, its real head now being on the ground. \\"Weld is here & we are glad,\\" wrote Professor Biggs on July 2. The self-assembling at Lane of men from very diverse places, called by a modern writer an invasion, was so colorful that multiple authors have described it. The earliest is from Weld himself; he is one of the \\"two members\\": A contemporary commentator points to the work on rafts as reflecting the students' experience with manual labor at Oneida. A modern retelling of the same incident: \\"[T]he institution itself is second in importance to no other in the United States.\\" Beecher \\"assured us that he had more brains in this theological camp than could be found in any other in the United States.\\" Beecher, in his autobiography, takes a dig at Oberlin, while claiming that there were already \\"colored students\\" at Lane: \\"It was with great difficulty, and only in the prospect of rich endowments and of securing a large class of students, that the principle of admission irrespective of color, already in practice at Lane, received from the trustees of Oberlin a cold and ambiguous sanction.\\" What he says about Oberlin is roughly correct, but none of the black students at Oneida moved to Lane. The one black student we know of at Lane, James Bradley, by his own description \\"so ignorant, that I suppose it will take me two years to get up with the lowest class in the institution,\\" despite Beecher's regret felt it wiser not to attend a student gathering at Beecher's home. The slavery debates Lane Seminary is known primarily for the debates held there over 18 evenings in February 1834; John Rankin was in attendance, as was Harriett Beecher [Stowe], daughter of Lane's president. They were nominally on the topic of colonization of freed slaves, on sending them to (not \\"back to\\") Africa. They were publicized nationally and influenced the nation's thinking about slavery, creating support for abolition. A 4-page report by H. B. Stanton appeared in March in both The Liberator and the New York Evangelist, and Garrison and Knapp, printers of The Liberator and most books on slavery in the U.S. in the early 1830s, issued it in pamphlet form. The affair got further publicity late in 1834, when 51 of the Lane students — the vast majority — published a 28-page pamphlet, A statement of the reasons which induced the students of Lane Seminary, to dissolve their connection with that institution (Cincinnati, 1834). =Background= The abolition–colonization controversy Part of \\"the negro problem\\", as it was seen in the antebellum United States, was the question of what to do with former slaves that had become free. Since the eighteenth century Quakers and others had preached the sinfulness of slave ownership, and the number of freedmen (and freed women) was rising and showed every sign that it would continue to grow. The freed slaves married and had children, so the number of free people of color (Blacks born free) was rising even faster. Some owners freed their slaves in their wills. Philanthropic societies and individuals raised or donated funds to purchase slaves' freedom; freedmen sometimes were able to purchase the freedom of family members. In some Northern cities there were more than a handful of escaped slaves. The status of these free blacks was anything but comfortable. They were not citizens and in most states could not vote. They had no access to the courts or protection by the police. In no state could their children attend the public schools. The were subject to discriminatory treatment in everyday life that makes the Jim Crow period look good. The original \\"remedy\\" for this problem was to help them go \\"back to Africa\\". The British had been doing this, in Sierra Leone, moving there former American slaves that had gained their freedom by escaping to British lines during the American Revolution, and who found Nova Scotia, where the British took many of them, too cold. (See Black Nova Scotians.) The British also took to Sierra Leone slaves captured from slaving ships, being smuggled illegally across the Atlantic to North America. A well-to-do African-American shipowner, Paul Cuffe, transported some former slaves to Sierra Leone. However, sending former slaves to a British colony as a policy was politically unacceptable. The American Colonization Society was formed to help found a new, American colony of freed blacks. Although there was some talk of locating it in the American territories of the midwest, or on the Pacific coast—a sort of reservation for Blacks—what was decided to follow the English example and start an African colony. The closest available land was what became Liberia. The rejection of colonization The colonization project got off to a good start, with various governmental and private donations and the participation of distinguished individuals: U.S. Presidents Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison; Senator Henry Clay, who presided over its first meeting; as well as most of the future white abolitionists. The problem had been solved, and in an honorable way. The former slaves would fare better in Africa, among other blacks. This happy situation quickly started to unravel. First of all, the disease rates were ghastly, the highest since accurate record-keeping began. Over 50% of the colonists died of malaria and other diseases. Particularly telling to Gerrit Smith, the abolitionist philanthropist, was that the American Colonization allowed the sale of alcohol (and other nasties, like guns and chewing tobacco) in the colonies which became Liberia. He comments on it in the Society's African Repository magazine. Smith was for temperance, which was the only respectable position. That blacks in Africa were allowed to import liquor from the United States revealed the true venality of the white members of the American Colonization Society: its goal was to get rid of the blacks, and they sure didn't want them up north. =Weld organizes \\"debates\\"= \\"Weld had no intention of holding a debate on the pros and cons of antislavery.\\" \\"There was little opposition, little conflict, and consequently little debate.\\" In his correspondence Weld informs friends that he is trying to get the anti-slavery (immediatist) argument and evidence out to as many people as possible. Nevertheless, what was announced was debates, on two points. Beecher was a colonizationist, and gave a speech on that topic to the Cincinnati Colonization Society on June 4, 1834. At Lane there was a \\"colonization society\\", supporting the efforts of the American Colonization Society to send free blacks to (not \\"back to\\") Africa, to Liberia. How it came to be is not known, but it was there when the Oneida contingent and friends arrived. There had been similar groups at Western Reserve and other colleges. Weld read William Garrison's new abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, begun in 1831, and his Thoughts on African Colonization, which appeared in 1832. These had a great influence at the other Ohio College, Western Reserve College, leading to Beriah Green's 4 published sermons, and his relocation under pressure to Gale's school, Oneida. What Garrison desired, and he convinced Green, was \\"immediatism\\": immediate, complete, and uncompensated freeing of all slaves. Over a period of several months Weld convinced nearly all of the students individually of the superiority of the abolitionist view. When the merits of the proposed solutions to slavery were debated over 18 days at the Seminary in February, 1834, it was one of the first major public discussions of the topic, but it was more of an anti-slavery revival than a \\"debate.\\" =The stated topics of the debates= The two specific questions addressed were: * \\"Ought the people of the slaveholding states abolish slavery immediately?\\", and * \\"Are the doctrines, tendencies, and measures of the American Colonization Society, and the influence of its principal supporters, such as render it worthy of the patronage of the Christian public?\\" The debates were not transcribed, and there was no attempt afterwards, as there would be later with Pennsylvania Hall, to collect the texts which were written out — not all were — and make a booklet of them. However, there are excerpts in newspapers and books. =Participants= =Speakers at the debates= * \\"Mr. Henry P. Thompson, a native and still a resident of Nicholasville, Kentucky, made the following statement at a public meeting in Lane Seminary, Ohio, in 1833 [1834]. He was at that time a slaveholder.\\" * \\"Rev. Coleman S. Hodges, a resident of Western Virginia, gave the following testimony at the same meeting:\\" *\\"Mr. Calvin H. Tate, of Missouri, whose father and brother were slaveholders, related the following at the same meeting. The plantation on which it occurred, was in the immediate neighborhood of his father's.\\" =Sequela= \\"The trustees soon expressed a determination to prevent all further discussion of the comparative merits of the policy of the Colonization Society, and the doctrine of immediate emancipation, either in the recitation rooms, the rooms of the students, or at the public table; although no objection had previously been made to the free discussion of any subject whatever. During the vacation that followed, in the absence of a majority of the professors, this purpose was framed into a law, or rule, of the seminary, and obedience to it required from all.\\" The trustees laid down the doctrine that \\"no associations or societies ought to be allowed in the seminary, except such as have for their immediate object, improvement in the prescribed course of studies.\\" This was followed by an order in these words: \\"Ordered that the students be required to discontinue those societies [the Anti-slavery and Colonization societies] in the seminary.\\" The event resulted in the dismissal of a professor, John Morgan, and the departure of a group of 40 students and a trustee. It was one of the first significant tests in the United States of academic freedom and the right of students to participate in free discussion. It is the first organized student body in American history. Several of those involved went on to play an important role in the abolitionist movement and the buildup to the American Civil War. though I can no longer publicly advocate it as the agent of your society, I hope soon to plead its cause in the humbler sphere of personal example, while pursuing my professional studies, in a rising institution at the west, in which manual labor is a DAILY REQUISITION. Each question was debated for two and a half hours a night for nine nights. Among the participants: * Eleven had been born and brought up in slave states. * Seven were sons of slaveholders. * One had only recently ceased to be a slaveholder. * One, Bradley,had been a slave and had bought his freedom. * Ten had lived in slave states. * One, Birnam, was an agent of the Colonization Society. Arguments addressing the first question in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery included: * Slaves long for freedom. * When inspired with a promise of freedom, slaves will toil with incredible alacrity and faithfulness. * No matter how kind their master is, slaves are dissatisfied and would rather be his hired servants than his slaves. * Blacks are abundantly able to take care of and provide for themselves. * Blacks would be kind and docile if immediately emancipated. In response to the second question, Reverend Dr. Samuel H. Cox, who had served as an agent for the Colonization Society, testified that his view of the Society's plan changed when he realized that no blacks, despite the claims of those who ventured to speak for them, would ever consent to be removed from their native country and transplanted to a foreign land. He reasoned, therefore, that the plan could only be enacted by a \\"national society of kidnappers.\\" At the end of the debate, many of the participants concluded not only that slavery was a sin, but also that the policy of the American Colonization Society to send blacks to Africa was wrong. As a result, these students formed an antislavery society and began organizing activities and outreach work among the black population of Cincinnati. They intended to attain the emancipation of blacks, not by rebellion or force, but by \\"approaching the minds of slave holders with the truth, in the spirit of the Gospel.\\" =Notable people present= \\"The President, and the members of the faculty, with one exception [Bates], were present during parts of the discussion.\\" * Gamaliel Bailey, physician, lecturer on physiology at Lane, to become an abolitionist newspaper editor. * Harriet Beecher Stowe, at that time simply Harriet Beecher, daughter of Lane's president; 18 years later publishes Uncle Tom's Cabin. * Henry Ward Beecher, minister, called, after his father Lyman, \\"the most noted minister of the nineteenth century\\". Supported sending rifles (\\"Beecher's Bibles\\") to emigrants trying to make Kansas a free state. * Lyman Beecher, controversial president of Lane, father of Henry and Harriet. * James G. Birney, attorney, former American Colonization Society Agent, author of a lengthy published break with or attack on the Society. \\"His knowledge and pervasive influence informed the Lane Seminary debate, lifting it to the height of its subject.\\" * James Bradley (former slave), the only Black participant. * Samuel Crothers (probable but unconfirmed) * Amos Dresser, Lane student; would hecome famous for being publicly whipped in Nashville, Tennessee, for distributing abolitionist literature. * Huntington Lyman * Asa Mahan, minister and Lane trustee, the only one that supported the students, who resigned with the students and accompanied them to the Oberlin Collegiate Institute, whose first president he became. * John Rankin (abolitionist), author of the first American anti-slavery book, and key figure on the Underground Railroad in Ohio. * Henry Brewster Stanton, future abolitionist speaker and politician, and husband of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. * Calvin Ellis Stowe, Lane professor, future husband of Harriet Beecher. * Theodore Dwight Weld, former Oneida student, anti-slavery activist. * Hiram Wilson, former Oneida student like Weld; moved to Canada and ran Canadian terminus for the Underground Railroad. After the debates =Activities in the black community= \\"We believe faith without works is dead,\\" Weld wrote to Arthur Tappan in 1834. He, Augustus Wattles, and other students created a school out of three rooms, and \\"raised hundreds of dollars to outfit a library and rent classrooms.\\" Classes were run both days and evenings, and the school was soon at capacity. Inspired by Prudence Crandall's example, he also set up a school for black women, and Arthur Tappan paid $1,000 () for four female teachers to relocate from New York to Cincinnati. As Lewis Taplan put it in his biography of his brother, \\"[T]he anti-slavery students of Lane Seminary established evening-schools for the adults, and day-schools for the children of the three thousand colored of Cincinnati.\\" =The threat of violence= Rumors circulated during the summer of 1834 about mob violence against the Seminary; the threat of violence had caused Miami University of Ohio to ban the discussion of abolition. Cincinnati, which was pro-Southern, had already experienced the anti-black Cincinnati riot of 1829, and the huge anti-abolition riots in New York in July of 1834, which specifically targeted the Tappans, were heavily reported in the Cincinnati newspapers. =Trustees ban the discussion of abolition= As Cincinnati businessmen, the members of the school's board of trustees were quite concerned about being associated with such a radical expression of abolitionism, which could have led to a physical attack on the Seminary. \\"A riot was very [narrowly] averted, probably only because of Lane's summer vacation.\\" President Beecher did not want to escalate the matter by overreacting, but when the press began to turn public opinion against the students that summer, he was conveniently fundraising in Boston. In his absence, the Executive Committee of the trustees issued a report ordering the abolishment of the school's antislavery society, stating that \\"no associations or Societies among the students ought to be allowed in the Seminary except such as have for their immediate object improvement in the prescribed course of studies.\\" They also declared that they had the right to dismiss any student \\"when they shall think it necessary to do so.\\" They further adopted a rule to \\"discourage...such discussions and conduct among the students as are calculated to divert their attention from their studies\\", meaning students were not to discuss abolitionism even when dining. (Talking to students while they were eating is specifically prohibited in the Standing Rules enacted by the Trustees on October 13, 1834.) The committee underlined their position by dismissing professor John Morgan for taking the side of the students. In October, without waiting for Beecher to return, the board ratified the committee's resolutions. On his return, Beecher and two professors issued a statement intended to assuage the anger of the students regarding the action of the trustees, but it was regarded by the students as a faculty endorsement of the trustees' action. =The \\"Lane Rebels\\" resign= On October 21, most of the students resigned, as did trustee Asa Mahan (another member of Finney's contingent). (Technically, they requested dismissal from the school, which was granted.) They published a pamphlet of 28 pages, written by Weld, on \\"the reasons which induced the students of Lane Seminary, to dissolve their connection with that institution.\\" The pamphlet received national attention as it was reprinted in full in The Liberator. The Rebels were a loosely-defined group, and different sources give different names and figures. The Statement had 51 signatures, but it adds that \\"several of our brethren, who coincide with us in sentiment, are not able to affix their names to this document, in consequence of being several hundred miles from the Seminary.\\" According to Lane, there were 40, including the entirety of Lane's first class, the class of 1836 (who began in 1833). There were also prospective students who declined to enroll. Lawrence Lesick, author of the only book on the Lane Rebels, gives a figure of 75, but another 19 had left before the Trustees took action, and only 8 students, out of 103, remained at Lane at the beginning of the next term. According to Oberlin, 32 of them enrolled, although some others who enrolled at the same time, though not students at Lane, are considered part of the Rebels. A few enrolled at other schools, such as Auburn Theological Seminary. Weld and some other student leaders at Lane — William T. Allan, Weld's collaborator and president of Lane's new anti-slavery society, James Thome, a prominent speaker during the debates, and Henry B. Stanton — had been threatened with expulsion. Weld did not withdraw until the motion to expel him, which would have been nationally publicized, had been defeated. =The \\"seminary\\" at Cumminsville= About a dozen of the Lane Rebels, as they came to be called, established an informal seminary of their own in 1834–1835, in Cumminsville, Ohio. \\"We went out, not knowing whither we went. The Lord's hand was with us. Five miles from the seminary we found a deserted brick tavern, with many convenient rooms. Here we rallied. A gentleman of the vicinity offered us all necaessary fuel, a gentleman far off [Lewis Tappan] sent us a thousand dollars, and we set up a seminary of our own and became a law unto ourselves. George Whipple was competent in Hebrew, and William T. Allan in Greek. They were made professors in the intermediate state. It was desirable that we should remain near to Cincinnati for a season, as we were there teaching in evening schools for the colored people of that city.\\" At Cumminsville, \\"the students continued their work in the black community. William T. Allan, Andrew Benton, Marius R. Robinson, Henry B. Stanton, and George Whipple taught in the Sabbath schools. John W. Alvord, Huntington Lyman, Henry B. Stanton, James A. Thome, and Samuel Wells gave lectures twice a week in the black community. The students also alternated in preaching at eight different churces, including two black churches. They helped support Augustus Wattles' teachers in schools, enlisted the cooperation of local black ministers, and kept Weld, now an anti-slavery agent, and Joshua Leavitt informed of local events.\\" This was the point at which the former Lane students came into contact with John J. Shipherd, founder of the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute, \\"a college in name only\\" that had been founded the previous year (1833). \\"The former Lane students literally took possession of the embryo institution.\\" =The conditions of the Lane Rebels' enrollment at Oberlin= The students negotiated with Shipherd the installation of Asa Mahan, the Lane trustee who resigned, as Oberlin's president. Oberlin also agreed to hire Morgan, the discharged professor. The trustees would not have the power, as they did at Lane, to meddle in the affairs of professors and students. The most controversial condition insisted on by the Rebels was that Oberlin commit itself to accepting African-American students in general, and the very popular James Bradley in particular, on an equal basis. This was agreed to reluctantly, after a \\"dramatic\\" vote (4–4, tie broken by Chair). The Lane Rebels, with Weld at their head, could insist on these conditions because funding from the Tappans came with them. If the Trustees did not agree they would lose this crucial funding, as well as Mahan, Finney, and Shipherd, who threatened to quit. The conditions of the Rebels set limits, for the first time, on an American college's authority over students and faculty. They also were part of the shift in American antislavery efforts from colonization to abolition; many of the Rebels would become part of Oberlin's cadre of minister–abolitionists. Postcard of Lane Theological Seminary, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati. Late 19th century? The Seminary after 1834 When the Rebels departed in October 1834, \\"they left behind them but two seminarians in a theological department that had boasted forty, and only five scholars of the sixty formerly enrolled for the literary curriculum. \\"Of the several gloomy years that succeeded the abolition secession, I need only say, that the wonder is, that Lane did not perish. It had few students and little money.\\" \\"The institution was disgraced and wrecked; it never recovered from the experience.\\" In 1837 \\"the seminary had no students\\", but Beecher went on a recruiting trip and persuaded some to enroll. Following the slavery debates, Lane Seminary continued as a \\"New School\\" seminary, cooperating with Congregationalists and others in mission and education efforts and involved in social reform movements like abolition, temperance, and Sabbath legislation. The seminary admitted students from other denominations and pursued educational and evangelistic unity among Protestant churches in the West. In 1837 there were 41 students from 15 states, and 4 faculty: Beecher, Calvin Ellis Stowe, Thomas J. Biggs, and Baxter Dickinson. After the Civil War, the New School and the Old School Presbyterians had reconciled, and Lane Seminary was reorganized along more conservative Presbyterian lines. In 1910, it became affiliated with the Presbyterian Seminary of the South, and the Seminary continued as a small but respected school, though financial pressures continued to increase. Following a brief period of growth in the 1920s, it became apparent that Lane could no longer survive as an independent school. In 1932 it suspended operations and transferred its library and other resources to McCormick Theological Seminary, in Chicago. While a permanent Board of Trustees for Lane Theological Seminary remained in service until the Seminary was legally merged out of existence in 2007, the faculty, library collections, and students were transferred to Chicago, and the last remnants of the Cincinnati campus, except for the house of president Lyman Beecher, were destroyed in 1956. A historical marker in front of an automobile dealership at 2820 Gilbert Ave. marks the site of the campus. Historical re-enactments The Lane Debates have been re-enacted in recent years by historians from Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and Oberlin College. Media A movie about the debates, Sons & Daughters of Thunder, is being released in December 2019. It is based on a play by Earlene Hawley and Curtis Heeter. Archival material Archival materials of Lane are located at the Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia.

Biography Preisler gained underground fame after publishing his first book Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture in the early 1980s. He says that he got the nickname \\"Uncle Fester\\" from his college years, since he was very well known for producing explosives, and blowing things up, like the character in The Addams Family. Preisler is an industrial chemist working in an electroplating factory he calls \\"the rat hole.\\" In his spare time, he writes books. Preisler graduated in 1981 from Marquette University with a Chemistry & Biology degree. Two years later, he was arrested for methamphetamine possession and was sentenced to probation. He was arrested again in 1984 for methamphetamine charges, and put in the Waupun Correctional Institution. He says that the arrest was over a few grams of methamphetamine, but the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) brought back credit card information saying that he had been buying large quantities of ephedrine, which is a precursor for methamphetamine. Outraged, Fester borrowed a typewriter from a fellow inmate, and began writing the manuscript for Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture. Loompanics Unlimited published the book, and it was an instant success. Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture is now in its eighth edition. It was one of Loompanics' best sellers. The book has information on how to produce crystal methamphetamine through six different methods. It also has data on how to synthesize MDMA or MDA, and how to synthesize methcathinone by oxidation of ephedrine. It also contains syntheses for precursor materials such as phenylacetone, ephedrine, methylamine, and alkyl nitrites. Previous editions of Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture have had some criticism: see for example Eleusis v. Fester for discussion between Fester and the past MDMA clandestine chemist Eleusis/Zwitterion. =Books= Uncle Fester has since written six other books: * Home Workshop Explosives details how the underground chemist can easily manufacture explosives. It describes manufacture of nitroglycerin as well as syntheses for RDX, ammonium nitrate, acetone peroxide blasting caps, nitroglycol, mannitol hexanitrate or nitromannitol, and PETN. It also has information on how to purify glycerin, how to synthesize nitric acid with minimal equipment, and how to make a fuel-air explosive (commonly known as an FAE). One reviewer of Home Workshop Explosives (David Harber, author of Guerrilla's Arsenal) notes that although the chemistry is solid, the chapter on detonation systems \\"borders on insanity.\\" * Silent Death describes routes for manufacturing nerve gases (such as tabun and sarin gas), botulinum (botulin toxin), ricin, phosgene, arsine, and other poisons. * Vest Busters, Fester's smallest book, describes easy methods for manufacturing steel bullets using a lathe and methods of coating them with Teflon. Both velocity and the strength of a bullet's core are the two most significant factors in determining whether a bullet has armor-piercing capabilities. However, coating a bullet with Teflon has no effect on armor penetration, and that Fester's statement that \\"Coating a bullet with Teflon would raise it one level higher\\" is false. As well, hard armor would render handguns a moot point against the plate anyhow. * Practical LSD Manufacture is one of Fester's more famous books. It deals with how one could manufacture a large quantity of LSD. This book is filled up with most of the hard-to-understand information on LSD syntheses that is currently available. The book has production information for the drug TMA-2, and plenty of information about how to isolate lysergic acid from morning glory seeds, and other plant material. This work is not without its criticisms: the use of more outdated syntheses from the 1950s and 1960s, lacking the synthesis using POCl3 as a dehydrating reagent in the condensation between diethylamine and lysergic acid; the speculation about \\"Method X\\" is erroneous, as propionic anhydride is used in the synthesis of fentanyl analogues; and there is some confusion over stereoisomers by Fester.

It took place in Quebec City on August 17–24, 1943, at both the Citadelle and the Château Frontenac. The chief representatives were Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, hosted by the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Conference Mackenzie King, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and the Earl of Athlone at La Citadelle Although Churchill suggested that Mackenzie King be involved in all discussions, Roosevelt vetoed the idea due to concern that future conferences would be encumbered by all of the Allied nations demanding seats. As a result, Mackenzie King's hospitality was almost purely for ceremonial purposes. Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, had been invited to join the conference, but he did not attend for military reasons. The Allies agreed to begin discussions for the planning of the invasion of France, codenamed Operation Overlord, in a secret report by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. It was agreed that Overlord would commence on May 1, 1944, but this was subsequently disregarded and a later date was finalised. However, Overlord was not the only option; for example, Operation Jupiter remained a strong possibility had the Germans proved too powerful on the French coast. In the Mediterranean (a theatre on which Churchill was very keen) they resolved to concentrate more force to remove Italy from the alliance of Axis powers and to occupy it along with Corsica. Churchill and Roosevelt made it clear that they would only accept unconditional surrender from Italy, with there to be a complete and immediate cessation of fighting. News came through of the fall of Sicily to Allied forces, an invasion that had taken just 38 days. It was then decided that an invasion of Italy would begin on September 3, 1943. However, an armistice was signed that same day, which officially put Italy out of the war. There were discussions about improving the coordination of efforts by the Americans, British, and Canadians to develop an atomic bomb. Churchill and Roosevelt, without Canadian input, signed the Quebec Agreement, stating that the nuclear technology would never be used against one another, that they would not use it against third parties without the consent of one another, but also that Tube Alloys would not be discussed with third parties. Canada, although not being represented at the particular meeting, played a key role in this agreement as she was a major source of uranium and heavy water, both essential in the atomic bomb. It was decided that operations in the Balkans should be limited to supplying guerrillas, whereas operations against Japan would be intensified in order to exhaust Japanese resources, cut their communications lines, and secure forward bases from which the Japanese mainland could be attacked. In addition to the strategic discussions, which were communicated to the Soviet Union and to Chiang Kai-shek in China, the conference also issued a joint statement on Palestine, intended to calm tensions as the British occupation was becoming increasingly untenable. The conference also condemned German atrocities in Poland. It was clear that eliminating Italy from the war was the Allies' main priority; this was expected to be done by the end of 1943. Following this, the next hope was that Germany would be defeated by the fall of 1944, which would leave just Japan remaining among the Axis powers. Following the conference, Churchill was on holiday at a fishing camp and then, on August 31, 1943, delivered a radio address before travelling by a special train that was going to Washington, D.C. to resume talks with Roosevelt.

Sgt. Maj. Émile Couture (then 25 years of age) of the Canadian Army was responsible for cleaning up the offices at both of these locations after the Conference had ended. Couture found a leather portfolio with a gold inscription \\"Churchill-Roosevelt, Quebec Conference, 1943.\\" on the exterior and kept it as a souvenir not realizing that it contained nearly complete plans for Operation Overlord. That evening Couture discovered the contents of the portfolio and, realizing the extremely sensitive nature of those documents, hid the portfolio under his mattress until he could return the portfolio in the morning. Couture was investigated by Scotland Yard and the FBI to ensure none of the information had been leaked. At the Second Quebec Conference Couture was awarded the British Empire Medal for his silence though it was attributed for \\"services rendered\\". Couture was interviewed on Radio-Canada's radio program Appelez-moi Lise by Lise Payette in 1972 about this issue. Additional magazine interviews with Couture are on display at the permanent exhibit for both Quebec Conferences in the Quebec Citadelle after September, 2019.

He was played by Jackie Coogan in the original television series, by Christopher Lloyd in the two feature films, by Nick Kroll in the 2019 animated feature, by Patrick Thomas in the direct-for-video film Addams Family Reunion, and by Michael Roberds in The New Addams Family. In the Broadway musical, the part was originated by Kevin Chamberlin, with Brad Oscar taking over on March 8, 2011. Character Uncle Fester is a completely hairless, hunched, and barrel- shaped man with dark, sunken eyes and often a deranged smile. He always wears a heavy, full-length fur coat. Fester was derived from a character drawn by cartoonist Charles Addams, although these were single-page cartoons, with no stories or character names. Nevertheless, the character is recognizable in a number of cartoons, both by his appearance (bald, stooping, sunken eyes) and behavior (e.g. turning the shower to a special \\"scalding\\" setting, feeding his garden plants blood plasma, and releasing an eagle on the neighbor's homing pigeons). While he is occasionally seen with the rest of the family, particularly on anthology covers, he is also seen on his own more often than the others. He is sometimes indicated to live in a small shack surrounded by a wrought-iron fence. Fester has a strange ability to generate electricity. He would often demonstrate this by putting a light bulb in his mouth, which would illuminate, accompanied by a loud, crackling noise. He claims to possess 110 volts of power in one episode of the sitcom, while in another episode he demonstrated his \\"magnetic\\" quality by levitating a metal paperweight up to his hand. When struck directly on the head by a fired cannonball, he appears only mildly dazed, while the cannonball bounces off his head. Uncle Fester at times has severe migraines but appears to enjoy them. Fester relieves his migraines by placing his head in a large screw press and tightening it to levels that normal people would not be able to withstand. At times, Fester uses the screw press on his head simply for enjoyment. Despite Uncle Fester's menacing look and bizarre behavior, he is gentle and caring to everyone. He shows great respect to Gomez and Morticia. He has always exhibited love and great care to his niece and nephews, despite their frequent naughtiness. Uncle Fester enjoys a movie In the original sitcom of the 1960s, Fester is said to be Morticia's maternal uncle (his name rhymes with Morticia's mother Hester's), but from the 1970s onward, he is Gomez's brother. In all adaptations, he is either uncle or great-uncle to Wednesday and Pugsley. He is known as \\"Tío Fétido\\" in Spain, \\"Tío Lucas\\" in Spanish-speaking countries and \\"Fétide\\" in France. In Brazil, he has three names: \\"Tio Chico\\" (original series and cartoon), \\"Tio Funéreo\\" (movies) and \\"Tio Fester\\" (Broadway Musical). Live action TV series In the 1960s television series, Fester (played by Jackie Coogan) is uncle to Morticia Addams. In one episode, he became perplexed when asked his last name, suggesting he has somehow forgotten it. In several episodes, Fester refers to the Addams lineage as if it were his own, possibly implying some degree of intertwined consanguinity in both their family lines, but the flashbacks in the episodes \\"Morticia's Romance, Parts 1 and 2,\\" clearly establish him as Morticia's uncle, brother of her mother, Hester Frump, a.k.a. Granny Frump (Margaret Hamilton), whose maiden name was similarly unrevealed. (Thus, Morticia's mother and uncle have rhyming names, Hester and Fester.) In various episodes, he was a partner in typical sitcom schemes with Gomez, Morticia, or Grandmama Addams, indicating no real preference for any family member over others. Fester's known ancestry dates back to his Great-Grandfather Blob (not to be confused with Gomez's Cousin Blob, a two-headed ghost), who received the gift of a sacred ruby after he had pried it from the head of a Hindu (to whom it was giving a terrible headache). The ruby remained in the family until Fester unthinkingly used his slingshot to hurl it at a yowling stray cat. \\"Well, it was the only rock in the house!\\" he said in his defense. Per the 1960s sitcom, little is known of Fester's childhood, save that his father (Morticia's maternal grandfather) was an excruciatingly strict man who severely disciplined him, paddling him even when he was good and paying him to stay out of public (Fester considered this to be experienced in \\"public relations\\"). He refused to allow Fester to even touch a battleaxe (a treasured toy among people with the Addams's macabre tastes) until he was eight. As an adult, Fester defended his father's strictness, pointing to his own character as proof of its effectiveness: \\"I didn't become what I am by accident! I had an upbringing like no other!\\" Sometime prior to Morticia's marriage to Gomez, Fester worked as a newspaper columnist, writing advice for the lovelorn, but left that job because people kept suing him. Fester has also offered contradictory information about his educational background. In the sitcom's first episode, he notes that he never went to school (\\"And look how [well] I turned out!\\"), but he later claims to have failed recess three times. As an adult, Fester took correspondence courses in various subjects, and his educational endeavors occasionally formed an episode's main plot. It may be from one such course that he obtained his fraternity paddle, which he once threatened to use on Wednesday in imitation of his father's punishment style; however, like many an uncle, Fester proved to have more bark than bite in dealing with the children. When he suspects someone of maligning, cheating or otherwise mistreating anyone in the family, Fester is ever ready with his blunderbuss \\"Genevieve\\", eager to \\"shoot 'em in the back!\\" However, he is far less eager in meeting a malefactor in a face-to- face duel; he was briefly enthusiastic about a pistol duel with an enemy until he asked, somewhat timidly, \\"Does he get one too?...Loaded?\\" Another prized possession was his cannon, \\"Old Reliable\\", which he normally kept in his bedroom. Fester maintained a treehouse in the Addams yard and frequently retreated to his closet to think. After receiving the gift of a motorcycle in the episode \\"The Addams Family Meets a Beatnik\\", Fester often drove it through the living room, inevitably crashing in the conservatory (several episodes used identical recycled footage of this scenario). Fester also collects three- dollar bills. The 1998 live-action series continues the tradition of having Fester (played by Canadian actor Michael Roberds) as Gomez's biological brother, yet between this version and the 1960s series, this is the only visible difference. In furtherance on the original series running gag of Uncle Fester being able to store electricity, one episode has Uncle Fester nearly kidnapped by aliens so as to be used to power their spaceship; the Aliens leave Uncle Fester behind-but only after \\"cloning\\" him for their spaceship journey home. Animated TV series In the first animated series by Hanna- Barbera, Jackie Coogan reprised his role as Fester. He also voiced that same character on an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In the second animated series by Hanna-Barbera, Fester was voiced by Rip Taylor (as Coogan had died in 1984). In this series, Fester is perhaps the most loving of self-inflicted injury. He would allow other members (usually Lurch) to harm him any way they can, but his greatest fondness was blowing himself up. As a running gag, Fester would never believe Grandmama's predictions until she predicts something that causes him great harm (or in his case, great joy). Fester also is very fond of the Addamses' next-door neighbor, Norman Normanmayer, a boring person controlling an underwear empire, who hates Fester (and the whole Addams family) for his strangeness (on an occasion, Fester comes on a visit through the sewer pipes). Fester seems quite oblivious of the fact that Norman hates him and, possibly due to the Addams family nature, thinks that all the angry and aggressive outbreaks are a sign of affection. This Fester also introduces himself, through his self-made comic books, as \\"Festerman\\", a gothic hero with a weakness to chimneys, who gives his flying cape to enemies upon request—so as to fall and would bring villains to their knees...simply by enjoying all the harm they would give him to the point of wearing them out. During this series, he is given a musical-type episode about the \\"Fester Way\\", his own, strange way of life. Film In the movie, The Addams Family, Fester (played by Christopher Lloyd) is the long-lost brother of Gomez Addams. He was believed to have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for twenty-five years. A loan shark named Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) conspires to steal the Addams's fortune using her son, Gordon, who displays an eerie resemblance to the missing Fester. On the night that the Addams hold a séance to contact Fester's spirit, Gordon shows up at their door, posing as Fester. Although he is baffled and horrified by the Addams at first, Gordon begins to take a liking to the family and their strange ways. In the end, he disobeys his mother and helps Gomez and his family get their house back. It is later discovered that Gordon is actually Fester, found by Abigail; his accident has caused him to suffer from amnesia, which is eventually cured by a lightning strike to his head. As revealed in the movie's ending scene, it is also subsequent to said abnormal electric shock that Fester acquires his ability to conduct electricity. In Gomez's home movies from their childhood, Fester is shown to be hairless as a child (although in a rather peculiar detail, as Gordon Craven, he is seen shaving his head). Fester also appears in the film's sequel (again played by Lloyd), Addams Family Values. This film centers around Fester's marriage to Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), the recently hired nanny who wishes to murder Fester and inherit his share of the Addams fortune. Fester again appears in the direct-to-video film Addams Family Reunion, here played by Patrick Thomas. He is portrayed as a mad scientist reminiscent of old Grade-B horror films. He creates a dog named \\"Butcher\\" as a birthday present for Pugsley—a dog that mutates into a hair-devouring brute whenever someone says \\"good boy.\\" In the end, Butcher attacks Cousin Itt—who is, understandably, quite nervous around him. Fester is voiced by Nick Kroll in 2019 computer-animated adaptation of The Addams Family. Musical In the musical, Uncle Fester was played by Kevin Chamberlin in the original broadway cast. Chamberlin received a Tony nomination for the role. He was later played by Brad Oscar, Blake Hammond, Russell Dykstra and Shaun Rice. This incarnation of Fester serves as the musical's narrator and is in love with the moon. The subject of love is apparently his \\"specialty\\", and he is able to play the ukulele when he sings a love song to the moon. He also seems to communicate with the ancestors throughout the show more than the other characters. Video games Uncle Fester has appeared in several Addams Family video games as a playable character.

After a spin-out, the dictionaries have been run since 3 April 2006 by the limited liability company Leo GmbH, formed by the members of the original Leo team, and are partially funded by commercial advertising on the website. Its dictionaries can be consulted free online from any web browser or from LEO's Lion downloadable user interface (GUI) which is free since version 3.0 (released 13 January 2009) to private users only and no longer sold as shareware. Corporate users and research institutions are however required to purchase a licence.  Dictionaries  The website hosts eight free German language based bilingual dictionaries and forums for additional language queries. The dictionaries are characterized by providing translations in forms of hyperlinks to further dictionary queries, thereby facilitating back translations. The dictionaries are partly added to and corrected by large vocabulary donations of individuals or companies, partly through suggestions and discussions on the LEO language forums. For any of the eight foreign languages, there's at least one (in the cases of English and French two) qualified employee in charge (whose mother tongue is either German and who has studied the respective other idiom or vice versa). These employees oversee the above-mentioned donations and suggestions before integrating them in the dictionary. Thus an entry can never be simply made by a registered user. These registered users, on the other hand, have the possibility to communicate in the eight different forums where native German speakers and the other native speakers collaborate alike, providing help with finding idiomatic equivalents for phrases or texts etc. All the eight dictionaries' user interfaces can be viewed either in German or in the respective language. = English–German = The English-German dictionary run by Leo since 1995 contains around 800,000 entries and receives an average of 11 million queries per weekday. = French–German = In 2004, a French–German dictionary was added to the site's services and has about 257,000 entries.

The original aim was to create a single, huge archive by linking up archives run by the different research groups (hence its name LEO – Link Everything Online. The archive was sorted thematically and the different sections organised and kept up to date by archivists. When the World Wide Web came into common use, HTTP access to the archive was at first added as an alternative to FTP. Students developed various services in their free time, in particular the dictionaries. Some services have been dropped in the course of the spin out. Name The name of the site is actually a backronym from the name Leo: the Bavarian coat of arms features a lion. Originally, the service was named ISAR (a backronym for Isar river, on the banks of which Munich is situated; here, ISAR stood for Informations Systeme und Archiv München, but it had to be renamed as there was another firm of the same name.

Music Dou Wei is a multi-instrumentalist and produces music across many genres. He first came to prominence as a member of the hard rock group Black Panther (Hei Bao, 黑豹). His album 'Dark Dreams (a.k.a. Black Dream) draws influences from The Cure and Bauhaus, and was a landmark album in the Chinese rock scene and gained strong popularity. In the following albums Sunny Days and Mountain River, Dou Wei explored new frontiers in electronic and ambience. From there on, Dou Wei's music took the direction of ambience, folk and post- rock. His two last vocal album Acousma and Rainy Murmur with the E band drew influence from the UK post-rock group Bark Psychosis. Dou Wei was the runner up in the 1995 MTV International Viewer's Choice Awards with his music video \\"Black Dream\\", right behind his then yet-to-be wife Faye Wong, who won the award with her music video \\"Chess\\". Since then Dou Wei's music became more improvisational and he has consistently collaborated with others and formed the group Indefinite. His 2013 album Golden Curse (殃金咒) was described as \\"a fifty-minute Buddhist metal freakout\\". In 2014 he released the \\"one track album\\" Horoscope, with Zifeng on flute and Moxi Zishi. Personal life Dou Wei has two daughters: one named Dou Jingtong, born to his ex-wife, Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, and the other one, Dou Jiayuan (), born to his ex-wife, photographer Gao Yuan (). On 10 May 2006, Dou was arrested after storming the office of The Beijing News' editorial department, destroying a computer keyboard and a DVD player, and pouring water on editors in the office, before setting fire to a car's boot parked in front of the newspaper's office building. Dou claimed that his actions had been justified by the actions of an anonymous Beijing News reporter, whom Dou accused of publishing what he believed to be falsified news about Dou and his second wife, Gao Yuan. Dou Wei wrote and sang the theme song of the 2011 film Dragon. The song was nominated for best original theme song at the 31st Hong Kong Film Awards. In March 2019, Dou Wei was married to a longtime fan two decades younger than him. She and Dou had a child in 2016.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 233 BC), also known as Han Fei Zi, was a Chinese philosopher or statesman2018 Henrique Schneider. p.1. An Introduction to Hanfei's Political Philosophy: The Way of the Ruler. of the Legalist school during the Warring States period, and a prince of the state of Han. Han Fei is often considered to be the greatest representative of “Chinese Legalism” for his eponymous work the Han Feizi, synthesizing the methods of his predecessors. Han Fei's ideas are sometimes compared with Niccolò MachiavelliNguyển Hiến Lê, Giản Chi (1995). Hàn Phi Tử. NXB Văn hóa thông tin. and his book is considered by some to be superior to the \\"Il Principe\\" of Niccolò Machiavelli both in content and in writing style. It is said that Shu Han's chancellor Zhuge Liang demanded emperor Liu Shan read the Han Feizi for learning the way of ruling. Sima Qian recounts the First Emperor as being presented with Han Fei’s works, going so far as to go to war with Han to obtain an audience with Han Fei, but is ultimately convinced to imprison him, whereupon he commits suicide.The biography by Sima Qian is presented in \\"The Biography of Han Fei Tzŭ By Ssŭ-ma Ch\`ien\\" chapter of The Complete Works of Han Fei Tzu, translated by W.K. Liao, 1939, reprinted by Arthur Probsthain, 1959. https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=op8KAQAAIAAJ http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/hanfei.xml&style;=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id;=d1.4&toc.depth;=1&toc.id;=0&doc.lang;=bilingual After the early demise of the Qin dynasty, the philosophy of Legalism became officially vilified by the following Han dynasty. Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, Han Fei's political theory and the concept of Legalism as a whole continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of a rule without laws was never to be realised. Han borrowed Shang Yang's emphasis on laws, Shen Buhai's emphasis on administrative technique, and Shen Dao's ideas on authority and prophecy, emphasizing that the autocrat will be able to achieve firm control over the state with the mastering of his predecessors' methodologies: his position of power (勢; Shì), technique (術; Shù), and law (法; Fǎ). He stressed the importance of the concept of Xing-Ming (holding actual outcome accountable to speech), coupled with the system of the \\"Two Handles\\" (punishment and reward), as well as Wu wei (non-exertion). Name Han Fei is his name, while -Zi (, lit. \\"Master\\") was often added to philosophers' names as an extra addition honorific. The title Han Feizi is also used to denote the book written by him. Life The exact year of Han Fei's birth remains unknown, however scholars have placed it at around 280 BCE. Unlike the other famed philosophers of the time, Han Fei was a member of the ruling aristocracy, having been born into the ruling family of the State of Han during the end phase of the Warring States period. In this context, his works have been interpreted by some scholars as being directed to his cousin, the King of Han. Sima Qian’s Shi ji says that Han Fei studied together with future Qin chancellor Li Si under the Confucian philosopher Xunzi. It is said that because of his stutter, Han Fei could not properly present his ideas in court. His advice otherwise being ignored, but observing the slow decline of his Han state, he developed \\"one of the most brilliant (writing) styles in ancient China.\\"Hàn Phi Tử, Vietnamese translation by Phan Ngọc, Nhà xuất bản Văn học, HCMC 2011 Sima Qian's biography of Han Fei is as follows: Han Fei was a prince of Han, in favor of the study of name/form and law/art, which Sima Qian dubiously espoused as taking root in the Huang-Lao philosophy. He was born a stutterer and was not able to dispute well, but he was good at writing papers. Together with his friend, Li Si, he served Xun Qing, and Si himself admitted that he was not as competent as Fei. Seeing Han was on the decline, he often remonstrated with the king of Han by submitting papers, but the king did not agree to employ him. At this, Han Fei was frustrated with the reality that, in governing a state, the king did not endeavour to refine and clarify the juridical system of the state, to control his subjects by taking over power, to enhance state property and defence, or to call and employ the wise by enhancing the state. Rather, the king employed the corrupted and treacherous and put them in higher positions over the wise. He regarded the intellectuals as a disturbance to the law by employing their literature, and thought that knights violate the prohibition of the state by using armed forces. While the state was in peace, the king liked to patronise the honoured; while in need, he employed warriors with armour and helmet. So the cultivated men could not be employed and the men employed could not be cultivated. Severely distressed over the reality that men of high integrity and uprightness were not embraced by the subjects with immorality and corruption, he observed the changes in the gaining and losing of the past. Therefore, he wrote several papers like Gu Fen, Wu Tan, Nei-Wai Chu, Shou Lin, and Shei Nan, which amount to one hundred thousand words. However, while Han Fei himself knew well of the difficulty of persuasion and created the detailed writing, Shei Nan, he eventually killed himself in Qin. He could not escape the trap of words for himself.\\"Tae Hyun KIM 2010 p.15, Other Laozi Parallels in the Hanfeizi His works ultimately ended up in the hands of the thrilled Qin king, Ying Zheng, who commented, \\"If I can make friends with this person [Han Fei], I may die without regrets.\\" and invited Han Fei to the Qin court. Han Fei presented the essay \\"Preserving the Han\\" to ask the king not to attack his homeland, but his ex-friend and rival Li Si—who was jealous of Han Fei—used that essay to have Han Fei imprisoned on account of his likely loyalty to Han. Han Fei responded by writing another essay named \\"In the first time of meeting Qin king\\", hoping to use his writing talent to win the king's heart. Han Fei did win the king's heart, but not before Li Si forced him to commit suicide by drinking poison. The Qin king later felt regret about the unfortunate death of Han Fei. Xunzi formed the hypothesis that human nature is evil and virtueless, therefore suggesting that human infants must be brought to their virtuous form through social-class- oriented Confucian moral education. Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtuelessly and be steered by his own human nature to commit immoral acts. Han Fei's education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy for the management of an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a loose and inefficient tool. Han agreed with his teacher's theory of \\"virtueless by birth\\", but as in previous Legalist philosophy, pragmatically proposed to steer people by their own interest-driven nature. Assessment =Vietnamese authors= in his foreword to the Han Feizi praised Han Fei as a knowledgeable man with sharp, logical and firm arguments, supported by large amount of practical and realistic evidence. Han Fei's strict methods were appropriate in a context of social decadence. Phan Ngọc claimed that Han Fei's writings has three drawbacks, however: first, his idea of Legalism was unsuited to autocracy because a ruling dynasty will sooner or later deteriorate. Second, due to the inherent limitation of autocratic monarchy system, Han Fei did not manage to provide the solutions for all the issues that he pointed out. Third, Han Fei was wrong to think that human is inherently evil and only seeks fame and profit: there are humans who sacrificed their own profit for the greater good, including Han Fei himself.Vietnamese translation, 2011, Nhà Xuất bản Văn Học considered the Han Feizi to be superior to Machiavelli's Prince, and claimed that Han Fei's ideology was highly refined for its era.

Heine became known for results on special functions and in real analysis. In particular, he authored an important treatise on spherical harmonics and Legendre functions (Handbuch der Kugelfunctionen). He also investigated basic hypergeometric series. He introduced the Mehler–Heine formula. Biography Heinrich Eduard Heine was born on 16 March 1821 in Berlin, as the eighth child of banker Karl Heine and his wife Henriette Märtens. Eduard was initially home schooled, then studied at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium and Köllnische Gymnasium in Berlin. In 1838, after graduating from gymnasium, he enrolled at the University of Berlin, but transferred to the University of Göttingen to attend the mathematics lectures of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Moritz Stern. In 1840 Heine returned to Berlin, where he studied mathematics under Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, while also attending classes of Jakob Steiner and Johann Franz Encke. In 1842 he was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Berlin for a thesis on differential equations submitted with Enno Dirksen and Martin Ohm as advisors. Heine dedicated the doctoral thesis to his professor Gustav Dirichlet. Next he went to the University of Königsberg to participate in the mathematical seminar of Carl Gustav Jacobi, while also following mathematical physics classes of Franz Ernst Neumann. In Königsberg Heine got in contact with fellow students Gustav Kirchhoff and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel. In 1844 Heine went for a teaching position at the University of Bonn, passing his habilitation and starting as a privatdozent. He continued his research in mathematics in Bonn and, in 1848, was promoted to extraordinary professor. In 1850 he married Sophie Wolff, the daughter of a Berlin merchant; the couple had five children, four daughters and one son. In 1856 Heine moved as a full professor to the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1864 to 1865, he served as a rector of the university. In 1875, the University of Göttingen offered Heine a mathematics chair but he decided to reject the offer and remain in Halle. In 1877, at the centenary of Gauss' birth, he was awarded the Gauss Medal for his research. Eduard Heine died on 21 October 1881 in Halle.

It was originally preserved and expanded solely through oral traditions, as the ancient Hawaiians never developed a writing system. Written literature in the Hawaiian language and literary works in other languages by authors resident in Hawaii did not appear until the nineteenth century, when the arrival of American missionaries introduced the English language, the Latin alphabet, and Western notions of composition to the kingdom. The earliest compilations of traditional Hawaiian writing were made by John Papa ʻĪʻī, Samuel Kamakau, Kepelino Keauokalani, and David Malo. They were succeeded by King Kalākaua, Martha Beckwith, Abraham Fornander, and William Drake Westervelt, all of whom produced later collections retelling or adapting Hawaii's oral histories. Other noted authors whose works feature Hawaiian settings and themes, or who were temporarily resident in Hawaii, include Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jack London. Detective novelist Earl Derr Biggers is remembered chiefly for his books set in early twentieth century Honolulu, whose protagonist is Chinese-Hawaiian detective Charlie Chan. Hawaiian literature in the latter half of the twentieth century was characterized by both rapid growth and an increasing emphasis on realism, sometimes influenced by the Second Hawaiian Renaissance and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

Plaque to Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun The burial vault beneath the church in East Saltoun Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (1655 – September 1716) was a Scottish writer and politician, remembered as an advocate for the non-incorporation of Scotland, and an opponent of the 1707 Act of Union between Scotland and England. Fletcher became an exile after being accused of promoting insurrection. He was appointed the cavalry commander of the Monmouth Rebellion, but shortly after landing in England he killed another leading figure. He again went into exile, this time as a fugitive and with his estates forfeit. He returned with William of Orange, becoming Commissioner of the old Parliament of Scotland. Fletcher was a defender of the Darién scheme, although suspicious of the effect of conventional commerce on traditional virtues. He also deplored the effect of London's relative size, which he said would inevitably draw an accelerating proportion of wealth and decision making to the south-east corner of Britain. Early life and political career Andrew Fletcher was the son and heir of Sir Robert Fletcher (1625–1664), and was born at Saltoun in East Lothian. Educated by Gilbert Burnet, the future Bishop of Salisbury, who was then minister at Saltoun, he completed his education in mainland Europe. Fletcher was elected, as the Commissioner for Haddingtonshire, to the Scottish Parliament in 1678. At this time, Charles II's representative in Scotland was John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale. The Duke had taxation powers in Scotland, and maintained a standing army there in the name of the King. Fletcher bitterly opposed the Duke, whose actions only strengthened Fletcher's distrust of the royal government in Scotland, as well as all hereditary power. In 1681, Fletcher was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament as member for Haddingtonshire. The year before, Lauderdale had been replaced by the Duke of Albany. At this time, Fletcher was a member of the opposition Country Party in the Scottish Parliament, where he resolutely opposed any arbitrary actions on the part of the Church or state. Exile and return In 1683, after being charged with plotting against the King, Fletcher fled Scotland to join with English opponents of King Charles in the Netherlands where he gained the confidence of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, being given command of the cavalry for the Monmouth Rebellion. Fletcher wanted to strike at the country militia while they were being formed up, and appropriated a fine horse belonging to the leading local sympathizer, Thomas Dare, who was shot dead when he became threatening in the ensuing argument. Monmouth was forced to send Fletcher away. Monmouth's forces failed to pursue a timely offensive strategy, and were defeated. After escaping from a Spanish prison, Fletcher fought in Hungary against the Turks before joining William of Orange, with whom he returned to Scotland in 1688, but his alliance with the Prince of Orange faded when it became clear William II - as he was in Scotland - was only interested in using the country to help fight foreign wars. His estates were restored to him and, increasingly, Fletcher defended his country's claims over English interests as well as opposing royal power. In 1703, at a critical stage in the history of Scotland, Fletcher again became a member of the Scottish Parliament as member for Haddingtonshire. Now Queen Anne was on the throne and there was a campaign to join England and Scotland in a parliamentary union, thus closing the \\"back door\\" to England that Scotland represented.  Darién Scheme and the Act of Union  Fletcher had been an early supporter of the Darien expedition, a financial disaster at the worst possible time for a country which had suffered repeated bad harvests and he continued to defend the Darién scheme against those - including agents of the English - who painted it as an act of folly. Hurt national pride had led to many Scots blaming the scheme's failure on the hostility of England, Fletcher and the Country party seized the opportunity to promote Scottish independence. However, by practically ruining the political elite the Darién scheme had weakened resistance to England's plans for a Union - and offers of money to Scots who would support it. Fletcher continued to argue against an 'incorporating union' and for a federal union to protect Scotland's nationhood. Although not successful in preventing the Act of Union passing in the Scottish parliament through these debates Fletcher gained recognition as an independent patriot. One of his most famous contributions were his \\"twelve limitations,\\" intended to limit the power of the crown and English ministers in Scottish politics. His limitations were: # THAT elections shall be made at every Michaelmas head-court for a new Parliament every year; to sit the first of November next following, and adjourn themselves from time to time, till next Michaelmas; That they choose their own president, and that everything shall be determined by balloting, in place of voting. # THAT so many lesser barons shall be added to the Parliament, as there have been noblemen created since the last augmentation of the number of the barons; and that in all time coming, for every nobleman that shall be created, there shall be a baron added to the Parliament. # THAT no man have vote in Parliament, but a nobleman or elected member. # THAT the King shall give the sanction to all laws offered by the Estates; and that the president of the Parliament be empowered by His Majesty to give the sanction in his absence, and have ten pounds sterling a day salary. # THAT a committee of one and thirty members, of which nine to be a quorum, chosen out of their own number, by every Parliament, shall, during the intervals of Parliament, under the King, have the administration of the government, be his council, and accountable to the next Parliament; with power in extraordinary occasions, to call the Parliament together; and that in the said council, all things be determined by ballotting in place of voting. # THAT the King without consent of Parliament shall not have the power of making peace and war; or that of concluding any treaty with any other state or potentate. # THAT all places and offices, both civil and military, and all pensions formerly conferred by our Kings shall ever after be given by Parliament. # THAT no regiment or company of horse, foot or dragoons, be kept on foot in peace or war, but by consent of Parliament. # THAT all fencible men of the nation, between sixty and sixteen, be with all diligence possible armed with bayonets, and firelocks all of a calibre, and continue always provided in such arms with ammunition suitable. # THAT no general indemnity, nor pardon for any transgression against the public, shall be valid without consent of Parliament. # THAT the fifteen Senators of the College of Justice shall be incapable of being members of Parliament, or of any other office, or any pension; but the salary that belongs to their place to be increased as the Parliament shall think fit; that the office of President shall be in three of their number to be named by Parliament, and that there be no extraordinary lords, and also, that the lords of the Justice court shall be distinct from those of the Session, and under the same restrictions. # THAT if any King break in upon any of these conditions of government, he shall by the Estates be declared to have forfeited the crown. Although the limitations did not pass the house, something little short of them was passed, the Act of Security, which made provisions in case of the Queen's death, with the conditions under which the successor to the crown of England was to be allowed to succeed to that of Scotland, which were to be, \\"at least, freedom of navigation, free communication of trade, and liberty of the plantations to the kingdom and subjects of Scotland, established by the parliament of England.\\" The same parliament passed an Act anent Peace and War, which provided that after Queen's death, failing heirs of her body, no person at the same time being King or Queen of Scotland and England, would have sole power of making war without consent of the Scottish Parliament. Withdrawal from politics In 1707, the Act of Union was approved by the Scottish Parliament, officially uniting Scotland with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Fletcher turned from politics in despair and devoted the rest of his life to farming and agricultural development in Scotland. He died unmarried in London in September 1716. His last words were 'Lord have mercy on my poor country that is so barbarously oppressed.' Reputation in his time He was reputed to have the best private library in Scotland. Contemporaries thought very highly of Fletcher's integrity, but he was also seen as impetuous, some Englishmen regarded him as a violent, ingenious fanatic. Arthur L. Herman in How the Scots Invented the Modern World describes Fletcher as a genuine intellectual, but regards his vision for Scotland as retrograde. Alasdair MacIntyre has written that \\"Almost alone among his contemporaries Fletcher understood the dilemma confronting Scotland as involving more radical alternatives than they were prepared to entertain\\". Thomas Jefferson thought well of him, writing, \\"The political principles of that patriot were worthy of the purest periods of the British constitution. They are those which were in vigour at the epoch of the American emigration. Our ancestors brought them here, and they needed little strengthening to make us what we are.\\" Works His chief works are A Discourse of Government relating to Militias (1698), in which he argued that the royal army in Scotland should be replaced by local militias, a position of civic republican virtue which was to return a half-century later and foreshadowed the thinking of Adam Ferguson in lauding martial virtues over commercially minded polite society, which Fletcher thought enervating. The famous phrase \\"well regulated militia,\\" which found its way into the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, appears in this work, as does the phrase \\"ordinary and ill-regulated militia.\\" Two Discourses concerning the Affairs of Scotland (1698), in which he discussed the problems of Scottish trade and economics; and An Account of a Conversation concerning a right regulation of Governments for the common good of Mankind (1703).See via Google Books In Two Discourses he suggested that the numerous vagrants who infested Scotland should be brought into compulsory and hereditary servitude, it was already the case that criminals or the dissolute were transported to the colonies and sold as virtual slaves at that time. In An Account of a Conversation he made his well-known remark \\"I knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christopher's sentiment, that he believed if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the laws of a nation.\\"John Stuart Mill, discussing poetry as a great instrument for acting on human mind, paraphrased this celebrated saying as: \\"Let who will make the laws of a people if I write their songs\\".

Historically in Staffordshire, Handsworth lies just outside Birmingham City Centre. History William Ellis The name Handsworth originates from its Saxon owner Hondes and the Old English word weorthing, meaning farm or estate. It was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086, as a holding of William Fitz-Ansculf, the Lord of Dudley, although at that time it would only have been a very small village surrounded by farmland and extensive woodland. Historically in the county of Staffordshire, it remained a small village from the 13th century to the 18th century. Accommodation was built for factory workers, the village quickly grew, and in 1851, there were more than 6,000 people living in the township. In that year, work began to build St James' Church. Later St Michael's Church was built as a daughter church to St James'. In the census of 1881, the town was recorded as having approx. 32,000 residents. By the census of 1911, this had more than doubled to 68,610. The development of the built environment was sporadic and many of Handsworth's streets display a mixture of architectural types and periods – among them some of the finest Victorian buildings in the city. Handsworth has two grammar schools – Handsworth Grammar School and King Edward VI Handsworth School (for girls). St Andrew's Church is a listed building in Oxhill Road which also held Sunday school classes in a small building on the corner of Oxhill Road and Church Lane. It also contains Handsworth Park, which in 2006 underwent a major restoration, the vibrant shopping area of Soho Road and St. Mary's Church containing the remains of the founders of the Industrial Revolution - Watt, Murdoch and Boulton. The 1901 Red Lion public house was grade II* listed in 1985, but has been empty since 2008 and is considered \\"at risk\\". Handsworth parish was transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire, and became part of Birmingham, in 1911. The redbrick building with the clocktower in the photograph was originally the offices of the district council on Soho Road. Birmingham historian Dr. Carl Chinn noted that during World War II the boundary between Handsworth and the outlying suburb of Handsworth Wood marked the line between being safe and unsafe from bombing, with Handsworth Wood being an official evacuation zone, despite being at least ten miles away from any countryside that might now qualify as \\"green belt\\" land, and being on the periphery of many \\"high risk\\" areas.Carl Chinn (1996) Brum Undaunted: Birmingham During the Blitz, Birmingham Library Services During World War II, West Indians had arrived as part of the colonial war effort, where they worked in Birmingham munitions factories. In the post-war period, a rebuilding programme required much unskilled labour and Birmingham's industrial base expanded, significantly increasing the demand for both skilled and unskilled workers. During this time, there was direct recruitment for workers from the Caribbean and the area became a centre for Birmingham's Afro-Caribbean community. A tram depot was erected near Birmingham Road, next to the border with West Bromwich, during the 1880s, and remained in use until the tram service ended in 1939. Although it has since been demolished, a replica of the depot was created later in the 20th century at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. The West Indian population in Birmingham numbered over 17,000 by the 1961 census count. In addition, during this time, Indians, particularly Sikhs from the Punjab arrived in Birmingham, many of them working in the foundries and on the production lines in motor vehicle manufacturing, mostly at the Longbridge plant some 10 miles away. A growing city centre is driving improvement and development into the area.

It operated from 1766-1848 and was demolished in 1863. Boulton commissioned Samuel Wyatt to design his nearby house Soho House, which is now a museum. In 1790, Heathfield Hall, also designed by Wyatt, was built for Boulton's business partner, the engineer James Watt. Watt died in the house in 1819, and was buried at nearby St Mary's Church. In the 1880s engineer George Tangye bought the hall and lived there until his death in 1920. From 1927 the hall was demolished and the lands redeveloped. What was the Heathfield Estate is now the land that comprises West Drive and North Drive. Watt's workshop from the house was dismantled and rebuilt in the Science Museum, London. Civil unrest, social issues and community A riot occurred in 1981, during which similar riots took place in Brixton (London), Chapeltown (Leeds), and Toxteth (Liverpool). The 'sus' law (Vagrancy Act 1824) saw black youths being disproportionately stopped, searched and arrested by the police, on the grounds of mere 'suspicion' of possible illegal activity; this, along with high unemployment and social alienation, was a key element of the backdrop to the 1981 riot in Handsworth (similarly in Brixton, Chapletown, (Leeds) and Toxteth). Following the Brixton riots of 1981, the subsequent Scarman report (1981) concluded that the events of 1981 were \\"essentially an outburst of anger and resentment by young black people against the police.\\" This scenario was replicated in Handsworth, Chapletown, (Leeds) and Toxteth. A similar social backdrop of tensions and hostility towards the police existed during the rioting of September 1985, which lasted for two days. It began in Lozells Road, Lozells and spread into Handsworth; to which this unrest was ascribed. After the 1985 riots and a change in perception of British sub-urban integration, community relations were reviewed. Local government worked to improve community relations as a way of managing both racial and cultural differences. Encouragement was provided by arts organisations such as West Midlands Ethnic Minority Arts Service; its director, Pogus Caesar, documented the riots, and Black Audio Film Collective produced the 1986 film Handsworth Songs. There was further unrest in 1991 and 2005; with a fatality occurring during the 2005 riot. The 2011 England riots also spread to the Handsworth area. The Guardian online article 'Riots don't happen without a reason' (August 2011) seeks to explore the context and histories of these inner-city riots, since the 1980s; emphasising the need for improvements in the relationship between the community and the police.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/10/riots-police- black-community In December 1982, on her first official visit to the West Midlands, Princess Diana of Wales visited the ‘Cultural Centre’ in Handsworth.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/nostalgia/handsworth-history- through-years-birmingham-7638262 A year later in 1983, the 3 times World Heavy Weight Champion and Olympic Gold Medallist, Mohammed Ali, also received a rapturous welcome from Handsworth's community.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/world-in-pictures- muhammad-ali-at-70-8477 Recent neighbourhood schemes and developments (2012) have helped to improve the area. Most visitors report that Handsworth is friendly, with an excellent sense of community. Businesses in the area particularly on SOHO road have contributed towards schemes in partnership with council local services. Soho Road, Holyhead Road & Soho Hill is within a Business Improvement District (BID) area.https://en- gb.facebook.com/SohoRoadBID/ A number of initiatives promoting community cohesion, exist within this multicultural community. The Handsworth Community Choir boasts a blend of singers from the area.http://www.handsworthcommunitychoir.org.uk/ The Handsworth Park Community Garden opened in July 2017. The community website ‘Inside Handsworth’, shares community news, events and stories.  Musical legacy  Handsworth has produced some notable popular musical acts: Steel Pulse (whose first studio album Handsworth Revolution is named after the area), Joan Armatrading, Pato Banton, Benjamin Zephaniah, Swami, Apache Indian, Ruby Turner and Bhangra group B21 and Jamaican musicians such as Mighty Diamonds, Alton Ellis, Burning Spear and Dennis Brown have performed in Handsworth, rare photographs of these musicians are held in Pogus Caesar's OOM Gallery Archive. In addition, hard rock band Black Sabbath's lead guitarist and songwriter Tony Iommi, Steve Winwood, UK pop singer Jamelia and progressive rock drummer Carl Palmer were born in Handsworth. The tenor Webster Booth was born in Handsworth in 1902, and began his singing career as a child chorister at the local parish church of St. Mary's. Together with his duettist wife Anne Ziegler, he became a mainstay of West End musicals and World War II musical films. A BBC Showbiz Hall of Fame article described him as \\"possessing one of the finest English tenor voices of the twentieth century.\\" Events Handsworth Park has hosted numerous events: The Birmingham Tattoo, The Birmingham Festival (both originally called Handsworth- rather than Birmingham) and the Flower Show, and in 1967 The Birmingham Dog Show. The Scouts Rally was another annual event held in the park for many years when Scouts from a wide area congregated and paraded. The Handsworth Carnival grew out of the Flower Show and Carnival; Caribbean-style carnivals began in Handsworth Park, in 1984, with a street procession via Holyhead Road. In 1994 the carnival was held in Handsworth Park for the last time. The following year it was moved from the park out onto the streets of Handsworth, since which time it has been known as the Birmingham International Carnival. In 1999, it was again held in a park, but this time in Perry Barr Park. Handsworth Park also hosts an annual Vaisakhi Mela and the Simmer Down Festival, a celebration of live music, dance and spoken word. Education Among education providers is the Rookery School, a 100-year-old mixed state primary school, still housed largely in its original buildings.Rookery School Secondary schools include Handsworth Wood Girls' Academy, Holyhead School, St John Wall Catholic School, also, selective state schools such as Handsworth Grammar School and King Edward VI Handsworth (girls).

They have had five Top 10 albums including a number one in 1997. They have also achieved seventeen Top 40 singles and six Top 10 singles to date. History =Early days (1990–1995)= Ocean Colour Scene were formed after two other bands called The Boys and Fanatics disbanded. Fanatics released an EP titled Suburban Love Songs. OCS signed to Phfftt Records in 1990. Their first single, \\"Sway\\", was released in September 1990 indie era. However, when their record label was swallowed up by larger company Phonogram their eponymous début album was remixed, against the band's wishes, to fit in with the Baggy/indie-dance musical trend of the time. The album was largely deemed a failure. Being in dispute with their label, the band were forced back onto unemployment benefits, with no real direction and being only able to write new music with no outlet for it. In 1993, the start of the turnaround occurred. Paul Weller invited the band to support him on some dates of his tour. On the back of these performances, Weller invited guitarist Steve Cradock to play on one of his singles, and vocalist Simon Fowler to sing on his album, Wild Wood. Cradock was asked to play live with Weller on his tour, and the money Cradock made kept the band afloat during this time. =Britpop fame (1995–2000)= The band recorded a demo that was sent to various industry figures. After hearing this tape, Noel Gallagher invited the band to play with Oasis on their 1995 tour. This support slot brought OCS to the attention of more record labels, and eventually in late 1995, the band signed with MCA Records. With the explosion of the Britpop scene, OCS's music became nationally and internationally known. Their second album Moseley Shoals was released to mixed-to-positive reviews, containing four hit singles and reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. They also played at one of the concerts at Knebworth House supporting Oasis in August 1996. Marchin' Already, the follow- up to Moseley Shoals, went to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, displacing Oasis' Be Here Now at the top of the charts in 1997. In 1998 they headlined their own arena tour in support of Marchin' Already and played three sold out nights at Stirling Castle, Scotland. One from the Modern was released in 1999, and peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 4\\\\. The record spawned three top 40 singles, \\"Profit in Peace\\", \\"So Low\\" and \\"July\\". A Greatest Hits album, Songs for the Front Row, was released in 2001.\\"CD REVIEWS: Creed, The Smashing Pumpkins, Robbie Williams and many more\\". Chart Attack, 20 November 2001 =Post-Britpop (2001–2008)= After splitting with bassist Damon Minchella, the band continued to record and perform. Releases in 2001 (Mechanical Wonder), 2003 (North Atlantic Drift), 2005 (A Hyperactive Workout for the Flying Squad) and 2007 (On the Leyline) continued the trend of releasing new material every two years. 2004 saw the band release their first live album, Live: One for the Road. The album was a compilation of nineteen live tracks taken from various concerts. In 2006 the band released a live acoustic album, Live at the Jam House, which consisted of fifteen live tracks and also contained four new songs in \\"Great Man in Waiting\\", \\"The Word\\", \\"Still Trying\\" and \\"Matilda's England\\". Ocean Colour Scene performing at Guilfest in 2004. The band also released a live album in December 2006, which was recorded at Birmingham Academy and spread over two discs. People attending the gig were able to purchase the recording straight afterwards. =Recent years (2009–present)= In 2009, the band went into the studio with producer Gavin Monaghan, known for his work with Editors, Scott Matthews and The Twang, to work on a new album, Saturday, with a release date of 1 February 2010 to mark the 21st anniversary of the band. The album had a working title of 'Rockfield', named after the studios where it was recorded, but it was released as Saturday - both \\"Rockfield\\" and \\"Saturday\\" being tracks thereon. On 2 November 2009, the band released a free downloadable version of a new song, \\"Mrs Maylie\\". \\"Magic Carpet Days\\", the first single from Saturday, was released on 25 January, followed by the album a few days later. The album charted at No. 35 on the UK Albums Chart. A second single, \\"Saturday\\", was released in May 2010 but it failed to chart. On 24 July 2010 they performed at the Wickerman Festival. On 11 October 2010, the band released a 4-CD box set, 21, to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the band. It included many previously unreleased tracks and a brand new song entitled \\"Twenty One\\". In March 2011, the band released a 15th anniversary special edition of their 1996 hit album Moseley Shoals. It consisted of the full album, b-sides and live tracks. The band played a full UK tour in support of the re-release. December saw the limited edition release of a double CD/DVD release of the band's Moseley Shoals gig at O2 Academy Birmingham, which was filmed on 26 February 2011. They performed an acoustic set at Lanford Live in 2011 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. In December 2012, the band announced the forthcoming release of their tenth studio album, Painting, which was released on 11 February 2013. They also played at V-festival where Inbetweeners actor James Buckley performed \\"The Circle\\" with them in Chelmsford and at The Electric Picnic Festival in Stradbally, Ireland. In 2014 a special edition of Marchin' Already was released on a 2 CD edition and a special deluxe 4 disc box set which included a DVD of their live performance at Stirling Castle in 1998. Early 2015 saw the band celebrate their 25th anniversary with some acoustic concerts around the UK. They released a double CD live album which was recorded at the Manchester concert on the tour. The following year, in 2016, the band announced several special concerts around the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1996 hit album Moseley Shoals. They also played several dates in Australia for the first time in their career. On 22 June 2016, the band officially announced that Scottish musician Raymond Meade would be joining the band permanently on bass, following the departures of both Dan Sealey and Andy Bennett. Meade had already played live with the band since the start of the year. In November 2018 the band unveiled their first new material in five years since the release of Painting. The four track EP was released on white vinyl and available only at the band's Christmas shows. The EP received a 5 stars rating from Flick of the Finger, with the publication stating that 'Lushly textured, these four compelling and diverse new offerings are nothing short of brilliant.'  Collaborative work  Most band members have supported and collaborated with other artists during the group's existence. Simon Fowler, along with members of Echo & the Bunnymen, Space and The Spice Girls, was part of the supergroup England United who recorded the official song for the England national football team's World Cup campaign in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. \\"((How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World\\" reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart. Steve Cradock plays regularly with Paul Weller, as well as with Amy MacDonald. During their peak (around the time of the Moseley Shoals release) OCS also regularly performed on stage with Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis, with whom they were on tour at the time. One particular performance of note with the Gallaghers was a rendition of The Beatles' \\"Day Tripper\\", which was included as a live B-side to \\"The Circle\\". The song was also included on the B-side compilation album, B-sides, Seasides and Freerides. Noel Gallagher previewed an advance copy of the song during an interview on BBC Radio 1 with DJ Jo Whiley. The interview mainly focused on Oasis's then forthcoming gig in the grounds of Knebworth House, where Ocean Colour Scene were one of the supporting acts. Over 2.6 million people applied for tickets for the shows, making it the most in-demand concert in UK history.Knebworthhouse.com There was a combined audience of over 250,000 people. At a 2011 gig at the University of East Anglia, Ocean Colour Scene were joined on stage by former footballer Dion Dublin, an amateur percussionist, who accompanied them on The Dube, an instrument he invented.

Damage to peripheral nerves may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function depending on which nerves are affected; in other words, neuropathy affecting motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves result in different symptoms. More than one type of nerve may be affected simultaneously. Peripheral neuropathy may be acute (with sudden onset, rapid progress) or chronic (symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly), and may be reversible or permanent. Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy), hyperglycemia-induced glycation, vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy, or commonly prescribed antibiotics including metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Levaquin, Avelox etc.)), traumatic injury, including ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause). In conventional medical usage, the word neuropathy (neuro-, \\"nervous system\\" and -pathy, \\"disease of\\")\\"neuropathy\\". Online Etymology Dictionary. without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called \\"mononeuropathy\\" and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called \\"symmetrical polyneuropathy\\" or simply \\"polyneuropathy\\". When two or more (typically just a few, but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called \\"mononeuritis multiplex\\", \\"multifocal mononeuropathy\\", or \\"multiple mononeuropathy\\". Neuropathy may cause painful cramps, fasciculations (fine muscle twitching), muscle loss, bone degeneration, and changes in the skin, hair, and nails. Additionally, motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or, most commonly, muscle weakness; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration, reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance, reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain, spontaneous tingling or burning pain, or skin allodynia (severe pain from normally nonpainful stimuli, such as light touch); and autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms, depending on the affected glands and organs, but common symptoms are poor bladder control, abnormal blood pressure or heart rate, and reduced ability to sweat normally. Classification Peripheral neuropathy may be classified according to the number and distribution of nerves affected (mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, or polyneuropathy), the type of nerve fiber predominantly affected (motor, sensory, autonomic), or the process affecting the nerves; e.g., inflammation (neuritis), compression (compression neuropathy), chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy). The affected nerves are found in an EMG / NCS test and the classification is applied upon completion of the exam. =Mononeuropathy= Mononeuropathy is a type of neuropathy that only affects a single nerve. Diagnostically, it is important to distinguish it from polyneuropathy because when a single nerve is affected, it is more likely to be due to localized trauma or infection. The most common cause of mononeuropathy is physical compression of the nerve, known as compression neuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome and axillary nerve palsy are examples. Direct injury to a nerve, interruption of its blood supply resulting in (ischemia), or inflammation also may cause mononeuropathy. =Polyneuropathy= \\"Polyneuropathy\\" is a pattern of nerve damage that is quite different from mononeuropathy, often more serious and affecting more areas of the body. The term \\"peripheral neuropathy\\" sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells in various parts of the body are affected, without regard to the nerve through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In distal axonopathy, one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the axons are affected in proportion to their length; the longest axons are the most affected. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this pattern. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, the myelin sheath around axons is damaged, which affects the ability of the axons to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern affects the cell bodies of neurons directly. This usually picks out either the motor neurons (known as motor neuron disease) or the sensory neurons (known as sensory neuronopathy or dorsal root ganglionopathy). The effect of this is to cause symptoms in more than one part of the body, often symmetrically on left and right sides. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking. In many polyneuropathies, these symptoms occur first and most severely in the feet. Autonomic symptoms also may occur, such as dizziness on standing up, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty controlling urination. Polyneuropathies usually are caused by processes that affect the body as a whole. Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common causes. Hyperglycemia-induced formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is related to diabetic neuropathy. Other causes relate to the particular type of polyneuropathy, and there are many different causes of each type, including inflammatory diseases such as Lyme disease, vitamin deficiencies, blood disorders, and toxins (including alcohol and certain prescribed drugs). Most types of polyneuropathy progress fairly slowly, over months or years, but rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also occurs. It is important to recognize that at one time it was thought that many of the cases of small fiber peripheral neuropathy with typical symptoms of tingling, pain, and loss of sensation in the feet and hands were due to glucose intolerance before a diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes. However, in August 2015, the Mayo Clinic published a scientific study in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences showing \\"no significant increase in...symptoms...in the prediabetes group\\", and stated that \\"A search for alternate neuropathy causes is needed in patients with prediabetes.\\" The treatment of polyneuropathies is aimed firstly at eliminating or controlling the cause, secondly at maintaining muscle strength and physical function, and thirdly at controlling symptoms such as neuropathic pain. =Mononeuritis multiplex= Mononeuritis multiplex, occasionally termed polyneuritis multiplex, is simultaneous or sequential involvement of individual noncontiguous nerve trunks, either partially or completely, evolving over days to years and typically presenting with acute or subacute loss of sensory and motor function of individual nerves. The pattern of involvement is asymmetric, however, as the disease progresses, deficit(s) becomes more confluent and symmetrical, making it difficult to differentiate from polyneuropathy. Therefore, attention to the pattern of early symptoms is important. Mononeuritis multiplex also may cause pain, which is characterized as deep, aching pain that is worse at night and frequently in the lower back, hip, or leg. In people with diabetes mellitus, mononeuritis multiplex typically is encountered as acute, unilateral, and severe thigh pain followed by anterior muscle weakness and loss of knee reflex. Electrodiagnostic medicine studies will show multifocal sensory motor axonal neuropathy. It is caused by, or associated with, several medical conditions: =Autonomic neuropathy= Autonomic neuropathy is a form of polyneuropathy that affects the non-voluntary, non-sensory nervous system (i.e., the autonomic nervous system), affecting mostly the internal organs such as the bladder muscles, the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, and the genital organs. These nerves are not under a person's conscious control and function automatically. Autonomic nerve fibers form large collections in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis outside the spinal cord. They have connections with the spinal cord and ultimately the brain, however. Most commonly autonomic neuropathy is seen in persons with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2. In most—but not all—cases, autonomic neuropathy occurs alongside other forms of neuropathy, such as sensory neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy is one cause of malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, but not the only one; some conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord also may cause autonomic dysfunction, such as multiple system atrophy, and therefore, may cause similar symptoms to autonomic neuropathy. The signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include the following: * Urinary bladder conditions: bladder incontinence or urine retention * Gastrointestinal tract: dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, diarrhoea, constipation * Cardiovascular system: disturbances of heart rate (tachycardia, bradycardia), orthostatic hypotension, inadequate increase of heart rate on exertion * Respiratory system: impairments in the signals associated with regulation of breathing and gas exchange (central sleep apnea, hypopnea, bradypnea). * Other areas: hypoglycemia unawareness, genital impotence, sweat disturbances =Neuritis= Neuritis is a general term for inflammation of a nerve or the general inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. Symptoms depend on the nerves involved, but may include pain, paresthesia (pins-and-needles), paresis (weakness), hypoesthesia (numbness), anesthesia, paralysis, wasting, and disappearance of the reflexes. Causes of neuritis include:  Signs and symptoms  Those with diseases or dysfunctions of their nerves may present with problems in any of the normal nerve functions. Symptoms vary depending on the types of nerve fiber involved. In terms of sensory function, symptoms commonly include loss of function (\\"negative\\") symptoms, including numbness, tremor, impairment of balance, and gait abnormality. Gain of function (positive) symptoms include tingling, pain, itching, crawling, and pins-and-needles. Motor symptoms include loss of function (\\"negative\\") symptoms of weakness, tiredness, muscle atrophy, and gait abnormalities; and gain of function (\\"positive\\") symptoms of cramps, and muscle twitch (fasciculations). In the most common form, length-dependent peripheral neuropathy, pain and parasthesia appears symmetrically and generally at the terminals of the longest nerves, which are in the lower legs and feet. Sensory symptoms generally develop before motor symptoms such as weakness. Length-dependent peripheral neuropathy symptoms make a slow ascent of the lower limbs, while symptoms may never appear in the upper limbs; if they do, it will be around the time that leg symptoms reach the knee. When the nerves of the autonomic nervous system are affected, symptoms may include constipation, dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and dizziness when standing. A user-friendly, disease-specific, quality-of-life scale can be used to monitor how someone is doing living with the burden of chronic, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. This scale, called the Chronic, Acquired Polyneuropathy - Patient-reported Index (CAP-PRI), contains only 15 items and is completed by the person affected by polyneuropathy. The total score and individual item scores can be followed over time, with item scoring used by the patient and care-provider to estimate clinical status of some of the more common life domains and symptoms impacted by polyneuropathy. CAP-PRI (Patient instructions: For each item , choose “Not at all” (0 points), “A little bit” (1 point), or “A lot” (2 points). Consider the past week when answering. Complete scale periodically to follow clinical status, for example, a few weeks after starting a new medication or with some change in clinical status.) 1\\\\.

Causes The causes are grouped broadly as follows: Diagnosis Peripheral neuropathy may first be considered when an individual reports symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain in feet. After ruling out a lesion in the central nervous system as a cause, diagnosis may be made on the basis of symptoms, laboratory and additional testing, clinical history, and a detailed examination. During physical examination, specifically a neurological examination, those with generalized peripheral neuropathies most commonly have distal sensory or motor and sensory loss, although those with a pathology (problem) of the nerves may be perfectly normal; may show proximal weakness, as in some inflammatory neuropathies, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome; or may show focal sensory disturbance or weakness, such as in mononeuropathies. Classically, ankle jerk reflex is absent in peripheral neuropathy. A physical examination will involve testing the deep ankle reflex as well as examining the feet for any ulceration. For large fiber neuropathy, an exam will usually show an abnormally decreased sensation to vibration, which is tested with a 128-Hz tuning fork, and decreased sensation of light touch when touched by a nylon monofilament. Diagnostic tests include electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCSs), which assess large myelinated nerve fibers. Testing for small-fiber peripheral neuropathies often relates to the autonomic nervous system function of small thinly- and unmyelinated fibers. These tests include a sweat test and a tilt table test. Diagnosis of small fiber involvement in peripheral neuropathy may also involve a skin biopsy in which a 3 mm-thick section of skin is removed from the calf by a punch biopsy, and is used to measure the skin intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), the density of nerves in the outer layer of the skin. Reduced density of the small nerves in the epidermis supports a diagnosis of small-fiber peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory tests include blood tests for vitamin B-12 levels, a complete blood count, measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone levels, a comprehensive metabolic panel screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes, and a serum immunofixation test, which tests for antibodies in the blood. Treatment The treatment of peripheral neuropathy varies based on the cause of the condition, and treating the underlying condition can aid in the management of neuropathy. When peripheral neuropathy results from diabetes mellitus or prediabetes, blood sugar management is key to treatment. In prediabetes in particular, strict blood sugar control can significantly alter the course of neuropathy. In peripheral neuropathy that stems from immune-mediated diseases, the underlying condition is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids. When peripheral neuropathy results from vitamin deficiencies or other disorders, those are treated as well. A 2009 Cochrane review states that there is no evidence from randomised trials on any form of treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy =Medications= A range of medications that act on the central nervous system have been used to symptomatically treat neuropathic pain. Commonly used medications include tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline. imapramine, and desipramine,) serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications (duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran) and antiepileptic medications (gabapentin, pregabalin, oxcarbazepine zonisamide levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, clonazepam, phenytoin, lacosamide, sodium valproate and carbamazepine). Opioid and opiate medications (such as buprenorphine, morphine, methadone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, tramadol and oxycodone) are also often used to treat neuropathic pain. As is revealed in many of the Cochrane systematic reviews listed below, studies of these medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain are often methodologically flawed and the evidence is potentially subject to major bias. In general, the evidence does not support the usage of antiepileptic and antidepressant medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Better designed clinical trials and further review from non-biased third parties are necessary to gauge just how useful for patients these medications truly are. Reviews of these systematic reviews are also necessary to assess for their failings. It is also often the case that the aforementioned medications are prescribed for neuropathic pain conditions for which they had not been explicitly tested on or for which controlled research is severely lacking; or even for which evidence suggests that these medications are not effective. The NHS for example explicitly state that amitriptyline and gabapentin can be used for treating the pain of sciatica. This is despite both the lack of high quality evidence that demonstrates efficacy of these medications for that symptom, and also the prominence of generally moderate to high quality evidence that reveals that antiepileptics in specific, including gabapentin, demonstrate no efficacy in treating it.  Antidepressants  In general, according to Cochrane's systematic reviews, antidepressants have shown to either be ineffective for the treatment of neuropathic pain or the evidence available is inconclusive. Evidence also tends to be tainted by bias or issues with the methodology. Cochrane systematically reviewed the evidence for the antidepressants nortriptyline, desipramine, venlafaxine and milnacipran and in all these cases found scant evidence to support their use for the treatment of neuropathic pain. All reviews were done between 2014 and 2015. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review of amitriptyline found that there was no evidence supporting the use of amitriptyline that did not possess inherent bias. The authors believe amitriptyline may have an effect in some patients but that the effect is overestimated. A 2014 Cochrane systematic review of imipramine notes that the evidence suggesting benefit were \\"methodologically flawed and potentially subject to major bias.\\" A 2017 Cochrane systematic review assessed the benefit of antidepressant medications for several types of chronic non-cancer pains (including neuropathic pain) in children and adolescents and the authors found the evidence inconclusive.  Antiepileptics  A 2017 Cochrane systematic review found that daily dosages between (1800 - 3600) mg of gabapentin could provide good pain relief for pain associated with diabetic neuropathy only. This relief occurred for roughly (30 - 40)% of treated patients, while placebo had a (10 - 20)% response. Three of the seven authors of the review had conflicts of interest declared. In a 2019 Cochrane review of pregabalin the authors conclude that there is some evidence of efficacy in the treatment of pain deriving from post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and post-traumatic neuropathic pain only. They also warned that many patients treated will have no benefit. Two of the five authors declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies. A 2017 Cochrane systematic review found that oxcarbazepine had little evidence to support its use for treating diabetic neuropathy, radicular pain and other neuropathies. The authors also call for better studies. In a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors found a lack of evidence showing any effectiveness of zonisamide for the treatment of pain deriving from any peripheral neuropathy. A 2014 Cochrane review found that studies of levetiracetam showed no indication for its effectiveness at treating pain from any neuropathy. The authors also found that the evidence was possibly biased and that some patients experienced adverse events. A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was high quality evidence to suggest that lamotrigine is not effective for treating neuropathic pain, even at high dosages (200 - 400) mg. A 2013 Cochrane systematic review of topimirate found that the included data had a strong likelihood of major bias; despite this, it found no effectiveness for the drug in treating the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. It had not been tested for any other type of neuropathy. Cochrane reviews from 2012 of clonazepam and phenytoin uncovered no evidence of sufficient quality to support their use in chronic neuropathic pain.\\" A 2012 Cochrane systematic review of lacosamide found it very likely that the drug is ineffective for treating neuropathic pain. The authors caution against positive interpretations of the evidence. For sodium valproate the authors of a 2011 Cochrane review found that \\"three studies no more than hint that sodium valproate may reduce pain in diabetic neuropathy\\". They discuss how there is a probable overestimate of effect due to the inherent problems with the data and conclude that the evidence does not support its usage. In a 2014 systematic review of carbamazepine the authors believe the drug to be of benefit for some people. No trials were considered greater than level III evidence; none were longer than 4 weeks in length or were deemed as having good reporting quality. A 2017 Cochrane systematic review aiming to assess the benefit of antiepileptic medications for several types of chronic non-cancer pains (including neuropathic pain) in children and adolescents found the evidence inconclusive. Two of the ten authors of this study declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies.  Opioids  A Cochrane review of buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone and morphine, all dated between 2015 and 2017, and all for the treatment of neuropathic pain, found that there was insufficient evidence to comment on their efficacy. Conflicts of interest were declared by the authors in this review. A 2017 Cochrane review of methadone found very low quality evidence, three studies of limited quality, of its efficacy and safety. They could not formulate any conclusions about its relative efficacy and safety compared to a placebo. For tramadol, Cochrane found that there was only modest information about the benefits of its usage for neuropathic pain. Studies were small, had potential risks of bias and apparent benefits increased with risk of bias. Overall the evidence was of low or very low quality and the authors state that it \\"does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect\\". For oxycodone the authors found very low quality evidence showing its usefulness in treating diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia only. One of the four authors declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies. More generally, a 2013 review examining the overall efficacy of opioid therapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain found studies were often subject to bias and that their efficacy and safety was not deducible with the evidence available. A 2017 Cochrane review examining opioid therapy as a treatment for many non-cancer pain syndromes (including neuropathic pain) concluded, \\"There was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.\\"  Others  A 2016 Cochrane review of paracetamol for the treatment of neuropathic pain concluded that its benefit alone or in combination with codeine or dihydrocodeine is unknown. Few studies have examined whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in treating peripheral neuropathy. There is some evidence that symptomatic relief from the pain of peripheral neuropathy may be obtained by application of topical capsaicin. Capsaicin is the factor that causes heat in chili peppers. However, the evidence suggesting that capsaicin applied to the skin reduces pain for peripheral neuropathy is of moderate to low quality and should be interpreted carefully before using this treatment option. Evidence supports the use of cannabinoids for some forms of neuropathic pain. A 2018 Cochrane review of cannabis-based medicines for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain included 16 studies. All of these studies included THC as a pharmacological component of the test group. The authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate. The primary outcome was quoted as, \\"Cannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo\\" but \\"the evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis to be of very low quality\\". The authors also conclude, \\"The potential benefits of cannabis-based medicine... might be outweighed by their potential harms.\\" A 2014 Cochrane review of topical lidocaine for the treatment of various peripheral neuropathies found its usage supported by a few low quality studies. The authors state that there are no high quality randomised control trials demonstrating its efficacy or safety profile. A 2015 Cochrane review of topical clonidine for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy included two studies of 8 and 12 weeks in length; both of which compared topical clonidine to placebo and both of which were funded by the same drug manufacturer. The review found that topical clonidine may provide some benefit versus placebo. However, the authors state that the included trials are potentially subject to significant bias and that the evidence is of low to moderate quality. A 2007 Cochrane review of aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment of the pain deriving from diabetic polyneuropathy found it no better than placebo. =Medical devices= Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy is often used to treat various types of neuropathy. A 2010 review of three trials, for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy explicitly, involving a total of 78 patients found some improvement in pain scores after 4 and 6, but not 12 weeks of treatment and an overall improvement in neuropathic symptoms at 12 weeks. Another 2010 review of four trials, for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, found significant improvement in pain and overall symptoms, with 38% of patients in one trial becoming asymptomatic. The treatment remains effective even after prolonged use, but symptoms return to baseline within a month of cessation of treatment. These older reviews can be balanced with a more recent 2017 review of TENS for neuropathic pain by Cochrane which concluded that, \\"This review is unable to state the effect of TENS versus sham TENS for pain relief due to the very low quality of the included evidence... The very low quality of evidence means we have very limited confidence in the effect estimate reported.\\" A very low quality of evidence means, 'multiple sources of potential bias' with a 'small number and size of studies'. =Diet= According to a single review (2019), strict gluten-free diet is an effective treatment when neuropathy is caused by gluten sensitivity, with or without the presence of digestive symptoms or intestinal injury. = Counselling = A 2015 review on the treatment of neuropathic pain with psychological therapy concluded that, \\"There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.\\" = Alternative medicine = A 2019 Cochrane review of the treatment of herbal medicinal products for people suffering neuropathic pain for at least three months concluded that, \\"There was insufficient evidence to determine whether nutmeg or St John's wort has any meaningful efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions.The quality of the current evidence raises serious uncertainties about the estimates of effect observed, therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.\\" A 2017 Cochrane review on the usage of acupuncture as a treatment for neuropathic pain concludes, \\"Due to the limited data available, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for neuropathic pain in general, or for any specific neuropathic pain condition when compared with sham acupuncture or other active therapies.\\" Also, \\"Most studies included a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm) and all studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel.\\" Also, the authors state, \\"we did not identify any study comparing acupuncture with treatment as usual.\\" A 2018 Cochrane review on acupuncture and related interventions for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome concluded that, \\"Acupuncture and laser acupuncture may have little or no effect in the short term on symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in comparison with placebo or sham acupuncture.\\" It was also noted that all studies had an unclear or high overall risk of bias and that all evidence was of low or very low quality. Alpha lipioc acid (ALA) with benfothiamine is a proposed pathogenic treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy only.http://www.currentdiabetesreviews.com/articles/170231/review-of-diabetic- polyneuropathy-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-management-according-to-the- consensus-of-egyptian-experts The results of two systematic reviews state that oral ALA produced no clinically significant benefit, intravenous ALA administered over the course of three weeks may improve symptoms and that long term treatment has not been investigated. Research A 2008 literature review concluded that, \\"based on principles of evidence-based medicine and evaluations of methodology, there is only a 'possible' association [of celiac disease and peripheral neuropathy], due to lower levels of evidence and conflicting evidence. There is not yet convincing evidence of causality.\\" A 2019 review concluded that \\"gluten neuropathy is a slowly progressive condition. About 25% of the patients will have evidence of enteropathy on biopsy (CD [celiac disease]) but the presence or absence of an enteropathy does not influence the positive effect of a strict gluten-free diet.\\" Stem- cell therapy is also being looked at as a possible means to repair peripheral nerve damage, however efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.

Other names include pit block, pit stop, and blocking.Law Enforcement Pursuits in Georgia: Review and Recommendations It was developed and named by the Fairfax County Police Department of Virginia, United States. Other interpretations of the acronym \\"PIT\\" include pursuit immobilization technique, precision immobilization technique,Raviv, Shaun, and John Sullivan, \\"Police driving maneuver used to end chases has killed 30 people since 2016, The Post finds\\", Washington Post, August 24, 2020. Retrieved 2020-08-24. push it tough, parallel immobilization technique, and precision intervention tactic. The technique is also known as tactical car intervention, tactical ramming, legal intervention, and fishtailing. The technique is used by law enforcement officers to bring car chases to a conclusion. Other methods of stopping a fugitive vehicle include the use of spike strips, or the use of tactical pursuit and containment (see below). History Crown Victoria Police Interceptor The PIT maneuver was adapted from the bump and run technique used in stock car racing, where a driver would bump a competitor in the rear bumper to cause the other car to lose traction and swerve away from the racing line. The PIT maneuver differs from the bump and run in that the car is bumped from the side near the rear wheel, causing the vehicle in front to spin out. It is illegal to perform this maneuver intentionally in stock car racing because it is very dangerous (although Rusty Wallace used this technique to spin out Darrell Waltrip and win the 1989 All-Star race). The high speed involved in auto racing makes it much easier for drivers to take out another car with a less substantial bump than at lower speeds. When employing the PIT maneuver, the speed of the two cars involved will determine how far the car will travel once it is bumped. Partially for this reason, the higher the speed, the more unpredictable and dangerous the PIT maneuver becomes. This is just one of the very important factors a police officer must consider before implementing the PIT maneuver. A police officer is trained to wait until conditions are right before attempting a PIT maneuver to avoid the use of deadly force. Speeds must be lower and the \\"landing site\\" for the bumped vehicle must be clear of danger. The first US law enforcement agency to teach PIT as a technique to halt fleeing vehicles was the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia, Eric J. S. Townsend, \\"Police End Car Chases with a Spin\\", News and Record, 2004 which modified the parameters for initiating and executing the technique for police use. Terry Pearson and Joseph McDowell were the first law enforcement officers to incorporate the technique into training. Terry Pearson named it the \\"Precision Immobilization Technique\\" or P.I.T. A publication of the United States National Institute of Justice wrote in 1996: > Known initially as \\"tactical ramming\\" or \\"legal intervention\\", this maneuver > was more fully developed and popularized more than a decade ago by BSR Inc., > the Summit Point, West Virginia, advanced driver training center, as > tactical vehicle interception (TVI), a formal training technique for law > enforcement. The first large law enforcement agency to teach TVI as a > technique to halt fleeing vehicles was the Fairfax County (Virginia) Police > Department, which modified the program for police use and named it > \\"Precision Immobilization Technique\\" or P.I.T. Police departments throughout the United States including the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in California have come to believe that, when executed properly, PIT is an intermediate force option that can safely end a pursuit. Police vehicles often have reinforced front bumpers to support this technique.  Procedure  The PIT begins when the pursuing vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle so that the portion of the pursuer's vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with the portion of the target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target's side, then steers sharply into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate or its bumper will slide off of the target vehicle. As soon as the fleeing vehicle's rear tires lose traction and start to skid, the pursuer continues to turn in the same direction until clear of the target. This is more of a committed lane change than an actual turn. The target will turn in the opposite direction, in front of the pursuer, and will spin out. The PIT may be done from either side, but consideration must be given to where both cars will end up. Typically, another police car will tail the PIT unit to proceed with the arrest, while the PIT unit recovers its own control and completely stops the car. The PIT does not immobilize the suspect vehicle and to prevent further flight, two police cars need to pin the suspect between them, front and rear. Avoidance maneuvers While steering into the skid (away from the pursuing vehicle) will reduce its effect, the fact that the pursuing car is continuing to push the rear of the target sideways virtually ensures loss of control of the targeted vehicle. By moving forward out of position, or by staying squarely in front of the PIT unit, the lead vehicle can disallow the PIT unit from gaining proper positioning to conduct the maneuver. Alternatively, rapid deceleration will, of course, force the PIT unit to overshoot the required positioning. Advanced defensive driving courses taught to VIP protection units would train drivers in other advanced vehicle control techniques, such as using J-turns as a way of controlling the spin-out resulting from a successful PIT maneuver.  Limitations  The PIT is not applicable in every situation, and many factors affect the usefulness of the technique. Many of these factors relate to safety concerns: typical police regulation recommends that an officer not attempt the PIT at speeds greater than 35 miles per hour (55 kilometers per hour), and requires careful choice of location, considering all possible effects on other traffic vehicles and pedestrians. Because of the police department's potential liability for the injury or death of not only of the occupants of the target vehicle, but also bystanders, most departments limit its use to only the most high-risk scenarios. Most departments specify that the PIT should only be used to stop pursuits that are immediately dangerous and ongoing. When possible, a minimum of three pursuers should be present when a PIT is executed: one as the PIT vehicle and two following at a greater distance to react to the results. The PIT is especially hazardous when the vehicles' bumpers are of significantly different heights, or against target vehicles with a high center of gravity such as vans or SUVs. High center of gravity vehicles frequently roll over. It cannot be safely used on motorcycles at any speed. At speeds below 35 MPH, it can be used on a fleeing vehicle, if the legal parameters would justify \\"less than lethal force\\" against the driver. At speeds greater than 35 MPH, the technique still works, but it is considered potentially lethal and normally would only be used if lethal force is justified against all occupants. It is best used when the driver is on surface streets and cornering. A high speed motorist may kill innocent people and it can sometimes be justified for that traffic offense. Since there may be unwilling or innocent passengers in the car, there is an inherent difficulty in justifying the use of PITs. Some suggest that due to the utilization of electronic control systems on modern vehicles, the policies of using PIT maneuvers might need some more consideration.Zhou et al.Jing Zhou, Jianbo Lu, and Huei Peng, \\"Vehicle Dynamics In Response to The Maneuver of Precision Immobilization Technique,\\" Proceedings of ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, 2008 provides a study for vehicles equipped with Electronic Stability Controls (ESC) in response to PIT maneuvers. The PIT maneuver is generally not permitted during police pursuits in the United Kingdom.  TPAC  Tactical Pursuit And Containment (TPAC) is a term used by police in the United Kingdom, and describes training for managing and terminating police pursuits. TPAC embodies several methods of stopping fleeing vehicles, including rolling roadblocks, use of spike strips, and the \\"box and stop\\" containment method. TPAC is most effective on separated carriageways (such as motorways) where the path of the suspect is limited. It is not suited to roads with frequent cross-roads, those with two-way traffic on a single carriageway, or highways where the suspect may escape by means of a U-turn across the median strip. Once a fleeing driver is contained on a motorway, a rolling block is initiated ahead of the pursuit. When the pursuit reaches the slowed traffic, the suspect can either attempt to pass the traffic or stay behind it. If the suspect chooses to stay behind the traffic, communication between the pursuing vehicles and the blocking vehicle(s) will lead to the block coming to a standstill, and the vehicle is surrounded and occupants detained. If the fleeing driver chooses to pass the traffic, usually on the hard shoulder, the pursuing vehicles follow it. Once past the traffic, the police vehicles can box in the suspect's vehicle and bring it to a controlled stop through coordinated braking, utilizing the sterile area in front of the blocking vehicle(s) to do so without endangering other road users. In the UK, TPAC is specialist training given to advanced police drivers. As with the PIT technique, consideration has to be given to the size, weight and center of gravity of the fleeing vehicle. The most commonly used UK police vehicle for TPAC (as of 2007) seems to be the Volvo V70 Estate, which has found widespread acceptance throughout UK police forces as a traffic policing vehicle. British police are comfortable with the TPAC, as fleeing drivers are usually considered to be unarmed, and driving beside or in front of them is not a hazard. Police in the US assume the driver is armed and prefer the PIT maneuver, as it is done from behind the suspect vehicle.

Originally played by indigenous peoples of the Americas, the modern women's game was introduced in 1890 at the St Leonard's School in St Andrews, Scotland. The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long-handled stick (known as a crosse or lacrosse stick) to catch, cradle, and pass a solid rubber lacrosse ball in an effort to score by hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. Cradling is when a player moves their wrists and arms in a semi-circular motion to keep the ball in the pocket of the stick's head using centripetal force. The head of the lacrosse stick has a mesh or leather net strung into it that allows the player to hold the ball. Defensively, the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body positioning. The rules of women's lacrosse are different from the men's lacrosse game. Equipment required to play is also different from the men's. In the United States, women are only required to wear eyewear or lacrosse goggles and a mouth guard. Internationally, women are only required to wear a mouthguard, and have the option to play without protective goggles. The stick has restrictions too, as it must be a certain length and the pocket must be shallow enough to show the ball above the side when held at eye level. At the collegiate level in the United States, lacrosse is represented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which conducts three NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championships, one for each of its competitive divisions, each spring. Internationally, women's lacrosse has a thirty-one-member governing body called the Federation of International Lacrosse, which sponsors the Women's Lacrosse World Cup once every four years. History Lacrosse is a traditional Native American game, which was first witnessed by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s.Vennum, p. 9Liss, p. 13. The games were sometimes major events that could last several days. As many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes would participate.Vennum, p. 183 Native American lacrosse describes a broad variety of stick-and-ball games played by them. Geography and tribal customs dictated the extent to which women participated in these early games: > \\"Lacrosse, as women play it, is an orderly pastime that has little in common > with the men's tribal warfare version except the long-handled racket or > crosse (stick) that gives the sport its name. It's true that the object in > both the men's and women's lacrosse is to send a ball through a goal by > means of the racket, but whereas men resort to brute strength the women > depend solely on skill.\\" Rosabelle SinclairFisher, p. 200 The first modern women's lacrosse game was played in 1890 at the St Leonards School in Scotland, where women's lacrosse had been introduced by Louisa Lumsden. Lumsden brought the game to Scotland after watching a men's lacrosse game between the Canghuwaya (probably Caughnawaga) Indians and the Montreal Lacrosse Club. A British school teacher, Cara Gascoigne, at Sweet Briar College, started club lacrosse at that college in 1914.http://www.vixenathletics.com/information/Hall_of_Fame/bios/c_gasciogne?view=bio One of Lumsden's students, Rosabelle Sinclair, established the first women's lacrosse team in the United States at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland in 1926. The first women's intercollegiate game was held between Sweet Briar College and The College of William and Mary in 1941.http://www.vixenathletics.com/information/athletics/history Until the mid-1930s, women's and men's field lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment. In the United States, the formation of the U.S. Women's Lacrosse Association led to a change in these rules. Rules A women's lacrosse player goes for a catch Women's lacrosse is played with a team of 12 players, including the goalkeeper during usual play. The ball used is typically yellow, unless both teams agree to use a different coloured ball. The duration of the game is 60 minutes, with two halves. Halftime is ten minutes (colleges use fifteen) unless both the coaches agree on less than ten minutes prior to the start of the game. Each team is allowed two 90-second team time-outs per game (two 2-minute timeouts in the USA). In the US, a time-out may be requested by the head coach or any player on the field after a goal is scored or any time the requestor's team is in clear possession of the ball. If a possession timeout is called, players must leave their sticks in place on the field and return to that same place for the restart of play. No substitutions are allowed during this stoppage of play. Before a game can begin, every stick that each player is planning on using the game must be approved by the referee based on a set of standards created by the U.S. Lacrosse and N.C.A.A. These standards are constantly changing as new sticks are being created by different lacrosse companies. Often a standard lacrosse ball is placed into the head of the stick and viewed by the referee at his/her eye level. If the ball cannot be seen over the top of either side of the head, then the pocket is most likely too deep for play. A pocket that is deeper than regulation causes an unfair advantage to that individual with the stick. If the stick pocket is too deep, this can often be fixed by tightening the stringing. If a stick is strung incorrectly by the manufacturer, the stick cannot be used in the game. An example of stick stringing regulation is that the shooting string attachment must be 3.5 inches from the top of the head.https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/USL- Stick-Memo2018final.pdf The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse. The details that follow are the USA college rules. International women's lacrosse rules are slightly different.2007 IFWLA Women's Lacrosse Rules , International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations The women's lacrosse game saw numerous rule changes in 2000. Modifications included limiting the number of players allowed between the two restraining lines on the draw to five players per team. Stick modifications have led to offset heads, which allow the women's game to move faster and makes stick moves and tricks easier. In 2002, goggles became mandatory equipment in the United States (but not a requirement in international rules). In 2006, hard boundaries were adopted. In 2013 the rules for women's NCAA lacrosse changed a defensive rule that made the game more similar to that of the men's. Players in their defending end of the field may run through any portion of the crease (8 meter circle around the goal) as long as their team is not in possession of the ball for as long as three seconds. Players that are on attack are allowed to run through the crease, but only in collegiate games; high school players are not allowed through the goalie crease. Only the defensive player who is directly marking the ball carrier within a stick's length may remain in the crease while defending. This rule evolved the game to a point where the defense had more equality in play with both the attackers, and compared to the men's game.http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/WLC15.pdf In 2015, for the 2016 season, there were a few other major rule changes. Players are now allowed to kick the ball in order to get it out of traffic. Also, players are now allowed to self-start after an opposing player commits a minor foul against them. Before moving forward, one must stand still in an athletic stance before self-starting to let the referee know the player is ready to continue with game play. In 2016, for the 2017 season, Division I implemented a 90-second possession shot clock, which was added to Divisions II and III in the following year. In the summer of 2017, the NCAA added more major changes. Prior to the newest addition, all players needed to stop play upon whistle of the referee. Play was resumed upon another whistle or continuation by self- start. Now, free movement has been implemented, meaning upon the whistle for a foul, play does not stop unless for halftime or the end of the game-this is similar to soccer. For the draw now only 3 players will be allowed into the midfield area until possession has been established. =Players= 2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship in which the Virginia Cavaliers lost to the Northwestern Wildcats Traditionally, women played with three attackers (starting with the position closest to the net that a team is shooting at, the attack positions are called \\"first home\\", \\"second home\\", and \\"third home\\"), five midfielders (a \\"right attack wing\\", a \\"left attack wing\\", a \\"right defensive wing\\", a \\"left defensive wing\\", and a \\"center\\"), three defenders (starting from the position closest to the net a team is defending, these positions are called \\"point\\", \\"cover point\\", and \\"third man\\"), and one goalie. The positions used to be pinned on the players, and the players used to be required to be marked on defense by their opposite number (third man or \\"3M\\" covering the opposing third home \\"3H\\"). Today, under North American rules, seven players play attack at one time and seven defenders are present. Generally, a team has four attackers, four close defenders, and three midfielders. There is a restraining line that keeps the four defensive players (plus the goalie) from going into the attack, or four attackers from going into the defensive zone. If those players cross the line and participate in the play, they are considered offside and a major foul is called. =Equipment= Women's lacrosse rules are specifically designed to limit physical contact between players. As a result of the lack of contact, the only protective equipment required are a mouth guard and face guard/goggles. Although headgear is not required, except for Florida where its mandatory for girls lacrosse players to wear a head gear, it is considered to new lacrosse players due to the risk of head injury. Brown University purchased headgear for its team and was the first N.C.A.A. program to make the helmets available to the whole team. It seems that women become more confident when they are playing with helmets on because they do not fear the ball or other players who may come in contact with them. This can lead to improved play and aggression. Wearing helmets causes women's lacrosse to be more like men's lacrosse in the aspects of equipment. This leads to controversy as if women are going to put helmets on, they should completely pad up like men do. This caused by the round rubber ball used in the sport. Players must wear eye protection according to US Lacrosse rules. All field players must properly wear eye protection that meets ASTM specification standard F803 for women's adult/ youth lacrosse for the appropriate level of play. All players must wear a professionally manufactured intra-oral mouthpiece that fully covers the teeth. The mouthguard must include portions protecting and separating the biting surfaces and protecting the teeth and supporting structures and has to cover the posterior teeth with adequate thickness. Most referees do not allow mouth guards to be white or clear colored as it is too difficult for them to distinguish between the mouth guard and the player's teeth. Mouth pieces must be worn at all times and cannot be taken out in the middle of play. No protruding tabs are allowed for field players. In addition, players may choose to wear gloves, and jewelry is not allowed to be worn. Although the rules specify these types of protection, injuries still occur from accidental checks to the head and the overall nature of the sport. Players must wear composition or rubber soled shoes. No spikes are allowed. Plastic, leather, or rubber cleats-studs may be worn. Shoes and socks are not required to be identical for team members. The pockets of women's sticks are shallower than those of the men, making the ball more difficult to catch and to shoot at high speed. The pockets also make it harder to cradle without dropping the ball. The crosse of a women's stick may be 35.5 inches and no longer than 43.25 according to the NCAA girls lacrosse committee. The crosse (Lacrosse stick) is divided into two parts, the shaft and the head. The shaft can be made of a variety of materials such as wood, aluminum and composite materials depending on what position the player prefers. Women's lacrosse rules mandate that only composite and aluminum shafts can be used, due to accidental checks and hitting that can happen during the duration of the games. The top of the stick is where the head joins the shaft to make the whole stick. The head is made out of compact plastic where the mesh, sidewall and pocket form. There are different mesh types made out of materials which affect the shot accuracy and handling of the ball. The sidewall is the siding of the head that affects the depth of the pocket and stiffness you feel when handling the ball. More stiff sidewalls and heads are better to use for defense players who want to check harder. More flexible sidewalls are better use of picking up groundballs, movement and face-offs. And the pocket is made from the mesh and with these different meshes they can have different capabilities like a wide pocket allows and easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control. While a smaller head will allow the user a more hard time catching the ball but greater accuracy. The pocket of the lacrosse stick can often be easily adjusted to ensure the depth of the pocket is legal and meets the players preference before the start of a game. The lacrosse ball is made of solid rubber and can be white, yellow or orange. All lacrosse balls must meet NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) standards. =Playing area= Women's lacrosse field dimensions based on 2007 IFWLA women's lacrosse rules The size of the playing field depends on the players' age group. For U15 and U13 players, they must play on a regulation sized field with all appropriate markings. For U11, they must play on a regulation sized field with all appropriate markings whenever possible. Otherwise, they may play on a modified field with reduced players. For U9 players the fields must be rectangular, between 60–70 yards in length and 30–40 yards in width to accommodate play on existing fields.https://uslacrosse.org/rules/field- diagrams There are two different surroundings around the goal on both sides of the field; the 8-meter arc and the 12-meter fan. When committing a major foul inside either of these areas, the offense regains the ball and has a direct opportunity to goal. If outside the 8-meter arc, but inside the fan, a \\"lane\\" to goal is cleared of all other players and the person who committed the foul is relocated 4 meters behind the offender. If inside the 8-meter-arc and a defensive foul occurs, all players that were previously inside the surrounding must take the most direct route out. The player who was fouled, now moves to the nearest hash mark that is located around the edges of the arc and has a direct lane to goal. The defender who committed the foul is relocated on the 12-meter fan directly behind the shooter. If a player fouled another player not in the arc, the victim receives the ball and the player who fouled must back away at least 4 meters. All other players standing closer than 4 meters to the ball holder must also back away to give the girl room to move with the ball. The shooting space rule in women's lacrosse is very important in keeping the players safe. It occurs when a defender moves into the offender's shooting lane to goal, at an angle that makes the defender at risk of being hit by the ball if the offender were to shoot. =Duration and tie-breaking methods= to intentionally touch the ball with their body to gain an advantage or cover the ball to protect it from being picked up by an opponent. Should a tie remain after regulation, state high-school associations can choose to break the tie using two 3-minute periods of extra time. If the game remains tied after the two periods of extra time, the teams will then play 3-minute golden goal periods until one team scores, which wins the game. Colleges use 4-minute golden goal periods. =Ball in and out of play= The \\"draw\\" is what starts the game and keeps the game going after a goal is scored. The draw is when two players, one from each team, stand in the center circle with the backs of their sticks facing each other. Then the referee places the ball between the two sticks. Each player has to push their sticks together parallel to the ground to contain the ball. There are allowed four players from each team (two Midfielders, one Attack wing, and one Defense wing) to stand along the circle surrounding the center circle during the draw. The players’ sticks around the circle cannot break the line until the whistle is blown. The centers must lift and pull their sticks over their heads releasing the ball. If one player taking the draw moves or lifts their stick before the other player, it leads to a re-draw or even alternate ball position as it is seen as a minor foul. When the referee blows the whistle during play, everyone must stop exactly where they are. If the ball goes out of bounds on a shot, then the player closest to the ball receives the possession. If the ball goes out of bounds not on a shot then the other team is awarded with the possession. For example, if a player threw a bad pass to her teammate and the ball went out of bounds then the other team would receive the ball. If the ball goes out of bounds on a shot, it is common for the player to reach out her stick in an attempt to be ruled closest to the ball and gain possession. Protecting one's stick from being checked is a very important key in the game of women's lacrosse. In order to protect the stick from being checked, the player must cradle the ball. If the player has a strong \\"cradle\\", it would make it much more difficult to recover the ball for the opposing team. \\"Cradling\\" is the back and forth movement and twisting of the head of the stick, which keeps the ball in the pocket with centripetal force. Allowable checking is based on what age level of the game is being played. Rules for U15 and above allow lacrosse players full checking above the head. However, this requires that at least one of the two umpires have a USL Local Rating so that they can judge the appropriate amount of contact. In most cases, a check into the head area is a mandatory red card. If a sufficiently experienced umpire is not available, then U13 checking rules must be used where modified checking only below the shoulder is allowed. Also in U13, a check into the head area is a yellow card rather than a mandatory red card. In U11 and U9 no checking is allowed. US Lacrosse rules recommend that Middle School/Junior High players play with U13 checking rules.https://www.edinalacrosse.com/page/show/597966-us-lacrosse- girls-rules In women's lacrosse, players may only check if the check is directed away from the ball carrier's head. Also, players may only check using the side of their stick. If caught by one of the referees using the flat of the head, it will be called as a \\"held check\\" and the opposing team will get the ball. There are two types of fouls in women's lacrosse, major and minor. When a minor foul is committed anywhere on the field, the player who committed the foul is set four meters to whichever side she was last guarding the person she obstructed. If a major foul occurs outside of the twelve meter fan or eight meter arc, the fouler must stand four meters behind the player she fouled. =Penalties= Penalties for women's lacrosse are assessed with the following cards: * The green card, given to the team captain, is for a delay of game. A delay of game is issued when a player continually moves once the whistle is blown (creeping), failure to move 4-meters as directed by the referee, jewelry violation, and improper use of equipment. * The yellow card is for a first-time penalty and results in the player being removed from the field for two or three minutes. In the U.S. any player receiving two yellows sits out the rest of the game but is allowed to play in the next game. * The red card is the result either of two yellow cards or a flagrant foul or extremely unsportsmanlike behavior, and causes the player to be ejected from the game. If the red card is for unsportsmanlike behavior, the player is also not permitted to play in the following game. U.S. rules differ in that a red card is not the result of two yellow cards and any player receiving a red card sits out the rest of that game and her team's next game. Penalties assessed include: *Rough/Dangerous Check *Check to the Head (Mandatory Card) *Slash (Mandatory Card) *Holding *Crosse in the sphere *Illegal Contact *Hooking *Reach across the body *Illegal cradle *Blocking *Charging *Pushing *Obstruction of the Free Space to Goal (Shooting Space) *Illegal Pick *Tripping *Detaining *Forcing Through *False Start *Playing the ball of an opponent *Dangerous Propelling (Mandatory Card) *Dangerous Follow-Through (Mandatory Card) *Dangerous Shot *Illegal Shot *Covering *Empty Stick Check *Warding off *Hand Ball *Squeeze the Head of the Crosse *Body Ball *Throwing her crosse in any circumstance. *Taking part in the game if she is not holding her crosse. *Illegal Draw *On the center draw, stepping on or into the center circle or on or over the restraining line before the whistle. *Illegal crosse *Scoring a goal with a crosse that does not meet the field crosse specifications. *Adjusting the strings/thongs of her crosse after an official inspection of her crosse has been requested during the game. The crosse must be removed. *Jewelry *Illegal Uniform *Illegal Substitution *Delay of game *Play from out of bounds *Illegal re-entry *Illegal Timeout International competition Beginning in 1972, the sport was governed internationally by the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations (IFWLA). The formation of the IFWLA actually predated that of the corresponding body for men's lacrosse, the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF), by two years. In August 2008, after negotiations lasting four years, the IFWLA and ILF agreed to merge into a single governing body, the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). All tournaments operated by the IFWLA have been taken over by the FIL. Every four years, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup is held. It was organized by the IFWLA before its merger with the IFL, and is now organized by the FIL. In Oshawa, Canada, in 2013, the United States defeated Canada in the final.

The Bruce Peninsula is a peninsula in Ontario, Canada, that lies between Georgian Bay and the main basin of Lake Huron. The peninsula extends roughly northwestwards from the rest of Southwestern Ontario, pointing towards Manitoulin Island, with which it forms the widest strait joining Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron. The Bruce Peninsula contains part of the geological formation known as the Niagara Escarpment. From an administrative standpoint, the Bruce Peninsula is part of Bruce County, named after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin (Lord Elgin), Governor General of Canada. A popular tourist destination for camping, hiking and fishing, the area has two national parks (Bruce Peninsula National Park and Fathom Five National Marine Park), more than half a dozen nature reserves, and the Bruce Peninsula Bird Observatory. The Bruce Trail runs through the region to its northern terminus in the town of Tobermory. The Bruce Peninsula is a key area for both plant and animal wildlife. Part of the Niagara Escarpment World Biosphere Reserve, the peninsula has the largest remaining area of forest and natural habitat in Southern OntarioParks Canada http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/on/bruce/index_e.asp and is home to some of the oldest trees in eastern North America. An important flyway for migrating birds, the peninsula is habitat to a variety of animals, including black bear, massasauga rattlesnake, and barred owl.

History  =History from the 19th century= Until the mid-19th century, the area known as the Bruce Peninsula was territory controlled by the Saugeen Ojibway Nations. The nations included the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation and Saugeen First Nation. Historical and archaeological evidence from the area concludes that at the time of first contact with Europeans, the peninsula was inhabited by the Odawa people, from whom a large number of local native people are descended. Oral history from Saugeen and Nawash suggests their ancestors have been here as early as 7500 years ago. The area of Hope Bay is known to natives as Nochemoweniing, or Place of Healing. In 1836 the Saugeen Ojibway signed a treaty with Sir Francis Bond Head to cede lands south of the peninsula to the Canadian government in exchange for learning agriculture, proper housing, assistance in becoming \\"civilized,\\" and for permanent protection of the peninsula. In 1854, the Saugeen Ojibway agreed to sign another treaty – this time for the peninsula itself. In 1994, after decades on increasing First Nations activism, the Saugeen Ojibway filed a suit for a land claim for part of their traditional territory; they claimed breach of trust by the Crown in failing to meet its treaty obligations to protect Aboriginal lands. The claim seeks the return of lands still held by the Crown and financial compensation for other lands. This claim is still active. European settlement began on the peninsula in the mid-19th century, despite its poor potential for agricultural development. Attracted by the rich fisheries and lush forest, settlers found the land known then as the \\"Indian or Saugeen Peninsula\\" to be irresistible. In 1881 settlers built the first sawmill on the peninsula in Tobermory. In less than 20 years most of the valuable timber was gone and timber industry jobs declined. Fuelled by the waste left behind by the rapid logging and land clearances, intense fires sprang up around the peninsula. By the mid-1920s formerly abundant forests of the peninsula were nearly barren. When the lamprey eel was accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes in 1932, the devastation on the fish supply made the peninsula a less attractive place to live. Many left when fish stocks were depleted. The peninsula underwent a steady decline in population until the 1970s. In the late 20th century, the peninsula started to attract a new kind of resident, the cottager. Today seasonal residents out-number permanent residents. The summer influx of tourists is so great that many attractions, parking, and infrastructure are overwhelmed by sheer numbers. =Natural history of the Bruce Peninsula and the Niagara Escarpment= Over-look towards the Niagara Escarpment at Dyer's Bay, Bruce Peninsula Overhanging Point along the Bruce Trail In its southern Ontario portion, the Niagara Escarpment is a ridge of rock several hundred metres high in some locations, stretching from Queenston on the Niagara River, to Tobermory at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula. Today, in Ontario, the Escarpment contains more than 100 sites of geological significance, including some of the best exposures of rocks and fossils of the Silurian and Ordovician periods (405 to 500 million years old) to be found anywhere in the world. The Niagara Escarpment has origins dating to the Silurian age some 430 to 450 million years ago, a time when the area lay under a shallow warm sea. This sea lay in a depression of the Earth's crust, centered in what is now the lower peninsula of the State of Michigan. Known geologically as the Michigan Basin, the outer rim of this massive saucer-shaped feature governs the location of the Niagara Escarpment, which is shaped like a gigantic horseshoe. The Escarpment can be traced from near Rochester, New York, south of Lake Ontario to Hamilton, north to Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula. It is covered by the waters of Lake Huron, appearing as Manitoulin Island, then across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and down the west side of Lake Michigan into the State of Wisconsin. As occurs with present-day water bodies, such as Hudson Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, rivers flowing into this ancient sea carried sand, silt and clay to be deposited as thick layers of sediment. At the same time, lime-rich organic material from the abundant sea life was also accumulating. Over millions of years these materials became compressed into massive layers of sedimentary rocks and ancient reef structures now visible along the Escarpment. Some rock layers now consist of soft shales and sandstones while others are made up of dolomite (a rock similar to limestone which contains magnesium and is more durable). Today, fossil remains illustrating the various life forms can be found in many of the rocks as they are slowly exposed by the action of wind, water and ice. =Indigenous history= Saugeen First Nation is an Ojibwa First Nation located along the Saugeen River and Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, Canada. The original territory included all of the Saugeen River watershed and all of the Bruce Peninsula. Organized in the mid-1970s, during a period of increased political activism, Saugeen First Nation declared itself the primary 'political successor apparent' to the historic Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory, who had occupied this territory and made treaties with the Crown. However, along with the Saugeen First Nation, the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation also claims to be the 'political successor apparent' to the Chippewa of Saugeen Ojibway Territory. Under the Saugeen Tract Agreement, the portion south of Owen Sound was ceded to the Crown, with reserves later established on the Bruce Peninsula. The claims for land and payment of rent on lands discussed in early treaties are significant. \\"The two First Nations are claiming aboriginal title to the lands under the water covering an area of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay from south of Goderich, west to the international border and north to the mid-point between the tip of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island; then east to the mid-point of Georgian Bay and south to the southernmost point of Nottawasaga Bay.\\"  Parks  There are 2 National Parks, 8 Ontario Parks, and 4 Federation of Ontario Naturalists Parks located within the Bruce Peninsula.

Lighthouses  The Bruce Peninsula's shoreline has several lighthouses, necessary to provide guidance to the many ships that would pass by her shores. The Cove Island Light, located near Tobermory is one of the six famous \\"Imperial\\" lighthouses built in the 1850s by John Brown which can be found on the mainland and on nearby islands of the northern Bruce Peninsula. Cove Island Light in the Bruce Peninsula. Other lighthouses include: * Lion's Head Lighthouse * Flowerpot Island * Big Tub Lighthouse * Knife & Lyal Island Lighthouse * Cape Croker Lighthouse * Cabot Head Lighthouse  Wildlife  There are many varieties of wildlife on the Bruce Peninsula, such as the northern flying squirrel, black bear, chipmunk, fisher, long-eared bats, red squirrel, fox, massasauga rattlesnake, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, hermit thrush, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager and yellow-spotted salamander. The Bruce Peninsula is located on a major northern migration route, so many species of birds, such as the bald eagle, have their wintering grounds here. The highest concentration of nesting birds can be found in the Bruce in May and June each year. About 20 species of warblers breed on \\"the Bruce,\\" including the black-throated green, yellow, yellow-rumped, and Blackburnian warblers and the ubiquitous American redstart. They make their summer homes in the extensive wooded areas along the Peninsula. The annual Huron Fringe Birding Festival in May observes the spring migration. The endangered piping plover has made a comeback along the northern shores of Sauble Beach as well, and nest in restricted areas of the beach. These are well marked to prevent visitors overrunning the area and to reduce negative human effects. Migrating hawks also follow the Niagara Escarpment. Hawks travel during the day, and can be seen in the vicinity of Cabot Head in the open areas west of Dyers Bay, and near Tobermory, in April.  Wildflowers and orchids  Pink ladies slipper orchid in the Bruce Peninsula. Some of the rarest flowers and ferns in Ontario can be found growing on the Bruce Peninsula. For example: lakeside daisy (Tetraneuris herbacea var. glabra), dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris), and northern holly fern (Polystichum lonchitis) = Orchids = Globally, there are more than 30,000 orchid species. Canada is home to 77 of these species. Ontario has 61 varieties of orchids, and of these, 44 can be found in the Bruce Peninsula.

It is a precipitate from limestone comprising aggregates of fine crystals of varying composition usually made of carbonates such as calcite, aragonite, hydromagnesite, and/or monohydrocalcite. There are several hypotheses concerning the origin of moonmilk. One of these explains moonmilk to be the result of bacterial action rather than from chemical reactions. According to this particular hypothesis, moonmilk is thought to have been created by the bacterium Macromonas bipunctata. However, no microbiological studies have been carried out so far. Moonmilk was originally explained as created by \\"moon rays\\". It is possible that moonmilk is formed by water that dissolves and softens the karst of caves consisting of carbonates, and carries dissolved nutrients that can be used by microbes, such as Actinomycetes. As the microbial colonies grow, they trap and accumulate chemically-precipitated crystals in the organic matter-rich matrix formed that way. It has been suggested that these heterotrophic microbes, which produce CO2 as a waste product of respiration and possibly organic acids, may help to dissolve the carbonate. Being soft, moonmilk was frequently the medium for finger fluting, a form of prehistoric art. The world's largest formation of brushite moonmilk is found in the Big Room of Kartchner Caverns State Park in southern Arizona. In the middle of 16th century moonmilk was used as a medicine according to Gessner, and continued to be used as such until the 19th century. It is said to have cured acidosis and probably cardialgia by neutralizing an overdose of acid. It had no adverse health effects.Moonmilk in showcaves.com.

She was originally intended to be part of the and would have been known as Weymouth. Leander was, like the rest of the class, named after a figure of the classical Greek mythology. She was built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland and was launched on 28 June 1961. She was commissioned on 27 March 1963. Service history =1963-1969= Upon her commissioning, Leander deployed to the West Indies, performing a variety of duties while there. She returned to the United Kingdom in April 1964. In 1965, Leander was part of Matchmaker I, a multi-national squadron of NATO, and the predecessor of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), which was created in 1967, although it was not actually formed until the following year. In 1966, Leander deployed to the Pacific and in 1967 she deployed back to the West Indies and subsequently to the Persian Gulf. =1970-1979= In 1970, Leander joined the NATO multi-national squadron STANAVFORLANT. In June that year, Leander began modernisation that included the removal of her one twin 4.5-in gun which was replaced by the Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile launcher. The work was completed in December 1972. In 1974, she joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron, which included other Leander-class frigates. That same year, as part of that squadron, Leander took part in Task Group (TG) 317.2, a deployment that caused some controversy back in the UK when the TG, on its way to the Far East/Pacific, visited South Africa, which was at that time under apartheid rule. As well as visiting two ports in South Africa, the TG performed military exercises with the South African armed forces, which caused uproar in some parts of the governing Labour Party, as well as gaining much press coverage. Leander, with the rest of the TG visited Cape Town, while and the submarine visited Simonstown. The TG, upon reaching their destination performed a number of exercises and 'fly the flag' visits with Far East and Pacific countries. While in the region, Leander, like a number of the TG, was shadowed by a number of nations, including the Soviet Union, a common occurrence during the Cold War. The TG did not visit South Africa on their return, and headed to Brazil for an exercise with the Brazilian Navy. Leander returned to the United Kingdom in June 1975. In December 1975, Leander, under the command of Captain John Tait, began a Fishery Protection Patrol during the Third Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland over fishing disputes. Like many other Royal Navy vessels, she was confronted by Icelandic gunboats. In January 1976, she rammed the Icelandic gunboat Þór (Thor), causing some damage to both ships. Þór sailed back to port for repairs with her helicopter deck damaged, while Leander's hull was dented on her starboard bow. No further collisions with Icelandic gunboats occurred on her first patrol, but on 17 January, the ship broke down during a heavy storm. She eventually made her way back to Faslane. The damage she suffered during her Fishery Patrol and during the storm was repaired at Devonport Dockyard. When the repairs were made, Leander undertook a second Fishery Patrol, and rammed another Icelandic patrol boat, Ver on 22 May 1976. Leander's stem was shattered, while part of Ver's port quarter was ripped off. In 1977, Leander undertook a refit, and the following year headed to the West Indies, California, British Columbia, Mexico and Florida. =1980-1989= In 1982, Leander came to the aid of the Portuguese vessel MV Ave Maria which was ablaze off Exeter. Leander deployed to the Mediterranean in 1983 and again in 1985. Fate On 31 July 1986 Leander was placed in Reserve, becoming part of the Standby Squadron.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 63. A potential sale to Chile did not occur, possibly due to Australia prohibiting the sale of the Ikara ASW missile to non-Commonwealth nations.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 87. In April 1987, Leander was decommissioned. Her career came to an end in 1989, when during a naval exercise, she was sunk by a Sea Dart missile, three Exocets and one gravity bomb.

Joaquim Callado (1848-1880) is considered one of the creators of the choro genre of music. Choro (, \\"cry\\" or \\"lament\\"), also popularly called chorinho (\\"little cry\\" or \\"little lament\\"), is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre which originated in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Despite its name, the music often has a fast and happy rhythm. It is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Choro is considered the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music. The serenaders who play choros are known as chorões. Choro instruments Instruments commonly played in choro Originally choro was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). Other instruments commonly played in choro are the mandolin, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. These melody instruments are backed by a rhythm section composed of 6-string guitar, 7-string guitar (playing bass lines) and light percussion, such as a pandeiro. The cavaquinho appears sometimes as a melody instrument, other times as part of the rhythm. Compositional structure Structurally, a choro composition usually has three parts, played in a rondo form: AABBACCA, with each section typically in a different key (usually the tonal sequence is: principal key->relative mode->sub-dominant keyHighBeam). There are a variety of choros in both major and minor keys.  Audio examples  History Chiquinha Gonzaga (1847-1935) Viriato Figueira (1851-1883) Ernesto Nazareth (1863-1934) In the 19th century, choro resulted from the style of playing several musical genres (polka, schottische, waltz, mazurka and habanera) by carioca musicians, who were already strongly influenced by African rhythms, principally the lundu and the batuque. The term “choro” was used informally at first to refer to the style of playing, or a particular instrumental ensemble, (e.g. in the 1870s flutist Joaquim Antônio da Silva Callado formed an ensemble called \\"Choro Carioca\\", with flute, two guitars and cavaquinho),What is Choro? Livingston- Isenhour, T., and Garcia, T. G. C. (2005). Choro: A Social History of a Brazilian Popular Music. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. and later the term referred to the music genre of these ensembles. The accompanying music of the Maxixe (dance) (also called \\"tango brasileiro\\") was played by these choro ensembles. Various genres were incorporated as subgenres of choro such as \\"choro-polca\\", \\"choro-lundu\\", \\"choro-xote\\" (from schottische), \\"choro-mazurca\\", \\"choro-valsa\\" (waltz), \\"choro-maxixe\\", \\"samba- choro\\", \\"choro baião\\".http://www.choromusic.com/arquivos/choro_english.pdf pag 4 Just like ragtime in the United States, tango in Argentina and habanera in Cuba, choro springs up as a result of influences of musical styles and rhythms coming from Europe and Africa. In the beginning (by the 1880s to 1920s), the success of choro came from informal groups of friends (principally workers of postal/telegraphic service and railwayAlexandre Gonçalves Pinto (1936). O choro - Reminiscências dos chorões antigos.) which played in parties, pubs (botecos), streets, home balls (forrobodós), and also the big hits of Ernesto Nazareth, Chiquinha Gonzaga and other pianists, whose musical scores were published by print houses. By the 1910s, many of the first Brazilian phonograph records are choros. Much of the mainstream success (by the 1930s to 1940s) of this style of music came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by urban samba in radio, but was still alive in amateur circles called \\"rodas de choro\\" (choro gatherings in residences and botecos), the one most famous was the \\"roda de choro\\" in the house of Jacob do Bandolim, in Jacarepaguá, and the \\"roda de choro\\" in the pub \\"suvaco de cobra\\" in the Penha. In the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre in the mainstream, through TV-sponsored nationwide festivals in 1977 and 1978, which attracted a new, younger generation of professional musicians. Thanks in great part to these efforts, choro music remains strong in Brazil. More recently, choro has attracted the attention of musicians in the United States, such as Mike Marshall and Maurita Murphy Mead, who have brought this kind of music to a new audience. Most Brazilian classical composers recognize the sophistication of choro and its major importance in Brazilian instrumental music. Radamés Gnattali said it was the most sophisticated instrumental popular music in the world. Heitor Villa-Lobos defined choro as the true incarnation of Brazilian soul. Notably, both composers had some of their music inspired by choro, bringing it to the classical tradition.http://www.brazzil.com/musfeb96.htm The French composer Darius Milhaud was enchanted by choro when he lived in Brazil (in 1917) and he composed the ballet Le Boeuf sur le toit, in which he quotes close to 30 Brazilian tunes.http://daniellathompson.com/Texts/Le_Boeuf/boeuf_chronicles.htm According to Aquiles Rique Reis (a Brazilian singer), ”Choro is classical music played with bare feet and callus on the hands”http://www.brazilianvoice.com/mostracolunas.php?colunista=Aquiles%20Reis&id;=772 Notable Brazilian choro musicians * Abel Ferreira * Alessandro Penezzi * Alexandre Ribeira * Alencar Sete Cordas * Almir Cortes * Altamiro Carrilho * Armando Neves (Armandinho) * Arnaldinho do Cavaco * Benedito Lacerda * Carlinhos 7 cordas * Carlinhos Moura * Chiquinha Gonzaga * Chôro das 3 * Danilo Brito * Dilermando Reis * Dino 7 Cordas * Ernesto Nazareth * Fernando César * Garoto * Hamilton de Holanda * Henrique Cazes * Irineu de Almeida * Israel Bueno de Almeida * Izaias Bueno de Almeida * Jacob do Bandolim * João Pernambuco :pt:João Pernambuco * Luciana Rabello * Luiz Otavio Braga * Luizinho 7 Cordas * Luperce Miranda * Manoel Jacintho Coelho :pt:Manoel Jacintho Coelho * Marcelo Gonçalves * Maurício Carrilho * Milton Móri * Nailor 'Proveta' Azevedo * Oscar Castro Neves * Paulo Bellinati * Paulo Moura * Paulo Sérgio dos Santos * Pixinguinha * Raphael Rabello * Rogério Souza * Ronaldo do Bandolim * Silvério Pontes * Waldir Azevedo * Wilfried Berk * Yamandu Costa * Zé Barbeiro * Zé da Velha * Zé Paulo Becker Notable choro compositions * \\"Brejeiro\\" (Ernesto Nazareth) * \\"Apanhei-te Cavaquinho\\" (Ernesto Nazareth) * \\"Odeon\\" (Ernesto Nazareth) * \\"Carinhoso\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Lamentos\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Cochichando\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Segura Ele\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Um a zero\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Vou Vivendo\\" (Pixinguinha) * \\"Sete cordas\\" (Raphael Rabello) * \\"Brasileirinho\\" (Waldir Azevedo) * \\"Pedacinhos do Céu\\" (Waldir Azevedo) * \\"Dôce de Coco\\" (Jacob do Bandolim) * \\"Noites Cariocas\\" (Jacob do Bandolim) * \\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\\" (Zequinha de Abreu) * \\"Meu caro amigo\\" (Chico Buarque e Francis Hime) * \\"Meu amigo Radamés\\" (Antonio Carlos Jobim) * \\"Choros nos. 1 to 14\\" (Concert music inspired in Choro, by Heitor Villa-Lobos) * \\"Choro no. 2\\" (Armando Neves) See also *Lundu *Frevo *Maxixe *Samba *Jongo Suggested reading *Livingston-Isenhour, T., and Garcia, T.

Various denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement have taken different paths on the subject of women and their role in the church and in society. Views range from the full equal status and ordination of women to the priesthood, as practiced by the Community of Christ, to a patriarchal system practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), to the ultra-patriarchal plural marriage system practiced by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and other Mormon fundamentalist groups. Women in Church history Nineteenth and early 20th-century accounts of Mormon history often neglected women's role in founding the religion. The 1872 history The Rise, Progress, and Travels of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not name any women. B.H. Roberts's famous seven-volume history, History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints only mentions a few women. A notable exception to this was 19th century historian Edward Tullidge, who Claudia Bushman said \\"stood alone as a Mormon feminist historian before the revitalization of the women's movement in the 1970s.\\"Claudia Bushman, \\"Edward W. Tullidge and The Women of Mormondom\\" Dialouge Journal V33, No. 4 https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N04_25.pdf However, a number of women had significant supporting roles; for example, Joseph Smith's wife, Emma Hale Smith, served as a scribe during translation of the Book of Mormon and was the subject of one of the church's early revelations, which included direction to compile the church's first hymnal. Emma Smith also served as head of the Relief Society, originally a self-governing women's organization within the church, which is one of the oldest and largest women's organizations in the world. =Women's suffrage= In the secular sphere, Utah Territory was at the forefront of women's suffrage; in 1870, it became one of the first states or territories in the Union to grant women the vote, though the federal government removed the franchise from women in 1887 via the Edmunds–Tucker Act. Education and scholarship was also a primary concern for Mormon women. Religious missions, like Bathsheba W. Smith's mission to southern Utah to preach \\"woman's rights\\", were launched. The Woman's Exponent magazine, the unofficial publication of the Relief Society, published a 1920 editorial in favor of \\"equal rights before the law, equal pay for equal work, [and] equal political rights\\", stating that a women's place is not just \\"in the nursery\\" but \\"in the library, the laboratory, the observatory.\\"cited in In 1875, Relief Society president Emmeline B. Wells said that women should speak for themselves, and if that is considered manly, that should be a good thing, since if men are superior, becoming more masculine ought to be desirable.: Late-19th-century Utah also had the most liberal divorce laws in the United States at the time. The laws were advantageous to women: any woman who insisted on a divorce got one. One of Brigham Young's wives divorced him and launched a lucrative career as a public speaker. The divorce rate in late 19th-century Utah came close to 30 percent. This divorce rate was inflated by people from other states seeking an easy divorce in Utah. In 1896, Martha Hughes Cannon was the first woman in the nation elected to state senate. She ran against her husband. =Laying on of hands and Priesthood= In the early church, women would sometimes lay hands on another person to give them a special \\"women's blessing\\". Patty Bartlett Sessions recorded giving and receiving blessings from other women in her work as a midwife, as did Louisa Barnes Pratt in her life as a pioneer and a missionary. While not given by virtue of priesthood ordination,Morgan Utah Stake Relief Society Minutes and Records, 1878–1973, Church History Library, Salt Lake City, vol. 1, Apr. 28, 1883, p. 88; see also “To All Authorities of the Priesthood–Instruction for the Relief Society,” First Presidency, Salt Lake City, to all priesthood leaders and Latter-day Saints, Oct. 6, 1880, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.President Wilford Woodruff stated that women administered to the sick “not as members of the priesthood, but as members of the Church.” Wilford Woodruff to Emmeline B. Wells, 27 Apr. 1888, Church History Library. these \\"women's blessings\\" were a normal part of religion at the time. Relief Society president Eliza Snow believed that women did not need to be \\"set apart\\" to officiate in temple ordinances or in administering to the sick.cited in She advised that women confide personal issues to the Relief Society president and her counselors, rather than the bishops. Women also participated in the Anointed Quorum in the early church.. Current LDS Church policy dictates that the act of giving blessings \\"by laying on of hands\\" is only to be performed by those ordained to offices in the Melchizedek priesthood, which offices are only held by men. However, a 2015 essay published in The Gospel Topics section of the church's website states that while neither Joseph Smith nor any other church leader ordained women to the priesthood, women do exercise priesthood authority without ordination. Polygamy The status of women in the LDS Church has been a source of public debate beginning in the 19th century, when the church found itself at odds with the United States federal government over its practice of polygamy.e.g. Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act (1862), Edmunds–Tucker Act (1887). Polygamy was introduced into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints when Joseph Smith prayed about the plural marriage as practiced in the Old Testament. The practice was established in the church in 1831. It continued until 1890 when Wilford Woodruff received a revelation, known as the \\"Manifesto\\", that stopped plural marriage. Following the Manifesto, many groups and individuals left the church in order to continue the practice; however, these groups have no affiliation with the church today. Although some church leaders are known to have large polygamous families, two-thirds of the men who practiced polygamy in the church only had two wives. Women were able to divorce their husbands. Among the church population as a whole, at its peak, only 25 to 30 percent of members were part of polygamist families by 1870. Despite the legal and cultural issues related to the Mormon practice of polygamy, 19th-century women played a significant public leadership role in Latter-day Saint culture, politics, and doctrine.. Some view the role of women in the 19th-century church as the zenith of women's institutional and leadership participation in the church hierarchy.. When speaking of polygamy, generally only two extremes are considered: \\"Mormon women were either highly empowered agents or submissive dupes.\\" To note only these extremes, however, is to ignore that Mormon women chose to participate in polygamy and the fact that it was a part of their daily lives. Polygamy caused many women to grapple with their faith, but also allowed them to grow closer to God and to make and keep covenants. Women in polygamous relationships at the time described the experience as a great trial that taught them self-denial. Many were protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, it was not always accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process that brought them closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline that taught her subordination to God and her family. For some women, like Hannah Tapfield King, plural marriage was a way for women to obtain the highest blessings of salvation. King's husband was not a member of the church, and although he did convert, the couple was not able to be sealed in the temple. King was sealed to Brigham Young but only for the next life. She remained married to her husband throughout her life and never had relations with Young, but was able to ensure blessings for herself through polygamy that she would not otherwise have received in this life. After accepting polygamy, Edith Turbin declared \\"I had rather to be the 20th wife of an honorably God-fearing Man, than to be the only wife of any one of two thirds of the Men in the world.\\" Gender roles Ezra Taft Benson stated that women have qualities of faithfulness, benevolence, and charity that balance the \\"more aggressive and competitive nature of man.\\" Speaking of women working in professions equal to men, Howard W. Hunter said, \\"I hope the time never comes when women will be brought down to the level with men, although they seem to be making these demands in meetings held … all over the world.\\" =Church activity= Ecclesiastically, the LDS Church is firmly committed to traditional gender roles. Women have a certain degree of authority in some areas, including leadership positions with authority over children and other women, although these women leaders receive supervision and guidance by male priesthood-holding leaders. Women are \\"endowed\\" with priesthood power, but are not ordained to priesthood office. Though not considered clergy, women play a significant part in the operation of local congregations. teaching classes to adults, teenagers, and children and organizing social, educational, and humanitarian activities. Women may also serve as missionaries, and a select few may perform certain ordinances such as washing and anointing on behalf of women in church temples. Aside from the years between 1967 to 1978 women have been allowed to pray in sacrament meetings. Women leaders have regularly given sermons at the church's semi-annual General Conference, but it was not until 2013 that a woman was invited to pray during a general session of the conference. A survey conducted in 2012 of 500 Mormons in the United States showed that if they were married to an LDS spouse, men and women had equal levels of church activity. Almost half of the men surveyed agreed that a good Latter-day Saint should obey without knowing why, while only 31 percent of women agreed. About 20 percent of LDS women believe that \\"women do not have enough say in the church.\\" =Marriage= In Orson Pratt's 1852 \\"Celestial Marriage,\\" he wrote that a woman should not marry a man unless she \\"had fully resolved herself to submit herself wholly to his counsel, and let him govern as the head\\", and in a 1972 article titled \\"Maintain Your Place as a Woman\\" church president Harold B. Lee stated, \\"the wife is to obey the law of her husband\\", but added the caveat \\"only as he obeys the laws of God.\\" In contrast, Spencer W. Kimball said that a man \\"presides\\" rather than \\"rules\\". Early prophet Brigham Young stated of his wives, \\"The influence of my women over me is no more than the buzzing of a fly’s wing in winter.\\" He also stated, \\"A woman is the dirtiest creature, dirtier than a man”, and “Men are honest, but if a woman won’t lie, she is a miracle.\\" Initially, early church members defined polygamy as \\"celestial\\" marriage, but \\"celestial\\" marriage now refers to marriages sealed in the temple. After the Manifesto prohibiting plural marriage, members felt that there was a lack of available Mormon men for women to marry, even though there were a sufficient number. Fiction from the Young Woman's Journal attempts to make religious marriage attractive by describing it as romantic. Unmarried LDS women are promised that if they are faithful, they will have the opportunity to marry in the afterlife. =Working and Responsibility to children= The Family: A Proclamation to the World states that \\"Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children\\", and an article on women in the church on the official church website states that women have \\"the greater gift and responsibility for home and children and nurturing there and in other settings.\\" Numerous quotes from General Authorities support the assertion that women are fundamentally different from men, not just in their physical bodies, but in their spiritual makeup as well. Harold B. Lee said that women have a special \\"mother's intuition.\\" Brigham Young taught that women \\"should stand behind the counter, study law or physic [medicine], or become good book-keepers and be able to do the business in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large.\\" Many women in Brigham Young's time worked; in 1874, Utah had a respectable class of literate and professional women and a visitor noted that no profession was closed to women. After the church officially ended polygamy, church members adopted a more mainstream Victorian view towards women's work, which confined women's roles to the home. By 1920, the church's ideals for women mirrored society's until the 1960s and 70s, when some Church leaders strongly advised against (presumably married) women working outside the home. Spencer W. Kimball said, \\"Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment.\\" Gordon B. Hinckley made allowances for single mothers and other women in similar circumstances: \\"I recognize [...] that there are some women (it has become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can.\\" A 1986 Ensign article emphasized that husband and wife share the responsibility of providing for their children's temporal needs, and that each family would prayerfully decide if a mother would go to work. Mormon women were to reject the secular values of individuality and devote themselves to the eternal women's roles of marriage, motherhood, and submissiveness. The messages of Church leaders regarding working women were reflected in the Relief Society's housework curriculum. Throughout the 1950s, Relief Society lessons were written by career women who balanced home and work life.Holbrook, Kate (2016). Housework: The Problem That Does Have a Name. In Patrick Q. Mason and John G. Turner (Eds.), Out of Obscurity: Mormonism since 1945. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Each lesson was listed with the author's name, allowing readers to match a name to the curriculum. However, by the 1970s, the Church discontinued the lessons written by specific individuals and the use of an author's byline. Relief Society lessons were then created to be messages from the Church as a whole, \\"providing no individual model of a professional woman for others to know and follow\\". One 1990 study by Laurence Iannaccone found that starting in 1963, statements from church leaders were highly variable on women's topics. After Ezra Taft Benson's 1987 talk \\"To The Mothers in Zion\\" exhorting women to not work outside the home, many women quit their jobs and some women BYU students wondered if they should continue their studies. Then-BYU-president Jeffrey R. Holland stated that BYU especially welcomed women, and encouraged personal study and revelation about how to follow church guidelines. The same study found that as the Church affirmed new sex roles, the number of living endowments increased (a sign of committed new membership) but the number of endowments for the dead decreased (a sign of committed, experienced member activity). It also found the opposite was true; as the Church affirms traditional roles, the number of living endowments increased and the number of endowments for the dead increased. =Modesty in dress= Brigham Young said that women's dress should reflect that they are separate from the world. After Joseph F. Smith complained about the indecency of some LDS women's attire, Amy Brown Lyman led the Relief Society, YLMIA, and Primary in issuing dress guidelines for Mormon women in 1917. These guidelines were not closely followed by members. In 1951, Elder Spencer W. Kimball gave the talk \\"A Style of Our Own: Modesty in Dress and Its Relationship to the Church,\\" which was reprinted in the Church News and defined modesty for Mormons in the latter half of the 20th century. Kimball said that Latter-day Saint women should have a unique style of their own that did not include strapless dresses, shorts, form-fitting sweaters, or dresses with low necks or backs. Immediately following the talk, many women changed their wardrobes to conform to Kimball's instructions and called their wardrobes \\"kimballized\\", but the church issued no formal dress standards. In 1957, the Mutual Improvement Association published a pamphlet on modesty in general. It advised women against \\"flaunt[ing] one's figure,\\" and also emphasized modesty in speech and conduct. A 1959 Improvement Era column counseled teenage girls to keep their clothing clean and ironed. In the 1960s, the counterculture movement started to influence the dress of Mormon youth. Short skirts, beards and long hair for men, and dirty clothing became popular. Fearing that the counterculture fashions would negatively influence morals, leaders began to advise on dress codes more stringently. Men received instruction to avoid long hair and beards because of their association with counterculture; women's dress standards were created to protect their virtue. The miniskirt in particular was denounced as unfashionable as well as immodest. The church's modesty rhetoric in the 1960s and 70s also encouraged women to dress femininely especially as androgynous styles became more popular. A more feminine dress style was associated with acceptance of traditional feminine gender roles of the 1950s. In 1965, the first For the Strength of Youth pamphlet was published, and the first presidency encouraged youth and their parents to conform to its regulations. It prescribed skirts that covered the kneecaps and forbade low-cut, strapless, and low-backed attire. It encouraged women to \\"always try to look feminine\\" and stated that slacks (rather than skirts or dresses) were appropriate only for hiking and other sports. The 1968 For the Strength of Youth pamphlet denounced soiled and sloppy clothing, and said that women should not be in public with her hair in curlers. In 1972, the pamphlet was changed to state that skirts should be \\"of modest length.\\" Dallin H. Oaks published a formal dress code for Brigham Young University in 1971, which allowed pant suits but no other pants for women. Jeans were allowed in 1981, and knee-length shorts in 1991. A specific prohibition against tattoos and multiple earrings was added in 2000. Sister missionaries also received special instruction in dressing professionally starting in 1977. The Church published a dress code for its own employees in 1980, which did not allow pant suits. Finding modest dresses, shorts, and swimsuits presents a challenge to some LDS women. The La Canada first ward in California sewed modest swimsuits for themselves in 1976. One group of LDS young women in Kansas worked with Nordstrom to propose modest dress ideas, garnering over 9,000 women's signatures in support of making more modest dresses available. The current For the Strength of Youth pamphlet for LDS youth defines modest dress standards for young women: \\"Young women should avoid short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back.\\" The pamphlet also counsels women to only wear one pair of earrings. Women who have gone through the temple endowment and wear temple garments, and their clothing must cover their garments, which cover shoulders, midriff, and thighs. Some members feel that when leaders emphasize dressing modestly to young women, they only emphasize the sexualization of women's bodies and encourage women to judge each other by their physical appearance. Other members feel that modest dress is the first defense against immorality, and that dressing modestly will help individuals act modestly. Factors affecting mental health Mormon women are no more likely than other women to experience depression, however, Mormon women who experience depression have specific challenges. A 1993 dissertation by Marleen Williams found a few differences in how Mormon women experience depression. Compared to mildly depressed Protestant women, mildly depressed Mormon women felt more guilt and self-blame, took responsibility for others' behavior, and depended on others for approval. Compared to non-depressed Mormon women, mildly depressed Mormon women were more likely to have role conflicts and feel their gender role restricted their behavior. A 1984 study by David Spendlove found that poor health, low income, less education, and less perceived caring from spouse were positively correlated with depression in LDS women in Utah. Spendlove also found that for women in Utah in 1984, women who work \\"may be at a higher risk of depression\\" than those who do not. Other studies have examined specific subgroups of Mormon women. A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 found that Mormon women who were sexually abused were more likely to feel distant from God, blame themselves for bad things that happen to them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon women who were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 found that Mormon women who experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity. In the temple =Menstruation= In December 1866, Brigham Young gave for advice that women should wait a week from the start of menstruation before participating in the endowment.Edward L. Kimball \\"The History of LDS Temple Admission Standards\\" Journal of Mormon History , Spring 1998, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring 1998), pp. 135–176 University of Illinois Press; Mormon History Association Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/23287671 Some temples in 2012 still did not allow women to perform baptisms for the dead during their menstrual period, despite official policy to the contrary. Feminist Mormon Housewives started a project to document which temples did not allow menstruating women to perform baptisms, and after the Salt Lake Tribune reported the story, the LDS church further clarified the policy that menstruating women are allowed to perform baptisms for the dead. =Endowment= A 1936 policy forbade women whose husbands were not endowed from receiving their own endowment, whether their husbands were members of the church or not. The ostensible reason for the prohibition was to maintain peace and harmony in the home. Gradually the policy changed, first for women whose husbands were members of the church, and then on 12 February 1986, for all women whose husbands were unendowed providing they have the consent of their husbands. In the temple endowment, women were previously urged to be a priestess \\"unto her husband,\\" while men were promised they will be priests to God. In January 2019, that was removed from the endowment process, in accordance with other changes that included more lines for Eve in their ritual performance of the Book of Genesis. Also in 2019, a letter from the church's First Presidency stated that \\"Veiling an endowed woman's face prior to burial is optional.\\" It had previously been required. The letter went on to say that such veiling, \\"may be done if the sister expressed such a desire while she was living. In cases where the wishes of the deceased sister on this matter are not known, her family should be consulted.\\" That same year veiling of women during part of the temple endowment ceremony was discontinued.https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/01/29/heels-temple-changes/ =Prayer circles= In current Latter-day Saint temple practice, the endowment ritual contains a prayer circle, where some participants stand in a circle and repeat a prayer given by a single person. A year after Joseph Smith established the temple endowment in 1843, he extended the privilege to women, who could then participate in the prayer circle and Anointed Quorum. After 1846, it was uncommon for women to participate in prayer circles without their husbands. Under Eliza R. Snow's guidance, some women made women-only prayer circles. In 1896, the first presidency advised against Relief Society prayer circles, but some Relief Societies continued the practice. In 1978, the First Presidency discontinued all prayer circles except those performed in a temple as part of the endowment. Since members of prayer circles had to be approved by the first presidency, continuing this tradition in a worldwide church made for unwieldy paperwork. Religiously significant women =Heavenly Mother= Along with the promotion of women's rights in the secular sphere, women in Utah, like renowned poet Eliza R. Snow, spoke of women's equality in sacred matters. This included the development of a Heavenly Mother theology.. Joseph Smith discussed the doctrine of a Heavenly Mother as early as the 1840s. The idea of a Heavenly Mother expanded to a loving mother who sent each of us off on our journey to this earth and who will welcome us back to her again after death. As written in poems by Mormon authors, \\"[Heavenly Mother] oversees key moments for individual souls in the Mormon progressive plan of salvation.\\" These ideas were expressed throughout the early 1800s. Today, church leaders continue to mention Heavenly Mother, although less frequently and embellished than in early church history. Neal A. Maxwell affirmed the ideas or a homecoming expressed in Snow's poetry about Heavenly Mother by saying, \\"Could such a regal homecoming be possible without the anticipatory arrangements of a Heavenly Mother?\\" In the 1970s and 1980s church members began to write speculations about a Heavenly Mother and even to pray to her in meetings. In the 1980s and 1990s the church stopped these practices. There were publications made in Dialogue during this time period that suggested that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost. In 2015 an essay was published in The Gospel Topics section of the church's website, which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven. =Eve= Mormonism rejected the Augustinian doctrine of original sin, which held that humanity inherits the sin of Adam and Eve in which they ate the forbidden fruit. This sin was historically blamed on Eve, and was thought to be the source of women's submissive and dependent state. The movement's second Article of Faith states, \\"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.\\" Civil rights =Reproductive rights= The LDS Church opposes elective abortion based on a belief in the \\"sanctity of human life.\\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Temples The church allows members to abort pregnancies in some rare circumstances. According to an official statement, \\"The Church allows for possible exceptions for its members when: Pregnancy results from rape or incest, or a competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or a competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.\\" The statement goes on to say, \\"Abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct.\\" The statement also clarifies that the LDS church does not favor or oppose specific legislation or public demonstrations concerning abortion. In the past the use of birth control methods including artificial contraception was explicitly condemned by LDS Church leaders. Beginning in July 1916, apostles were quoted stating that birth control was a \\"pernicious doctrine\\" and that \\"limiting the number of children in a family...is sinful\\". As recently as 2003 a church manual was published containing a quote from the late church president Spencer W. Kimball stating that the church does not \\"condone nor approve of\\" measures of contraception which greatly \\"limit the family\\". The current church stance is that \\"decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple\\" and that they should consider \\"the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children\\" when planning a family. The church \\"strongly discourages\\" surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and encourages members to only turn to it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop. The church's insurance company Deseret Mutual Benefits Administrators which provides coverage for its employees does not cover any form of birth control and will only cover sterilization by vasectomy or tubal ligation for a couple if the woman has already had five children or is over forty. =Equal Rights Amendment= According to historian Ardis Parshall, in 1943, women within positions of leadership in the LDS Church backed the amendment.https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/12/12/this-week-mormon-land/ In the 1970s, the LDS Church came out against the Equal Rights Amendment. The LDS Church in Utah requested that ten women from each ward attend the Utah International Women's Year in 1977 to support the church's position on the Equal Rights Amendment and other women's issues. The fourteen thousand attendees, mostly Latter-day Saint women recruited in their wards, voted on platforms before hearing their discussion and rejected all the national resolutions—even those that did not advocate a moral position opposed to that of the LDS Church. In 1978, the LDS church encouraged nine thousand female members in greater Las Vegas, Nevada, to canvass their neighborhoods with anti–Equal Rights Amendment pamphlets and encouraged all members to vote. Nevada did not ratify the amendment. Sonia Johnson fought against the church in support of the Equal Rights Amendment and was excommunicated; a December 1979 excommunication letter claimed that Johnson was charged with a variety of misdeeds, including hindering the worldwide missionary program, damaging internal Mormon social programs, and teaching false doctrine. Also in 1979, the Alice Reynolds forum was forbidden from discussing the amendment in the Alice Reynolds reading room at Brigham Young University; the club subsequently found a different place to meet. Dissent Within and outside the church mainstream, there is a minority of LDS women who raise concerns regarding church policy and doctrine. However, any members who are viewed as publicly oppositional toward the church's current structure are subject to ecclesiastical discipline, including excommunication for apostasy.e.g. September Six, Kate Kelly 20th and 21st centuries changes in church policies about women The First Presidency made the Relief Society an auxiliary to the church, removing their independent financial status in 1970. In 1977, First Presidency member N. Eldon Tanner told a meeting of church leaders that presidency of the Relief Society should be considered a partner with the Melchizedek priesthood. Other developments during the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball included having young women class advancements recognized in sacrament meeting and, in 1978, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a policy which approved of women praying in sacrament meeting. Women had been barred praying in sacrament meeting from 1967 to 1978. In 1980, the general presidents of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary were invited to sit on the stand with the male general authorities during general conference. In 1984, a woman spoke in general conference for the first time since 1930. Since then, women have spoken in every general conference. In 1978, a conference session specifically for women was added, initially two weeks before the October general conference, which was later changed to one week beforehand. In the April 2013 general conference, women gave prayers for the first time. In 1978, a policy that a woman was not allowed to be a Sunday School president was clarified to a bishop in a Boston suburb. Also in 1978, Alice Colton Smith, a member of the Relief Society General Board, remarked in a letter to Leonard J. Arrington that women were once permitted to join in or stand as an observer at the blessing of her baby, but now were rarely permitted to do so. In 1975, the LDS church allowed Maureen Ursenbach Beecher to continue to work in the History Division after the birth of her daughter. Previously, the church's policy was to terminate new mothers' employment; after consulting with their legal counsel, the church changed their policy to allow women employees to continue working after several weeks of maternity leave. Brigham Young University (BYU), the LDS Church's flagship educational institution, has made several changes in its policy towards women. In 1975, the four-year, full tuition and boarding expenses presidential scholarship was changed from only being available to men to being available to an equal number of men and women. BYU established a Women's Research Institute in 1978. Among its directors over its 21 years of existence was Marie Cornwall. At the end of 2009, BYU restructured its Women's Studies Programs, freeing more money for research on women's issues by ending an institute staff, placing the Women's Studies Minor in the Sociology Department and thus putting all the money that had been split between research and staff directly into research expenditures. In 2013, the church adjusted the leadership council in its missions to include a greater role for the wife of the mission president and by creating a new role, called \\"sister training leader\\". The new Mission Leadership Council expands the use of councils to govern the church at every level. Also in 2013, the organization Ordain Women was established by LDS women who supported the extension of priesthood ordinations to women. On November 1, 2013, the church announced that beginning in 2014, a general women's meeting, conducted by the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary organizations, would be held in connection with its bi-annual general conferences. In 2015, the church appointed women to its executive councils for the first time. The church appointed Linda K. Burton, president of the Relief Society, Rosemary Wixom, president of the Primary, and Bonnie L. Oscarson, president of the Young Women's organization, to three high-level church councils (one woman to each).. Mormon feminism Mormon feminism is a feminist movement concerned with the role of women within Mormonism. Mormon feminists advocate for a more significant recognition of Heavenly Mother, the ordination of women, gender equality, and social justice grounded in Mormon theology and history.Sherilyn Cox Bennion, \\"The Woman's Exponent: Forty-two Years of Speaking for Women,\\" Utah Historical Quarterly 44:3 (Summer 1976): 226 The modern form of the movement has roots that go back to the founding of Mormonism, including the largely independent operation of the female Relief Society, priesthood blessings by women in early church history, and the women's suffrage movement in the western United States. Fundamentalist groups Mormon fundamentalists are groups or individuals who have broken from the dominant form of Mormonism practiced by the LDS Church. Since the mid-19th century, numerous fundamentalist sects have been established, many of which are located in small, cohesive, and isolated communities in areas of the Western United States, western Canada, and Mexico. Mormon fundamentalists advocate a return to Mormon doctrines and practices which, they believe, were wrongly abandoned, such as plural marriage, the law of consecration, the Adam–God doctrine, the Patriarchal Priesthood, elements of the Mormon endowment ritual, and often the exclusion of blacks from the priesthood. Plural marriage is generally considered the most central and significant doctrine separating fundamentalists from mainstream Mormonism. In Mormon fundamentalist groups, women are typically expected or encouraged to adhere to a strongly patriarchal perspective on women's roles and activities and, in many cases, participate in plural marriage. Even though women in fundamentalist groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, it is not accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex is viewed as a necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.

Structure Somatotropic cells constitute 20% of anterior pituitary cells.Costanzo Physiology 5th edition They release growth hormone (GH) in response to Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH, or somatocrinin) or are inhibited by GHIH (somatostatin), both received from the hypothalamus via the hypophyseal portal system vein and the secondary plexus. Clinical significance =Hormone deficiency= When levels of somatotropin are low in the body, a physician may prescribe human growth hormone as a drug. Deficiency in somatotrope secretion before puberty or before the end of new bone tissue growth, can lead to pituitary dwarfism. When growth hormone is deficient, blood sugar is low because insulin is not opposed by normal amount of growth hormone. =Hormone excess= If there is an excess of growth hormone, it is usually because of over-secretion of somatotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland. A significant amount of excess somatotrope secretion before puberty or before the end of new bone tissue growth can lead to gigantism, a disease that causes excess growth of body (e.g. being over 7 ft. tall) and unusually long limbs. An excess of secretion of growth hormone after puberty can lead to acromegaly. This is a disease that causes abnormal growth in the hands, head, jaw, and tongue. Some symptoms associated with acromegaly include heavy sweating, oily skin, improper processing of sugars in the diet (diabetes), high blood pressure, increased calcium in urine and swelling of the thyroid gland and arthritis. Other animals Bovine somatotropin occurs in the pituitary of cattle and differs in structure from human pituitary growth hormone and is biologically inactive in the human being. Bovine somatotropin aids in regulating the amount of milk produced. Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is a hormone that is injected in cows that increases milk production.

Design and development The Su-80 program was supposed to start in the late 1990s, but due to lack of funds, it was postponed for several years. A prototype of the combined Freight/Passenger Su-80GP was built and its first flight was planned for early 1998, but the program was delayed again. The first flight of the prototype was at the 2001 MAKS in Moscow issued Zhukovsky. On the fourth September 2001, Igor Wotinzew started with the prototype, 82911, on his first flight. In early 2006, the Su-80 entered production in the KnAAPO factory in Komsomolsk-on- Amur. The first model of the turboprop transporter Sukhoi S-80 was shown at the 46th Paris International Air and Space Show, 2005. The plane is being developed by Sukhoi OKB and the aircraft factory in Komsomolsk/Amur under the \\"konversija\\" program. The aircraft is intended to replace the An-24/26, An-28 and Yak-40, and to compete with the Antonov An-38 . The design of the machine is very similar to the Scaled Composites ATTT and the Rockwell OV-10. It has three lift-generating surfaces: the primary wings; two fins at the rear of the fuselage which join the booms to the fuselage; and the horizontal stabilizer which joins the two vertical fins at the rear of the booms. Two General Electric CT7-9B turboprop engines are housed in bays at the front of the tail booms. The sleek hull offers space for 30 passengers, and a \\"beaver-tail\\" cargo ramp is fitted at the rear of the fuselage, which allows for easy loading and unloading of cargo. Operational history S-80 (rear view) at Zhukovski in 2003 Eight aircraft from the second production (first definitive) batch are earmarked for delivery to customers. =Commercial orders= Blagoveshchensk Airlines, Chukotavia, Dalavia, the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Air Enterprise, and Polar Airlines have all signed preliminary agreements for the acquirement of the type. The KnAAPO factory airline is expected to be the Su-80s first operator. =Military orders= The Kazakhstan Border Guards have tentatively ordered ten Su-80s, while the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, Jordanian Air Force, Royal Malaysian Air Force, Indonesian Air Force and Republic of Korea Air Force have all expressed interest. Variants There are two different models of the Su-80.

Most developed amongst the Liberal Democrats but adopted to some extent by the British Greens, other parties, and Independents. Community politics is based on small-scale action on local political issues. To give an example of how it works: Residents are irritated by rubbish dumped by a playing field. A 'non-community' political response would be to issue a statement calling for more resources to be allocated to deal with dumped rubbish. A 'community politics' response would be for local councillors to lead a group of people to clear the rubbish themselves, then inform the local community through a newsletter. The result is a stronger local community who feel that their representatives are achieving something, and a better chance of even the most under-resourced local authority taking the time to stop the problem in future. The low-budget techniques are easy to adopt. No television advertising, mass direct mailing or contacts with national newspapers are necessary. Community politics principles can be applied to any area and by any party. The keys are local action on residents' concerns and effective communication with local residents through newsletters and face-to-face contact. Parties which espouse community politics often meet with electoral success (e.g. the Liberal Democrats' ability to break out of the third-party trap), particularly in areas which have been dominated by one political party. In Letchworth Garden City local residents, disenchanted by local politics and the local establishment, petitioned for their own town council and elected all 24 members as independents. (All the seats had been contested by the main political parties).  National and local initiatives  Concern at disengagement with local politics in the UK—manifested, not least, by low turnout in local elections - has led to a series of initiatives aimed at making it easier for people to become involved in local decision-making. Their success is debatable. Notable national initiatives include changes to electoral systems to allow universal postal voting on a trial basis, and the process introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 by which the public can, via petition, call for a referendum on whether there should be a local elected mayor. National regeneration funding streams, such as New Deal for Communities, require community leadership as part of their governance arrangements. At a local level, many local authorities have established \\"area\\", \\"ward\\" or \\"neighbourhood\\" committees and such like to consider more local, community based issues, sometimes with devolved budgets. The requirement placed on each local authority in England and Wales to create a Local Strategic Partnership is also intended to facilitate greater community involvement. There is also ongoing reform of the mechanisms for public and patient involvement in health issues. The Police and Justice Act 2006 and the 2006 local government white paper include processes for \\"Community Calls for Action\\", setting out statutory mechanisms by which local residents can formally bring issues of concern to the attention of their local authority and other public sector organisations.

In May 2016, she was sworn in as the Mayor of Islington, having served as a councillor of the borough's St George's Ward since 2013. She was previously president of the National Union of Students, between 2004 and 2006, the first to be elected from a political slate to the left of Labour Students. Early life Born in Sheffield, Fletcher was the General Secretary of Sheffield College's students' union, where she joined the Campaign for Free Education (CFE) and the Alliance for Workers' Liberty, a small Trotskyist group. She later attended the University of Leeds where she studied Social Policy and Education. After studying for two years, she was elected as the NUS National Women's Officer, and subsequently to the NUS Block of Twelve part- time officers. She then returned to Leeds, graduating in 2004. NUS President She was elected president in 2004 in an extremely close contest, which she won by only two votes after six rounds of transfers, having lost the 2003 election by only three votes to the incumbent candidate. Although a long- standing member of the Labour Party, she ran on a leftist platform as a member of the Campaign for Free Education (CFE) criticising the NUS proximity to Tony Blair's Labour government, particularly on the issue of tuition fees. After being elected she pushed through a process of NUS reform which she claimed was necessary to save the organisation from financial crisis. She left the AWL before being elected President; during her first year in office, she disbanded CFE, as a result of reinstating free education policy. It was at this point that the AWL and other left-wing activists such as the CFE's successor organisation Education Not for Sale came into sharp opposition to her. In 2005, she stood for re-election without any description, winning by the largest margin in NUS history. Other candidates standing included: Conservative Future's candidate Michael Champion and the Socialist Workers' Student Society candidate Suzie Wylie. Career After her presidency, Fletcher worked for two years (2006–08) at the Centre for Excellence in Leadership, a government quango in the Further Education sector. Between 2008 and January 2010 she worked as Director of Policy and Development for the 157 Group. In 2010, she started volunteering for Ed Miliband's Labour Leadership Campaign, being subsequently appointed as head of volunteers for the duration of the campaign. Fletcher stood as a Labour candidate at St. George's ward in the London Borough of Islington March 2013 by-election, and was elected as a councillor with relative ease. She was subsequently re-elected in the 2014 Islington London Borough Council election. Fletcher acted as election agent for Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 general election, and was subsequently a part of Corbyn's campaign team when he won the 2015 Labour Party leadership election. In 2015, Fletcher was appointed the Deputy Mayor of Islington. The following year she was sworn in as Mayor, a post she held until May 2017. She selected the Ben Kinsella Trust as her designated charity. In November 2019, she announced her decision to resign from Islington Council. During the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, she worked for Keir Starmer's campaign as Director of Field.

The channel launched as Talktv in 2000, but was not as widely available prior to its relaunch in March 2006. Unlike MTV channels in the U.S. and elsewhere, the channel was restricted in its ability to carry music programming until 2015, due to conditions in the channel's licence issued by the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Thus, the channel never used the \\"Music Television\\" tagline as its international counterparts did prior to 2010. Instead, MuchMusic had been launched in 1984 as the designated Canadian channel dedicated to mainstream music. History =MTV in Canada before 2005= CHUM Limited launched Canadian music channel MuchMusic in 1984, inspired by the success of MTV in the United States. CRTC genre exclusivity restrictions prevented MTV from either bringing its U.S. channel directly into Canada or launching a homegrown competitor. Instead, MuchMusic would acquire Canadian rights to MTV's programming. In October 2001, MTV partnered with Craig Media to launch MTV Canada as a digital cable channel. One of the conditions of licence was that a maximum of 10% of the schedule could be devoted to music videos and music programming. In 2003, CHUM filed a complaint with the CRTC alleging that MTV Canada was airing more music videos and music programming than allowed by its licence and had subsequently become competitive with MuchMusic. In Broadcasting Decision 2003-65, the CRTC found that MTV Canada was offering a music-based service rather than a broadly-based teen channel. Furthermore, the Commission found that MTV was broadcasting in excess of 10% music video clips and that MTV was not meeting its commitment to provide educational programming for teens, nor was it providing any programming from independent educational authorities. Craig was ordered to come into compliance with its broadcasting licence, but after CHUM purchased Craig in 2004, MTV Networks terminated the agreement with Craig as the contract had included a provision to cancel the agreement if there was a change in ownership. MTV Canada was subsequently rebranded as Razer from 2005-2008, when the channel was rebranded as MTV2 on August 1. 2000-2006 logo Meanwhile, Talktv was launched on September 1, 2000 and primarily carried repeats of CTV talk shows. Talktv had been licensed as an analogue channel, allowing cable companies to offer it without requiring a digital converter box, and was one of the last specialty channels to be launched with that status (all specialty channels licensed since 2001 have been specifically limited to digital distribution). However, it was not explicitly required to receive analog carriage either, provided the provider had already launched digital services.Decision CRTC 96-612, September 4, 1996 Due to this, combined with the channel's late launch and cable systems approaching capacity for analog channels, Talktv was only available on digital programming tiers, aside from a handful of major markets such as Toronto. In 2002, the CRTC had granted the channel the right to charge 7¢ per subscriber when carried on basic cable, whereas it was previously made available to these viewers free of charge; the new charge had been expected to help sustain the channel's live programming. ARCHIVED - Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-143 =Relaunch= MTV logo used from 2006 to 2012. On September 28, 2005, CTV and MTV Networks announced that Talktv would be relaunched as a new Canadian incarnation of MTV, while continuing to maintain its licence requirement of \\"documentary programming\\" with over 68% Canadian content. In the September 28 press release, CTV claimed to have applied for a Category 2 licence that would feature music videos, along the lines of the former MTV2 Canada (now Juicebox). Prior to the relaunch, The Globe and Mail reported that the network would \\"... be quite different from what most people associate with the original American MTV, which has increasingly moved away from music videos toward reality shows and other original programming,\\" placing a heavy emphasis on \\"talk and lifestyle shows\\". In a Canadian Press report, it was stated that while there could not be a Canadian version of the music-oriented Total Request Live, other spin-off programs were not out of the question. Canadian versions of MTV Cribs, Diary and Making the Video have already been produced. The relaunch occurred on March 21, 2006, at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time, with the first edition of MTV Live. Beginning in 2013, the channel would begin airing MTV's scripted programming and the MTV Video Music Awards, along with new episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation and its in-house produced aftershow, After Degrassi. Programming MTV carries most of the original programming seen on its U.S. counterpart, though the network's scripted programming (Teen Wolf and Awkward., etc.) and the MTV Video Music Awards did not begin airing on the Canadian channel until 2013. Music-based programming was absent from the channel because the original broadcasting license issued for Talktv did not allow for any music programming. Moreover, Much's previous status as Canada's mainstream music channel (and the accompanying genre protection from direct competition) meant that MTV could not have requested a new format enabling it to compete directly with Much in any event. Since mid-2007, Much and its affiliated channels have been under the same ownership, following CTVglobemedia's acquisition of CHUM Limited, making the former rival networks present-day sister channels. In March 2015, the CRTC announced it would no longer enforce conditions of licence related to programming for most specialty channels other than those primarily airing news or sports. (paragraph 254) By that point, MTV's schedule had begun to emphasize scripted series reruns during the daytime hours, including Canadian-produced shows to fulfill Canadian content quotas. MTV also maintains a Canadian-exclusive web brand called \\"MTV FORA\\", which is dedicated to beauty, fashion, and lifestyle content.

Early life and education Eads was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and named for his mother's cousin, future President of the United States James Buchanan. Eads' father, Thomas C. Eads pursued a fortune to no avail and the family moved several times. Eads grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. The family lost all of their possessions in a steamboat fire as they landed in St. Louis in 1833. Thomas Eads' business ventures in St. Louis failed, and he abandoned his family and moved upriver. James Eads was largely self-educated; at the age of 13, he left school to take up work to help support the family. He sold apples on the streets of St. Louis to help support his sisters and mother, who ran a boardinghouse. One of his first jobs was at the Williams & Duhring dry-goods store run by Barrett Williams. Williams allowed the young Eads to spend time in his library, located above the store. In Eads's spare time, he read books on physical science, mechanics, machinery, and civil engineering. When Eads became successful later in life and Williams suffered hardship, Eads reciprocated Williams' generosity by providing money for Williams' comfort in his old age.  Family  Photograph portrait of Martha Dillon Eads, wife of James B. Eads. Around 1842, Eads fell in love with Martha Dillon, a woman related to him by marriage. Martha's father was Patrick Dillon, a prominent St. Louis businessman. Patrick did not approve of the couple, as he wanted Martha to marry someone with money and influence. In October 1845, James and Martha wed without her father's consent. Martha moved in with Eads' parents in LeClaire, Iowa while Eads stayed behind in St. Louis to set up a glass works. Although their living arrangement was supposed to be temporary, the failure of his glass business made it permanent. Eads had many debts to pay off from the failed business and he went back to working in salvage. Martha died in October 1852 of cholera. She did not live to see Eads become successful. Five years after her death, when Eads retired from working on the river, he had amassed a fortune of $5. Nine years after Martha's death, in 1861, Eads remarried. Fortune When he was twenty-two, Eads designed a salvage boat and showed the drawings to two shipbuilders, Calvin Case and William Nelson. Although Eads had no previous experience and no capital for the project, Case and Nelson were impressed with him and the three became partners. At that time, salvaging wrecks from the Mississippi River was nearly impossible because of strong currents. Eads made his initial fortune in salvage by creating a diving bell, using a wine barrel to retrieve goods sunk in riverboat disasters. He also devised special boats for raising the remains of sunken ships from the river bed. Eads did much of the diving himself because the work was so dangerous. His work gave Eads an intimate knowledge of the river, as he explored its depths from the Gulf of Mexico to Iowa. Because of his detailed knowledge of the Mississippi (the equal of any professional river pilot), his exceptional ability at navigating the most treacherous parts of the river system, and his personal fleet of snag-boats and salvage craft, he was afforded the much prized courtesy title of \\"Captain\\" by the rivermen of the Mississippi and was addressed as Captain Eads throughout his life.How 1900: p. 12. Civil War In 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Eads was called to Washington at the prompting of his friend, Attorney General Edward Bates, to consult on the defense of the Mississippi River.How 1900: pp. 25-26. Eads received \\"a telegram calling him to Washington for consultation on the best method of defending and occupying the Western rivers.\\" Soon afterward, he was contracted to construct the City-class ironclads for the United States Navy, and produced seven such ships within five months:Gunboats on the Mississippi St. Louis, Cairo, Carondelet, , Louisville, Mound City, and Pittsburgh.How 1900: pp. 32-33. He also converted the river steamer New Era into the ironclad Essex. The river ironclads were a vital element in the highly successful Federal offensive into Tennessee, Kentucky and upper Mississippi (February–June, 1862). Eads corresponded frequently with Navy officers of the Western Flotilla, and used their \\"combat lessons learned\\" to improve vessels during post-combat repairs, and incorporate improvements into succeeding generations of gunboats. By the end of the war he would build more than 30 river ironclads. The last were so hardy that the Navy sent them into service in the Gulf of Mexico, where they supported the successful Federal attack on the Confederate port city of Mobile. All senior officers in the Western Theater, including Grant and Sherman, agreed that Eads and his vessels had been vital to early victory in the West. The first four gunboats were built at the Eads' Union Marine Works in Carondelet, Missouri. The next three were built under Eads' contract at the Mound City (Illinois) Marine Railway and Shipyard.\\"Ironclads\\" , St. Louis County, Missouri, US GenNet Eads' vessels were the first United States ironclads to enter combat. On January 11, 1862 the Eads-built ironclads St. Louis and Essex fought the Confederate gunboats CSS General Polk, CSS Ivy, and CSS Jackson at Lucas Bend, on the Mississippi River. Subsequently, on February 6, 1862, Eads' ironclads captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. This was over a month before the combat actions of the ironclads CSS Virginia and USS Monitor during the March 8–9, 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads. During the war, Eads wrote a check to the War Department for $1,000 to help homeless Confederates and Union sympathizers. After the war, he held a fair to raise money for the thousands of homeless refugees in St. Louis. Mississippi River bridge Eads Bridge, St. Louis Eads designed and built the first road and rail bridge to cross the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The Eads Bridge, constructed from 1867 through 1874, was the first bridge of a significant size with steel as its primary material, and it was the longest arch bridge in the world when completed. Eads was the first bridge builder to employ the cantilever method, which allowed steam boat traffic to continue using the river during construction. The bridge is still in use today, carrying both automobile and light rail traffic over the river. The Eads Bridge is the only bridge to be named for its engineer. Mississippi River designs The Mississippi in the 100-mile-plus stretch between the port of New Orleans, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico frequently suffered from silting up of its outlets, stranding ships or making parts of the river unnavigable for a period of time. Eads solved the problem with a wooden jetty system that narrowed the main outlet of the river, causing the river to speed up and cut its channel deeper, allowing year-round navigation. Eads offered to build the jetties first, and charge the government later.Eads Jetties Plaque, Fort Jackson, LA. If he was successful, and the jetties caused the river to cut a channel 30 feet deep for 20 years, the government agreed to pay him $8 million. Eads was successful. The jetty system was installed in 1876 and the channel was cleared in February 1877. Journalist Joseph Pulitzer, who had known Eads for five years, invested $20,000 in this project. A flood in 1890 brought calls for a similar system for the entire Mississippi Valley. A jetty system would prevent the floods by deepening the main channel. However, there were concerns about the ability of water moving through a jetty system to cut out the rock and clay on the river bottom. . The development of navigable channels at the mouth of the Mississippi River made Eads famous. Alternatives to Eads' jetties we developed by leading engineers, integrating innovative technologies and new concepts of ecological design. The patented technologies by Juan Bautista Medici and Lewis M Haupt were never tested by the USAMCE though they may have radically altered the future of the river.Hindle, Richard L. Prototyping the Mississippi Delta: Patents, alternative futures, and the design of complex environmental systems. Journal of Landscape Architecture 12.2 (2017): 32-47. Other work Contemporary illustration of Eads' proposal for an Interoceanic Ship Railway Eads designed a gigantic railway system intended for construction at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which would carry ocean-going ships across the isthmus from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean; this attracted some interest but was never constructed. In 1884 he became the first U.S. citizen awarded the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of the Arts.  Later life and death  Although he came from a humble background, Eads' accomplishments throughout his life earned him wealth and renown. He was so revered that Scientific American proposed that he run for president of the United States. Eads died while on vacation in Nassau, Bahamas, aged 66. Eads and his second wife, Eunice, had moved to New York four years before his death. However, his funeral took place in St. Louis and he was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri in the family vault. Legacy 1888 color lithograph of J. B. Eads, made for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes The towns of Eads, Tennessee; Eads, Colorado; and Port Eads, Louisiana are named for him. U.S. Route 50 through Lawrenceburg, his hometown, is called Eads Parkway in his honor. Eads Street is a street running parallel to U.S. Route 1 Jefferson Davis Highway in Crystal City, Arlington Virginia. In 1920, Eads was added to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans colonnade, located on the grounds of the Bronx Community College in New York. Eads is memorialized at Washington University in St. Louis by James B. Eads Hall, a 19th-century building long associated with science and technology. Eads Hall was the site of Professor Arthur Holly Compton's Nobel Prize–winning experiments in electromagnetic radiation. Today Eads Hall continues to serve Washington University as the site of a number of facilities including the Arts and Sciences Computing Center. Eads Hall was the gift of Captain Eads's daughter Mrs. James Finney How. Each year the Academy of Science of St. Louis awards the James B. Eads Award recognizing a distinguished individual for outstanding achievement in science and technology. Eads is recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 1927, the deans of America's engineering colleges vote Eads one of the top five engineers of all time, an accolade he shared with Leonardo da Vinci, James Watt, Ferdinand de Lesseps, and Thomas A. Edison. Eads' great Mississippi River Bridge at St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1964 and on October 21, 1974 was listed as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also awarded a Special Award of Recognition by the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1974 on the 100th anniversary of its entry into service.

They are also found in smaller numbers in accessory cell groups between these two nuclei, the largest one being the nucleus circularis. There are two types of magnocellular neurosecretory cells, oxytocin-producing cells and vasopressin- producing cells, but a small number can produce both hormones. These cells are neuroendocrine neurons, are electrically excitable, and generate action potentials in response to afferent stimulation. Magnocellular neurosecretory cells in rats (where these neurons have been most extensively studied) in general have a single long varicose axon, which projects to the posterior pituitary. Each axon gives rise to about 10,000 neurosecretory terminals and many axon swellings that store very large numbers of hormone-containing vesicles. These vesicles are released from the axon swellings and nerve terminals by exocytosis in response to calcium entry through voltage-gated ion channels, which occurs when action potentials are propagated down the axons. The cells typically have two or three long dendrites, which also contain large dilations and a very high density of hormone-containing vesicles. Oxytocin and vasopressin can, thus, be released within the brain from these dendrites, as well as into the blood from the terminals in the posterior pituitary gland. However, the release of oxytocin and vasopressin from dendrites is not consistently accompanied by peripheral secretion, as dendritic release is regulated differently. Dendritic release can be triggered by depolarisation, but can also be triggered by the mobilisation of intracellular calcium stores. The dendrites receive most of the synaptic inputs from afferent neurons that regulate the magnocellular neurons; typically a magnocellular neuron receives about 10,000 synapses from afferent neurons.

The Epilimnion Ⅱ. The Metalimnion Ⅲ. The Hypolimnion The scales are used to associate each section of the stratification to their corresponding depths and temperatures. The arrow is used to show the movement of wind over the surface of the water which initiates the turnover in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. The hypolimnion or under lake is the dense, bottom layer of water in a thermally-stratified lake. The word hypolimnion is derived from the Greek \\"limnos\\" meaning \\"lake\\". It is the layer that lies below the thermocline. Typically the hypolimnion is the coldest layer of a lake in summer, and the warmest layer during winter. In deep, temperate lakes, the bottom-most waters of the hypolimnion are typically close to 4 °C throughout the year. The hypolimnion may be much warmer in lakes at warmer latitudes. Being at depth, it is isolated from surface wind-mixing during summer, and usually receives insufficient irradiance (light) for photosynthesis to occur.  Oxygen Dynamics  The deepest portions of the hypolimnion have low oxygen concentrations. In eutrophic lakes, the hypolimnion is often anoxic. Deep mixing of lakes during the fall and early winter allows oxygen to be transported from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion. The cooling of the epilimnion during the fall reduces lake stratification and allows for mixing to occur. The hypolimnion can be anoxic for up to half the year. Anoxia is more common in the hypolimnion during the summer when mixing does not occur. In the absence of oxygen from the epilimnion, decomposition can cause hypoxia in the hypolimnion. = Hypolimnetic Aeration = In eutrophic lakes where the hypolimnion is anoxic, hypolimnetic aeration may be used to add oxygen to the hypolimnion. Adding oxygen to the system through aeration can be costly because it requires significant amounts of energy.

The Hypolimnion The scales are used to associate each section of the stratification to their corresponding depths and temperatures. The arrow is used to show the movement of wind over the surface of the water which initiates the turnover in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. The epilimnion or surface layer is the top- most layer in a thermally stratified lake, occurring above the deeper hypolimnion. It is warmer and typically has a higher pH and higher dissolved oxygen concentration than the hypolimnion. Being exposed at the surface, it typically becomes turbulently mixed as a result of surface wind-mixing. It is also free to exchange dissolved gases such as O2 and CO2 with the atmosphere. Because this layer receives the most sunlight it contains the most phytoplankton. As they grow and reproduce they absorb nutrients from the water; when they die they sink into the hypolimnion resulting in the epilimnion becoming depleted of nutrients.
