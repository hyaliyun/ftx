Sandwiched between Main Street and the Connecticut River, this area was set off from neighboring Middletown in 1851. It is visually dominated by residential structures built before 1810. The area grew as a significant river port and shipbuilding center until the mid-19th century. and The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Middletown Upper Houses area was laid out about 1650, as one of two settlements flanking the mouth of the Little River on the west bank of the Connecticut River. The northern settlement eventually became Cromwell, incorporating out of Middletown (the site of the \\"Lower Houses\\") in 1851. By the mid-18th century, Upper Houses was a thriving seaport, engage in domestic trade and with the West Indies. The maritime trade declined beginning in the 1830s, supported in part by the shipping of brownstone from local quarries. The village was unable to expand due to geographic constraints (it is in the floodplain and surrounded by marshland) and declined in the late 19th century. The historic district includes a small grid of streets sandwiched between Main Street (Connecticut Route 99) and the river. River Street runs parallel to the riverbank, as does Pleasant Street a short way inland. These are joined by School, South, and Wall Streets. There are now relatively few traces of the area's maritime trade history, and the area's isolation gives it the feel of a sleepy residential neighborhood. There are 72 houses in this area, with almost half predating 1820. This concentration of colonial and Federal housing has integrated examples of later architecture, from the Victorian to post-World War II construction. The waterfront includes the remnants of a dock area used for the loading of brownstone.

It consists of five mid-19th century residences, on both sides of the street, and a carriage barn. In 1979 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The houses were built by wealthy residents in the middle of the 19th century, in the Second Empire, Gothic Revival, and Italianate architectural styles, when the area offered a view of the Hudson River to the west. Three were built by Jacob Odell, Tarrytown's first village president, and his descendants. They share some common architectural elements, and have survived relatively intact. Today three remain as private residences while the other two are home to the Tarrytown Historical Society. Geography The district is located at the north end of North Grove Street, immediately south of Neperan Road, two blocks east the commercial buildings of South Broadway (U.S. Route 9), Tarrytown's main artery. To its immediate west is the walkway along the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark. The neighborhood is residential, with most houses built during the 20th century. A large park is across Neperan north of the intersection. The district's terrain is level, with a steep hill rising to the immediate east. The boundaries of the district are formed by the lot lines of the five houses within it. It encloses a area. The houses and the carriage barn are all considered contributing properties; a garage behind 1 North Grove is not. Buildings 1, 15 and 19, all brick, are located on the west side of the street; 2 and 8, both of wood, are opposite. The carriage barn is to the south of 8. alt=A brick house with a peaked tower and red wooden trim, seen from far to its right and illuminated by late-afternoon sun from the left =1 North Grove Street= 1 North Grove Street, at the southwest corner of the Neperan intersection, is a two-story, two-by-three-bay brick house with a flat roof pierced in its rear by a brick chimney. In the middle of the east (front) facade is a three-story tower, and a two-bay two- story projection with wraparound porch extends west from the rear. There is a decorative wrought iron fence along the sidewalk in front of the house, and a detached one-story garage is in the rear. Fenestration consists of single and double one-over-one double-hung sash windows with vertical-board shutters and stone lintels and sills. The porch on the west wing has a wooden guardrail, and on the south side of the wing's second story is a small wooden shed-roofed addition. Just below the roofline are short eyebrow windows; the broad overhanging eave is supported by simple wooden brackets. The main entrance and the window above it on the tower have wooden hoods. The tower itself is topped by a slate-shingled mansard roof pierced on all sides by round-arched dormers. Inside the house retains many of its original finishes, including marble fireplaces. =15 North Grove Street= Two short driveways are located in the open space between 1 and 15 North Grove Street to the south. It, too, is a two-story brick house with flat roof, pierced by a single chimney, and attached tower (albeit on the west elevation). A two-story north wing is faced in simple shingles and a railed porch runs along the east facade, supporting a small deck above it. All windows on 15 are also one-over-one double-hung sash, but with segmental-arched lintels. Some are on the three-sided bay windows that project from both the north and south profiles. The roofline is supported by decorative wooden brackets. The tower is square, joined to the rear at a 45-degree angle. It has several double segmental-arched windows and a flat roof supported by brackets. On the interior are the original spiral staircase and door and window surrounds. =19 North Grove Street= Rounding out the west side of the street is 19 North Grove Street, also a two-story brick house with attached rear tower. It is distinguished from the other house by its three-by-two-bay configuration and low-pitched gable roof pierced by two chimneys with gauged decorative brickwork. An intricately detailed wooden porch runs the length of its west (rear) facade. Windows are one-over-one double-hung sash with round-arched transoms, set singly or doubly. The flanking windows on the second story have small wrought iron balconies. In the center of the first floor is the main entrance, located in a projecting vestibule with a similar round-arched entrance and tiled hipped roof supported by brackets. Different brackets also support the overhanging eave. The tower also has a gabled roof with brackets. Inside are many original finishes, including marble fireplaces and wooden door and window surrounds. It, too, retains the original spiral stair. =8 North Grove Street= Across from 15 is the carriage barn and 8 North Grove Street. It is a wood frame three-by- two-bay house sided in clapboard. Atop is a slate-shingled mansard roof is pierced by three hooded round-arched dormers on the west and a brick chimney on the south end. A railed porch with flat roof runs the length of the west (front) facade. A later two-story kitchen wing extends from the east. The windows are paired one-over-one double-hung sash on the west, single two-over- two on the side profiles and single one-over-one on the kitchen wing. On the north face of the kitchen is a bay window. The broad overhanging eaves of the porch and main roofs are supported by carved modillions. Original interior features include marble fireplaces and simple wooden door and window surrounds. To the southwest, along the sidewalk, is the carriage barn, subsequently converted into an automobile garage. It is a wood frame two-story structure sided in clapboard and topped with a mansard roof shingled in asphalt, pierced by two gabled round-arched dormers set with two-over-two double-hung sash. The other windows are six-over-six. A garage door has been installed as the main entrance. Above it is a second-story loft door set in a larger gabled dormer. =2 North Grove Street= A row of mature trees on the north property line separates 8 from 2 North Grove Street, on the southeast corner of the Neperan Road intersection. Like its southern neighbor, it is a two-story three-bay wood frame house sided in clapboard. Like the brick houses on the other side of the street, it has an attached tower that rises an extra story. The main block has a gable roof shingled in asphalt, complementing the tower's hipped roof with carved brackets. Shutter-flanked double and single round-arched one-over-one sash on some of its faces echoes the fenestration of 19 North Grove Street. Other windows, particularly on the main block's west facade, are rectangular with recessed round-arched panels in their entablatures. A small porch with flat roof supported by two wooden pillars shelters the main entrance, a single door with transom. The interior has heavy molded window and door surrounds. History The oldest of the houses, 1 North Grove Street, was built by Jacob Odell, a successful local merchant who served as Tarrytown's first village president (a precursor to mayor), in 1848. He would later also serve as Greenburgh Town Supervisor. Eight years later the next house, 19 North Grove Street, was built on land formerly part of a large local estate. In 1860, Odell built 15 North Grove Street as a wedding gift for his daughter. The same year Marcus Raymond, a local newspaper editor, built 2 North Grove Street. The last of the houses to be built was 8 North Grove Street, home to three generations of local physicians. The ground floor was used as their office. The houses display a range of the architectural styles popular at the time, from the Italianate mode popular before the Civil War, combined with some elements of the Gothic Revival, to the Second Empire that flourished after the war. They have remained largely unaltered today. Most are still private residences; the Odell House at 1 North Grove is operated by the Historical Society of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow as a historic house museum.

A Texas State Historical Marker was installed in 1968, Marker 3550. Original purchase The league of land was purchased near from what is now Round Top, from Robert Mills by Adelsverein officers Count Ludwig Joseph von Boos-Waldeck and Count Viktor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen, at a cost of seventy-five cents an acre. It was named for the Duke of Nassau, in whose castle the Adelsverein was established. The acreage was developed as a full working plantation by slave labor bought by Count Boos-Waldeck in New Orleans, Galveston, and Houston. When Prince Solms inspected the plantation in 1844, he recommended the Verein divest itself of the property, rather than be associated with slavery. Initially, the plantation had been considered as the primary base for arriving German immigrants, but the immigrants instead went to colonies established by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels and John O. Meusebach. Nassau Plantation became a luxurious noblemen's retreat for representatives of the Adelsverein. Prince Solms enjoyed horse racing and extravagant entertaining on the property. John O. Meusebach resided at Nassau from April to July 1846 to recover his health.King (1967), pp.90,96 One of the early managers of Nassau appointed by Prince Solms was Friedrich W. von Wrede, Sr. from Oberhausen, Germany. On October 24, 1845, Wrede and New Braunfels botanist Oscar von Claren were scalped and killed by Indians while camping about ten miles from Austin. Sale The plantation was mismanaged and operated at a loss. Gustav Dresel, Special Business Agent for the Adelsverein, sold Nassau plantation and its twenty-five slaves on July 28, 1848, to Otto von Roeder.Solms (2000) p.88 Von Roeder, in turn, sold off of undeveloped land and the manor house to fellow Prussian nobleman, Baron Peter Carl Johann von Rosenberg, who immigrated to Texas in 1849 with his family from their estate, Eckitten, near Memel in East Prussia. In 1853, Bexar County district court ordered the Fayette County sheriff to sell the league, to satisfy creditors of the Adelsverein. The sheriff sold the property to James A. Chandler on May 3, 1853. Chandler filed suit for legal title. In June 1868, Chandler recovered judgment.

Formation Around 16 000 years ago, the area surrounding Burn O'Vat was covered by a glacial ice sheet. As the area warmed around 14 000 years ago, the ice sheet began to melt, resulting in a torrent of meltwater that carried with it debris previously caught up in the glacial ice. This debris, consisting of rocks and boulders, is thought likely to be the most important component of the formation of Burn O'Vat. It is thought that a rock, from the meltwater stream, became lodged in a small hollow on the river bed, causing the meltwater to flow around it in a spiralling motion. This spiralling motion caused the bed underneath the rock to erode over a long period of time, creating a feature known as a pothole. View from above the Vat, showing its bowl shape Around 13 500 years ago the volume of meltwater decreased to such a level that the stream began to deposit more than it was eroding. This change resulted in the deposition of sand and gravel into the bottom of the pothole. It is believed that this sediment extends down around 5‚Äì7 metres, below the current ground level, though no-one can be certain of the true value. The pothole, known locally as 'The Vat', measures 18 metres across and 13 metres high, from present ground level. Approximately 12 000 years ago, the entrance to the vat was exposed when the rock in front of it was undercut by the same stream that formed the vat, albeit in the form of a waterfall. The Vat Burn The Vat burn is the stream which resulted in the formation of the vat, and which now runs through it. The source of the burn lies 1.2 kilometres east of the vat on Culblean Hill. The burn flows due east, through the vat, to its mouth at Loch Kinord. The burn is 2.2 kilometres in length, with an average width of 2.7 metres. Image:vat_burn_upper_course.JPGTypical view of the Vat Burn in its Upper Course Image:vat_lower_course.JPGTypical view of the Vat Burn in its Lower Course History of the Vat According to local folklore, the cave behind the waterfall in the vat was used by Rob Roy, a notorious outlaw, to hide from the authorities. In fact, this is not true, with the cave instead being used as a hiding place for Patrick Gilroy Macgregor, an outlaw renowned for his exploits in Deeside during the 17th century and a possible relative of Rob Roy. *Video of Gilderoy and the Burn O'Vat (2018) The Vat Today In modern times, the Vat has become a popular tourist attraction, offering many walks around the area, as well as into the Vat itself.

He graduated from the Prince of Wales College, Jammu. He received his law degree from the Lahore Law College and started his career as a lawyer in Jammu. He was offered a position of Sub-Judge but he refused to serve the Dogra Raj. He reorganized the socio-political organization Young Men‚Äôs Muslim Association, which was established earlier in 1909 and was the only platform that Muslims were using to raise their political voice in Jammu and Kashmir. This organization conducted some massive demonstrations against the Dogra rule and its activities. In order to safeguard the rights of the Muslims of the Valley of Kashmir, another organization, All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was established. Its president was Sheikh Abdullah while Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas was elected as its secretary general. Later the organization was renamed as Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. But when Sheikh Abdullah developed his association with Nehru and the All India National Congress, Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas withdrew from the National Conference. Consequently, the Muslim Conference was revived under the leadership of Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas and Agha Shaukat Ali. The Muslim Conference demanded Kashmir affiliation to Pakistan on 19 July 1947. Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas campaigned for the affiliation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan. He arrived in Pakistan after the transfer of prisoners in 1948 when the ceasefire in the Kashmir conflict took effect and served the Azad Kashmir government till 1951.

Stace that lays out his philosophy of mysticism and compiles writings on mystical experience from across religious traditions. The book‚Äôs comprehensive selections met with broadly positive responses. Synopsis An introductory chapter lays out Stace‚Äôs philosophy and psychology of mysticism. He defines the principal characteristic of mystical experience as \\"the apprehension of an ultimate nonsensuous unity in all things\\",Stace, Walter Terence (1960), The Teachings of the Mystics, p. 14, New American Library, and differentiates it from occult, parapsychological phenomena, visions, voices, and anything \\"misty\\" or vague. Stace distinguishes between two types of mystical experience: extrovertive mysticism experiences unity in the world through the physical senses, while an introvertive type experiences unity in the self. Stace sees introvertive mysticism as more important and the focus of The Teachings of the Mystics. He proposes that there is a core to mystical experience, which is more basic and important than superficial differences over time and across cultures. This hypothesis can only be justified by a survey of mystics‚Äô descriptions of their experiences ‚Äì the book purports to be that.Stace, W. T. (1960), p. 14. Stace chooses texts that describe mystical experience, rather than interpret or analyse it. Hindu mysticism Stace selects from the Chandogya Upanishad, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Svetasvatara Upanishad, and Sri Aurobindo‚Äôs book The Life Divine.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 30-66. Buddhist mysticism Stace selects from the Udana on Nirvana, the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya and the Majjhima Nikaya from the Hinayana school. Mahayana selections are taken from The Awakening of Faith by A≈õvagho·π£a, the Maha Prajna Paramita Hridaya and the Diamond Sutra. Zen is represented by DT Suzuki on Satori, Eugen Herrigel on the Koan and satori.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 67-101. Taoist mysticism Selections are taken from Laozi‚Äôs Tao Te Ching,Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 102-109. Plotinus Enneads selected include those that describe The Ascent to Union with the One.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 110-123. Christian mysticism Selections are taken from Dionysius the Areopagite‚Äôs The Divine Names and Mystical Theology, various Meister Eckhart sermons, Jan van Ruysbroeck‚Äôs The Adornment of Spiritual Marriage and The Book of Supreme Truth, excerpts from The Life of St. Theresa and The Interior Castle by St Theresa of Avila, and from The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 126-200. Islamic mysticism Mystics represented include Abu Said Ibn al Arabi's Kitab al-Wajd, Abu Yazid Al Bistami, Ibn Sina (Avicena), Farid al-Din Attar‚Äôs The Conference of the Birds, Ibn al-Arabi, and Jalal al-Din Rumi.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 201-2. Jewish mysticism Stace quotes Gershom Scholem, the leading authority on Jewish mysticism, writing that union with God is extremely rare in Judaism, although there are some instances of this in Abraham Abulafia and some later Hasidism. None the less, Stace finds quotes from The Zohar.Stace, W. T. (1960), pp. 221-229. After laying out the contemporary mystical experiences of Arthur Koestler in his book The Invisible Writing, Stace in his final chapter rounds up his conclusions drawn over the course of the book and looks to the future of mysticism. Critical response The Teachings of the Mystics was seen as a useful historical overview of the central ideas of mysticism,Hick, John, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 59, No. 5 (March 1, 1962), pp. 135‚Äì136. and despite losing something in translation between experience and authorship is never tedious.Kiley, Frederick S., The Clearing House, Vol. 35, No. 7 (March 1961), p. 444. For Huston Smith, the book could be seen as a companion volume to Stace‚Äôs more academic work, Mysticism and Philosophy, although representing his ideas at an earlier stage. The Teachings of the Mystics helps overcome the difficulty that many readers experience with understanding the writings of mystics by its use of clear introductions and brief selections. However, Stace does not spell out his concept of the \\"universal core\\" of mysticism precisely enough.Huston Smith, Walter, \\"Mysticism and Modern Perspective\\", Philosophy East and West, Vol. 14, No. 1, (April 1964), pp. 59‚Äì65. Writing in Mind, Thomas McPherson regarded the book as a by-product of Mysticism and Philosophy and, despite quibbling over a few selections, he concluded the book‚Äôs introductory essay was useful and the selections sensible.McPherson, Thomas, \\"Review of Mysticism and Philosophy and Teachings of the Mystics\\", Mind n.s. 71, 1962, p. 566.

The Shooting Range Gardens) is a small public park in the heart of the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark. Its name refers to the former shooting range of the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society which used to be located on the site. The most distinctive feature of the park is the Neo-Gothic Shooting Range Wall which was constructed in 1887 to shield traffic on Istedgade from stray bullets. The other end of the park is bounded by the rear of the former headquarters of the Shooting Society, a Neoclassical mansion which has more recently housed the Museum of Copenhagen. Access to the park is either through a small gate in the Shooting Range Wall, through an unassyming gate next to Absalonsgade 14 (off Vesterbrogade), or a third gate at the northeastern and of Matth√¶usgade. The section of the park located closest to Istedgade is occupied by a public playground. The Vesterbrogade ned of the park is dominated by lawns and flower beds. History =The Shooting Society's shooting range= The shooting range, 1830 The Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society was originally based in Kompagnistr√¶de. The Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society's building, 1888 In the 1750s, it established a shooting range at a site outside the Western City Gate. In 1782 the society acquired a 3.5 hectare piece of land, stretching from present day Vesterbrogade to the beach just south of the city. The society also built a mansion, completed in 1787, which was to serve as a venue for its active social life. The shooting range with the new Shooting Range Wall in the 1880s When Vesterbro started to develop in the second half of the 19th century, after the city had been allowed to develop beyond its now decommissioned fortifications, the City expropriated much of the Shooting Society's grounds. In 1887 a tall wall was constructed to shield newly established Istedgade from stray bullets from the shooting range. The wall was designed by the architect Ludvig Knudsen in a Neo-Gothic style. Knudsen also modernized the interior of the Shooting Society's mansion in the 1890s and added a small new wing towards the gardens. =A municipal park= In 1949 the Society moved to S√∏lyst Manor at Klampenborg north of Copenhagen, while the City acquired the rest of the property on Vesterbrogade.

It was located in Palermo, New Jersey, north of Sea Isle City, in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. It was closed in 1970. History In 1948 USAF directed Air Defense Command (ADC) to take radar sets out of storage for operation in the Northeastern United States. By August. a radar had been placed in operation at Palermo, NJ.Winkler & Webster, p. 17 This hasty program was appropriately named \\"Lashup.\\"Winkler & Webster, p.3 The AN/TPS-1B long-range search radar at Palermo (Lashup Site L-14) fed into a primitive control center established at Roslyn Air Warning Station, New York. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of additional stations, and it received the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction of Palermo Air Force Station. The 770th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron was activated to control the site.Cornett & Johnson, p. 166 Because of difficulties with new production radar equipment, Palermo AFS initially received radar equipment from the former Lashup site to expedite operational status. Thus it was designated as site LP-54, and initially the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1951 AN/CPS-5 and AN/TPS-10A height-finder radars were added to the site. By April 1952 the 770th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was operating AN/CPS-4 and AN/FPS-3 radars. In the spring of 1957, Palermo was one of the first to deploy an AN/FPS-20 radar. Palermo also received two AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars at this time. During 1958 Palermo AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-01 at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 770th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 Oct 1958. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By late 1959 this station also was performing air traffic control duties. On October 1, 1961, the 770th Radar Squadron and the site designation (RP-54) left for Fort Meade, Maryland. The Palermo site was then operated by Detachment 1 of the New York Air Defense Sector and designated as site RP-63C. This unit was replaced by the 680th Radar Squadron in 1962Cornett & Johnson, p. 160 and the P-54 site designation returned to Palermo in 1963. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-54, and later the AN/FPS-20 was upgraded into an AN/FPS-65 radar. In 1968 one AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was retired. I was stationed at Palermo from 1968 until it closed in 1970, and I worked in the \\"6 shop\\" ‚Äì and both FPS-6 height finders were in operation until just before the site closed. The 680th was inactivated and the Air Force closed the facility in May 1970. Palermo's GATR (Ground Air Transmitter Receiver) site (R-28) remained active until 1975, becoming a detachment of the 770th Radar Squadron at Fort Meade, Maryland. The housing reportedly was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard after site closed. For many years, the site was abandoned and overgrown, with deteriorating buildings and former radar towers dominating the site. Palermo AFS was demolished in 2003 and was redeveloped into the \\"Osprey Point\\" single- family housing development, with no evidence of the former military radar station.

Opened in 1883, it is located on the Termoli‚ÄìVenafro railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state- owned rail company. Location Campobasso railway station is situated at Piazza Vincenzo Cuoco, close to the city centre. History The platform side of the passenger building The station was opened on 5 August 1883, upon the inauguration of the Baranello‚ÄìCampobasso section of the Termoli‚ÄìVenafro railway and the Benevento‚ÄìCampobasso railway. Features The station has a passenger building arranged on multiple levels. It houses the ticket office, waiting room, a kiosk, a restaurant and the headquarters of the Railway Police. The station is attended, and therefore has a room for the management of train movements. In the station yard are three through tracks used for passenger services. These tracks are served by two platforms and connected by a pedestrian underpass. There are other tracks passing through the goods yard, which is equipped with a detached workshop. The station also has a goods shed and locomotive depot. Passenger and train movements The station has about one million passenger movements each year. The majority of the passengers use the Termoli‚ÄìVairano railway; the Benevento‚ÄìCampobasso railway has relatively little traffic. All passenger trains passing through the station stop there. The station is also the originating or terminating point of many trains. The main destinations are Termoli, Roma Termini, Napoli Centrale, Benevento and Pescara Centrale.

He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1994 and reader in 1995. In 1997 he joined the University of Sheffield's Department of Chemistry as a Professor of Physical Chemistry, becoming Head of Department from 1999 until 2004. He also served as Director of the University's Polymer Centre from 2000 until 2008, when he became Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Faculty of Science, a post he held until 2016. Ryan has been a Visiting Professor at the London College of Fashion, University of The Arts since 2009 and an Honorary Professor at Nanjing Tech University since 2014. In the 2006 New Year Honours, he was appointed Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to Science.Chemistry World, January 2006 Chemistry World ed-board member gets gong Ryan's chemistry research is based around phase transitions in polymers. He cites his main contribution to the field of polymer chemistry as the development and application of the techniques of time-resolved structural tools to polymers. This work won prizes in 1990 from the Plastics and Rubber Institute, in 1992, 1999 and 2003 from the Royal Society of Chemistry and in 1999 from the Polymer Processing Society. Ryan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC). As leader of the University of Sheffield's programme of sustainability research and Director of the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, Ryan's focus is on \\"the global challenge of the food, water and energy nexus, feeding a growing world population, reducing the impacts of agriculture and food production that account for 25-30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and harnessing the power of the sun for food production and renewable energy\\". = Project Sunshine and the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures = Upon becoming Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the University of Sheffield, Ryan spearheaded Project Sunshine, which brought together a number of areas of scientific research under the umbrella of sustainability. The project's stated aim was to \\"harness the power of the sun to tackle the biggest challenge facing the world today: meeting the increasing food and energy needs of the world‚Äôs population in the context of an uncertain climate and global environment change\\". Project Sunshine expanded into areas of engineering and social sciences and two cohorts of interdisciplinary PhD students were recruited to a Project Sunshine Centre for Doctoral Training. This work led to a book, 'Project Sunshine: How science can use the sun to fuel and feed the world', co-authored by Ryan and Steve McKevitt, and published in 2013 by Icon Books. It was republished in paperback in 2014 as 'The Solar Revolution: One World. One Solution. Providing the Energy and Food for 10 Billion People'. On 26 August 2014, the University of Sheffield announced it had received a ¬£2.6m donation from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment to found the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, with funds matched by the University itself. The Grantham Centre, with Ryan as Director, builds on the work of Project Sunshine through an interdisciplinary PhD training programme that gives students (known as 'Grantham Scholars') the skills to become sustainability advocates, as well as experts in their particular fields of research. The Grantham Centre supports sustainability research at the University of Sheffield and Ryan represented the Grantham Centre at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015. = Arts collaborations = Ryan's arts collaborations include:  Wonderland  In 2005, Ryan began working with Professor Helen Storey from the Centre of Sustainable Fashion, London College of Fashion. Together they conceived the exhibition Wonderland to examine plastic packaging and explore new approaches to how it could be used and disposed of. The exhibition was hosted in London, Belfast and Sheffield throughout 2008. The 'Disappearing Dresses' from the exhibition went on to appear at the Royal Academy of Arts, London and toured Europe as part of the Futurotextiles exhibition in 2010/2011. A later exhibition, Plastic Is Precious: It's Buried Sunshine, explored similar themes with a focus on plastic shopping bags, and was held at Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield in 2013.  Catalytic Clothing  In 2010, Ryan and Storey launched Catalytic Clothing, to show how a photocatalyst that breaks down air borne pollutants could be applied to clothing and textiles, to improve air quality. The first Catalytic Clothing exhibition, Herself, featured a couture textile sculpture and was first show in Sheffield in October 2010, before appearing as part of Newcastle ScienceFest in 2011. It was shown in Dubai in 2012 and toured France in 2013. A second exhibition, Field of Jeans, applied the photocatalyst to pairs of denim jeans, to illustrate how it could be used in everyday life. The exhibition appeared in Sheffield, Newcastle and London, and was developed into A Field of Jeans and Kilts for the Edinburgh International Science Festival before appearing at Manchester Science Festival in 2012.  In Praise of Air  Building on the concept of Catalytic Clothing, in 2014 Ryan worked with the poet and University of Sheffield colleague Simon Armitage to prepare a 10 meter by 20 meter size poster coated with microscopic, pollution eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. The giant poster hung from the side of the Alfred Denny Building at the University and absorbed the toxic emissions from around 20 cars each day. The poster was unveiled at the University's spoken word festival Lyric and featured a poem by Armitage written especially for the project, 'In Praise Of Air'.Nanotechnology to gobble up pollution = Media work = Ryan has worked extensively as a science communicator and commentator, and in 2002, he presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures. The series of five lectures was titled Smart Stuff and polymer chemistry was the underlying theme. The individual lectures were: * The spider that spun a suspension bridge * The trainer that ran over the world * The phone that shrank the planet * The plaster that stretches life * The ice cream that will freeze granny In 2005, Ryan became the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's first Senior Media Fellow and has remained a regular commentator on science and sustainability issues in the media. He has appeared on BBC Radio 4 programmes including Start the Week, Material World, In Our Time and The Infinite Monkey Cage, and was the subject of a 2012 episode of The Life Scientific.

Description This plant is decumbent - as its name suggests - and its long, thin branches sprawl for up to 1 meter along the ground and over the rocky outcrops where it grows. Its bright scarlet flowers appear on and off throughout the year, regardless of season, though usually in January and December. The individual flowers are brightly coloured and large like those of A. ciliaris. However they appear only very sparsely on the relatively small, thin inflorescence. They also share the long, slender perianth of A. gracilis - not A. ciliaris's green-tinted and constricted opening to the perianth. Stem and foliage detail Natural distribution Aloiampelos decumbens survives in small, isolated pockets growing in coarse sandstone sands, on cliffs and steep slopes in the Langeberg mountain range of the Western Cape, South Africa. Of the eight isolated sub-populations, one exists as far west as the vicinity of Swellendam, and one population is protected in the Boosmansbos Wilderness Area. It is possible that further undiscovered populations survive in the remote and inaccessible Cape Fold mountains.http://redlist.sanbi.org/species.php?species=2206-103 Taxonomy This plant is sometimes described as being merely an isolated subspecies of Aloiampelos gracilis which occurs much further east in the area around Port Elizabeth. Aloiampelos decumbens is also clearly a close relative of Aloiampelos juddii which similarly occurs only in an isolated pocket of fynbos vegetation, further west near Cape Agulhas.

Description The town was inhabited from 1910 to 1920. The community has the name of George W. Victor, a postal worker. History Victor was established in 1910, when a burst dam treated the soil near Desert Lake with alkaline water, preventing farming. Residents of Desert Lake, a town located near the lake, had to relocate to a more fertile area in order to continue farming. They chose a spot east of Elmo. The town was soon named Victor. Homes and a schoolhouse were built in town. Farming was more difficult at Victor, because the area was much drier than Desert Lake. Sand dunes located near the town were often blown by wind onto farmland and the surrounding buildings. In 1920, the continuous lack of rain caused the residents of Victor to leave.

He is mentioned in the History of the Wars of Procopius, as well as in the Annales of Marcellinus Comes.. Biography In 537 AD, Cottistis was serving in the Byzantine army as an infantry soldier. He was stationed at Dara, where he started a military revolt against Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). He was likely declared emperor, because the sources describe his as a \\"tyrant\\", which was the term often used for usurper emperors. He was killed in battle four days following the start of his rebellion. According to the 6th-century historian Procopius: \\"In the city of Daras the following event took place. There was a certain John there serving in a detachment of infantry; this man, in conspiracy with some few of the soldiers, but not all, took possession of the city, essaying to make himself tyrant. Then he established himself in a palace as if in a citadel, and was strengthening his tyranny every day. And if it had not happened that the Persians were continuing to keep peace with the Romans, irreparable harm would have come from this affair to the Romans. But as it was, this was prevented by the agreement which had already been reached, as I have said.\\"Procopius. Persian War, 26.5‚Äì26.12. The agreement mentioned by Procopius was the Eternal Peace of 532, which was signed at the end of the Iberian War. The rebellion took place during a period of cooperation between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires, the two great powers of the Middle East. Justinian was focusing his resources on his wars of reconquest against the Vandals and in Italy against the Goths, neglecting the defences of the Byzantine Empire in the East... Procopius continues: \\"On the fourth day of the tyranny some soldiers conspired together, and by the advice of Mamas, the priest of the city, and Anastasius, one of the notable citizens, they went up to the palace at high noon, each man hiding a small sword under his garment. And first at the door of the courtyard they found some few of the body-guards, whom they slew immediately. Then they entered the men's apartment and laid hold upon the tyrant; but some say that the soldiers were not the first to do this, but that while they were still hesitating in the courtyard and trembling at the danger, a certain sausage- vendor who was with them rushed in with his cleaver and meeting John smote him unexpectedly. But the blow which had been dealt him was not a fatal one, this account goes on to say, and he fled with a great outcry and suddenly fell among these very soldiers. Thus they laid hands upon the man and immediately set fire to the palace and burned it, in order that there might be left no hope from there for those making revolutions; and John they led away to the prison and bound. And one of them, fearing lest the soldiers, upon learning that the tyrant survived, might again make trouble for the city, killed John, and in this way stopped the confusion.

Until Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration (Norges Handelsh√∏yskole) in Bergen was established in 1936, Oslo Commerce School provided the highest level of commercial education available in Norway. The number of pupils has increased steadily since then, especially after a 1950 reform gave economics and commerce courses the same recognition as the traditional high school subjects, and provided the right for its graduates to study at universities and colleges. This avenue of entry to post-secondary studies became popular, and after a few years many traditional upper secondary schools began offering programs in economics and commerce as well. The first students for the new Arts and Sciences curriculum began studies in 1977; the first class graduated in 1980. When Frogner Upper Secondary School closed, 13 class groups studying commerce and office/clerical programs transferred to Oslo Commerce School; the remaining students transferred to Hartvig Nissen School. From the 2002-03 school year, the school has included programs in training for the service sector, for the travel industry, for transport and logistics and for information technology. In addition, the school caters to special-needs students and offers two preparatory class groups for minority- language students. School library The school library has some 9,000 books, including both fiction and non-fiction subjects, and subscribes to three newspapers and several journals. The library has sections for poetry and novels, as well as audiobooks and foreign-language fiction in English, French, Spanish and German.Mer om biblioteket ved OHG, Oslo Kommune Utdanningsetaten.

Later, before the present building at Parkveien 65 was completed in 1946, the school's pupils were housed at Munchsgaten 4. The original school had been used as a command center for the occupying Germans during World War II. The Germans added a bunker, which is today used as a museum. The current building was designed by the architectural partners Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas and was largely financed through private funds and donations.

Chemrec's technology for second generation biofuels has in the European Community's Sixth Framework Programme project RenewRENEW website been shown to yield lower production cost than any other studied technology.RENEW Final report EUCAR / Concawe / JRC's Well-to-Wheels analysis of future automotive fuels and powertrains in the European context shows that methanol and DME produced via black liquor gasification has extremely high well-to-wheels efficiency and very high greenhouse gas reduction. The world's first BioDME plant was inaugurated in Pite√• on Sept 9, 2010.Chemrec press release September 9, 2010 On January 26, 2011, the European Union's Directorate-General for Competition approved the Swedish Energy Agency's award of 500 million Swedish kronor (approx. ‚Ç¨56M as at January 2011) toward the construction of a 3 billion Swedish kronor (approx. ‚Ç¨335M) industrial scale experimental development biofuels plant at the Domsj√∂ Fabriker biorefinery complex in √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, Sweden, using Chemrec's black liquor gasification technology.EU press release IP/11/67 dated 26/11/2011 This represents the largest public award ever to an EU second generation biofuels project.Swedish Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications press release January 26, 2011 (in Swedish) The Pite√• plant was closed down permanently due to financial problems in 2016Article in NyTeknik April 2016: Biobr√§nsleanl√§ggning l√§ggs ner Chemrec was for three consecutive years ranked as one of the top 100 global greentech companies by the Cleantech Group and AlwaysOn (see Awards). History Installation of the BioDME synthesis towers at Chemrec's pilot facility in Pite√•, Sweden, on May 23, 2010 Chemrec's technology originated in the mid-80's with an invention by Jan-Erik Kignell who was awarded the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences' Gold Medal for this feat in 1993.Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences website (in Swedish) Kignell sold his black liquor gasification patent to the Swedish ball bearing company SKF that worked on gasification in the late 1980s, but concluded that the technology related to black liquor was too far removed from the company's core business, upon which the inventors Nils Bernhard and Lars Stigsson acquired the patents in 1989 and founded Chemrec (an abbreviation of CHEMical RECovery) to exploit the technology. In 1990 Kvaerner bought Chemrec and remained the sole owner until 2000. When Kvaerner experienced financial difficulties and divested several non-core businesses in 2000 Babcock Borsig acquired a majority position in Chemrec. Babcock Borsig filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and Nykomb Synergetics, at the time a minority owner, acquired Chemrec from the bankruptcy estate. In 2003-2006 Nykomb Synergetics was the sole owner. During the period from 1990 Chemrec developed a series of pilot plants for first generation atmospheric air-blown gasifiers. In 1996 the first full-scale commercial gasifier with this technology was delivered to Weyerhaeuser's New Bern plant in a collaboration between Chemrec and the U.S. DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division.Biomass Program - Advancement of High Temperature Black Liquor Gasification Technology EERE website Concurrently Chemrec initiated development of second generation pressurized oxygen-blown technology based on operating experience and new patents. A pilot plant using this technology is today in continuous use adjacent to Smurfit Kappa's plant in Pite√•, Sweden. Within the \\"BioDME\\" project, supported by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the Swedish Energy Agency, Chemrec built the world's first pilot plant for synthesis of BioDME adjacent to the gasification pilot plant in Pite√•, with production start early in 2010.BioDME Project website In 2009 the Swedish Energy Agency awarded Chemrec a grant of SEK 500 million towards the construction of a SEK 3 billion industrial scale experimental development biofuels plant at the Domsj√∂ Fabriker biorefinery complex in √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, Sweden. The grant was approved by EU's Directorate- General for Competition on January 26, 2011, following assessment of the project under the EU framework for State aid for research and development and innovation.  Technology  = Black liquor properties = Black liquor sample Black liquor is a biomass feedstock with unique properties. First of all, it is available at existing industrial sites in large quantities.C. Higman, M. van der Burgt, Elsevier, Gasification 2003, Secondly it is a liquid. This makes it possible to easily feed it by pumping into the pressurized gasifier. With biomass in solid or pulverized form this becomes significantly more difficult. The liquid state also makes the black liquor easy to atomize into a fine mist that reacts very quickly in the gasifier. Thirdly, the gasification of black liquor char is more rapid than for any other feedstock as the inherently high sodium and potassium content of black liquor acts as a catalyst. These properties makes it possible to apply the high temperature, entrained flow gasification principle to black liquor. This type of gasification process provides many advantages over alternative gasification technologies: * It is a very rapid, single-stage gasification process with low reactor volume * It minimizes the need for raw syngas clean- up as the Chemrec process directly provides a raw syngas of excellent quality with # Complete carbon conversion # No tar formation # Low methane content For all practical purposes sodium-based sulfite liquor, the sulfite process equivalent of black liquor, is equally or even better suited for gasification. = Investment cost and energy efficiency = Black liquor gasification fulfills two investment-intensive duties with a single process; it provides the pulp mill with needed black liquor recovery capacity at the same time as it produces syngas for biofuels production. In this way the total investment demand decreases. The Chemrec gasification process had a substantially higher thermal efficiency than the process it replaces - the Tomlinson recovery boiler. The location within a pulp mill complex provided benefits. First, environmental permitting was generally easier than for a greenfield industrial activity. Secondly, the pulp mill infrastructure for raw material supply, utilities and energy reuse further reduced investment and provided the opportunity for net energy cost reduction.  Products  A300 Booster The 300 tons/day atmospheric air-blown unit increases pulp production through improved black liquor recovery capacity and flexibility in chemical recovery. The A300 Booster is installed in parallel with the mill‚Äôs existing recovery boiler. A significant benefit of this system is that it can be installed while the recovery boiler continues to operate, thus avoiding down time and lost production.Chemrec web site OX300 Booster The OX300 atmospheric oxygen-blown Booster not only increases the black liquor recovery capacity but also produces a fuel gas suitable as lime kiln fuel. In this way lime kiln fuel costs and the mill carbon footprint can be significantly reduced. P500 Expansion Unit The 500 tons/day pressurized oxygen-blown unit offers mills additional capacity and increased yield, while producing significant volumes of sustainable, low-carbon biofuels. P2000 Replacement Unit The 2000 tons/day pressurized oxygen-blown unit replaces recovery boilers entirely, granting improved pulp yield, while producing significant volumes of sustainable, low- carbon biofuels. P2000 Combined Cycle Unit The 2000 tons/day pressurized unit oxygen-blown replaces recovery boilers entirely, granting improved pulp yield, while doubling ‚Äúgreen power‚Äù production.

Salo night school offers high school level education for adults and students of the primary high school.  History  In the year of 2005 the facilities on the Kaheri site were finished and the two former upper secondary schools of Salo (Hermanni and Lauri) were combined. The new school was established due to many years of lack of space. Lauri and Hermanni upper secondary schools used to work in the same space as the junior highs with the same names. The number of students increased year by year. = Building = Salo upper secondary school is a modern ivory colored building on the outskirts of Salo center. It has 33 classes all of them equipped with modern AV technology: VHS-DVD recorders, WolfVision documentary cameras, video projectors and computers. There is also an increasing number of Smart Boards. The hall is the first thing to be entered when coming to the building from the main entrance. Immediately to the right there is the cafeteria and on the left there are the racks and the school office along with the auditorium. Behind the racks there are the arts and music classes. In front of the entrance there is the janitor's office. From beside the janitor's office there is a pair of staircases leading to the upper and lower levels. The stairs going to the lower level leads to the gym and science and math classes. On the same level as the cafeteria there are the language classes. On the upper level there are the humanitarian sciences and Finnish. Also the library, multimedia class and separate study booths are in the upper level. Most of the classes expand to the left side of the building. The yard consists of a volleyball court, a garden and two parking lots: one pointing towards Kisko and one towards Perni√∂. The garden is designed to portray our solar system.  Academics  Salo upper secondary school concentrates on general education. It coaches its students to get through baccalaureate needed to become a university student. In the teaching technology, internationality, self-expression and entrepreneurship are used as basic tools. The school has a special musical program that collaborates with the musical classes in junior high. There are also special courses for athletes: ice hockey, Finnish baseball, basketball, soccer and volleyball. There is a possibility to complete music, arts and athletic diplomas that have a positive effect while applying to university or polytechnic.

It was defined as the least inclusive clade containing Aetosaurus ferratus, Rauisuchus tiradentes, Prestosuchus chiniquensis, and Crocodylus niloticus (the living Nile crocodile) by Nesbitt (2011). Generally the only pseudosuchian group which is omitted from Suchia is the family Ornithosuchidae, although at least one analysis classifies ornithosuchids as close relatives of erpetosuchids (which are usually considered suchians) and aetosaurs (which are suchians by definition of the group). Phytosaurs are also excluded from Suchia, although it is unclear whether they qualify as pseudosuchians in the first place. There is some controversy over which traits, if any, can be used to distinguish suchians from non-suchian archosaurs. Anatomical features which evolve at the base of a group, and can thus be used to characterize the group, are known as synapomorphies. The two most comprehensive recent studies on archosaur relationships, Nesbitt (2011) and Ezcurra (2016), each came to different conclusions on what synapomorphies characterize Suchia. Nevertheless, they did agree on one trait that likely qualified as a synapomorphy of Suchia: a calcaneal tuber which was significantly wider than it was tall.  Description  As Suchia is a clade, it is defined by relationships rather than shared characteristics between its members. However, several traits are found in most suchians but not in ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, or other archosaurs and archosaur relatives, so they can be used to help determine whether a reptile is a suchian or not. These traits are spread out throughout the body, but different paleontologists disagree on whether they were true synapomorphies (derived distinguishing features). While Benton & Clark (1988) found numerous characteristics for the clade later renamed Suchia, Paul Sereno's 1991 study on archosaur relationships argued that many of them were also present in ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, or avemetatarsalians, so they could not be considered traits which diagnose Suchia (under his definition of the group). Instead, Sereno listed a single synapomorphy for Suchia. The postorbital- squamosal bar, which separates the upper and lower temporal fenestrae at the rear part of the skull, is short. This has the effect of making the lower temporal fenestra triangular in shape. However, Sereno also noted that this feature was not present in Prestosuchus, which he excluded from the group. Later studies found support for a placement of Prestosuchus deep within Suchia, so Sereno's synapomorphy is likely invalid. = Nesbitt (2011)'s synapomorphies = The left calcaneum (heel bone) of Batrachotomus, showing several of the calcaneal features Nesbitt (2011) considered to be synapomorphic for Suchia Sterling Nesbitt's major 2011 analysis of early archosaurs found several more stable syapomorphies of Suchia. The jugal (cheek bone, below the eye) has a low, rounded longitudinal ridge in suchians, contrasting with other archosaurs which typically have no ridge, or a sharp ridge instead. As is the case for many early archosaurs, the structure of the calcaneum (outer heel bone) is important for diagnosing Suchia. This bone connects to both the fibula (outer shin bone) and astragalus (inner ankle bone) by means of two distinct surfaces, the convex fibular condyle and the concave astragalar facet. In other archosaurs, these surfaces are continuous, rather than separate. Moreover, the fibular condyle is hemicylindrical (half- cylinder shaped) in contrast to the more spherical structure of ornithosuchids, avemetatarsalians, and archosaur relatives such as Euparkeria and proterochampsians. A hemicylindrical fibular condyle is also present in phytosaurs, likely convergently. Lastly, the rear edge of the calcaneum has a backwards-extending tube of bone known as a calcaneal tuber. In early archosauriforms, the calcaneal tuber was taller than wide, while later archosaurs and archosaur relatives had a calcaneal tuber which was circular in cross-section. Suchians take this one step further, as early members of the group had calcaneal tubers which were much wider than tall. Although bipedal poposauroids and most loricatans (Luperosuchus and crownward) had circular calcaneal tubers, these features were likely reversions, since the earliest poposauroids (Qianosuchus, for example) and loricatans (Batrachotomus) retained wide calcaneal tubers. Some suchians have a shallow longitudinal groove on the rear edge of the radius (inner forearm bone), although the distribution of this characteristic is poorly understood. Likewise, some early suchians have a triangular medial condyle of the femur (thigh bone), but this characteristic is also known in some archosaur relatives so it is unclear whether the presence of the trait in suchians was a synapomorphy or a plesiomorphy (\\"primitive\\" trait retained from an earlier ancestor). In addition, most loricatans reverted to the state present in other archosaurs: a rounded medial condyle. Many of Nesbitt (2011)'s suchian synapomorphies are not present in Nundasuchus, an unusual crurotarsan sometimes considered a suchian close to Ticinosuchus and Paracrocodylomorpha. = Ezcurra (2016)'s synapomorphies = The skull of Gracilisuchus. Note the rounded ridge on the jugal bone beneath the eye (one of Nesbitt [2011]'s synapomorphies) visible in A, and the posterodorsal process of the maxilla (one of Ezcurra [2016]'s synapomorphies) visible in E (pdpm) Martin Ezcurra's 2016 analysis of archosauromorphs provided an alternative diagnosis for Suchia. Ezcurra found that Koilamasuchus was a member of the group, but also argued that Suchia excluded Nundasuchus. As a result, his diagnosis for Suchia depended primarily on several traits visible in Koilamasuchus, which was known from significantly less fossil material than most other Suchia. These traits are the presence of large, well-rimmed pits on either side of the dorsal (back) vertebrae, a humerus (upper arm bone) which has a symmetrical proximal portion when seen from the front, and a preacetabular process (front blade) of the ilium (upper hip bone) which has a moderate length, longer than it is high, but not longer than the pubic peduncle. He also noted that in some suchians, the tip of the maxillary bone's posterior process (rear branch), near the rear lower tip of the antorbital fenestra, is actually taller than the middle portion of the rear branch. This trait, formally known as the posterodorsal process of the maxilla, has been considered a synapomorphy of gracilisuchids and is also present in aetosaurs and Qianosuchus. Despite the broad distribution of this characteristic, its absence in some suchians makes it ambiguous whether it qualifies as a synapomorphy of Suchia, or alternatively evolved in several independent lineages within the group. Ezcurra also agreed with one of Nesbitt (2011)'s synapomorphies of the calcaneum, namely the calcaneal tuber being wider than tall. Classification Suchia was originally formalized by German paleontologist Bernard Krebs in 1974. His intention was to link the Triassic pseudosuchians (which at that time were considered to have left no descendants) with the true crocodilians that would evolve later in the Mesozoic. Suchia was named as an order united by the possession of a crurotarsal ankle, with Pseudosuchia and Crocodilia as independent suborders within it. However, newer studies starting in the 1980s have significantly altered the traditional classification scheme of crocodilian ancestors. Rather than pseudosuchians and crocodilians being sister groups as Krebs believed, the crocodilians are now considered to be a subset of Pseudosuchia. This necessitated Suchia to acquire a new definition, as Kreb's original classification scheme was invalidated. Sereno (1991) assigned the name Suchia to a clade containing most pseudosuchians, which had previously been found by Benton & Clark (1988). Under this new definition, Suchia included Gracilisuchus stipanicicorum, Aetosauria, \\"Rauisuchia\\", Poposauridae, Crocodylomorpha, and all descendants of their common ancestor. Nesbitt (2011) altered Sereno's definition slightly, as he defined Suchia as the least inclusive clade containing Aetosaurus ferratus, Rauisuchus tiradentes, Prestosuchus chiniquensis, and Crocodylus niloticus (the living Nile crocodile). Suchia, therefore, is a node-based taxon including crocodylomorphs and several more basal Triassic pseudosuchian groups. Such groups include Gracilisuchidae, Revueltosaurus, Aetosauria, Ticinosuchus, Poposauroidea, Loricata, and possibly Erpetosuchidae, Koilamasuchus, Nundasuchus, and/or Euscolosuchus. =Phylogeny= Below is a phylogenetic cladogram by Butler et al. in 2011 showing the cladistics of Archosauriformes, focusing mostly on Pseudosuchia: Clade names follow Nesbitt 2011.

Life Margaret Ann Griffiths, who was of English and Welsh parentage, was born and raised in London and studied archaeology at Cardiff University. She lived for some time in Bracknell and later moved to Poole, where she cared for her ailing parents until their deaths in 1993. Griffiths, also known by the Internet pseudonyms \\"grasshopper\\" and \\"Maz\\", began posting her poetry online in 2001. Rather than seek publication through traditional channels, she was content to share her work with fellow poets on various Internet forums, including Sonnet Central, where she volunteered as a moderator. On the rare occasions she submitted work for publication, it was typically to online venues such as Snakeskin, miller's pond, and the Shit Creek Review. During the mid-2000s she worked from home, running a small Internet-based business, and edited the Poetry Worm, a monthly periodical distributed by email. Griffiths suffered for years from a stomach ailment which eventually proved fatal. She died in July 2009. Poetry Griffiths wrote on a wide array of subjects, in both free verse and traditional forms. Although she often posted at poetry forums popular with formalists, she eschewed such categories, writing, \\"The division between free and formal verse, as if one is better than the other, bewilders me.\\" Largely ignoring contemporary trends and schools, she was more likely to make imaginative use of voice and setting than to experiment radically with language, and often wrote narrative poems and dramatic monologues in the voices of historical figures and fictional characters. Key themes included pets and animals in the wild; poets and scholars; illness and aging; war; spirituality; and women and sexuality. Her many influences included Andrew Marvell and Philip Larkin. Although little known to academic critics, M. A. Griffiths acquired a significant international readership over the years, many of her admirers notable poets themselves.Discussion thread with contributions from many notable poets, including Maryann Corbett, A.

In 2008, her \\"Opening a Jar of Dead Sea Mud\\" won Eratosphere's annual Sonnet Bake-off, and was praised by Richard Wilbur. Later that year she was a Guest Poet on the Academy of American Poets website, where she was hailed as \\"one of the up-and-coming poets of our time\\". After her death, the American poet Timothy Murphy wrote, \\"It is a shame that Margaret Griffiths never took the TLS, PN Review, and Faber by storm. They would have been the better for it.

It is located west of Dale City, Virginia. It was closed in 1965. History Manassas AFS was established as one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent Air Defense Command radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 647th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operating AN/FPS-3 and AN/CPS-4 radars at what was initially designated Quantico in March 1952, due to it being situated at the northeast corner of the Quantico Marine Corps Base. It assumed coverage from the temporary \\"Lashup\\" site L-14 at Fort Meade, Maryland in 1955, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The AN/FPS-3 remained active until 1962. In July 1957, the name of the station was officially changed to Manassas Air Force Station. In 1958 AN/FPS-6A and AN/FPS-6B radars took over height-finder chores. During 1959 Manassas AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was re- designated as the 647th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Manassas AFS was upgraded to an AN/FPS-35 radar in 1961, but problems prevented operations. It became operational in 1962, and was tested to determine if it could detect missile launchings. The radar detected Polaris and Minuteman missile launches from Cape Canaveral on June 28, 1962. Additional tests revealed the AN/FPS-35 radar had marginal value for missile detection. The AN/FPS-3 was then retired. In 1963 an AN/FPS-26A replaced the AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-55. In addition to the main facility, Manassas operated several unmanned AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites * Hermanville, MD (P-55B): : When Manassas AFS closed, the site became an annex of Fort Meade, MD and was redesignated \\"RP-54A\\". * Hanover, PA (RP-55D): : Reassigned to Fort Meade, MD in December, 1960 and was redesignated \\"RP-54B\\". * Thomas, WV (P-55F): : When Manassas AFS closed, the site became an annex of Oakdale AI, PA and was redesignated \\"RP-62G\\". The site was removed from service on 25 June 1965. Reportedly, the FPS-35 radar sail was then sent to Fortuna AFS, North Dakota, to replace the one there which had been destroyed in a fierce wind storm a year earlier. The Manassas GATR site at Independent Hill, VA was retained as site R-20 and manned by the 770th AC&W; Squadron, Operating Location \\"A\\", and continued in operation until 1976. Today, the former Manassas Air Force Station is an administrative and logistics center for the Prince William County School District. The area remains fenced and many of the former Air Force buildings are in use, along with the housing area. The large AN/FPS-35 search radar tower remains, as well as the foundations for the other towers, although the towers themselves were removed several years ago.

During Leonid Brezhnev's rule of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) the Soviet economy began to stagnate; this period is referred to by historians as the Era of Stagnation. Even after several reform attempts by Kosygin and his prot√©g√©s, the economic situation in the country continued to deteriorate. In contrast to his earlier reform initiative, the 26th Congress that his government would implement the reform during the (1981‚Äì1985). This never happened, and even Brezhnev complained that implementation of the reform had been slow. This unfinished reform is seen by some as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government. Intentions The reform was initiated, and created, by Premier Alexei Kosygin in a joint decision with the Central Committee (CC) and the Council of Ministers. The reform tried to reaffirm and separate the economic functions of the state and the ministries. To accomplish this, several procedures were established to ensure that each ministry would contribute to the state budget. All ministries were given a fixed budget even if the ministry did not fulfill the five-year plan. The reform supported giving enterprises more autonomy from the central government and extending the rights of the ministries by giving them new principles. The reform tried to improve labor productivity by introducing new production indicators via the State Standards Committee, and tried to solve some of the USSR's economic problems by reducing the effects of sectorial barriers set up by the ministries. The reform succeeded in giving more power to the regional authorities and the Soviet Republics; this development was consolidated by a Central Committee decree in 1981. Implementation The 1979 reform was an attempt to reform the existing economic system without any radical changes. The economic system was centralised even more than previously. The effectiveness of the planned economy was improved in some sectors, but not enough to save the stagnation economy of the USSR. One of the major goals of the reform was to improve the distribution of resources and investment, which had long been neglected because of \\"sectorialism\\" and \\"regionalism\\". Another priority was the elimination of the influence \\"regionalism\\" had on the five- year plan. The 1965 reform tried, with little success, to improve the quality of goods produced. In the 1979 reform Kosygin tried to displace gross output from \\"its commanding place\\" in the planned economy, and new regulations for rare and high-quality goods were created. Capital investment was seen as a very serious problem by the Soviet authorities by 1979, with General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Kosygin claiming that only an increase in labor productivity could help develop the economy of the more technologically advanced Soviet Republics such as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR). When Kosygin died in 1980, the reform was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Brezhnev told the 26th Congress that the implementation of the reform had been very slow. Tikhonov, during his speech to the 26th Congress, told the delegates that parts of the reform would be implemented during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981‚Äì1985).

It is regarded as the first complete Urdu stage play ever written. The play was translated into German in the 1880s as a doctoral thesis at the University of Leipzig by Friedrich Rosen, and published to positive critical reception in 1892.Friedrich Rosen. \\"Die IndarsabhƒÅ des AmƒÅnat : neuindisches Singspiel in lithographischem Originaltext.\\" Leipzig: Brockhaus Verlag, 1892. A movie, Indrasabha, based on the play was released by Madan Theatre in 1932. The play The opera is set in the celestial court of Indra, the king of the gods (devas) in Hindu mythology. The play is written entirely in verse, and the central theme is a romance between a prince and a fairy. Operatic devices such as fireworks and masks are employed in enacting the play. Although the play was initially intended to be performed in royal court, songs from the play influenced the geet tradition in Urdu and quickly transitioned into popular culture, where \\"for at least two generations after that, actors and musicians of Oudh sang the songs of Inder Sabha.\\" The play included \\"31 ghazals, 9 thumri of gaya and Benares gharana, 4 holis, 15 songs and two chaubolas and five chhands with enough scope for dances as well.\\" The play is considered a seminal work that directly influenced several important nineteenth and early-twentieth century Urdu plays that followed it, including Khadim Husain Afsos's Bazm-e-Suleman (1862), Bahiron Singh Asmat's Jashn-e- Parastan and Taj Mahal Farrukh's Nigaristan-e-Farrukh (1911). Commissioning Although it is widely regarded as the first Urdu stage play, there is dispute on how the play came to be created. While some historians have contended that Agha Hasan Amanat was commissioned by Wajid Ali Shah to write it, others (such as Abdul Halim Sharar) have disputed this claim and asserted that it was written entirely independently by Amanat. Inder Sabha a film with maximum songs Released in 1932, Indrasabha was one of the earliest sound films made in India, the very next year after Alam Ara, which was the first Indian talkie. It featured over seventy songs and was 211 minutes long. The movie was made by Jamshedji Framji Madan's company, Madan Theatre.

The 12th-century keep or stone tower, which is the castle's most prominent feature, is one of the best preserved in England or France. Situated on the River Medway and Watling Street, Rochester served as a strategically important royal castle. During the late medieval period it helped protect England's south-east coast from invasion. The first castle at Rochester was founded in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest. It was given to Bishop Odo, probably by his half-brother William the Conqueror. During the Rebellion of 1088 over the succession to the English throne, Odo supported Robert Curthose, the Conqueror's eldest son, against William Rufus. It was during this conflict that the castle first saw military action; the city and castle were besieged after Odo made Rochester a headquarters for the rebellion. After the garrison capitulated, this first castle was abandoned. Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, to build a new stone castle at Rochester. He established the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King Henry I granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12th century the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops. During the First Barons' War (1215‚Äì1217) in King John's reign, baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king, who then besieged it. The Barnwell chronicler remarked \\"Our age has not known a siege so hard pressed nor so strongly resisted\\". After resisting for just over seven weeks, the garrison surrendered. The castle had been greatly damaged, with breaches in the outer walls and one corner of the keep collapsed, and hunger eventually forced the defenders' hand. The castle did not stay under John's control for long: in 1216 it was captured by the French Prince Louis, who was the new leader of the baronial faction. John died and was succeeded by his son King Henry III in 1216; the next year, the war ended and the castle was taken under direct royal control. Rochester was besieged for the third time in 1264 during the Second Barons' War (1264‚Äì1267). The castle's royal constable, Roger de Leybourne, held Rochester in support of Henry III. Rebel armies led by Simon de Montfort and Gilbert de Clare entered the city and set about trying to capture the castle. Again the castle's defenders resisted, this time with a different outcome. After a week, the rebel armies raised the siege in the face of relief from Henry himself. The garrison did not surrender, and the castle suffered extensive damage that was not repaired until the following century. The castle saw military action for the last time in 1381 when it was captured and ransacked during the Peasants' Revolt. As Rochester Castle fell out of use its materials were reused elsewhere and custodianship relinquished by the Crown. The castle and its grounds were opened to the public in the 1870s as a park. At various points during the 19th and 20th centuries repairs were carried out. The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Monument. Today the ruins are in the guardianship of English Heritage and open to the public. Early history Rochester Cathedral is visible beyond the castle's ruined fortifications. Castles were introduced to England by the Normans in the 11th century and their construction, in the wake of the conquest of 1066, helped the Normans secure their new territory. Rochester was an important city, built on the site of a Roman town at the junction of the River Medway and Watling Street, a Roman road. It has long been assumed that the first castle was located next to the river, just outside the south-west corner of the town walls. The conjectural site of the early castle later became known as \\"Boley Hill\\". Archaeologist Tom McNeill has suggested that these earliest castles in England may have been purely military in character, built to contain a large number of troops in hostile territory. According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester was given land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in compensation for land that became the site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48 castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester is the only one for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11th century the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle- guard consisted of 60 knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification. Bishop Odo, here seen in the Bayeux Tapestry, held Rochester as one of the headquarters of a revolt against William Rufus in 1088. It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were abandoned after the conclusion of the siege and have since vanished. After the abandonment of Rochester's first castle it was replaced by another on the current site, in the south-west corner of the town walls. Founded between 1087 and 1089, some parts of the castle survive, much altered by use and reuse in subsequent centuries. William the Conqueror had granted Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, the manor of Haddenham in Buckinghamshire ‚Äì which as of the Domesday Survey had an annual income of ¬£40 ‚Äì for the duration of his life. In turn, the archbishop had granted the manor to Rochester's monks, so on the Conqueror's death Lanfranc and Gundulf, who was appointed Bishop of Rochester in 1077, had to appeal for reconfirmation of the original grant from the new king. William Rufus demanded ¬£100 in exchange for confirmation of the grant. The two bishops felt such a sum was beyond their means and sought a compromise. Instead it was agreed that Gundulf would build a new stone castle at Rochester. Initially the two bishops were concerned that the cost would exceed the king's original request and that they would be responsible for the castle's upkeep. Henry, Earl of Warwick convinced them that a castle suitable for the king could be constructed for ¬£40, and that following its completion the castle would be handed over to someone else. The actual cost to Gundulf was ¬£60. The bishop was a skilled architect and supervised the construction of the Tower of London's eponymous White Tower on behalf of William the Conqueror. Gundulf's castle was adjacent to Rochester Cathedral. According to archaeologist Oliver Creighton, when castles were positioned close to churches or cathedrals it suggested a link between the two, and in this case both were owned by the Bishop of Rochester. Often the same craftsmen and architects would work on these closely related buildings, leading to similarities in some of their features. Along with Durham and Old Sarum, Rochester is one of the best examples of a closely linked castle and religious building. This 19th- century reconstruction of medieval Rochester from E. A. Freeman's The Reign of William Rufus 1882 shows the city was surrounded by a wall. The castle founded by Gundulf was in the south-west corner. Construction started around 1127; it shows the great tower built by William de Corbeil. In 1127 King Henry I granted Rochester Castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, and his successors in perpetuity. He was given permission to build \\"a fortification or tower within the castle and keep and hold it forever\\". Corbeil is responsible for building the great tower or keep that still stands today, albeit in an altered state. The 12th century saw many castles in England rebuilt in stone, an advancement in sophistication of design and technology. Rochester had already been given a stone curtain wall by Bishop Gundulf, and the keep dates from this period. It visually dominated the rest of the castle, towering above its outer walls, and acted as a residence containing the castle's best accommodation. A sturdy fortification, it could also serve as a stronghold in the event of military action. Such was the importance of the keep as a symbol of Rochester it was depicted on the town's seal in the 13th century. Construction progressed at a rate of about per year. It was probably finished before Corbeil died in 1138 and definitely before 1141, when Robert, Earl of Gloucester, was imprisoned there during the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign. It is likely that after the keep was built there was no further building activity in the 12th century, only maintenance. The castle was held by the Archbishops of Canterbury under the king, but the monarch was still responsible for financially supporting it. Continuous records of royal expenditures known as \\"Pipe Rolls\\" began in the reign of Henry II, and included in the rolls are details of expenditure on Rochester Castle's upkeep. During the 12th century, these were generally small figures, but in 1172‚Äì1173 more than ¬£100 was spent on the castle, coinciding with the rebellion of Henry II's sons. Following the fall of Normandy in 1204 to the French forces of King Philip II, King John increased his expenditure on the castles in south-east England in preparation for a possible invasion. Amongst these was Rochester and in 1206 John spent ¬£115 on the castle's ditches, keep, and other structures. Under England's Angevin kings royal castles in south-east England were invested in to protect the country from invasion; Rochester was one of the most important. King John Custody of Rochester Castle remained with the Archbishops of Canterbury until the end of the 12th century. Despite ascending to the throne in 1199 King John did not confirm Hubert Walter as the castle's custodian until July 1202. John may have wished to regain direct control of what was an important castle. The crisis of John's rule began in 1212 with the discovery of a plot to overthrow him. Defeat at the Battle of Bouvines in July 1214 marked the end of John's ambitions to retake Normandy and exacerbated the situation in England. He returned to England in October and a few months later barons in the north of England were actively challenging his rule. A group of barons renounced their feudal ties to John in May 1215, and they captured London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John persuaded Stephen Langton, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, to cede control of Rochester Castle to a royal constable, Reginald de Cornhill. Under the terms of the agreement, the castle was to revert to the control of the archbishop at Easter 1215. This period was later extended to Easter 1216. Letters Patent dated 25 May 1215 requested that other royal constables would take over from Cornhill. The castle would still be returned to the archbishop when the agreement expired or if peace was restored to the kingdom before Easter 1216. In the meantime, control reverted to Langton whom John had asked to hold the castle \\"in such a way that by it no ill or harm shall come to us or our kingdom\\". An early 13th-century drawing by Matthew Paris showing contemporary warfare, including the use of castles, crossbowmen and mounted knights Chroniclers record that the rebels garrisoned the castle with between 95 and 140 knights, supported by bowmen and sergeants, amongst others. John met the rebel barons at Runnymede, and on 19 June 1215 they renewed their vows of fealty. A peace treaty, which later became known as Magna Carta, was sealed. Shortly after the treaty the agreement between John and Langton to appoint a royal constable in charge of Rochester Castle was dissolved, returning control to the archbishop. The peace did not last and the First Barons' War broke out. A group of rebels headed to Rochester to hold the city against John. The events surrounding the rebels' takeover of the castle are unclear, but contemporary chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall recorded that the king demanded Langton hand over the castle to royal control and the archbishop refused. Langton held out against the king's demands, but the rebels feared he would eventually cave to pressure from the king and seized control of Rochester Castle for themselves. According to Ralph of Coggeshall, this was done with the consent of the castle's constable, Reginald de Cornhill, who seems to have switched allegiance from the king to the archbishop after John appointed him as royal constable of the castle. Langton left the country that same month, leaving the castle in the hands of the king's enemies. In a letter that year to justiciar Hubert de Burgh John expressed his frustration towards Langton, calling him \\"a notorious traitor to us, since he did not render our castle of Rochester to us in our so great need\\". After this point, Rochester Castle was no longer considered to be in the perpetual custody of the archbishops of Canterbury. At the time, John was in south-east England recruiting mercenaries in preparation for his war with the barons. Rochester blocked the direct route to London, which was also held by the rebels. According to Roger of Wendover, the rebels at Rochester were led by William d'Aubigny, lord of Belvoir. Estimates of the size of Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140 knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing the news that the city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13 October. Royal forces had arrived ahead of John and entered the city on 11 October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that followed was the largest in England up to that point, and would take nearly two months. Boley Hill to the south of the castle may have been used as John's headquarters during the siege. According to the Barnwell chronicler, five siege engines hurled a barrage of stones at the castle's wall day and night. These were supported by missiles from smaller bows and crossbows. The Barnwell chronicler claimed they smashed a hole in the castle's outer walls; Roger of Wendover asserted they were ineffective and that John turned to other methods to breach the defences. A letter dated 14 October indicates John was preparing to undermine the castle's walls. He wrote to Canterbury, asking for the production \\"by day and night of as many picks as you are able\\" and that they be sent to Rochester. On 26 October a relief force of 700 horse was sent from London. They turned back before arriving, perhaps because they heard the king was advancing to meet them. When the castle's outer walls were eventually breached, the defenders retreated to the relative safety of the keep. It too withstood the efforts of the siege engines, and once again John turned to mining to bring down the walls. The mine was dug beneath the south-east corner of the keep. A letter sent from Rochester on 25 November offers insight into the methods of medieval siegecraft. John ordered Hugh de Burgh to \\"send to us with all speed by day and night forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating to bring fire beneath the tower\\". The wooden props supporting the tunnel dug beneath the keep were set alight to collapse the mine, bringing down one corner of the keep. Still the garrison held out and sought safety behind the stone partition or cross-wall in the keep, abandoning half the building. The Barnwell chronicler remarked that \\"for such was the structure of the stronghold that a very strong wall separated the half that had fallen from the other\\". Conditions within the keep worsened by the day and the garrison were reduced to eating horse flesh. In an attempt to reduce the demand on limited provisions, some members were sent out of the keep, beginning with those least capable of fighting. Some sources record that they had their hands and feet amputated by the besiegers. On 30 November the garrison eventually surrendered and were taken captive. Initially John wanted to execute them all as was the custom of the time when a garrison had forced a long and bloody conflict. Savaric de Maul√©on, one of John's captains, persuaded the king otherwise, concerned that similar treatment would be shown to royal garrisons by the rebels. Only one person was executed: a crossbowman who had previously been in the service of the king since childhood was hanged. Many of the rebels were imprisoned, sent to royal castles such as Corfe for safe-keeping. Of the siege the Barnwell chronicler wrote, \\"Our age has not known a siege so hard pressed nor so strongly resisted ... Afterwards few cared to put their trust in castles\\". Prince Louis of France, son of Philip II, was invited by the barons to become the new leader of the rebellion and become king in the event of their victory. In 1216 he arrived in England and captured Rochester Castle; it is not known how, as no documentary evidence recording the event survives. Henry III The Round Tower (centre) was a replacement built by Henry III to repair the damage done to the Keep by King John's mine. In contrast to the other two towers visible, it is cylindrical. John died in 1216 and was succeeded by his nine-year-old son, Henry, with the support of the barons. With no prospect of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the damage incurred during John's siege, the castle was in dire need of repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around ¬£680 were spent on repairs, of which ¬£530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of ¬£300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain wall. At the same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, buttery, and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid to making the castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, ¬£132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over ¬£120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than ¬£120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to Henry III's worsening relations with his barons. During the 1264 siege the garrison retreated within the keep. Henry III's reign was in crisis in 1258. He had recently suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems leading to a famine, and relations with the pope were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, and the rule of the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort. Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, held the castle in support of Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co- commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army attacked from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London with the intention of attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18 April, Good Friday using a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter Sunday there was no fighting; hostilities resumed on the Monday. Siege engines were set up and targeted the keep. As in 1215 the keep proved resistant to missiles, and after a week had not succumbed. According to one contemporary source, the besiegers were about to dig a mine beneath the tower, but the siege was abandoned on 26 April when the earls received news of a relief force led by Henry III and his son, Prince Edward. Later history Though the garrison had held out within the keep, the rest of the castle had incurred severe damage, but no attempt was made to carry out repairs until the reign of Edward III (1327‚Äì1377). It was noted in 1275 that the castle's constables had not only failed to make any effort to repair the structure but had caused further damage: they stole stone from the castle for reuse elsewhere. In 1281 John of Cobham, the constable, was granted permission to pull down the castle's hall and chambers which had been left as burnt-out ruins after the 1264 siege. Numerous surveys in the following century bear testament to the castle's sorry state and follow its steady decline. A survey from 1340 estimated that repairs would cost around ¬£600; another conducted 23 years later stated that it would cost ¬£3,333 6s 8d. Natural weathering worsened the condition of the castle, and in 1362 a \\"great wind\\" damaged the structure. By 1369 few of the castle's buildings still stood: the keep, gatehouses, a hall, kitchen, and stable were all that survived, and even then in a state of ruin. The keep was in desperate need of repair, but it was still in use and was the centre of the domestic life at the castle. Elizabeth de Burgh Queen of Scots, captured by English in 1306, was confined in the castle in 1314 from March to June. Between May 1367 and September 1370 repairs costing ¬£2,262 were carried out. Records show that sections of the curtain wall were repaired and two mural towers built, one of them replacing a tower on the same site. The towers were positioned north-east of the keep and still stand. More work was undertaken between 1370 and 1377, the year of Edward's death. The royal apartments built during Henry III's reign were never repaired; it has been suggested this was because by the 14th century, when considerable sums were being spent on repairs elsewhere in the castle, Rochester had fallen out of favour as a royal residence. As the castle's importance as a high-status residence waned, its role as a barracks and administrative centre came to the fore. The reign of Richard II (1377‚Äì1400) saw the investment of ¬£500 in repairing the castle. This was in part in response to French raids on England's southern coast during the Hundred Years' War as England's fortunes in the conflict worsened. The most significant of these works was the construction of a tower at the north end of the castle, overlooking the bridge over the Medway. Records document the sum of ¬£350 spent on a new tower between 1378 and 1383, and it mostly likely refers to the one guarding the bridge. Rochester Castle saw fighting for the final time during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It was besieged and captured by a group of rebels who plundered the castle and released a prisoner. It has been suggested that the ¬£66 10s spent in 1384‚Äì1388 and the ¬£91 13s spent in 1395‚Äì1397 may have been partially in response to damage incurred during the revolt. During the reigns of Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413) and his successor Henry V (1413‚Äì1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to Henry V's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 as part of her dower to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15th century and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle between then and the second half of the 16th century. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort. Diarist Samuel Pepys commented on the condition of Rochester Castle, and as early as the 17th century the castle may have acted as a tourist attraction. By this time many castles were in a state of ruin, and Rochester was amongst those in need of repair, although still in use. In 1610 James I granted Sir Anthony Weldon control of the castle. During the English Civil War, Weldon declared for the Parliamentarian cause. The castle did not see fighting during the war, even when the city was captured by Royalists in 1648; this may indicate that the castle was not a serviceable fortification by this point. Weldon's support for the Parliamentarians may have spared the castle from slighting (demolition) in the aftermath, a fate suffered by many other castles. Walker Weldon inherited the castle and carried out the destruction of part of the outer wall in the 18th century to sell off the building material; he had originally intended to dismantle more of the castle, but the plans were abandoned. A drawing from around this time suggests that the cross wall had been removed by this point. While other parts of the castle were dismantled, the two towers in the south-east wall were still being used for accommodation. In 1743 prisoners were held at the castle, probably in huts. Rochester Castle descended through the Weldon family until it was bequeathed to Thomas Blechynden in the 18th century. By 1774 Robert Child was in possession of the castle, and it remained in the possession of his family until 1884. There were unsuccessful plans in 1780 to reuse Rochester Castle as an army barracks, after the commander of the Royal Engineers for Chatham, Colonel Hugh Debbieg, asked the Child family for permission.; General Hugh Debbieg bio at en.wikisource.org The castle ruins inspired a painting by artist J. M. W. Turner in the late 18th century, one of his first oil paintings. Turner was renowned for his love of nature and was at the forefront of the picturesque movement, during which such ruins became fashionable. By the 19th century, gardens were created within the castle's enclosure. Charles Dickens lived in Rochester and included the castle ruins in The Pickwick Papers and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Through the words of one of his characters, Dickens described the castle as a \\"glorious pile ‚Äì frowning wall ‚Äì tottering arches ‚Äì dark nooks ‚Äì crumbling stones\\". Many of England's historic buildings, particularly ruins, have acquired myths and legends, and some are rumoured to be haunted. Rochester is no exception, and is reportedly haunted by a white lady. Dickens is also said to haunt the moat on Christmas Eve. The 19th century saw efforts to preserve the castle. In 1826 repairs were made to the well in the keep. At the same time a survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the well in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure and the walls overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for ¬£6,572 (equivalent to ¬£3.4 million in 2009 terms).Financial comparison based on average earnings; using . Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In the first quarter of the century the gardens acquired a German field gun, a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand; these were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence. The castle's state was assessed in 1961, and the cost of repairs estimated at ¬£30,000 (equivalent to ¬£1.1 million in 2009 terms). The Ministry of Public Building and Works took over care of the castle from the Corporation of Rochester in 1965. Records of the Ministry's conservation work have gone missing, so precisely what was done is unclear. Between 1962 and 1965 the council removed buildings from the castle's ditch. Guardianship transferred to English Heritage in 1984. Since 1995 the City of Rochester has been responsible for daily management of the castle. Descaling at the start of the 21st century contributed to the decay of the keep, and one of the mural towers was in need of maintenance. Due to the decayed state of the keep, public access is restricted and netting has been erected to protect visitors. The possibility of adding floors and a roof to the keep was discussed in the 1970s and 1990s, but there were concerns that a roof would change the climate within the building. The castle is a Scheduled Monument, a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The castle is open to the public. Architecture Little is known about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer enclosure defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte. The castle built by Bishop Gundulf in the late 12th century was enclosed by a stone wall. Situated in the south-west corner of the city, the castle used the remains of the Roman town walls as foundations. The circuit had at least one tower; it was replaced in the 14th century. The original gateway was radically altered in the 13th or 14th century. From across the River Medway, the twin landmarks of Rochester's castle and cathedral would have dominated the medieval landscape, symbolic of the authority of the church and nobility in the period. Most castles were built by secular nobles, but the work by Gundulf and his successor Corbeil provide examples of the role of the church in castle building. A plan of Rochester Castle's keep from MacGibbon and Ross's The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth century (1887) According to military historian Allen Brown Rochester's keep is \\"among the finest and oldest in all England\\". Since its construction it has undergone limited alteration, aside from the rebuilding of one corner, and although now in a state of ruin it remains significantly intact and is considered one of the most important surviving 12th-century keeps in England and France. The keep was richly decorated with hangings and furnishings. Dating from the second quarter of the 12th century, it is Rochester Castle's dominant feature. It had a square plan, and measures externally with pilaster buttresses at each corner. The keep was built in the castle's southern corner, close to the curtain wall. The primary building material was local Kentish Ragstone; Caen stone used to face the keep was imported from Normandy. The same material was imported for the Tower of London's White Tower in the 11th century. The tops of the turrets rise above the ground, 12 ft above the battlements. Below the latter are rectangular holes, marking where wooden hoarding would have been attached. The walls of the keep are 12 ft thick at the base, and taper to 10 ft at the top. It is the tallest keep in England, and only those at Dover, the Tower of London, Colchester, and Norwich are larger. During John's siege of Rochester in 1215, the south-east corner collapsed; during Henry III's reign it was rebuilt as a cylinder. The windows increase in size higher up the walls; those in the uppermost were decorated. A spiral staircase in the north- east corner provided access to all floors, and another in the south-west corner went from the first floor to the top floor. The north-west corner tower contains small chambers, and the south-east probably had a similar layout before it was rebuilt. Keeps were traditionally built with an entrance at first-floor level, and Rochester's follows this pattern. A forebuilding attached to the north side guarded the entrance. A stone staircase began on the west side of the keep before turning and meeting the forebuilding, which could be entered by crossing a drawbridge across a gap wide. There was another entrance in the west of the forebuilding, and at some point a new doorway was knocked through to the keep at the bottom of the drawbridge pit. The original door from the forebuilding into the keep was protected by a portcullis. The stone-built keeps of the 11th century generally had simple plans, with few rooms and an uncomplicated layout. Rochester's keep bears testament to a developing complexity, and provides an early example of a keep divided into separate areas for the lord and his retinue. The thickness of the walls allowed rooms to be built into them, as can also be seen at the Hedingham Castle's contemporaneous keep, or the slightly later one at Dover. The keep's interior is divided for its entire height by a cross wall running east‚Äìwest. The ground floor was used for storage, with the three storeys above providing accommodation. The first floor probably contained a hall and great chamber, divided by the cross wall. This level may have been the accommodation of the castle's constable who looked after it during the owner's absence. There is a room called \\"Gundulf's Chamber\\" built into the thickness of the wall in the north-west corner; it may well have been the constable's private chamber. The second floor contained the keep's best accommodation and some of its most elaborate decoration. It is high and surrounded by a gallery in its upper half built into the thickness of the walls. The floor also had a chapel measuring about . At some unknown point in the post-medieval period, a fire gutted the keep, leaving it in its present state without floors or a roof. On the second floor, there are openings in the cross wall, broken by a series of Romanesque columns between round-headed arches. The cross wall carried a well shaft, with a well-head at each floor. The third floor had a second chapel and access to the roof, and may have held additional accommodation. The riverside curtain wall dates from the 12th century, when the castle was first surrounded by a stone wall. The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249‚Äì1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was thick at the base, narrowing to at the top; it rose to a height of around . Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century; the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Its vaulted undercroft is no longer standing. In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, but has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged the castle and to reinforce a weak point in the defences. The section from the tower to the location of the former main gatehouse in the north-east dates from about 1367 to 1370. Two towers were built along the wall, each two storeys high and again using Kentish Ragstone. The one nearest the keep is relatively plain and the northernmost one more elaborate. The latter was intended for use as a residence and in the modern period was converted into a cottage. The wall between these two towers was reduced in the modern period, possibly to give a better view of the cathedral. Apart from the west side, the castle was surrounded by a ditch, much of which has since been filled in.

New Zealand rugby career Following his move to New Zealand he was capped 12 times by the All Blacks, with a record of 10 wins, a draw and a defeat. The defeat came in his final match in 1964, against Australia at Wellington. Coaching He was to return to Australian rugby as a coach firstly at Brisbane Brothers, then Queensland and Australia. He led the Wallabies in that role in their home series against New Zealand in 1968. A keen tactician and student of the game, Connor studied the rulebook and after consulting with referees, he introduced in the first Test the first short lineout used in the Southern Hemisphere.

Range and habitat It is found in Burundi, Rwanda, the DRC, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and the northern and north-eastern Limpopo. Its habitat is open woodland, flood plains, banks of rivers and the fringes of pans and swamps. Reproduction As with other Hyphaene species, H. petersiana is dioicous and the female plants produce copious fruit of some 60 mm diameter. Up to 2,000 fruit may be found on a tree, the combined yield of about four seasons. The seeds germinate with difficulty but find saline conditions beneficial. They develop massive tap- roots which draw saline water deep underground. Though slow-growing, they may attain a maximum height of 18 metres. Typical adult plants however stand some 5 to 7 metres tall. Uses and associations The plants are utilized by humans and animals. Repeated cutting of the growth point to obtain sap for palm wine production may eventually destroy the trees. The stem pith is edible. Beneath the outer fibrous husk of the fruit is a core of white endosperm known as vegetable ivory, initially soft and edible and containing some liquid comparable to coconut milk. The Ovambo people call the fruit of the Makalani palm eendunga and use it to distill ombike, their traditional liquor. African palm swifts and rufous-tailed palm-thrushes regionally depend on this species for breeding. Similar species The species is similar to H. coriacea, which occurs to the southeast. It is however distinguishable by the shape of the fruit‚Äìround rather than pear-shaped‚Äìand the shape of the stem, which regularly bulges out below the foliage. B. aethiopum has a comparable stem shape.Martius, Carl Friedrich Philipp von. 1845. Historia Naturalis Palmarum 3: 227, Hyphaene PetersianaKirk, James Tiberius. 1866. Journal of the Linnean Society.

It was formed on 21 May 1947 in the aftermath of World War II as the successor to Berliner Fu√üball-Club which was established 15 October 1896 and was one of the founding clubs of the DFB (Deutscher Fussball Bund, en: German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900. TOC History =BFC Favorit= Sometime in 1904, FC Favorit was renamed Berliner Sport-Club Favorit. The team was primarily a lower-tier side and played just three seasons in the top-flight Oberliga Berlin in 1911‚Äì12 and 1917‚Äì19. In March 1933, Favorit was joined by the membership of Pankower SC 08 Adler, a left- leaning worker's club banned under the policies of the Nazis which led to the breakup of clubs with undesirable political or regligious affiliations.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . The Pankow side were the 1928 champions of the ATSB (The Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund, en:Workers Gymnastics and Sports Federation), a leftist national sports organization which organized a football competition and championship separate from that of the DFB. =VfL Nord Berlin= Favorit was lost following World War II when occupying Allied forces banned most organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of de-Nazification. New clubs soon emerged and the former membership of Favorit became part of the railworker's club Sportgruppe Nordbahn Berlin formed in 1945 and which was renamed VfL Nord Berlin on 21 May 1947. SG played a single season in the postwar Stadtliga Berlin, Staffel D (I) in 1945‚Äì46 before becoming part of the Landesliga Berlin (II) for the next two years. They captured a divisional title there in 1949 and advanced to the Oberliga Berlin (I). VfL was immediately sent down after a 12th-place result, but quickly bounced back after taking the first ever title of the newly formed Amateurliga Berlin (II) in 1951.Gr√ºne, Hardy and Karn, Christian (2009). Das gro√üe Buch der Deutschen Fusballverein Kassel: Agon- Sportverlag. . That title earned the team a place in the opening round of the national amateur championship where they were put out 1:4 by eventual champions ATSV 1860 Bremen. After another failed Oberliga campaign, Nord spent four of the next five seasons in Amateurliga play before slipping into lower- tier competition. They re-emerged into the now third tier Amateurliga Berlin in 1962 and were promoted to the Regionalliga Berlin (II) in 1968. The club had two unsuccessful turns at the Regionalliga level in 1968‚Äì69 and 1970‚Äì71, followed by a pair of poor Amateurliga seasons that ended with demotion in 1973. On 1 June 1973, VfL merged with Berliner FC Nordstern to create Sportverein Nord-Nordstern Berlin. That club in turn joined SC Rapide Wedding on 1 July 2001 to form present-day club SV Nord Wedding 1893.

He was also Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division from 1965-68. Turner's work in academia and in the government profoundly affected American antitrust law. As an academic, with a Ph.D. in economics and law degrees, Turner published influential papers applying economics to a wide variety of antitrust issues. As the federal government's chief antitrust enforcement officer, he attempted to ground all policy on economic foundations, disregarding populist or other political components on the ground that they could not be the basis for sound policy. He also tried to develop rules that would allow courts to apply economic principles in a way that recognized the nature of evidentiary proof and the limitations of judicial fact-finding. in his later academic career, together with Professor Phillip Areeda he published an influential paper on predatory pricing, developing the so-called Areeda-Turner rule, as well as a multi- volume treatise summarizing all of antitrust law, as explained by economic theory. \\"Few economists or lawyers have pursued as ambitiously as Donald Turner the effort to make antitrust more economically rational.Shepherd, William G., \\"Donald Turner and the economics of antitrust,\\" 41 Antitrust Bulletin 935-948 (Winter 1995). Biography =Early life and education= Turner was born on March 19, 1921, the son of a Presbyterian minister.Saxon, Wolfgan, \\"Donald Turner, Lawyer for the U.S. and Writer, 73,' New York Times, July 22, 1994, p. B18. A native of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, Turner worked his way through Northwestern University where he received his undergraduate degree in 1941. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, before he went on to earn a doctorate in economics from Harvard University in 1947. His thesis dealt with urban economics.Turner, Donald F., Industrial Change and the Housing Problem (Ph.D. thesis, Harvard, Hollis catalog number: 003996062, 1947). He obtained a teaching position at Yale University where he taught economics while working on his law degree from Yale Law School which he obtained in 1950. He clerked for Supreme Court Associate Justice Tom C. Clark (who had been Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust before his appointment to the Court), had a brief career in private law practice and then joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1954. =Early academic work= At Harvard Turner's colleagues included the economists Edward Mason and Joe Bain, economists who pioneered the field of industrial organization. Turner was attracted to the work of Carl Kaysen, whose experience as a clerk of the district court judge who presided over the United Shoe Machinery case,United States v. United Shoe Machinery. Co., 110 F. Supp. 295 (D. Mass.1953). aff‚Äôd, 347 U.S. 521 (1954). an experience on which he based his Ph.D. thesis,Kaysen, Carl, United States v United Shoe Machinery Corporation: An Economic Analysis of an Anti-trust Cases (Ph. D. thesis, Harvard Hollis catalogue number: 003864932, 1954). and which convinced him of the need for economists to select cases to be prosecuted by government and frame the issues for the court. Turner's collaboration with Kaysen expanding this approach produced Antitrust Policy: An Economic and Legal Analysis, described as \\"the most prominent antitrust treatise of the time.\\"Niefer, Mark J., \\"Donald F.Turner at the Antitrust Division: A Reconsideration of Merger Policy in the 1960s,\\" 29 Antitrust 53-59 (Summer 2015). Together with the work of Joe Bain, the Kaysen- Turner book \\"ushered in the structure, conduct, performance (SCP) approach to industrial organization, with special emphasis on barriers to entry. (Delivered at a department commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the 1982 Merger Guidelines. While the so-called Chicago School under the neoclassical views of Aaron Director and his colleagues objected to antitrust enforcement based on the SPC paradigm (chiefly because they attributed a great deal of value to the presumed \\"efficiencies\\" of concentration), they nevertheless agreed with the \\"Harvard School\\" in conceiving economic actors for antitrust purposes as production entities and examined market conduct through price theory.Coase, Ronald H. \\"Industrial Organization: A Proposal for Research,\\" This approach to antitrust enforcement would guide Turner's policies as head of the Antitrust Division. =Tenure as head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division= Turner taught at Harvard Law School from 1954 to 1965, when he was appointed Assistant Attorney General, in which capacity he headed Antitrust Division at the United States Department of Justice under President Lyndon B. Johnson. President Johnson had an aversion to Harvard academics but was persuaded to appoint him after Clark Clifford, a close adviser to the President, provided the President with a review of Turner's antitrust philosophy and views. The decisive consideration for the President and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach was to calm concerns of business leaders, whose support they believed necessary for the Administration's prosecution of the Vietnam War, over language of recent Supreme Court decisions concerning the need to protect potential competition and small business. Turner, they felt, had the intellectual prestige and professional inclination to rationalize antitrust policy in a way that would reassure the business community. Some observers believed on his appointment to lead the Antitrust Division that Turner would be more \\"lenient\\" than his predecessor, William Horsley Orrick Jr. Others noted his views in his 1959 volume on Antitrust Policy with Carl Kaysen that corporations should be broken up when they acquired \\"unreasonable market power.\\"Shanahan, Eileen, \\"Antitrust Chief against Concentration of Power,\\" New York Times, May 3, 1965, p. 51. Katzenbach, together with Treasury Secretary Henry H. Fowler and Commerce Secretary John T. Connor tried to reassure business (without promising leniency) at the Spring Meeting of the Business Council. Katzenbach said that \\"the most that can be said is that the department proposes and the Supreme Court disposes.\\" The current effort would be placed on developing guidelines \\"under which companies can more clearly tell in advance the mergers [which] might bring antitrust action.\\" At his Senate confirmation hearing before the subcommittee on Antitrust, Turner was closely questioned by both proponents of stricter enforcement and those who wished to roll back enforcement. Senator Hart, chairman, question him on his viewTurner, Donald F., \\"Conglomerate Mergers and Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\\" 78 Harvard Law Review 1313-1395 (1965). that \\"conglomerate\\" mergers (those not involving either competitors or firms in the same product supply line) should not be scrutinized as strictly as other mergers. On the other hand, Republican Senator Hruska questioned whether he believed \\"bigness\\" equaled \\"badness.\\" (Subscription require.) Turner nonetheless was approved by the Judiciary Committee on June 22, 1965, (Subscription required.) and two days later was confirmed by the full Senate. Turner's career in the Antitrust Division was noted for three characteristics. First, he attempted to articulate policy in a way that would give economic actors clear guidance. Second, he tried to ground that policy in sound academic research. Third, he limited antitrust policy to rules designed to enhance competition and not attempt to achieve broader social goals. His most long-lasting influence came about by creating the position of Special Economic Assistant, which he used to lure prominent academic economists for one year stints. His three appointments, William S. Comanor, Oliver E. Williamson and William G. Shepherd, all went on to noted academic careers.Comanor taught at Harvard and Stanford and was the chief economist at the Bureau of Economics of the US Federal Trade Commission before becoming Professor of Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and also Professor of Health Policy and Management at UCLA. Shepherd was Professor of Economics at University of Michigan and later at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was designated the fourth Distinguished Fellow of the Industrial Organization Society in 2002. Williamson became a professor of economics at University of California, Berkeley and was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2009 for \\"his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm.\\" Turner was also aggressive in replacing old-line staff with extremely credentialed younger appointees. Shepherd said that the permanent staff called his upper-administration appointees the \\"Gold Coast.\\" In a telephone conversation on Wednesday 23 November 1966 with Attorney General Ramsey Clark, President Johnson stated his lack of confidence in Donald Turner. =Post- government career= After his term in government he returned to Harvard where he taught from 1968 until he retired in 1979 as Bassey Professor of Law. In 1976 Turner was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. It was during this period that he engaged in fruitful collaboration with fellow Harvard Law professor Phillip Areeda. The two authored numerous articles together as well as an ambitious multi-volume treatise on antitrust law. On retirement he became counsel to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering. He also served as visiting professor at Georgetown University Law Center and was a fellow at the Brookings Institution. =Death and tributes= He died on July 24, 1994 in Derwood, Maryland, from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Upon his death, Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote the obituary on his legal career.Breyer, Stephen G., \\"Donald Turner,\\" 41 Antitrust Bulletin 725-727 (Winter 1996). Breyer wrote that Turner was Breyer's first post-clerkship employer. Legal contributions Turner became prominent as the first legal scholar of antitrust to apply economic analysis to the Sherman Act and Clayton Acts. His analysis of the \\"Cellophane Case\\" against DuPont, published in The Harvard Law Review in 1956 was perhaps the first important illustration of the approach.Turner, Donald F., \\"Antitrust Policy and the Cellophane Case,\\" 70 Harvard Law Review 281-318 (December 1956). The article was notable not only for its economic analysis but also its style, which was direct towards non- economists. He soon became an important voice on issues involving economic regulations of businesses. In 1956 he testified before the Senate Commerce Committee against two practices of the television networks, arguing that both were \\"clear\\" violations of antitrust laws: \\"option time\\" whereby affiliates were required to set aside certain time to air network programing and \\"must buy\\" where by CBS and NBC required advertisers to buy advertising time from at least 50 affiliates in order to get their sponsored program on the air.Dale, Jr., Edwin L., \\"TV Independent Scores Networks,\\" New York Times, March 27, 1956, p. 71. In academic writings Turner tackled problems such as under what circumstances \\"tying\\" services could be a monopolization offense, how courts could distinguish \\"agreement\\" among competitors (under Section 1 of the Sherman Act) from responses to market forces, and under what circumstances the Clayton Act prohibited so-called \\"conglomerate Mergers\\" (i.e. mergers of companies not directly competing (horizontal) or in a chain of supply or distribution (vertical)). By the time he was appointed head of the Antitrust Division, he was considered \\"the nation's foremost academic expert in antitrust law, and his writings in the field are considered authoritative.\\"Turner, Donald F. Current Biography (Bio Ref Bank) [serial online]. July 1, 1967; Available from: Biography Reference Bank (H.W. Wilson), Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 29, 2016. Unlike advocates of a \\"populist\\" approach to antitrust enforcement (who condemned \\"bigness\\" as a problem not only for its effect on competition but also for the political power which large economic actors wielded), Turner tended to disregard the size of an economic actor and focused solely on the economic consequences of the actions. \\"He believed that competition, efficiency, and innovation should be the lodestars of antitrust policy, and that forestalling the undue exercise of market power should be its goal.\\" In his first speech as Assistant Attorney General, he said: \\"\\"I do not believe it is proper under the law as it now is for the Department to attack mergers or other business conduct on the basis of considerations that have little or nothing to do with competition in the economic sense.\\"Donald F. Turner, Address Before the Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association 8 (August 10, 1965), reprinted in 10 Antitrust Bulletin 685-691 (1965). During his tenure he became known as a strong enforcer of the laws but attempted to make enforcement action predictable by, for example, publishing merger guidelines. They were designed to allow economic entities to continue natural growth, with the caveat that he often expressed that \\"substantial competitors cannot merge.\\" After his return to Harvard from government he teamed with Professor Areeda to author an important contribution to the jurisprudence of \\"attempt to monopolize\\" by predatory pricing under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.Areeda, Phillip E. & Turner, Donald F., \\"Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\\" 88 Harvard Law Review 697-733 (February 1975). The goal was to develop a bright line test (which became known as the Areeda-Turner test) to separate illegal price cutting designed to drive a competitor from the market, which would harm consumers once the monopolist was free to raise prices in the future, from healthy price competition, which is inherently pro-competitive and beneficial to the consumer. The point their test settled on is when the price set is below short term average variable cost, which is a more easily ascertained substitute for marginal cost. By this measure, a court can determine when a monopolist is deliberately setting a price which does not profit-maximizing (except for the profits to be achieved once a competitor is forced from the market). The latter part of his career at Harvard was spent in collaboration with Areeda producing their multi-volume treatise covering all of U.S. antitrust law. Family Professor Turner married Joan Pearson in 1955. They had two children: Paul A. Turner and Katherine Turner.

History In the five years before becoming an academy, the school was consistently ranked in the top 5% nationally for adding value and was the top secondary school in West Kent based on CVA scores. In September 2014, it was on the shortlist for the 2014 Kent Design Awards. Curriculum The school offers the International Baccalaureate syllabuses. Buildings The old buildings were replaced in 2010 with an award-winning design. The contractors were Willmott Dixon. It is based on a four-storey hub building with three three-storey rectangular teaching blocks set at 45‚Äô to each other, and a further large sports block opposite. The school required extra capacity to host its new one form entry, 3-11 primary school. They worked closely with KCC and the appointed contractors, Baxall Construction. It is a bespoke two-storey timberframed, sustainable, offsite, factory construction. The building was designed using 3D CAD software, by Willmott Dixon in discussion with the staff. The components which included the floors and the walls with the windows already in place, were all delivered at the same time as flat packs on lorries.

He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Biography Born in Thuringia, Boineburg-Lengsfeld joined the army of Imperial Germany as an Fahnen-junker (officer cadet) in 1910. He was commissioned in the light infantry and fought in World War I. In the interwar period, he served in the Reichsheer and then the Wehrmacht. He led the 1st Rifle Regiment from 1938 to 1939 before being given command of the 4th Sch√ºtzen (Rifle) Brigade of the 4th Panzer Division which fought in the Invasion of Poland. He temporarily commanded the division for a few days in May 1940, during the campaign in Holland, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 19 July 1940. Now an oberst (colonel), a more substantive period in command of the 4th Panzer Division followed from late July to September 1940. He was then transferred to the 7th Panzer Division, serving occupation duty in France and then in Russia during Operation Barbarossa, as commander of its 7th Sch√ºtzen Brigade. When the 23rd Panzer Division was formed in September 1941, Boineburg-Lengsfeld was appointed its commander. He was promoted to generalmajor shortly afterwards. He led the division during the Battle of the Caucasus but was relieved of command during the \\"Reichel Case\\", when plans for Case Blue, the codename for the Wehrmacht's summer offensive in Southern Russia, were lost to the Soviets. However, when his successor as commander, Generalmajor Erwin Mack, was killed in action, he returned as the division's permanent leader. In late December 1942, having received a promotion to generalleutnant a few weeks earlier, he was injured as a result of an accident with a tank. With several broken bones, he underwent an extended period in hospital. After recovering from his injuries, Boineburg-Lengsfeld was made the commandant of greater Paris. When that city was captured by the Allies in August 1944, he took a post at OB West. His participation in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler went undetected and he ended the war at Bergen, as its area commander. He died on 20 November 1980 in Felsberg.

The album mixes bottleneck blues, hard edged rock power chords, and thoughtful introspective song writing and experimental orchestrations. Tony McPhee was one of the earliest rock guitarists to experiment with guitar controlled synthesis and Oberheim/Maestro ring modulators. On this album he used a Hagstrom guitar synthesizer, a simple controller for an ARP 2600. The Hagstrom was monophonic and had resistors soldered on at each fret to create a monophonic control voltage bus and trigger gate. This allowed the guitar sound to be doubled, (but not bent by string pulls) and also required the analog synth to hold its tuning over the entire range. The album closes with a tribute to John Lee Hooker.

The J-20 is designed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability; it descends from the J-XX program of the 1990s. The J-20 made its maiden flight on 11 January 2011, and was officially revealed at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The aircraft entered service in March 2017, and began its combat training phase in September 2017. The first J-20 combat unit was formed in February 2018. The J-20 is the world's third operational fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft after the F-22 and F-35. Development The two Chengdu J-20s making their first public appearance at Airshow China 2016 The J-XX (Chengdu J-20) development program was started in the late 1990s. A proposal from Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, designated Project 718, won the PLAAF endorsement following a 2008 competition against a Shenyang proposal that was larger than the J-20. In 2009, a senior PLAAF official revealed that the first flight was expected in 2010‚Äì11, with a service entry date by 2019. On 22 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype underwent high speed taxiing tests outside the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute.\\"Video: Chinese Stealth Fighter.\\" The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 10 January 2011. Three months later, the first J-20 prototype made its maiden flight in Chengdu. Several changes were made to J-20 prototypes, including new low-observable intake and stealth coating, as well as redesigned vertical stabilizers in 2014. Analysts noted new equipment and devices for multi-role operations such as integrated targeting pods for precision-guided munition, and six additional passive infrared sensors can also be spotted around the aircraft. In December 2015, the low rate initial production (LRIP) version of J-20 had been spotted by a military observer. Chinese state media reported in October 2017 that the designs of J-20 had been finalized, and is ready for mass production as well as combat-ready. In January 2019, Chinese media reported that a twin-seat variant of the J-20 is rumored to be in development for use in tactical bombing, electronic warfare and carrier strike roles. In November 2019, a J-20 painted in yellow primer coating was spotted during its flight testing by defense observers at the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation manufacturing facility. The aircraft is equipped with new variant of WS-10 Taihang engines with serrated afterburner nozzles to enhance stealth. Report indicated Chengdu Aerospace Corporation terminated the manufacturing of J-20 with Russian engines since mid-2019. Chinese media reported that a new variant of the J-20, the J-20B, was unveiled on July 8, 2020 and entered mass production the same day. The only change mentioned was that the J-20B was to be equipped with thrust vectoring control. Conflicting reports emerged regarding the exact engine type. Analyst Andreas Rupprecht expressed skepticism regarding the use of Russian engine on J-20, as he believes that the J-20 is using a variant of the WS-10 which he called the WS-10C. This engine has improved thrust, stealthier serrated afterburner nozzles and higher reliability, but it is not designed for thrust vectoring unlike the WS-10 TVC demonstrated on a J-10 at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. Analyst Jamie Hunter believed the new engine type is what he called WS-10B-3, a Chinese-made thrust vectoring engine demonstrated on the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow. Design =Characteristics= The J-20 has a long and wide fuselage, with a chiseled nose section and a frameless canopy. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into the delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section has twin outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round engine exhausts.\\"Worldview Report  Vol. 14\\" digitalglobe.com 2 January 2013 One important design criterion for the J-20 is high instability. This requires sustained pitch authority at a high angle of attack, in which a conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to stalling. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control.\\"Super Agile aircraft and method of flying it in supernormal flight.\\" Google Patents. Retrieved 20 March 2013 A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta wing design.Probert, B. \\"Aspects of Wing Design for Transonic and Supersonic Combat.\\" NATO.

This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows the use of a smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.\\"‰∏ÄÁßçÂ∞èÂ±ïÂº¶ÊØîÈ´òÂçáÂäõÈ£ûÊú∫ÁöÑÊ∞îÂä®Â∏ÉÂ±ÄÁ†îÁ©∂ A High Lift Low-Aspect Ratio Aerodynamic Configuration\\" sina.com Retrieved 20 March 2013\\"Translation of article ‰∏ÄÁßçÂ∞èÂ±ïÂº¶ÊØîÈ´òÂçáÂäõÈ£ûÊú∫ÁöÑÊ∞îÂä®Â∏ÉÂ±ÄÁ†îÁ©∂\\" http://www.defence.pk Retrieved 20 March 2013\\"‰∏ÄÁßçÂ∞èÂ±ïÂº¶ÊØîÈ´òÂçáÂäõÈ£ûÊú∫ÁöÑÊ∞îÂä®Â∏ÉÂ±ÄÁ†îÁ©∂ A High Lift Low-Aspect Ratio Aerodynamic Configuration\\" baidu.com Retrieved 20 March 2013 =Avionics and cockpit= The J-20 has an Electro-Optical Targeting System under its nose while six units of Distributed Aperture System (DAS) sensors are mounted around the fuselage. Radar Official information on the type of radar that J-20s use have not yet been released publicly. Some analysts believed that J-20s used Type 1475 (KLJ-5) active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with 1856 transmit/receive modules, but more recent information's revealed that this radar was designed for upgraded versions of J-11D. Other analysts point out that, based on nose cross-section of J-20 and known data about a single transmit/receive module surface in the J-16's AESA radar-system, J-20s likely fit 2000‚Äì2200 transmit/receive modules. Targeting and communication Prototypes after application \\"2011\\" and production models feature revised nose section with an electro-optical/infra-red targeting system and an advanced communications suite on top of the aircraft enables it to datalink with other friendly platforms in service, such as airborne early warning drones. Six electro-optic sensors called Distributed Aperture System similar to EODAS can provide 360-degree coverage for pilot with sensor fusion system combining radar signal with IR image in order to provide better situational awareness. The combination of an integrated targeting pod with spherically located passive-optical tracking system is reported similar to the design concept of Lockheed Martin F-35's avionic suite. Beijing A Star Science and Technology has developed the EOTS-86 electro-optical targeting system and Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System for the J-20 and potentially other PLAAF fighters to detect and intercept stealth aircraft.

These side bays allow closure of the bay doors prior to firing the missile, thus allowing the missile to be fired in the shortest time possible as well as enhancing stealth.\\"China claims innovation in J-20 weapons bay design\\" AINonline, Retrieved 2 March 2014Sweetman, Bill. \\"J-20 Stealth Fighter Design Balances Speed And Agility\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, 3 November 2014. Accessed: 5 November 2014. Archived on 5 November 2014 The J-20 is reported to lack an internal autocannon or rotary cannon, suggesting the aircraft is not intended to be used in short range dogfight engagements with other aircraft but engage them with from long standoff ranges with missiles such as the PL-15 and PL-21. While the fighter typically carries weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints to extend ferrying range by carrying auxiliary fuel tanks. However, much like the F-22, the J-20 is unlikely to carry fuel tanks on combat missions due to its vulnerability in such a configuration, thus this configuration remains valuable for peacetime operations, such as transiting between airbases. The fighter is able to carry four medium/long range AAMs in main bay and short-range missile one in each lateral weapon bay of the aircraft. A staggered arrangement with six PL-15s is possible depending on the rail launcher for missile mounted in the future. =Engines= The J-20 entered production powered by a Saturn AL-31 variant, reportedly the AL-31FM2 with a \\"special power setting\\" thrust of . The Shenyang WS-10 has also powered various aircraft. The WS-10B reportedly powered low rate initial production aircraft. The WS-10 may have replaced the AL-31 in mid-2019. The intended powerplant is the Xian WS-15 with a thrust of 180 kN. The J-20 requires the WS-15 to supercruise. As of August 2019, the WS-15 was in development There are conflicting reports concerning the powerplant of the TVC-equipped J-20B. The powerplant has been identified as the AL-31FM2, or a variant of the WS-10; \\"WS-10C\\" by Andreas Rupprecht, or \\"WS-10B-3\\" by Jamie Hunter. The TVC-equipped WS-10B-3 was demonstrated at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The aircraft is equipped with a retractable refueling probe embedded on the right side of the cockpit, to help the fighter to maintain stealth while flying greater distances. =Stealth= Analysts noted that the J-20's nose and canopy use a similar stealth shaping design as the F-22, yielding similar signature performance in a mature design at the front, while the aircraft's side and axi-symmetric engine nozzles may expose the aircraft to radar.Axe, David. \\"Chengdu J-20: China‚Äôs First Stealth Fighter.\\" warisboring.com, 29 December 2010. One prototype has been powered by WS-10G engines equipped with different jagged-edge nozzles and tiles for greater stealth.

Retrieved 24 February 2014. This particular aircraft, numbered '2011', performed its maiden flight on 1 March 2014 and is said to represent the initial pre-serial standard. By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown: number '2012' on 26 July 2014, number '2013' on 29 November 2014 and finally number '2015' on 19 December 2014. On 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed DSI bumps on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian AL-31 or Chinese Shenyang WS-10 turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18‚Äì19 ton WS-15 engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \\"2014\\" and \\"2015\\" predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.. In November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype is the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggest that \\"2017\\" is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' is likely the last J-20 prototype, low rate initial production of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016. It has been reported that the design of J-20 is already mature and will not directly use the 117S engine. As of March 2017 there were still a series of technical problems that needed to be tackled, including the reliability of its WS-15 engines, the aircraft's flight control system, stealth coatings and hull materials, and infrared sensor. =Production= In late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the LRIP version of the aircraft. In October 2017, Chinese media reported that Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC) initiated a series production for the J-20 and is on a path towards achieving full operational capability with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Initially, the lack of a suitable indigenously produced engine hindered the mass production of the J-20, however in September 2018, it was reported that issues with the development of the WS-15 engine, particularly the reliability of the turbine blades overheating at top speeds are fixed and after further minor refinements it should be ready for widespread installation by the end of 2018. In 2019, Chengdu Aerospace Corporation began to manufacture J-20 fitted with Chinese-made WS-10 Taihang engine. J-20s manufactured after mid-2019 are no longer fitted with Russian AL-31F turbofan engines. =Deployment= At least six J-20s are in active service, with tail numbers 78271-78276 identified. Another six were believed ready to be delivered by end of Dec 2016. On 9 March 2017, Chinese officials confirmed that the J-20 had entered service in the Chinese air force. It is anticipated that before 2020 China be equipped with the Chengdu J-20 low observable combat aircraft. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) has proposed that the USA could lose its lead on operational stealth aircraft. The J-20 officially entered service in September 2017 making China the second country in the world‚Äîafter the United States‚Äîand the first in Asia to field an operational fifth-generation stealth aircraft. The PLAAF began inducting J-20s into combat units in February 2018. The aircraft entered service with the 9th Air Brigade based at Wuhu Air Base, Anhui province in late 2018 ‚Äì March 2019, replacing Su-30MKK fighters previously deployed there. On 27 August 2019, the Central Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army have approved the J-20 as the PLAN's future primary fighter, beating out the FC-31. Arguments for the J-20 state that the plane is far more advanced, longer ranged and carries a heavier payload than the FC-31, while those supporting the FC-31 argued that it is cheaper, lighter and far more maneuverable than the J-20. It is likely that the J-20 would be commissioned upon the Type 002 aircraft carrier under construction, however, the length of the J-20 means that it has to be shortened to be considered operable on an aircraft carrier. =Training= Pilot training for the J-20 started as early as March 2017, after the fighter entered limited service in the initial operational capability (IOC) phase. During the IOC phase, the fighters equipped with radar reflectors, also known as Luneburg lens to enlarge and conceal the actual radar cross section. The J-20 participated in its first combat exercise in January 2018, practicing beyond-visual-range maneuvers against China's fourth-generation fighters such as J-16 and J-10C. The exercise was reported to be realistic. Training with mixed generations allow pilots to become familiar with fifth-generation aircraft, and to develop tactics both for and against them. Chinese Ministry of National Defense also revealed that J-20 has conducted night confrontation missions during several coordinated tactical training exercises. The J-20 participated in its first over-ocean combat exercise in May 2018. Strategic implications =Political= The first test flight coincided with a visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was initially interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting US delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said \\"I asked President Hu about it directly, and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and there had been a pre-planned test.\\".Wines, Michael and Elisabeth Bumiller. \\"Test Unrelated to Gates Visit, China Says.\\" The New York Times, 12 January 2011.

The U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that the United States knew about the program for a long time and that the test flight was not a surprise.Clapper, James R. \\"World Wide Threats Hearing\\" Director of National Intelligence, 10 February 2011. In 2011, Loren B. Thompson, echoed by a 2015 RAND Corporation report, felt that J-20's combination of forward stealth and long range puts America's surface assets at risk, and that a long-range maritime strike capability may cause the United States more concern than a short range air-superiority fighter like the F-22.Thompson, Loren B. \\"Chinese Fighter Test Embarrasses Gates, Casts Doubt On Goals.\\" Lexington Institute, 13 January 2011. In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the Pentagon described the J-20 as \\"a platform capable of long range, penetrating strikes into complex air defense environments.\\"\\"Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People‚Äôs Republic of China, 2011.\\" Office of the Secretary of Defense, 6 May 2011. Retrieved 16 February 2012. A 2012 report by the U.S.‚ÄêChina Economic and Security Review Commission suggests that the United States may have underestimated the speed of development of the J-20 and several other Chinese military development projects.\\"Indigenous Weapons Development in China‚Äôs Military Modernization.\\" U.S.‚ÄìChina Economic and Security Review Commission Staff Research Report, 2012. Observers were not able to reach a consensus on J-20's primary role. Based on initial photographs with focus on the aircraft's size, early speculations referred to the J-20 as an F-111 equivalent with little to no air-to-air ability. Others saw the J-20 as a potential air superiority fighter once appropriate engines become available. More recent speculations refer to the J-20 as an air-to-air fighter with an emphasis on forward stealth, high-speed aerodynamics, range, and adequate agility. The J-20 with its long range missile armament could threaten vulnerable tankers and ISR/C2 platforms such as the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS, depriving Washington of radar coverage and strike range. However one of these targets, the Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, is reported to be optimized for spotting fighter sized stealth aircraft such as the J-20. After the deployment announcement, several analysts noted that experience that the PLAAF will gain with the J-20 will give China a significant edge over India, Japan, and South Korea, which have struggled to design and produce their own fifth-generation fighters on schedule. However, despite the failure of their indigenous projects, Japan and South Korea operate the imported F-35A, negating this potential technological disparity.https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/japan-air-self-defense-force-stands- up-first-f-35a-lightning-ii-fighter- squadron/https://web.archive.org/web/20190331112705/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/03/113_266285.html United States Marine Corps created a full-scale replica (FSR) of a Chengdu J-20 in December 2018. The replica was spotted parked outside the Air Dominance Center at Savannah Hilton Head Airport in Georgia. The United States Marine Corps later confirmed that the aircraft was built for training. Controversy In April 2009, a report in The Wall Street Journal indicated that, according to the Pentagon, information from the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II had been compromised by unknown attackers that appeared to originate from China. There is some speculation that the compromise of the F-35 program may have helped in the development of the J-20.Groman, Siobhan, August Cole and Yochi Dreazen. \\"Computer Spies Breach Fighter-Jet Project.\\" The Wall Street Journal, 21 April 2009.

First patented in 1901, the Lombard Steam Log Hauler revolutionized the movement of harvested logs through the woods and set the stage for every snowmobile, tank and bulldozer ever built. Youth Alvin Lombard was born in Springfield, Maine in 1856. He demonstrated mechanical aptitude as a boy building small machines including a model wood-splitter powered by a water wheel. He demonstrated the model by cutting cucumber slices. Career At the age of 8, Alvin began working in the family sawmill in Lincoln, Maine.Harrington, John Walker How Self-taught Lumberjack Invented the World's First Endless-Tread Logging Tractor in January, 1923 Popular Science magazine pp.43&46 He later obtained patents for some of his mechanical innovations at the sawmill, and opened a blacksmith shop in Waterville, Maine with his brother, Samuel Lombard. Samuel oversaw manufacturing of sawmill and logging equipment Alvin had designed. In their shop in Waterville, the Lombard brothers produced the huge steam-powered locomotives that slid on skis and were powered by huge tracks in the rear, enabling them to travel throughout the Maine woods free from the steel tracks that limited other railroad vehicles. In time, Lombard produced smaller, diesel powered loghaulers as well as trucks, snowplows and other commercial vehicles. Lombard also obtained patents for a pulpwood debarker, a device for automatically cutting pulpwood into shorter lengths for grinding, a pulpwood crusher, a device for removing knots from sulfite process pulp, and a governor to control the speed of water turbines.

The company is best known for being the developer and producer of Blackthorn Cider, now produced by Gaymer Cider Company, a subsidiary of C&C; Group plc of Ireland. Origin In 1805, a local farmers co-operative had formed to produce cider at Norton Fitzwarren. By the early 1900s, the Reverend Cornish had started producing cider from these locally produced apples and pulp at the Heathfield Rectory. In 1911 the priest and the co-operative set-up the \\"Taunton Cider Company\\" in Norton Fitzwarren, to commercially produce his cider. After World War I After World War I, producing only non-sparkling cider in traditional wooden barrels, the methodology only allowed the products to be distributed around the wider Taunton area, and hence the company choose only to supply public houses. Becoming a private limited company in April 1921, the structure of the company changed again after the UK Government introduced the Purchase Tax on cider in 1923, but the company managed to continue to produce their basic recipe. After World War II, in the 1950s the introducing of pasteurisation gave the cider a much longer shelf life, allowing the drink to be marketed nationally. Mastering this process allowed the company to purchase local competitors Quantock Vale, Ashford Vale, Bruttons and Horrells. The 1980s By the 1980s, the company was the UK's second largest cider maker after Hereford-based H. P. Bulmer, employing 550 people at its Norton Fitzwarren site, which produced 30 million gallons of cider per annum. The main brand was Blackthorn Cider and various derivatives (Original, Dry, Sweet, Special Vat, Cool), as well as: Diamond White; Red Rock; and the draught-only Taunton Original. Autumn Gold was the sweet derivative which was available on draught, in cans and bottles throughout the country. The company also marketed and distributed Miller Genuine Draft lager in the United Kingdom in a joint agreement with the Miller Brewing Company. The 1990s In 1995 the company was bought by drinks company Matthew Clark plc ¬£256 million, which itself is now part of the Gaymers Cider Company. Revival In 2016 it was reported that the company had been revived, now based in Churchstanton. In 2017 the company moved back in to central Taunton. The reformed company received a number of accolades in 2017 including a diploma in the British Bottlers Institute annual awards, a bronze in both the British Cider Championships British Cider Championshipshttp://www.bathandwest.com/royal-bath-and-west- show/competitions/results and International Cider Awards, and Highly Commended in the Taste of the West Awards Taste of the West awardshttps://www.tasteofthewest.co.uk/product-award-winners-2017 .

When it was founded in 1946 it emerged as the main force in the Japanese post-war labour movement and led a campaign of militant strikes. However, it suffered a major backlash after only a few months in existence when a planned general strike was aborted. Internal divisions followed, and the organization was never able to recover its initial strength. Founding Sanbetsu was founded in August 1946. During its early phase it counted with around 1.5 million members. Sanbetsu was organized on initiative of the Japanese Communist Party, and the key leaders of the organization were communists. The organization was able to mobilize a large section of white-collar workers in government and civil service sectors. Salaries in the public sectors were about a half of salaries in the private sector, a fact that enabled the public sector to become a centre of radical trade unionism. Sanbetsu also established a foothold in the transportation sector.Scalapino, Robert A. The Japanese Communist Movement, 1920‚Äì1966.

Disparaged success: labor politics in postwar Japan. 1998. pp. 55-56 Following the October offensive two Sanbetsu unions, Kokur≈ç and Zentei ('Communication Ministry Workers Union'), launched a struggle for higher salaries. During this campaign calls for the overthrow of Yoshida were raised.Harari, Ehud. The Politics of Labor Legislation in Japan. Berkeley [usw.]: University of California Press, 1973. p. 61 By the end of the year, Sanbetsu was clearly the dominant force in the Japanese labour movement. Sanbetsu took part in the Economic Recovery Conference together with other unions and employers' organizations. However, the organization was reluctant to become part of the corporativist system that the Economic Recovery Conference projected. Aborted General Strike of 1947 Ii Yashiro Sanbetsu planned a major general strike for February 1, 1947. Hosoya Matsuta and the Kokur≈ç leader Ii Yashiro founded Zent≈ç ('Joint Strike Action National Committee'), consisting of Sanbetsu, Sodomei, Nichir≈ç Kaigi, the Communist Party and the Japan Socialist Party. The demand of the strike was improvement of conditions for public sector employees. Four million workers were expected to take part in the strike. During the preparations for the strike, the political atmosphere was tense. The Sanbetsu president was severely wounded in an assassination attempt in January 1947.Flath, David. The Japanese Economy. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 79 However, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers intervened and blocked the strike, claiming that the strike was contrary to the welfare of the Japanese people. The preparations for the strike had led to divisions between communists and non-communists within Sanbetsu. In its aftermath, the failed strike resulted in a political backlash for Sanbetsu and the Communist Party. Restrictions on union organizing in the public sector was imposed and key communists were fired from their employments. As a result, defections and splits occurred in Sanbetsu.Scalapino, Robert A.

Under the artistic and managerial leadership of Charles Calvert, \\"Manchester's most celebrated actor-manager\\", it soon became a great popular success. The theatre's first production, Shakespeare's The Tempest, took place on 15 October 1864; Calvert himself played Prospero and his wife took the role of Miranda. The Times newspaper of 18 October reported that the 1,590-seat theatre \\"was exceedingly well filled\\", and declared the evening \\"a brilliant success\\". The theatre subsequently became synonymous with Calvert's elaborate and historically accurate Shakespearian productions. The theatre's interior was extensively rebuilt by Alfred Darbyshire in 1869. The work included the addition of 300 seats, and featured a frieze over the proscenium painted by Henry Stacy Marks showing Shakespeare flanked by muses and his principal characters. The Prince's was the first theatre to introduce tip-up seats and \\"early doors\\" tickets, which for a premium allowed patrons to enter the theatre early, to avoid the usual opening-time crush. In 1874 the theatre was the venue for the premiere of Alfred Cellier's comic opera The Sultan of Mocha. The years after the First World War saw a decline in the theatre's fortunes, and by the 1930s the increasing competition from cinema was threatening its viability. The final performance took place in April 1940, after which the building was sold to the ABC cinema company, who intended to replace it with a large cinema complex. Although the theatre was demolished shortly afterwards, the intervention of the Second World War meant that the cinema was never built; the site is now occupied by Peter House, a large office complex completed in 1958.

While inspecting his troops' lines, Charles XII was killed by a projectile. The Swedes broke the siege off, and the Norwegians held the fortress. Alongside with the Treaty of Nystad three years later, the death of Charles XII marked the end of the imperial era in Sweden, and the beginning of the Age of Liberty (Swedish: Frihetstiden) in that country.

On display at Livrustkammaren i Stockholm. Carl Gustaf Armfeldt King Charles XII of Sweden made several campaigns into the city during the Great Northern War (Swedish: Stora nordiska kriget) as part of his campaign to capture Norway. At the close of the Great Northern War, the Norwegian Army had been weakened in early 1716 by withdrawal of 5000 of the best troops to Denmark. When rumors reached Christiania (now Oslo) that Charles XII was preparing to invade, all remaining troops in √òsterdal and Gudbrandsdal were ordered to the border at Halden and Fredrikstad. The Norwegians expected Swedish forces to invade at Kongsvinger, Basmo and/or Halden. It was at Basmo Fortress (Basmo festning) where Charles struck, crossing the border March 8, 1716. The Norwegian scorched earth policy and guerrilla raid interdiction of supply chains by the residents of Bohuslen deprived Charles of supplies, while the fortresses still held by the Norwegians behind his lines threatened his supply chain. Charles took Christiania (now Oslo), but without heavy siege artillery, was unable to take Akershus Fortress. After a brief occupation, Charles retraced his steps to the Norwegian fortresses in southeastern Norway with the objective of capturing Frederiksten. This would remove the threat at his back, and the fortifications could serve as the base for a renewed offensive later that year. Capturing the harbours at the mouth of the Glomma river would also allow him to land the necessary provisions for a successful siege of Akershus Fortress. Charles' troops attempted to take Frederiksten by storm on July 4th. His troops took the town after fierce fighting, but the citizens set fire to their own houses, forcing Charles, unable to take the fortress, to retreat and await the arrival of heavy siege guns. Unfortunately for the invading army the entire Swedish transport fleet was captured or destroyed by the Norwegian naval hero Peter Wessel Tordenskjold (1690-1720) at the Battle of Dynekilen (Slaget om Dynekilen) in Bohuslen. Running low on supplies, Charles retreated hastily across the Svinesund and burned the bridges behind him. By July 12, 1716 all Swedish troops had been withdrawn from the area around Fredriksten.  Siege of 1718  Charles came again to besiege the fortress in autumn of 1718 with 40,000 men. He did this intending to first capture Fredriksten fortress to be able to sustain a siege of Akershus. By first taking the border areas, Charles wished to avoid a repeat of the fiasco he had suffered two years before. The 1,400 strong garrison of Frederiksten fought ferociously to hold back the invasion, but suffered a severe setback when, on December 8th the forward fortification, Gyldenl√∏ve fort, at Fredriksten fell. Encouraged by their very hard-fought success the Swedish army intensified their efforts against the main fort. The Swedish trenches had almost reached the main fortification walls when on the evening of December 11th (Swedish calendar: November 30), 1718, a projectile (probably a large musket ball or grapeshot) struck and killed Charles XII through the left temple while he inspected the trench- works. The death of the king effectively ended the attack on Fredriksten and the invasion was called off, leading to the conclusion of the war. References Related reading *√Öberg.

An enormously thick series of sediments deposited over millions of years in environments ranging from nearshore to deep water, it makes up much of the crest of the Santa Ynez range north of Montecito, as well as portions of the San Rafael Mountains in the interior of the county. Its softer shales weather to saddles and swales, supporting a dense growth of brush, and its sandstones form prominent outcrops.Dibblee (1966) 20-22 Type locality, description, and distribution Weathered Juncal Shale. Quarter for scale. The type locality of the Juncal Formation is found north of the Santa Ynez River and east of Agua Caliente Canyon, near Juncal Campground in the Los Padres National Forest, where the unit is well-exposed. At the type locality the Juncal Formation is 3,360 feet thick, which is about average; elsewhere it is both thicker and thinner, reaching 5,400 feet thick near the Romero Saddle north of Carpinteria, and thinning to 1,500 feet north of the Santa Ynez Fault in Oso and Redrock Canyons. The unit consists of shales and sandstones, with the shales being generally more abundant, particularly near the top of the stratigraphic column.Dibblee (1966) 22 Overall the unit shows a persistent alternation of shale and sandstone layers, of widely varying thickness, indicating frequent and erratic changes in water depth at the point of deposition. The lithologic characteristics of the unit are different north and south of the Santa Ynez River. South of the river, on the north slope and on the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains, the shales are darker and a thick interior sandstone member can be mapped as a separate unit. Page, Marks, and Walker, in their 1951 report on the region mapped it as the \\"Camino Cielo Sandstone member.\\"Page, B.M., Marks, J.G., Walker, G.W. Stratigraphy and structure of mountains northeast of Santa Barbara, California. Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Vol. 35 No. 8. 1951. p. 1749 North of the river, the unit contains fossil oyster beds in a sandstone member at its base, and an interior sandstone member is massive and cliff-forming, unlike anything in the Juncal of the Santa Ynez Mountains. Shales of the unit are micaceous and dark, usually gray or brown, weathering to various colors. Sandstones are arkosic, hard, and range from white to tan in color. The shale weathers readily, and supports a dense growth of chaparral, similar to the other shale units in the Santa Ynez Mountains, such as the Cozy Dell.Thomas M. Dibblee, 1986. Geologic Map of the Santa Barbara Quadrangle, Santa Barbara County, California. California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology. Dibblee Foundation Map DF#06.Dibblee (1966) 20-21, 24 The unit lies conformably on the Sierra Blanca Limestone, a relatively thin, separately-mapped limestone unit, in some areas. Where the Sierra Blanca is not present the unit lies unconformably on older units ‚Äì including the Jalama Formation and Espada Formations, both of Cretaceous age; and in some places the Juncal lies unconformably on the Franciscan Formation, which is probably of Jurassic age.Norris, 77-80Dibblee (1966) 21-24 Deposition environment and tectonic history Sometime during the late Cretaceous period, the sea withdrew from the area that was to become the California coast in the region of Santa Barbara and Ventura, exposing the sediments that had accumulated during tens of millions of years underwater ‚Äì the Espada and Jalama Formations ‚Äì and they began to erode. In the early Eocene, the sea returned, resuming sediment deposition on the eroded surface, making an unconformity. The first unit deposited in the Eocene was the limestone Sierra Blanca Formation, although only north of the Santa Ynez Fault, and then the ancient sea deposited the Juncal Formation on top of the Sierra Blanca.Norris, 77-81 At this time, the crustal block on which these units were deposited was nearer to the present-day position of San Diego; it has twisted approximately 90 degrees clockwise during the last 15 million years, as part of a process of regional, extensional deformation associated with motion along the boundary of the Pacific and North American Plates.Deborah R. Harden. California Geology. Prentice Hall, 1997. p. 398Marilyn E. Tennyson and Caroline M. Isaacs, \\"Geologic setting and petroleum geology of Santa Maria and Santa Barbara Basins, Coastal California.\\" In: Isaacs, Caroline M. and Rullk√∂tter, J√ºrgen. The Monterey Formation: From Rocks to Molecules. Columbia University Press, 2001. p. 218. At first the sea was shallow, and the first part of the Juncal Formation to be deposited was in a shallow-water environment with reefs. This portion of the unit includes calcareous sandstones and shales and sandstones with lenses of limestone, as well as come conglomerates. Gradually the sea deepened, resulting in the deposition of finer-grained sediments, although mixed in with the shales that resulted are coarser-grained sediments such as sandstones, indicating an alternating regime of deep and shallow water over the millions of years in which the Juncal Formation was laid down. Another peculiarity of the unit is that fossil foraminifers from very different depth environments are often mixed together; this has been interpreted as the result of turbidity currents and other submarine mass movements. Rip-up clasts and conglomerates which appear in the Juncal also support this interpretation.Minor, Scott A. \\"Geologic Map of the Reyes Peak Quadrangle, Ventura County, California.\\" United States Geological Survey Open File Report 2004‚Äî1420. 2004. Some of the foraminifers are characteristic of lower bathyal depths, indicating that some of the Juncal formation was deposited at a depth of up to 2,000 meters. Paleontology While the formation is rich in microfossils, particularly foraminifers,County of Santa Barbara. Paleontological Resources section from the Lompoc Wind Project Final Environmental Impact Report . 3.12-4 larger fossils are uncommon. However, some of the stratigraphically lowest beds ‚Äì such as the portion which is in contact with the Sierra Blanca limestone formation ‚Äì contain larger fossils characteristic of nearshore and reef environments. These include oysters, especially in limestone-rich beds and limestone lenses. Other fossils from the Juncal include algae, worms, brachiopods and molluscs.Dibblee (1966) 22, 24 Economic importance As a potential hydrocarbon resource, the unit is grouped with above-lying sedimentary units as part of the Gaviota-Sacate- Matilija Sandstone Play. While the Juncal Formation itself does not likely contain large pools of oil or gas, it may be a source rock for petroleum found in other units, particularly low-sulfur oil in offshore reservoirs.James M.

In September of that year he accepted a job at a non-profit organization dealing with people with psychological problems, prisoners and aliens seeking a positive resolution of their immigration status in Belgium.

After the fall of Kisangani on 15 March 1997, businessman Jeannot Bemba Saolona and Ambassador Pelendo charge Dungia with the mission to deliver in Goma a message from the Ngbaka people to the leader of the rebellion Laurent Kabila, speaking on the behalf of the Ngbaka community.

Upon his return, Dungia was appointed Chief of the diplomatic mission in Pretoria, following the arrest of its former head shortly before the trip to South Africa. Nelson Mandela and Emmanuel Dungia, Pretoria, South Africa, August 1997 Dungia was appointed ambassador to Bangui in July 1998, with jurisdiction over the Republic of Congo and Chad. According to his own reports, he was deeply mistrusted by the DRC government and faced harassment. Citing a lack of accreditation document as Ambassador of the DRC, Dungia returns to Kinshasa after two days in Chad as the Central African authorities refuse to receive him. In 1999, Laurent Kabila decided that Dungia should return to South Africa, but the South African authorities did not respond to DRC's request for the accreditation of its Ambassador. In May 2000, Kabila appointed him as his Special Adviser to Georges Leta, the deputy assistant chief of the National Intelligence Agency. However, after Nelly Ntwite, the President's private secretary, fed false information that Dungia was supposedly an agent of Ngbaka rebel Jean-Pierre Bemba, Dungia was placed under surveillance by Kabila until his assassination on January 16, 2001. =Arrest and 2nd exile= On 19 February 2001, Dungia was arrested by the security department of the Presidential Guard on allegations of being involved in a plot to overthrow the new president Joseph Kabila.

With the assistance of the Voice of the voiceless (Voix des sans-voix), one of the non-governmental organizations that had supported the cause of the prisoners unjustly accused in the trial, Dungia attempted to make the ireegularities in the trial public, but the event was prohibited under threat by the Military Court. Dungia instead published the text of his statement in the paper La Temp√™te des Tropiques on September 28, 2001. The Congolese government tried to abduct him one night in the Protestant Center where he had settled with his wife upon his release from prison. In April 2002, he fled with his wife to Brazzaville.

Personal life Emmanuel Dungia, √âcole Royale des Cadets, Brussels (Laeken), 1962 Dena (son) and Emmanuel Dungia, Rome, Italy, February 1989 =Family background= Emmanuel Dungia was born Emmanuel Dedetemo. De de te mo translates literally into Ngbaka by doing to yourself. Figuratively, one interpretation would be: Take care of yourself without letting anyone influence you. The name DUNGIA comes from NDUNGIA, from which the \\"N\\" letter was removed in 1957 when changes to make Congolese surnames uniform and legal were implemented by the colonial authority. Ndungia exists in the Ngbaka tribe, but is not commonly used and its significance is unknown. The Belgian colonial authority procedures were overturned by colonel Mobutu in 1967 when he introduced the concept of authentic Congolese nationalism or authentic Zairian revolution whose sole purpose was to erase the colonial history of the country. Emmanuel Dungia is the father of 4 children. In 1998 Dungia married for the second time but his wife will be struck death by sudden illness in November 2004 few months after their return from Brazzaville. =Health and death= During his stay in South Africa between 1997 and 1998 Dungia was diagnosed with cancer that might have developed as early as 1995. It was thought to be a benign cancer that could be treated successfully. Without treatment he was expected to live only another 5 years. Dungia had aversion, if not an extreme fright of hospitals and especially surgical rooms, and could not stand the sight of blood. As a consequence, he failed to follow his treatment as advised until 2005 when he was forced to return to Brussels for medical care that ultimately proved unsuccessful. He died on 1 February 2006.

He was also a philologist, and Professor of Hebrew (and Oriental Languages) at Edinburgh University.right Early life He was born on 2 July 1759, the son of Rev Roger Moodie, Minister of Gartly, Strathbogie and Margaret Scott. His father moved to the post of Minister of Monimail, near Cupar, in 1766, where William attended the Parish School. In 1773, he enrolled at the University of St Andrews. His father died when he was sixteen, in 1775, and he moved to Edinburgh, where \\"he finished his course of Theological study with distinguished approbation\\"Moodie, page ix Contested appointment He was licensed by the Presbytery to preach the gospel in 1781 and became tutor to the family of James Oswald of Dunnikier. William apparently impressed with his preaching and Mr Oswald, the Parish's Patron, along with several other parishioners presented him to the Parish of Kirkcaldy. This was \\"violently opposed\\" by others, but he was ordained Minister of Kirkcaldy on 9 June 1784. His biographer says he won over the doubters by showing no resentments himself and being an exemplary Minister. > \\"Carefully avoiding those intricate discussions, which tend rather to > perplex than to enlighten the mind, he was guided in his selection of > subjects for discourse, by their general importance and utility ...The > striking light in which he exhibited the truth of the gospels; the clearness > with which he explained its doctrines and its precepts; the tenderness with > which he applied its consolations to soothe the afflicted; the solemnity > with which he warned the impenitent of the consequences of their guilt, and > the earnestness with which he exhorted the righteous to persevere in the > paths of holiness, roused the attention and interested the hearts of all > whom he addressed.\\"Moodie, page x However, he did feel obliged to refer to his opponents, at some length, in his final sermon before he left for Edinburgh three years later, telling them he bore them no ill-will, and leaving them to their consciences.Moodie, page xiv Professor of Hebrew In 1787, he was asked by the Town Council of Edinburgh to be Minister of St Andrew's Church in the fashionable New Town and he took up post on 25 October 1787. Six years later (1793) they added the post of Professor of Hebrew and Oriental Languages at the University, which he held in conjunction with his position at St Andrew's Church until he died. During this time he initially lived on North Hanover Street and then at 12 Frederick Street, both at that time, new Georgian townhouses in the First New Town of Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory; 1792 In 1788 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, James Hutton and Rev James Finlayson. He taught Hebrew and Chaldaic to students as required by the University, and \\"by divesting it (Hebrew) of every useless encumbrence, he exhibited it to their view in all its native simplicity and beauty\\". He also added Persian to the curriculum. It is not one of the Christian sacred languages, but he seems to have a particular fondness for Persian and its culture ‚Äì the science, philosophy and (particularly) poetry. He had acquired proficiency in this language by private study and, by daily conversation with a \\"learned native of India\\" then in residence in Edinburgh, acquired a perfect pronunciation. Persian was the diplomatic language of the Indian Empire, where many Edinburgh students hoped to make a career, so his classes were a success. He liked to compare the Hebrew and Persian grammars with what he called Universal Grammar so as to highlight the differences, so that his students developed judgement and not just a memory for words. He edited the third edition of a standard Hebrew GrammarWilson's Hebrew Grammar and he corresponded worldwide with other renowned Persian scholars (a number of whom suggested, in 1800, that they set up an Oriental Society).Monthly Magazine; p. 467 The University made him Doctor of Divinity in 1798. Ministry He thought of his Edinburgh congregation as a diverse one. He certainly was in attendance in 1788 at the hanging for theft and shopbreaking of one Peter Young. Others had a more jaundiced view. A reviewer of his published sermons thought > His audience was almost entirely composed of the higher classes of society. > He was attended chiefly by the fashionable and the gay, the wealthy and the > learned; and he succeeded in obtaining, what appears to have been the object > of his ambition, their applause and admiration of his discourses.Pratt, pp. > 510-514 The same reviewer, while noting the elegance of the discourses, was scandalised at the lack of what he thought of as proper Christian content in the sermons ‚Äì such as, the consciousness of human depravity, the need for conversion, repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, to avoid an otherwise certain eternal punishment. It may well have been Mr Moodie's distaste for these topics that had prompted such opposition in Kirkaldy. Parishioners who felt their rights as Presbyterias were being over-ridden resented having so- called Moderate Ministers imposed on them ‚Äì appointed by Patrons or presented by the local landowners. They wished to interrogate the firmness of the proposed Minister's adherence to standards of belief such as the Westminster Confession of Faith, rather than his broader accomplishments, or connections. There were social class elements to this division, which were highly sensitive around the time of the French Revolution. The Evangelicals, as the opponents of the Moderates, were called, were by no means confined to the lower orders, but they were well represented among them and those in power feared the issue might be used as a front for more political unrest. Mr Moodie was very much a Moderate and supported measures \\"he thought conducive to the respectability of our eccesiastical establishment, to the maintenance of public order, and to the advancement of true religion\\".Moodie, page xxvi Moderator of the General Assembly In 1799, just short of his 40th birthday, on 23 May 1799, Rev. Dr. William Moodie was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It was in the middle of the French Revolutionary Wars and Britain was haunted by the threat of foreign invasion coupled with insurrection at home, particularly in Ireland and in the industrial areas. Dr Moodie presided over a fairly anxious meeting. After congratulating the King on recent naval victories on the Nile and off the Irish coast, the General Assembly expressed gratitude for living in such a free country under so beneficent a king. It deprecated the savage actions of the French Revolutionaries and their attacks on established order and even Christianity itself. The King, in a letter, had asked them to do all in their power to keep their parishioners loyal and virtuous, which they in turn promised to do. They also adopted a Declaratory Act, against \\"unlicensed\\" or \\"vagrant\\" teachers of the gospel, especially those teaching outdoors or in unregulated Sabbath schools, where loose talk about democracy and Thomas Paine could lead to trouble. A Public Admonition was drawn up, to be read out in every Parish, reminding their parishioners of the happy country in which they are blest to dwell, warning them about the evils of the French Revolutionaries, or of listening to the unlicensed teachers or attending unregulated Sunday schools. A Committee reported on a detailed examination of the law, which, it claimed, gave the Parish Minister the right to inspect all educational premises in his parish, including the Universities and private or voluntary establishments.Acts, pp. 865‚Äì875 At this time he had moved house within the New Town to 7 George Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory; 1800 Modern Moderation? John Kay's caricature \\"Modern Moderation\\"Kay, page 356 shows how seriously Mr Moodie took this responsibility. When some Sabbath School teachers asked him to visit them to reassure them and him that they were law-abiding, orthodox Christians, he turned up, and without giving a moment's attention to them, told the pupils to leave immediately and their parent's would answer any questions. Later, in 1805, he was part of a group of Edinburgh clergy who opposed the appointment of John Leslie as Professor of Mathematics at the University, for holding views \\"destructive of all religion\\". In his \\"Essay on Heat\\" he had seemed to approve of some aspect of the work of sceptical philosopher David Hume. They pursued him through the Presbytery and the Synod up to the General Assembly. There was a tumultuous debate, for which the public queued for hours to get in, after which the Assembly dismissed the complaint against Professor Leslie.The Scots Magazine; pp. 400-403 There is a letter from Robert Burns to Dr Moodie, defending his friend James Clarke, schoolmaster at Moffat against a charge of cruelty to his pupils.Paterson, page 381 Personal life He married Johanna Lindsay on 10 November 1786, who died 24 August 1796, and had a daughter Margaret, born 29 December 1789; son John, born December 1790, died 10 February 1791; George Mackenzie, born 7 February 1795, died 13 March 1800; Sarah, born 11 August 1796 (who married Dugald Campbell, Minister of Glassary in Argyleshire, who wrote the Statistical Account of Scotland Report for the Parish). Dr Moodie thus had a fairly tragic personal life. He was also afflicted with a \\"weak stomach\\" and was subject to such violent attack in 1803 that it seemed he would not recover and he had to abandon the pulpit. By now he had an assistant Minister, David Ritchie, Professor of Logic at the University. In 1810, he had another attack and had to abandon preaching again. He began to prepare his sermons for publications (for the benefit of posterity). After a stay in the countryside, he seemed to recover during the winter of that year, but it returned in force in May 1712 and he died on 11 June 1812. His congregation arranged for the publication of his sermons, to which was attached an account of his life by someone who seemed very close and familiar with him. He was mourned by his family, colleagues and congregation  Publications  * Political Preaching, or the Meditations of a Well-meaning Man, in a letter addressed to the Rev.

Walking in Austria, 1st ed., Cicerone, Milnthorpe, p. 265, . It is owned by the Turner Alps Kr√§nzchen Section of the German Alpine Club.  Location  The hut is located on the sunny southern side of the Wilder Kaiser ridge on a grassy terrace high above the villages of Ellmau and Going with an outstanding view that, on clear days, takes in the Gro√üvenediger. Towering above this heavily frequented hut is the Ellmauer Halt that, at , is the highest mountain in the Kaisergebirge range. On fine summer days the Grutten Hut is a popular destination for hikers and an important base for mountaineers and climbers, who can set out from here on numerous Alpine tours to the summits of the Wilder Kaiser.  History  The Grutten Hut was built in 1899 on its present site by the Alpen Turner Kr√§nzchen Section and Carl Babenstuber and was ceremonially opened on 14 July 1900. Soon afterwards a glass veranda, a wash house and a mule stable were built. In 1922 a separate sleeping block, the Josef Dorn Haus was built and in 1925 the then manager of the hut, Hans Eisenmann, created a climbing area through the Wilde Gschlo√ü, the present-day Jubil√§umssteig. In 1938 there were further modifications and extensions, including another sleeping block, the Emil Kempfle Haus. During the Second World War the Grutten Hut was commandeered and it remained closed until 1951 after the border opening when there was a great influx into the Tyrol. In the 1960s further major upgrades and extensions were added. Even after a new well was dug, its supply was hardly any greater, and just before its 100th anniversary a costly sewer conduit was built. This not only ensures the supply of water and drainage, but also provides the lodge with electricity and telephone service. In 2002, the sanitary facilities were modernized and a wooden terrace was built.  Access  By car from Kufstein drive through Scheffau to Ellmau.

While the Pegasus is the logo and mascot of the university, Knightro is the mascot of university's athletic programs, the UCF Knights. The Pegasus logo is popular among students and the community, and UCF's equestrian club maintains a mascot program, which owns a \\"Pegasus\\" horse, a gray Andalusian stallion. Portraying \\"Pegasus,\\" the horse often appears at home football games at Spectrum Stadium, and other home sporting events, such as baseball and softball, and alumni events. History The University of Central Florida was founded in 1963 as the Florida Technological University. In 1968, UCF's first president, Dr. Charles N. Millican, and a citizen advisory group, designed the university's Pegasus seal. The logo and the school's first mascot was approved on April 5, 1968. The Pegasus became the school's first athletic mascot in 1970, when UCF students voted and selected the \\"Knight of Pegasus\\" as their mascot over \\"Vincent the Vulture\\" which had been the university's unofficial mascot. Today, the Pegasus logo may be seen in the university's commercials and advertisements, and adorned on almost every building. Pegasus program The Burnett Honors College In 2001, the UCF Alma Mater Society established the Pegasus Mascot Program to provide both riders as well as horses for the role as Pegasus and the UCF Knight. Every fall semester students are eligible to submit applications to become the UCF Knight, but only the best riders at UCF are accepted. The creation of the Equestrian Club at UCF was due to the need for riders for Pegasus Mascot Program, and now every student trying out must be a member. The program is entirely run by the students, with the guidance of the UCF Alumni Association. As well as the opportunity to try out to become the UCF Knight, students may choose to help at events, therefore become \\"squires\\". All squires must also be members of the Equestrian Club at UCF. =The horses= The university has had an array of horses used as Pegasus during its history. Since the creation of the Pegasus Mascot Program in 2001, all horses used must be white. Horses have been donated by Burt Reynolds, UCF Board of Trustees member Rick Walsh and Medieval Times. In 2009, the famed touring show the \\"World Famous\\" Lipizzaner Stallions agreed to provide their horses for the program. The current Pegasus is a gray and white Andalusian stallion who used to be a solo horse on the tour. \\"Maluso\\" as he is known at the barn, has been trained in Classical dressage also known as haute ecole, made famous by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria. His signature move is his rear which he performs at every home football game. The current Pegasus is also known for his tongue that he sticks out for his fans.

A small United States Marine Corps (USMC) reconnaissance platoon inflicted large casualties on regular People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) fighters before withdrawing with only a few dead.  Background  In June 1966, the 1st Marine Division began expanding its Tactical Area of Responsibility north into Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province (today part of Qu·∫£ng Nam Province). In order to interdict enemy fighters between Tam K·ª≥ and the Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c District, Brigadier General William A. Stiles conceived of an extensive reconnaissance effort in the area. Dubbed Operation Kansas, the initial phase was to find the headquarters of the PAVN 2nd Division near the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, then exploit that in the second phase by engaging with eight battalions of Marine and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) infantry. On the afternoon and evening of the 13th, seven teams from 1st Reconnaissance Battalion were deployed in the area around N√∫i L·ªôc S∆°n and Qu·∫ø S∆°n, ringing the valley. They were tasked to report on enemy activity via AN/PRC-25 radio, and to call in artillery fire and airstrikes. While most of the teams successfully avoided detection, a scout dog accompanying an enemy patrol caught scent of one team near Hill 555. As the patrol advanced towards their position, the team hastily retreated and were exfiltrated by helicopter to Chu Lai. Team 2 was deployed at dusk on 13 June, a platoon of 16 Marines and 2 attached corpsmen, under the leadership of Staff Sergeant Jimmie E. Howard. They were dropped off near the top of Hill 488, known to locals as Nui Vu, near Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c. Settling into static positions atop the hill, they established a defensive perimeter around the poorly-covered and -concealed hilltop to establish their observation post. By constant observation over the next few days, the team was able to monitor many enemy patrols and troop movements, and successfully called in artillery fire from a nearby artillery battery about to the south. Though they became concerned that the enemy might conclude they were being observed, Howard decided against exfiltration on the evening of the 14th. Requesting permission from the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Sullivan, to remain in the area for one more day, he cited a good escape route to the east, and his request was granted.  Battle  On the 14th, the PAVN began organizing a force to attack the post. On the night of the 15th, a nearby Army Special Forces team leading a Civilian Irregular Defense Group patrol radioed warning that a full battalion of about 200 to 250 PAVN and VC were closing in. At 22:00 that night, Lance Corporal Ricardo C. Binns fired the first shots from his M14 rifle. The PAVN/VC quickly surrounded the Marines and advanced in too close for fire support to assist. DShK and 60mm mortar fire kept the Marines from maneuvering out of their hilltop positions. After the initial contact, the Marines withdrew from their outposts to the main position near a rocky knoll, and the PAVN/VC responded with a shower of hand grenades and a short assault that was repelled. Switching to more cautious tactics, the PAVN/VC began quietly probing the Marine's lines for weaknesses, being rebuffed violently each time, forcing them to withdraw long enough to regroup. Near midnight, Howard radioed his company commander, Captain Tim Geraghty, to ask for extraction and close air support, but these were delayed at III Marine Amphibious Force's (III MAF) Direct Air Support Center. After fending off another coordinated assault, the Marines were low on ammunition, and all of them had been wounded by that point. While the frustrated pilots circled the area without being able to see clear targets, a C-47 deployed flares for illumination at around 01:00. Early into the morning, as Marines traded taunts with the enemy, the pilots began dangerously close attack missions, including one Air Force F-105, Marine F8U Crusaders, and helicopter gunships. Armed UH-1Es stayed with the Marines through the morning until the end of the battle, often serving as airborne forward air controllers with the aid of Howard and his red-filtered flashlight. As the PAVN/VC launched their third assault, Howard forbade the use of automatic fire to conserve ammunition. Out of grenades, the Marines threw rocks in the hopes that the enemy would confuse them for live explosives. A pair of UH-34 Choctaws attempted to land at about 03:00, but were driven off by heavy fire. By 04:00, six of the eighteen Americans had been killed, and Howard was immobilized by a wound to his back, using Binns to relay commands to the platoon while he called in air strikes. The PAVN/VC ceased offensive tactics and dug into cover (as daylight made them vulnerable to unassisted air attack), but kept the Marines trapped on the hilltop. During a lull in the fighting, Major William J. Goodsell, commanding officer of VMO-6, risked a landing to medevac the wounded, but was shot down and later died of his wounds. When a second UH-1 offered itself as bait to draw out enemy positions, it too was shot down, killing a crew chief. Two other Marines were killed of gunshot wounds in their helicopters. Just before 10:00, Company C, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines arrived on the south face in UH-34s. While the reconnaissance team was evacuated immediately, the infantry company remained for a few hours to finish the fight. After brief resistance, the PAVN/VC retreated in the face of the reinforcements, leaving forty-two of their dead behind.  Aftermath  Statement by Jimmie E. Howard After both sides had retreated, the battle had lasted approximately twelve hours of vicious fighting, some hand-to-hand. The marines of Team 2 lost six men, Company C lost four, and the two aviation squadrons lost two Marines each, along with two UH-1Es. US claims the PAVN/VC casualties range from 42 to 100 or 200. The first phase of Operation Kansas ended on the 16th, and the second phase of the operation was modified. The ARVN forces were unavailable due to fighting at Hu·∫ø, but Lieutenant General Lewis William Walt, the commander of III MAF, ordered the operation to continue. With 141 reported sightings, Marine infantry and fire support dispersed PAVN troops from the area, and the operation ended on the 22nd. The next month, Sullivan would take his battalion onto Operation Washington. Each member of Team 2 was decorated for their actions, each also receiving the Purple Heart for their wounds. Howard was promoted to Gunnery Sergeant and received the Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House on 21 August 1967. Commissioned in 2001, would be named for him. Four would receive the Navy Cross: Corporal Binns, Petty Officer Second Class Billee Don Holmes, while Corporal Jerrald Thompson and Lance Corporal John Adams would be awarded posthumously. The remaining thirteen would all receive Silver Stars, four posthumously, as were two members of Company C. The desperate nature of the fighting, often hand-to-hand, lead to comparisons with Battle of the Alamo and The Longest Day.

The model, proposed by research psychologist Jeffrey Alan Gray in 1970, is well-supported by subsequent research and has general acceptance among professionals.Matthews, Gerald & Gilliland, Kirby. (1999). The personality theories of H. J. Eysenck and J. A. Gray: A comparative review. Personality and Individual Differences. 26. 583-626. 10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00158-5. Gray hypothesized the existence of two brain-based systems for controlling a person's interactions with their environment: the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioural activation system (BAS).Gray, J.A. (1981). A critique of Eysenck's theory of personality, In H.J. Eysenck (Ed.) A model for personality (pp 246‚Äì276)Gray, J.A. (1982). The neuropsychology of anxiety: An enquiry into the functions of the septo-hippocampal system.M.P. Feldman, A.M. Broadhurst (Eds.), Theoretical and experimental bases of behaviour modification, Wiley, London (1976), pp. 3‚Äì41 BIS is related to sensitivity to punishment and avoidance motivation. BAS is associated with sensitivity to reward and approach motivation. Psychological scales have been designed to measure these hypothesized systems and study individual differences in personality. Neuroticism, a widely studied personality dimension related to emotional functioning, is positively correlated with BIS scales and negatively correlated with BAS scales. History The biopsychological theory of personality is similar to another one of Gray's theories, reinforcement sensitivity theory. The Biopsychological Theory of Personality was created after Gray disagreed with Hans Eysenck's arousal theory that dealt with biological personality traits.Gray, Jeffrey A.; Neil McNaughton (1982). \\"The neuropsychology of anxiety: An inquiry into the functions of the septo- hippocampal system.\\". Oxford University Press. Eysenck looked at the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) for answering questions about personality. The ARAS is part of the brain structure and has been proposed to deal with cortical arousal, hence the term arousal theory. Eysenck compared levels of arousal to a scale of introversion versus extraversion. The comparison of these two scales was then used to describe individual personalities and their corresponding behavioral patterns.Larsen, R. J. & Buss, D. M. (2008). Personality Psychology.New York: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Gray disagreed with Eysenck's theory because Gray believed that things such as personality traits could not be explained by just classical conditioning. Instead, Gray developed his theory which is based more heavily on physiological responses than Eysenck's theory. Gray had a lot of support for his theories and experimented with animals to test his hypotheses. Using animal subjects allows researchers to test whether different areas of the brain are responsible for different learning mechanisms. Specifically, Gray's theory concentrated on understanding how reward or punishment related to anxiety and impulsivity measures. His research and further studies have found that reward and punishment are under the control of separate systems and as a result people can have different sensitivities to such rewarding or punishing stimuli.  Behavioral inhibition system  The behavioral inhibition system (BIS), as proposed by Gray, is a neuropsychological system that predicts an individual's response to anxiety-relevant cues in a given environment. This system is activated in times of punishment, boring things, or negative events. By responding to cues such as negative stimuli or events that involve punishment or frustration, this system ultimately results in avoidance of such negative and unpleasant events. According to Gray's Theory, the BIS is related to sensitivity to punishment as well as avoidance motivation. It has also been proposed that the BIS is the causal basis of anxiety.Gray J.A., The psychophysiological basis of introversion-extraversion (1970) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 8 (3), pp. 249-266. High activity of the BIS means a heightened sensitivity to nonreward, punishment, and novel experience. This higher level of sensitivity to these cues results in a natural avoidance of such environments in order to prevent negative experiences such as fear, anxiety, frustration, and sadness. People who are highly sensitive to punishment perceive punishments as more aversive and are more likely to be distracted by punishments. The physiological mechanism behind the BIS is believed to be the septohippocampal system and its monoaminergic afferents from the brainstem. Using a voxel-based morphometry analysis, the volume of the regions mentioned was assessed to view individual differences. Findings may suggest a correlation between the volume and anxiety-related personality traits. Results were found in the orbitofrontal cortex, the precuneus, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex.  Behavioral activation system  The behavioral activation system (BAS), in contrast to the BIS, is based on a model of appetitive motivation - in this case, an individual's disposition to pursue and achieve goals. The BAS is aroused when it receives cues corresponding to rewards and controls actions that are not related to punishment, rather actions regulating approachment type behaviors. This system has an association with hope. According to Gray's theory, the BAS is sensitive to conditioned appealing stimuli, and is associated with impulsivity. It is also thought to be related to sensitivity to reward as well as approach motivation. The BAS is sensitive to nonpunishment and reward. Individuals with a highly active BAS show higher levels of positive emotions such as elation, happiness, and hope in response to environmental cues consistent with nonpunishment and reward, along with goal-achievement. In terms of personality, these individuals are also more likely to engage in goal-directed efforts and experience these positive emotions when exposed to impending reward. The physiological mechanism for BAS is not known as well as BIS, but is believed to be related to catecholaminergic and dopaminergic pathways in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter commonly linked with positive emotions, which could explain the susceptibility to elation and happiness upon achieving goals which has been observed. People with a highly active BAS have been shown to learn better by reward than by punishment, inverse to BIS as mentioned above. BAS is considered to include trait impulsivity that is also related to psychopathological disorders such as ADHD, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse. The higher the BAS score, or the higher the impulsive, the more it is likely to be related to psycho-pathological or dis-inhibitory disorders. Certain aspects of the dopaminergic reward system activate when reward cues and reinforcers are presented, including biological rewards such as food and sex. These brain areas, which were highlighted during multiple fMRI studies, are the same areas associated with BAS.  Compare and contrast  Together, the two systems work in an inverse relationship. In other words, when a specific situation occurs, an organism can approach the situation with one of the two systems. The systems will not be stimulated at the same time and which system is dominant depends on the situation in terms of punishment versus reward.Gray, J. A. (1987). The psychology of fear and stress. New York: Cambridge University Press. This phenomenon of the differentiation between the two systems is thought to occur because of the distinct areas in the brain that becomes activated in response to different stimuli. This difference was noted years ago through electrical stimulation of the brain.Nebylitsyn, V. D. & Gray, J. A. (1972). Biological bases of individual behavior. New York: Academic Press, Inc. The behavioral activation system and behavioral inhibition system differ in their physiological pathways in the brain. The inhibition system has been shown to be linked to the septo-hippocampal system which appears to have a close correlation to a serotonergic pathway, with similarities in their innervations and stress responses. On the other hand, the activation, or reward system, is thought to be associated more with a mesolimbic dopaminergic system as opposed to the serotonergic system. The two systems proposed by Gray differ in their motivations and physiological responses. Gray also proposed that individuals can vary widely in their responsiveness of the behavioral inhibition system and the behavioral activation system. It has been found that someone who is sensitive to their BIS will be more receptive to the negative cues as compared to someone who is sensitive to their BAS and therefore responds more to cues in the environment that relate to that system, specifically positive or rewarding cues. Researchers besides Gray have shown interest in this theory and have created questionnaires that measure BIS and BAS sensitivity. Carver and White have been the primary researchers responsible for the questionnaire. Carver and White created a scale that has been shown to validly measure levels of individual scores of BIS and BAS. This measure focuses on the differences in incentive motivations and aversive motivations. As previously mentioned these motivations correlate to impulsivity and anxiety respectively. Applications Since the development of the BAS and BIS, tests have been created to see how individuals rate in each area. The questionnaire is called the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Questionnaire. People can be tested based on their activation of either systems by using an EEG.citation needed These tests will conclude whether a person has a more active BIS or BAS. The two systems are independent of each other. These tests can determine different things about a person's personality. They can determine if a person has more positive or negative moods. Using psychological test scales designed to correlate with the attributes of these hypothesized systems, neuroticism has been found to be positively correlated with the BIS scale, and negatively correlated with the BAS scale. According to Richard Depue's BAS dysregulation theory of bipolar disorders, now doctors and other professionals can determine if a person with bipolar disorder is on the brink of a manic or depressive episode based on how they rate on a scale of BAS and BIS sensitivity. Essentially, this dysregulation theory proposes that people with BAS dysregulation have an extraordinarily sensitive behavioral activation system and their BAS is hyper- responsive to behavioral approach system cues. If a person with bipolar disorder self-reports high sensitivity to BAS, it means that a manic episode could occur faster. Also, if a person with bipolar disorder reports high sensitivity to BIS it could indicate a depressive phase. A better understanding of BAS dysregulation theory can inform psychosocial intervention (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, etc.). The BAS/BIS Questionnaire can also be used in the cases of criminal profiling. Previous research as reported by researchers MacAndrew and Steele in 1991 compared two groups on opposite spectrum levels of fear and the response of a variety of questions. The two groups in the study varied on levels of BIS, either high or low, and were selected by the researchers. One group was composed of women who had experienced anxiety attacks and together made up the high BIS group. The low BIS group was composed of convicted prostitutes who had been found to take part in illegal behavior. Main findings showed that the responses to the questionnaires were distinctly different between the high BIS group and the low BIS group, with the convicted women scoring lower. Results from this study demonstrate that questionnaires can be used as a valid measurement to show differences in the behavioral inhibition systems of different types of people. Gray also introduced his SPSRQ questionnaire to measure sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP) in anxiety (2012). It is a specifically designed questionnaire linking to Gray's theory referencing the SR to the BAS and the SP to the BIS. Future research or implications As mentioned previously, psychological disorders have been analyzed in terms of the behavioral inhibition and activation systems. Understanding the differences between the systems may relate to an understanding of different types of disorders that involve anxiety and impulsivity.

Early life Thaw was born on January 2, 1880, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of William Thaw, Sr., who is considered one of the 100 wealthiest Americans of all time arising from his ownership of the Pennsylvania Company, and her father's second wife, Mary Sibbet Copley. From her father's first marriage to the former Eliza Blair, she was a younger half- sister to five (that survived childhood), including Benjamin Thaw Sr., a banker and philanthropist. From her parents marriage, she was one of five additional children (that survived childhood), including Harry Kendall Thaw, who married the actress Evelyn Nesbit (and later murdered Stanford White over her affair with the architect), and Margaret Copley Thaw, who married George Lauder Carnegie, a nephew of Andrew Carnegie, and after his death, Roger, Comte de P√©rigny. Her paternal grandparents were John Thaw, an owner of the United States Bank of Philadelphia, and Elizabeth (n√©e Thomas) Thaw and her maternal grandparents were Margaret and Josiah Copley, a pioneer editor who was well known in the community. Her father died in 1889, after having given an estimated $5,000,000 to charity during his lifetime. From her father's estate, which was divided equally into one-sixteenth shares, nine year old Alice inherited coal lands (held until all of his children became of age and expected to be worth approximately $13,000,000 in the William Thaw Coke Trust), and a one-sixteenth interest in the remainder. Alice, as a daughter of her father's second wife, stood to inherit even more due to her mother's own wealth, totaling $10,000,000 in 1903. Personal life In January 1903, George Seymour, Earl of Yarmouth, an amateur actor who was a friend of her older brother Harry and was the eldest son and heir apparent of Hugh Seymour, 6th Marquess of Hertford, was a two-week guest of her mother at their rented residence on Lafayette Square in Washington (owned by former U.S. Senator J. Donald Cameron). Their engagement was announced in February 1903 and they were married shortly thereafter on April 27, 1903, in Pittsburgh, but not before the Earl \\"extorted\\" her mother to increase the dowry under the threat he would not go through the marriage. After their marriage, the couple sailed aboard the St. Paul to her husband's native England. Upon leaving the U.S., much was made about debts the Earl had accumulated while in New York, prompting him to comment to reporters: > \\"I don't owe much here and I don't want any fuss. I don't expect any, as my > lawyer is here to meet anybody who may have a claim against me. My father > has given Col. Olin money to pay my debts and I want it understood that may > wife is not paying them for me. After I leave, if any other creditor comes > forward I want him to go to Col. Olin, who will settle the bill.\\" Reportedly, \\"scores of tales have been told of the sorrowful life of the Countess, and it was a well-known fact that within a few months after the marriage the ill-treatment of his wife by the Earl began.\\" In January 1908, Alice sued Yarmouth for divorce. Their marriage was annulled in 1908 on the grounds of non-consummation. As part of the divorce, all financial interests were returned to Thaw, and she resumed using her maiden name and moved to Lenox, Massachusetts. After their divorce, her former father-in-law died in 1912, and her ex-husband succeeded to his titles as the 7th Marquess of Hertford. He died in 1940, having never remarried nor having any children and was succeeded in his titles by his nephew. =Second marriage= On March 22, 1913, Alice married for a second time to Geoffrey George Whitney Sr. (1882‚Äì1953), a stockbroker with Whitney & Elwell, at her sister's home, Plum Orchard at Dungeness on Cumberland Island in Georgia. Together, they lived in Milton, Massachusetts, maintained a summer home known as Little Harbor Farm in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and were the parents of two sons: * Geoffrey George Whitney Jr. (1915‚Äì2001), who married Pauline M.

Charlie's friend, novelist Paul Essex, dies aboard the aircraft after receiving a radiogram warning him not to ignore \\"Zodiac\\". His briefcase mysteriously disappears. Charlie meets with Deputy Police Chief J.J. Kilvaine, and runs into reporter and old friend Peter Lewis. Charlie also meets noted local magician Fred Rhadini, and discusses Essex's death with the three men. Rhadini tells Charlie about Dr. Zodiac, a psychic preying on the rich in San Francisco. Charlie, Rhadini, and Lewis go to Dr. Zodiac's home, where Dr. Zodiac conducts an eerie s√©ance. Lewis' fianc√©e, Eve Cairo, has been meeting with Dr. Zodiac, angering Lewis. Later, Kilvaine reveals that Essex was poisoned, but can't rule out suicide. Jimmy spends the afternoon following Thomas Gregory, whom he believes stole Essex's briefcase when leaving the plane. He discovers Essex's manuscript in Gregory's hotel room. That night, Charlie attends Rhadini's magic show at the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island. Rhadini's clumsy, comic acquaintance, Elmer Kelner, is helping to serve food and drink at the club. Charlie meets Eve Cairo and socialite Bessie Sibley, as well as Rhadini's jealous wife, Myra. During her telepathy act with Fred Rhadini, Eve comes into contact with someone thinking about murder and Charlie is almost killed when a knife is thrown at him. After the show, Charlie, followed by Rhadini and Lewis, break into Dr. Zodiac's home. They find Jimmy already there. Charlie discovers evidence that Zodiac is a fraud. When Zodiac's Turkish houseman, Abdul, arrives, Charlie searches him and finds the holster that fits the knife. Abdul escapes, and the burglars discover Zodiac's vast files which he uses to frighten and blackmail others. Charlie realizes Bessie Sibley is providing information on others to protect herself, and that Zodiac was blackmailing Essex. Charlie burns Zodiac's office to protect the innocent. Essex's manuscript is a fictional account of Dr. Zodiac's blackmail scheme, and the next morning Charlie finds that the last page revealing who the murder was committed is missing. Charlie meets with Gregory, who says he is an insurance company detective investigating mysterious suicides. Charlie believes Gregory's claim is false, and Gregory fails to steal the manuscript back. Charlie believes Dr. Zodiac suffers from pseudologia fantastica, and Rhadini challenges Dr. Zodiac to a public test of psychic skills. Dr. Zodiac accepts the claim by leaving a note on the front door of the Temple of Magic where Rhadini performs. It's written on the back side of the missing manuscript page. The manuscript mentions a pygmy arrow; a similar arrow from a display in the foyer of the Temple of Magic is missing. That night, Charlie, Jimmy, Bessie Sibley, Myra Rhadini, and Peter Lewis attend Rhadini's magic show, where he is assisted by Eve Cairo and Elmer Kelner. Dr. Zodiac appears during the show, and is invited on stage. As Rhadini performs a levitation trick, Zodiac is killed with the pygmy arrow. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Abdul. Although a bow is found, it is too brittle to have fired the arrow. Zodiac must have been stabbed with the arrow. Gregory gives Rhadini an alibi after discovering Rhadini's wand in the aisle by his seat. Kilvaine reveals that Gregory is Stewart Salsbury, and that he really is an insurance company executive. At Kilvaine's suggestion, the murder is re-enacted with Lewis standing in for Zodiac. The secret of Rhadini's levitation trick is revealed, and Rhadini is stabbed in the aisle during the act. Myra uses the \\"sphinx\\"‚Äîan upright metal pseudo-Egyptian coffin with a hidden elevator in its floor‚Äîto go from the stage to the below-stage area, where her husband's dressing room is located. Charlie encourages Eve to try to tap into the mind of the killer. Eve reads Charlie's thoughts, which describe the motivations of Stella Essex, Bessie Sibley, Thomas Gregory, Peter Lewis, Fred Rhadini, and Myra Rhadinia (although without mentioning their names). The mind of Dr. Zodiac interferes with Eve's mind. Eve reads Zodiac's mind, and discovers that the real Dr. Zodiac killed Abdul because only Abdul knew Dr. Zodiac's real identity. The killer attempts to shoot Eve while she is on stage, but Jimmy spots the pistol and pushes the gun away just in time. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Fred Rhadini. While all eyes were on Eve, he sneaked into the wings, ran below the stage, and used the elevator in the sphinx to re-emerg on stage and attempt to kill Eve. Charlie reveals that Rhadini used a wand with a spring trigger to fire the arrow that killed Abdul. He then stabbed himself to divert attention from himself as a suspect.

The Romanesque Revival church was designed by Joseph H. McGuire, p.243 and built in 1902‚Äì05. Parish history The parish was established in July 1901 by the Most Rev. Michael A. Corrigan, Archbishop of New York. A parish in Manhattan had already been dedicated to St. Rose of Lima in 1868, and another existed in Parkville, Brooklyn. Upon this parish's founding, the now demolished Old St. Rose of Lima's Church on the Lower East Side was simply known as St. Rose's to distinguish itself from this parish. The current pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church is Reverend Ram√≥n L√≥pez. Currently, there are no parochial vicars at St. Rose of Lima Church. Buildings Corrigan had the double-height brick and stone Romanesque Revival-styke church built in 1902‚Äì1905 to designs by architect Joseph H. McGuire for $70,000. Cardinal Farley dedicated the structure on December 10, 1905. Next door, a four-story and basement brick-and-stone rectory was built in 1903‚Äì1904 to the designs by the same architect for $16,000. This building was completed and blessed by Msgr. Lavelle, V.G., on March 19, 1904. The site for the school at 1086 St. Nicholas Avenue at West 164th Street was secured around 1904.

On January 5, 1922, the Rev. Msgr. John R. Mahoney announced the building of the first modern parish school, at its current location, 1086 St. Nicholas Avenue on the corner of West 164th Street. The building's cornerstone was set in place on July 13, 1924, and construction complete in 1925. The new school was blessed on November 15, 1925. The principal at St. Rose of Lima School before it closed was Mr. Joseph J. De Bona. St. Rose of Lima School was located at 517 West 164th Street, Washington Heights, New York, New York, 10032. The Archdiocese of New York announced that St. Rose of Lima was one of the schools that closed in June 2019. The early schools had used nuns from the Ursulines of the Blessed Virgin from the Our Lady of Lourdes parish nearby, but they were unable to provide a sufficient number of teachers, so four nuns from the Sisters of St. Dominic in Sparkill, New York came to New York City at the request of Mahoney.

During his time in Winnipeg, Quanz was mentored by Arnold Spohr. Upon graduation, Quanz was awarded the Judy and Henny Jurri√´ns Choreographic Fellowship which afforded him a period to study ballet repertory, observing choreographers and companies in Europe. Career From 2000 to 2002 Quanz worked as a member of the Stuttgart Ballet. During this time, he was also supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and a Chalmers Performing Arts Grant. Quanz began his choreographic career by creating pieces for young choreographers' evenings, such as Fast Forward (Royal Winnipeg Ballet), Noverre (Stuttgart Ballet), the New York Choreographic Institute (New York City Ballet), and Cascades (National Ballet of Canada). Quanz's pieces in these workshops attracted considerable attention from critics and helped Quanz launch his career. In 2002, he was invited by the New York Choreographic Institute to choreograph a short work for the New York City Ballet. In 2003, Quanz created SpringScape for the American Ballet Theatre Studio Company. Two years later, in March 2005, Quanz premiered his first full-length ballet, Charlie's Cruise, for Ballett Chemnitz, which drew positive reviews.

He majored in architecture at the University of Minnesota. As a student he was able to work with the Minnesota Orchestra and recorded musicians such as Al Jarreau, Bobby Lyle and Willy Weeks. When folk music's popularity waned, Moss became a sound engineer and producer for rock and roll bands in Detroit. He moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and found work producing and engineering projects for recording artists such as Little Richard, Joe Cocker and Johnny Cash. He became the executive director and chief engineer of The Record Plant Recording Studios in 1986. This recording company operated Paramount Pictures scoring stage which enabled Moss to expand his musical endeavors with film music. He was able to develop new technology and production techniques. He became a member of the advisory board developing digital formats for film sound. In 1990, he worked and became associated with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.

The Church of St. Stephen of Hungary (Hungarian: Szent Istv√°n R√≥mai Katolikus Magyar Templom) was a Roman Catholic parish church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 402-412 East 82nd Street, Manhattan, New York City.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.375. It was administered by the Order of Friars Minor from its founding in 1922 until the merger of the parish took place in 2015. History The congregation was established in 1902 by L√°szlo Per√©nyi, a Catholic priest from Hungary to serve the growing immigrant population from that country in the city. It had no permanent facility until three years later, when it moved into a former Presbyterian church on 14th street. Growth in the parish led to plans to build a new church and school in 1927 in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, which became a center for several Central European ethnic groups, most notably German and Hungarian. In November 2014, the Archdiocese announced that St. Stephen of Hungary Parish was one of 31 parishes which would be merged into other parishes.Otterman, Sharon. \\"Tears and Heartache for New York‚Äôs Catholics as Cardinal Shuts Churches\\" New York Times (November 2, 2014) St. Stephen Parish and St. Elizabeth of Hungary Parish were to be merged into St. Monica Parish at 413 East 79th Street.\\"List of Merging Churches and Those That Will Cease Regular Services\\" New York Times (November 2, 2014) A High Mass for the Feast of St. Stephen took place on August 23, 2015, the last major event for the parish. The final Mass was held on August 30. After that, the Hungarian congregation moved to the nearby Church of St. Joseph. Buildings Plans were filed for a three-story brick church and school (both with basement and tile roofs) in 1926 to designs by Joseph H. McGuire of 5 Columbus Circle at a cost of $240,000. According to the AIA Guide to NYC (Fifth Edition, 2010), the Romanesque Revival church was built (or at least completed) in 1928 to the designs of a different architect, Emil Szendy. There are no referenced plans filed with the city for a church designed by Szendy; however, he may have worked for McGuire. Similarly confusing is the attribution for the rectory. The Rev B. J. Dudley had plans for a four-story friary at 402-412 East 82nd Street designed in 1960 and filed with the city to designs of Brother Cajetan J. B. Baumann, O.F.M., of 44 Whitehall Street, for $300,000. Plans for a three-story friary at 414-416 E 82nd Street were drawn up in 1965 and filed with the city to designs of Joseph Mitchell of 355 West 54 Street for $300,000.

Members The Nat Turner Rebellion was a quartet led by Joseph Jefferson. The most frequent lead singer was Major Harris. Bill Spratley was also a member of the group, as well as Ron Hopper. Jefferson, the last surviving member, died in 2020 at the age of 77. Formation and Philly Groove Records In the late 1960s, Jefferson had been touring with Cissy Houston's band, The Sweet Inspirations, as a drummer. However, he became ill with a foot infection and stayed in Philadelphia to recover. During his recovery, he realized that he no longer wanted to play R&B; music. Jefferson then returned to his home town of Petersburg, Virginia to put together his own music group, the Nat Turner Rebellion, named after Nat Turner's slave rebellion. The band toured the east coast of North America, traveling as far north as Montreal, Canada and as far south as Miami, Florida. From 1969 to 1972, the Nat Turner Rebellion recorded for Philly Groove Records. Under the record label, they recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, also in Philadelphia. Philly Groove Records released a few singles from the band, but never released their debut album. Breakup The Nat Turner Rebellion broke apart in 1972 on bad terms, with Jefferson saying that Spratley brandished a gun at him during a dispute about the band's finances. Rediscovery The audio archives of Drexel University inherited Sigma Sound Studios' collection of over 7,000 cassette tapes, which included never-released music from the Nat Turner Rebellion. Along with the songs that had been released as singles, Drexel discovered fourteen tracks recorded by the band. Drexel University-owned record label Mad Dragon Records, along with the company that owned the publishing rights to Philly Groove Records Catalog, Reservoir, assembled an album of the Nat Turner Rebellion's recordings. The title of the album they released was Laugh to Keep From Crying. It was released with Jefferson's permission in 2019. The album will be re-released by ORG Music for Record Store Day in 2020. Style Music critic Ken Tucker stated that musically, \\"they were sort of a cross between Sly Stone and Blood, Sweat & Tears. But really, they sounded like no one else.\\" Jefferson stated that vocally, he was inspired by The Temptations, but for rock and roll inspiration he looked to The Rolling Stones. He said that the soul of the Nat Turner Rebellion could be best ascribed to Sly and the Family Stone, saying, \\"We wanted to be Sly. Didn‚Äôt everybody?\\" Each of the four members sang; they were accompanied by a seven-piece band that included horns.

The Centre is owned and run by the London Welsh Trust. The Centre is a base for three choirs: the London Welsh Chorale, the Gwalia Male Voice Choir and the London Welsh Male Voice Choir. The Centre also hosts Welsh language classes, concerts, drama productions, the Young Welsh Singer of the Year Competition, the London Welsh School‚Äôs ', literary events, discussion programmes, and a variety of other events.  History  The Centre was built to provide a home for the Young Wales Association (YWA), which later became the London Welsh Association and is now the London Welsh Trust. = Young Wales Association = The Young Wales Association was founded on 21 October 1920 at the Portman Rooms, Baker Street, when more than 400 members of the London Welsh community attended a meeting presided over by Margaret Lloyd George (who became the YWA‚Äôs first President). The YWA was founded partly as a tribute to the dead of the First World War but mainly as a meeting place for young Welsh migrants. It was registered as a company limited by guarantee in March 1925 under the title of \\"Young Wales Association (London) Limited\\" and later changed its name to the London Welsh Association Limited. The London Welsh Trust was established in 1964. During the first decade of its life, the YWA lacked a permanent home. Meetings were held first in a little caf√© in Villiers Street, then in the premises of Gwilym Thomas at 26 Upper Montagu Street and later thanks to Owen Picton Davies, at the Hotel Somerset. At a lunch hosted by Picton Davies at one of his hotels in July 1928, the Rt Hon Lord Atkin and the Rt Hon David Lloyd George spoke in support of a movement to provide headquarters for the Young Wales Association in London. As a result, Sir Howell J. Williams, a building contractor and London County Council member, purchased a site of just over bounded by Doughty Street and Mecklenburgh Square on the West and Gray's Inn Road on the East, and offered it as a free gift to the Young Wales Association. These premises were formally opened by Margaret Lloyd George on 29 November 1930. Coincidentally, the site was almost exactly opposite that in Gray's Inn Road which had been occupied from 1772 to 1857 by the Welsh Charity School. = Current building = alt=Two storey red-brick building, with seven sets of windows on the upper floor, and for sets on the ground floor. It has three entrance doors, all shut. Railings separate the building from the pavement. A Welsh flag flies from above the central main entrance. Sir Howell J. Williams later rebuilt the properties that fronted onto Gray's Inn Road and completed the main hall of the current London Welsh Centre. The new premises were formally handed over by Williams on 5 November 1937. The properties on Doughty Street and Mecklenburgh Square have since been sold off for residential use, but the premises fronting on to Gray's Inn Road remain in use as the modern day London Welsh Centre. The bar at the Centre was officially opened by Harry Secombe on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March) 1971. The building is in the Holborn conservation area. = World War II = During the period 1940‚Äì1946 the Welsh Services Club provided beds and meals for Welsh (and a few Canadian) military personnel passing through London. On 13 December 1941 the Centre was officially committed for use as a Welsh Services Club. The Rt Hon Lord Atkin PC was chair of the newly formed Welsh Services Club, which was opened by David Lloyd George.  Activities  The Centre seeks to promote the arts (primarily Welsh art and culture) and provide facilities for local community use. = Magazine = The London Welsh Association's monthly magazine, Y Ddolen, was introduced in 1925. When it reappeared after the Second World War in October 1946 it was called Y Ddinas. Some idea of the range of activities at the London Welsh Centre in the post war years can be gathered from the announcement in Y Ddinas for just one month, January 1948. The Centre was the venue for three dances, two nights of community singing, a concert, two whist drives and an \\"at home\\". The Centre's magazine is now published quarterly alongside regular newsletters by email. = Welsh Language Classes = Welsh language classes have been held more or less continuously at the London Welsh Centre since 1946. The Saturday morning Welsh classes for children, which began in 1957, resulted in the establishment of the London Welsh School a year later. Welsh language classes are now held at the Centre each week, for three different levels of ability. All-day, intensive Welsh language courses are held on weekends, two or three times each year.

The habitat of Tethys fimbria is seas which have sand or mud on the bottom, in depths from 20 to 150 m. Tethys fimbria captures and feeds on small crustaceans. It uses its broad hood for catching them. The cerata can be self-amputated (autotomy) as a defence mechanism when the slug is in danger. Within the mantle large amounts of prostaglandins are produced. Subsequently the prostoglandins are moved to the cerata. The biosynthesis of prostgandins has been studied by Marzo et al. (1991).

The Celts exercised politico-military rule over Transylvania between the 4th and 2nd century BC and brought with them a more advanced iron-working technology. They were also responsible for the spread of the potter's wheel into a much wider area than the one they occupied.  History  Celtic socketed axes and tools from the Bronze Age in Transylvania, Romania Large areas of ancient Dacia, which were populated early in the First Iron Age by Thracian people, were affected by a massive migration of Iranian Scythians moving east to west during the first half of the first millennium BC. They were followed by a second equally large wave of Celts migrating west to east. Celts arrived in northwestern Transylvania in around 400-350 BC as part of their great migration eastwards. When Celtic warriors first penetrated these territories, the group seem to have merged with the domestic population of early Dacians and assimilated many Hallstatt cultural traditions. = 4th century BC = The second half of the 4th century BC saw the Middle La T√®ne Celtic culture emerge in north-western and central Dacia, a development reflected especially in burials of the period. Celtic artifacts dating to this time have been discovered at Turda≈ü, Ha≈£eg and Media≈ü in modern-day Romania. By 1976, the number of Celtic sites found in Transylvania had reached about 150, indicating a significant La T√®ne population surpassed only by the Dacians. These sites are mostly cemeteries. Archaeological investigations have highlighted several warrior graves with military equipment, suggesting that an elite Celtic military force penetrated the region. Celtic vestiges are found concentrated in the Transylvanian plateau and plain, as well as the upper Some≈ü basin, whereas the surrounding valleys of Ha≈£eg, Hunedoara, FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü, B√¢rsa, Sf. Gheorghe and Ciuc have neither necropoleis nor settlements but only tombs or isolated items. This indicates that Celts occupied the territory between Mure≈ü and Some≈ü, west of the Apuseni Mountains, and the plains and plateau in the intra-Carpathian space along with the valley in the upper basin of Some≈ü. Nevertheless, these valleys, as well as those of Banat and Maramure≈ü, have also yielded contemporary Dacian findings. Of the Celtic cemeteries excavated, the most important are those in Ciume≈üti and Pi≈ücolt (Satu Mare County) and F√¢nt√¢nele (Bistri≈£a-NƒÉsƒÉud County). These contain over 150 graves compared to the average of 50-70. Necropoleis have also been found at SanislƒÉu (Satu Mare County), Curtui≈üeni (Bihor County), Gala≈£ii Bistri≈£ei (Bistri≈£a-NƒÉsƒÉud County), and Bra≈üov (Bra≈üov County). * Twenty-three of the oldest graves from the extensive F√¢nt√¢nele, Mure≈ü cemetery in Mure≈ü County have been dated to the beginning of the 4th century BC. Among European Celtic cemeteries, this one is second only to Munsingen in size. The Geto-Dacian population is also represented through a full range of contemporary native pottery types. * Finds from Pi≈ücolt reveal that the inhabitants of settlements in the area practiced inhumation, or reuse of a pre-existing barrow or grave, as a type of burial. * At Ciume≈üti cemetery, of the 34 graves excavated, 21 were simple cremations in pits, seven featured inhumations, while the remains of six cremations had been buried in urns. The number and type of finds in the graves differed in each case. Principal among the grave-goods was an iron warrior's helmet of eastern Celtic type as well as a socketed spear, a pair of Hellenistic greaves and a suit of chain mail, to which a small bronze disc had been attached as its central feature with S-shaped motifs arranged in a series of symmetrical panels around its edge. In Transylvania, the Celts shifted from inhumation to cremation, either through natural progression or because of Dacian influence. Almost without exception, the necropoleis so far studied are bi-ritual, although cremation appears to be more prevalent than inhumation. The Celts in Dacia certainly cremated their dead from the second La T√®ne period onwards but Celtic inhumations appear no older than pit-grave cremations in any of the cemeteries. It is impossible to say whether the Celts turned away from the practice of cremation as the Scythians had. Although less frequent, inhumation still occurred as a constant practice even during the final stage of Celtic inhabitation of this territory. Celtic settlements had a rural character with such sites found in Media»ô, More≈üti, (Mure≈ü County) and Ciume≈üti. Movements of the Celts in Transylvania in 3rd century Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts from Romania. Expansion of Celtic groups in the area may be related to their invasion of the Balkans around 335 BC, when a massive colonization of the Tisa plain and the Transylvanian Plateau occurred following the death of Lysimachus. However, the eastward movement of the Celts into Transylvania used a different route from the one taken by the hordes that attacked the Balkans. Celts did not occupy all intra-Carpathian areas of Transylvania, stopping short of the Maramure≈ü Depression for instance, where excavations have uncovered Dacian fortifications from the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. As regards Celtic influence on local Daco-Getic culture, Vasile P√¢rvan has stated that the latter is wholly indebted to Celtic traditions and that the \\"La Tene-ization\\" of these northern Tracians was a cultural phenomenon primarily due to the Celtic population who settled the area. = 3rd - 2nd century BC = Archaeological sites of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC reveal a pattern of co-existence and fusion between the bearers of La T√®ne culture and the indigenous Dacians. Domestic dwellings exhibit a mixture of Celtic and Dacian pottery while several Celtic graves contain Dacian type vessels. At Celtic sites in Dacia, finds show that the native population imitated Celtic art forms that they admired, but remained firmly and fundamentally Dacian in their culture. Dacian archaeological finds in the Transylvania area increase in number from the middle of the 2nd century BC. = 2nd-1st century BC = Migratory movements of the Celtic Boii During the first half of the 2nd century BC, Pompeius Trogus writes in his Historiae Philippicae of a Dacian king, Oroles, who fought against Celtic incursions. Oroles is recorded as resisting the intrusion of the Bastarnae, a people now generally considered to be of Germanic origin but who were in fact Celto- Germanic and, according to Livy, spoke a Celtic language. The Bastarnae moved from Silesia into what is now central and northern Moldavia. Pompeius Trogus along with Justin also record the rise in Dacian authority prior to 168 BC under the leadership of King Rubobostes.Barry Cunliffe (1987)142John T. Koch (2005) 549 Around 150 BC, La T√®ne material disappears from the area. This is concurrent with ancient writings, which mention the rise of Dacian authority. This ended Celtic domination and it is possible that the Celts were forced out of Dacia. On the other hand, some scholars have posited that the Transylvanian Celts remained but merged with the local culture and thereafter ceased to be distinctive. The boundary between the Celts and Dacians near the River Tisa is depicted in 2nd century BC pottery found at Pecica in Arad County, a prosperous trading center at the confluence of the two peoples. = 1st century BC = Map of Dacia during Burebista's time (60-44 BC) including the campaigns against Celtic Boii and Teurisci A classic period of Geto-Dacian La T√®ne culture began in the 1st century BC centered around the city of Sarmizegetusa Regia in south-western Transylvania. Dacian king Burebista defeated the Celtic Boii and Taurisci tribes between 60-59 BC. However, some archaeological finds in Dacian settlements and fortifications feature imported Celtic vessels and others made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic prototypes. These discoveries in sites from regions north and west of Transylvania show that relations between the Dacians and the Celts continued in the period 1st century BC-1st century AD. During Burebista's time, the Dacians became closer to the remaining Celtic populations than they had been when the Celts ruled Transylvania. Evidence from the earlier period shows Celtic burials and settlements with only occasional Dacian elements, while Dacian settlements with Celtic finds are infrequent. This situation reversed after Burebista's conquest when a distinctive hybrid Celtic-Dacian culture emerged on the Hungarian plain and in the Slovakian regions. Most of the Celts were absorbed into the Geto-Dacian population and contributed to Dacian cultural development. These Celtic tribes, who were skilled in iron exploitation and processing, also introduced the potter's wheel to the area, thereby contributing to acceleration of the development of Dacia. By this time, prosperous Celtic communities had spread over the whole territory of modern Romania. Dacian (orange) and Celtic tribes (green) in the Roman republic and its neighbours in 58 BC = 2nd century AD = By the 2nd century, Celtic military and civilian groups from Roman Empire provinces had moved into the area of Transylvania that also had become part of the Empire, as part of Roman Dacia, by 106 AD. They were probably Latin-speaking groups with Celtic substratum who also participated in the Roman military campaigns in Dacia. Roman Dacia consisted of eastern and southeastern Transylvania, the Banat and Oltenia regions of modern Romania but excluded the rest of Dacia. The presence of Celts here is mainly illustrated by the composition of both the legions and cohorts. Legio XIII Gemina came from the Celtic zone of Vindabona and contained some Celtic elements. Troops from Roman Celtic and Germanic provinces were the most numerous of the auxiliary troops. (See also List of Roman auxiliary regiments) The several cohorts and alae Gallorum attested in diplomas and inscriptions reveal the large number of Gauls who were recruited by Romans, some of whom were moved to Transylvania (i.e. Cohors II Gallorum Dacica equitata in Dacia Superior later organized as Dacia Porolissensis). Some units were recruited from single Gallic or Germanic tribes (i.e. Germanic Batavi formed Cohors III Batavorum \\"3rd Cohort of Batavi\\"). The following are military units with some Celtic-speaking elements stationed in this region: * Legio XIII Gemina located at Apulum the Latin name of the Dacian settlement Apulon, (Alba Iulia). * Cohors I Alpinorum equitata: When stationed in Dacia Superior, they were garrisoned at SƒÉrƒÉ≈£eni, Mure≈ü. After 144 AD they were moved to CƒÉlugƒÉreni * Military detachments I Vindelicorum c.R. eq: Formed by the Celtic Vindelici, it is attested at Cumidava on the site of modern Rasnov, by an inscription \\"Vindelicorum Cumidavensis Alexandriana\\". Other detachments of I Vindelicorum c.R. eq were located at Tibiscum. * Alpinorum and cohors VIII Raetorum are recorded in Dacia superior in diploma from 136/38 having been attested in Dacia in 114 and 110 AD. * Cohors II Gallorum Dacica equitata, Dacia Superior. A number of stamps of Ala Gallorum were found at Borosneul Mare Covasna. * Cohors V Lingonum (Celtic Lingones): They were located at Moigrad-Porolissum. Celts in Illyria, Pannonia, including parts of Dacia (modern Transylvania)  Celtic tribes in Transylvania  In the vicinity of 2nd century BC Transylvania, the Celtic Boii settled in the northern area of Dun√°nt√∫l, in modern-day southern Slovakia and in the northern region of Hungary around the centre of modern-day Bratislava. Boii tribal union members the Taurisci and the Anarti lived in northern Dacia with the core of the Anarti tribe found in the area of the Upper Tisa. The Anartophracti from modern southeast Poland are considered part of the Anarti. Scordiscan Celts dwelling southeast of the Iron Gates of the Danube may be considered a part of the Transylvanian Celtic culture. A group of Britogauls also moved into the area. Celts penetrated first into western Dacia, then as far as north-west and central Transylvania. A large number of archaeological finds indicate a sizeable Celtic population settling for a long period among the natives. The archaeological evidence shows that these Eastern Celts were absorbed into the Geto-Dacian population. A geographic reference by Ptolemy from the 2nd century AD indicates that the Anarti were settled on the northwestern edge of Dacia with the Teurisci bordering them on the east, and further east there were the Costoboci.  Celtic art in Transylvania  The Celtic Helmet from Ciume≈üti, near Satu Mare, Romania (northern Dacia), an Iron Age raven totem helmet, dated around the 4th century BC. A similar helmet is depicted on the Gundestrup cauldron, being worn by one of the mounted warriors (detail tagged here ). See also an illustration of Brennos wearing a similar helmet. = Helmet of Ciume≈üti = One of the best known and most often reproduced pieces of Celtic art is the helmet found in a warrior chieftain's grave at Ciume≈üti (now Satu Mare County, Romania). The Ciume≈üti helmet is half-round with a neck protector and was hammered out of a single bronze plate with the cheek pieces bolted on afterwards. A bronze spike protrudes through the top of the helmet to which is fixed a cylinder on which a bird perches. The legs and the underpart of the head are cast while the remainder is hammered. The eyes are yellow ivory with a red enamel pupil, fastened in with bitumen. Overall the bird is in length and has a wingspan of . The wings originally articulated at the body so that they would have flapped up and down as the wearer moved.Connoly, p. 122 The bird, whether raven, eagle or falcon, is a known Celtic totem. The representation of the bird of prey hovering over the Ciume≈üti helmet had a profound supernatural significance since in the world of the La T√®ne Celts based on the ample documentary evidence endorsing the special ritual associations of birds. Note that the Gundestrup cauldron, now in Copenhagen, also depicts a bird crest on helmets. Wilcox and McBride mentioned that their illustration of the iron Gallic warrior's helmet of the middle La T√®ne period had been reconstructed on the basis of the Ciumesti helmet. Gundestrup cauldron inside panel. One of the scenes provides a good parallel to the Ciumesti bird helmet = Other Transylvanian helmets = Four other helmets of bronze or iron have also been found in the intra-Carpathian area at Silivas (Alba County), Apahida (Cluj County), Ocna Mure≈ü (Sibiu County) and Valea Ha≈£egului (Hunedoara County). All these helmets are of the Waldalgesheim Style developed by the La T√®ne and date from the period when semi-victorious Celtic armies returned from the Balkan Peninsula and settled on the Pannonian Plain and in Transylvania. Helmets with reinforced crests are typically eastern Celtic and can be traced as they spread from the western margins of Taurisci territory at Mihovo, to be subsequently used by the Scordisci at Batina and throughout Transylvania (Apahida, Ciume≈üti). = Other Celtic art objects = The wheeled cauldron or Kesselwagen OrƒÉ≈ütie, Romania, used as a crematory urn, during the later Celtic Bronze Age. It is drawn by water-birds The Dacian war trumpet, as shown on the Roman Emperor Trajan's Column at Rome 116 AD, is a Celtic-style Carnyx. (n.b. The Celtic carnyx appears on the Gundestrup cauldron). Lure A wheeled cauldron or Kesselwagen, used as a crematory urn during the later Celtic Bronze Age ritual assemblage, was found at OrƒÉ≈ütie, Romania. This one is notionally drawn by teams of water- birds. A coin type from Ciumesti shows a warrior wearing a wild boar crest on his helmet The Dacian war trumpet, as shown on the Roman Emperor Trajan's Column at Rome 116 AD, is a Celtic-style carnyx. = Plastic Style = High- relief ornamental designs known as the \\"Plastic Style\\" are found on warriors' equipment from Pi≈ücolt, comprising a shield with an ornate handle and shield- boss as well as a sword in an ornamented scabbard with traces of a \\"dragon- pair\\" motif. This motif is one of the genuinely pan-European themes of early La T√®ne art and is found embellishing the upper end of scabbard front-plates from southeast Britain to Transylvania. = Influences of the Thracian / Dacian style in works of Celts = Figures with horns / carnyx on the Gundestrup Cauldron From at least the 3rd century BC, the undoubted interaction between the La T√®ne Celtic and Dacian worlds can be considered a Thracian / Dacian influence on works of Celtic craftsmanship, or even imports from these regions. Such influence may be seen in the great silver ring from Trichtingen, near Stuttgart. Silver is not the prime medium of high-status craftsmanship in the Celtic world but is characteristic of Thracian / Dacian metal-working. Moreover, the Ciume≈üti Helmet and numerous later artifacts made partly or wholly of silver (fibulae or belt plates), clearly demonstrate the interaction between Thracian and Dacian schools of ornamental metalwork with the Celtic La T√®ne tradition. Numerous studies of the artwork of the Gundestrup cauldron, provide comparative analyses of Celtic and Thracian traditions. Images on the cauldron have many features that are common to the Celtic and Thracian corpus of art while exotic animal motifs suggest an oriental influence. Although the design has features of Celtic belief and iconography, it appears to have been made by Thracian smiths in Dacia or Thrace, in the lower Danube region, according to their own traditions. The cauldron may have been commissioned by a member of Celtic community.  Society  = Coins = Mythological symbols feature on the earliest Celtic coins, which were struck in what is now modern Transylvania, Romania. This would result in the minting of later Celtic coins elsewhere that are considered miniature works of art. Evidence of the Hallstatt culture in Dacia, as well as the political and economic rule of the Celts, suggests that it was the Celts, not the Dacians, who minted these silver coins based on the Macedonian Tetradrachmae of Philip II (r. 382-336 BC). According to Zirra, this theory is supported by numismatist, C. Pedra, who argues that the Celts of Dacia first began minting coins in the mid-3rd to the mid-2nd century BC, after which, native mints lasted until the early decades of the 1st century BC. = Religion = Epona (the horse-goddess) as seen at the Historical Museum of Bern, the most important Celtic cult attested to in Roman Dacia, 2nd century AD The Dacian priestly class may have influenced the druids of the Celts with the important Christian author Hippolytus of Rome (170-236 AD), claiming that the druids adopted the teachings of Pythagoras through the intermediacy of Zalmoxis. Roman Dacia's pantheon includes Celtic divinities brought to the province by both military and civilian elements. The most important Celtic cult attested in the new province is that of the horse- goddess Epona. Specific epithets in her honor as Augusta, Regina and Sancta are found on inscriptions from Alba Iulia, on the site of ancient settlement Apulon (Latin Apulum). The stag-horned Cernunnos, one of the \\"great gods\\" of the Celts, was also known in the area according to two testimonies, one of them calling him Iupiter Cernenus, a name found nowhere else in the Empire. However, Cernunnos also has funereal attributions, not only as a protector of tombs but also as a psychopompos god. References to Apollo Grannus and Sirona, divinities widespread in Gallia and on the Upper Danube as protectors of health are also recorded in Roman Dacia. = Language = Two out of the sixty known Dacian plant names are considered of Celtic origin, e.g. propeditla ‚Äòcinquefoil‚Äô (cf. Gaulish pempedula, Cornish pympdelenn, Breton pempdelienn), and dyn ‚Äònettle‚Äô. Celtic nomenclature carries the same onomastic weight as that of the Celto-Germanic cults in the religion of Roman Dacia.

It is located in the City of North Charleston, South Carolina. It was closed in 1980. History North Charleston AFS was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational on 1 June 1955 when the 792d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron activated an AN/MPS-7 radar at the site, designated M-113. Logistical support for the radar site was provided by the adjacent MATS Charleston AFB, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. By 1956 operational radars included the AN/MPS-7, AN/GPS-3, AN/MPS-14, and AN/MPS-8 sets. In late 1959 this site was also performing air traffic control duties for the FAA with a newly installed AN/FPS-20A search radar and AN/MPS-14 set. In 1961 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66 and an AN/FPS-26 height- finder radar was installed. During 1962 North Charleston AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 792d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 25 March 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-113. By 1966 the site was operating an AN/FPS-27. In addition to the main facility, Fort Fisher AFS operated several unmanned Gap Filler sites: * Stateburg, SC (M-113A/Z-113A): * Georgetown SC (M-113B/Z-113B): * Parris Island MCAS SC (M-113C/Z-113C): The sites at Statesburg and Georgetown were opened in 1959 AN/FPS-14 radars, Parris Island was taken over from the closed site (M-112) at Hunter AFB, Georgia in December 1961 and was an AN/FPS-18. All the Gap Fillers were closed in June 1970. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The facility came under Tactical Air Command jurisdiction in 1979 with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the activation of ADTAC. North Charleston AFS was closed on 4 June 1980. In 1980 the Air Force built a height-finder tower at Jedburg, SC, an FAA site located twenty-two miles northwest of Charleston and closed North Charleston AFB. The North Charleston GATR (Ground Air Transmitter Receiver) site (R-113), operated by the 1968th Communications Squadron remained open temporarily after the parent radar sited closed. Today North Charleston Air Force Station has been mostly torn down. Some former AF buildings are now used as government offices for the city of North Charleston. The large support buildings for the FPS-27, FPS-26 and FPS-66 radars remain. The former housing units used for low-income housing. Also the site hosts a local Marine Corps Reserve Training Center. The Gap Filler at Parris Island is now part of a golf course; the one at Georgetown County Airport has been redeveloped; the Stateburg site remains, with an existing radome .

All reflexes have an afferent and efferent arc. The Inflammatory reflex has a sensory, afferent arc, which is activated by cytokines, and a motor, or efferent arc, which transmits action potentials in the vagus nerve to suppress cytokine production. Increased signaling in the efferent arc inhibits inflammation and prevents organ damage. Molecular mechanism The molecular basis of cytokine-inhibiting signals requires the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor receptor expressed on cytokine-producing cells. The release of acetylcholine in spleen suppresses the production of TNF and other cytokines which cause damaging inflammation. Signaling in the efferent arc of the inflammatory reflex, termed the \\"Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,\\" provides a regulatory check on the innate immune system response to invasion and injury. The action potentials arising in the vagus nerve are transmitted to the spleen, where a subset of specialized T cells is activated to secrete acetylcholine. The net effect of the reflex is to prevent the damage caused by excessive cytokine production. Therapeutic potential Evidence from experimental disease models of arthritis, colitis, sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, and congestive heart failure indicate that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can prevent or reverse these diseases. It may be possible to implant nerve stimulators to replace anti-inflammatory drugs that target cytokine activity (e.g. anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 antibodies).

Development In 1941, it became apparent that the then current Romanian reconnaissance type, the IAR-39, was no longer an effective design. Therefore, IAR designed a replacement type, the IAR-47. Effectively a hybrid of the IAR 39 and IAR 80, it used their IAR 14K IV C32 engine. The IAR 47 prototype was flown for the first time in 1942 to meet a requirement for a tactical bombing and reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft was similar to the IAR-39, except for the fact that it was a low-wing monoplane and had a smaller cockpit (for 2 instead of 3). Its fuselage, based on the IAR 39, was of mixed construction. Compared to the IAR-39, the observers fuselage side windows were deleted, and the crew reduced to two, pilot and observer/rear gunner, armed with a 7.92mm Rheinmetall MG. Like the IAR-80, the IAR-47 was a low-winged monoplane, and used a re-inforced version of that type's undercarriage. Two 7.92mm Rheinmetall MGs were mounted, and six 110 lb (50 kg) bombs could be carried in a bomb bay between the crew's positions. Reconnaissance was its primary mission, however, and the bomb bay was normally filled with a fuel tank, increasing its normal fuel load of 127 Imp gal (580 l) to 209 Imp gal (950 l). The mission fit was three cameras, one vertical and two 45o oblique, in the fuselage underside. The unarmed prototype was flight tested in autumn 1942, and exhibited good handling characteristics. However, in the light of the improved Soviet fighters now in service, its low powered engine, and light armament, it was considered obsolescent, and anyway, all of IAR's production capacity was required for Bf 109 production. Therefore, development of the IAR-47 was stopped in January 1943, one prototype being destroyed in a USAAF air raid in 1944.Axworthy 1994, pp.10-11.

A temporary church was erected and dedicated by then Bishop John Hughes on December 23, 1849. In 1853 the property was purchased by the New York and Harlem Railroad and a new church was built on 28th Street and opened March 5, 1854. The first pastor was Rev. Jeremiah W. Cummings. One of the parishioners around that time was Orestes Brownson. In an article on \\"Vocations to the Priesthood\\" that the plain spoken Cummings contributed to \\"Brownson's Review\\" of October, 1860, he severely criticized the management and mode of instruction in Catholic colleges and seminaries which he styled \\"cheap priest- factories\\". This aroused a bitter controversy, and brought out one of the noted essays by Archbishop Hughes, his \\"Reflections on the Catholic Press\\". \\"Under the administration of Dr. Cummings St. Stephen's, which he had completed in March, 1854, became the most fashionable and most frequented church in New York, its sermons and music making it a local attraction.\\"Meehan, Thomas. \\"Jeremiah Williams Cummings.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4.

He was succeeded by assistant pastor Rev. Edward McGlynn. Future Bishop of Buffalo, Charles H. Colton's first assignment after his ordination in 1876 was as a curate at Stephen's. He remained there for ten years, his duties including the chaplaincy at Bellevue.\\"Bishop C.H. Colton of Buffalo is Dead\\", The New York Times, May 10, 1915 In 1879, Charles Edward McDonnell, (later Bishop of Brooklyn) was also curate at St. Stephen's. No less plain spoken than his predecessor, Rev. McGlynn was reprimanded by Archbishop John McCloskey, who required McGlynn to refrain from defending in public the views of Henry George, which some considered bordering on socialism. McGlynn subsequently ran afoul of Archbishop Michael Corrigan for McGlynn's open endorsement of George's mayoral campaign. In January 1877, Corrigan removed McGlynn from the pastorate of St. Stephen's for insubordination. Father Colton became pastor in February 1877 and founded the parish school. On June 10, 1903, Colton was appointed the fourth Bishop of Buffalo. He was succeeded by Thomas Francis Cusack, auxiliary bishop of New York, who served as pastor of St. Stephen's Church from 1904 to July 5, 1915, when he was named Bishop of Albany. At that time, the parish maintained the Presentation Day Nursery on East 32nd St., which allowed mothers to work; and St. Stephen's Inn at East 31st St., an affordable residence for young working women.Lafort, Remigius.

Early life and education  Edward M. Shepard was the son of Lorenzo B. Shepard (1821‚Äì1856) and Lucy (Morse) Shepard (1821‚Äì1890). After the early death of his father, Abram S. Hewitt became his guardian, and the family removed to Brooklyn. There Shepard attended Public School Nr. 13. Afterwards he attended Oberlin College Preparatory School for one year (1860‚Äì61), and graduated from City College of New York in 1869. He then studied law with John Edward Parsons, was admitted to the bar in 1875, and formed a partnership with Albert Stickney. In 1890, he became a partner in the firm of Parsons, Shepard and Ogden.  Political career  From 1883 to 1885, he was Chairman of the Brooklyn Civil Service Board. In 1884, he was appointed a State Forestry Commissioner. He became a Democratic leader in Brooklyn, but disagreeing with the corrupt local boss Hugh McLaughlin, Shepard organized in 1894 a Democratic Reform faction which nominated Everett P. Wheeler for Governor. In the election, Democrat David B. Hill was defeated by Republican Levi P. Morton. Shepard was a delegate to the National Convention of the \\"Gold Democrats\\" in Indianapolis which nominated the Palmer/Buckner ticket for the 1896 United States presidential election. In 1897, Shepard supported Seth Low who ran on the Citizens Union ticket for Mayor of New York City at the first election under the Consolidation Charter, and said that Tammany Hall was the \\"most burning and disgraceful blot upon the municipal history of this country.\\" In 1900, Shepard supported William Jennings Bryan for President. The next year, Tammany boss Richard Croker had Shepard nominated as the regular Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York City, but he was defeated by Seth Low who had been nominated by a fusion of Anti-Tammany Democrats, Republicans and the Citizens Union. Mark Twain, an avid supporter of Seth Low, said of Edward M. Shepard: \\"A Tammany banana is a strange thing. One end of it, or one part, here or there, is perfectly white. The rest of it is rotten. Now, I have the greatest respect for Mr. Shepard personally, but nine-tenths of the rest of the bananas on that ticket are rotten. Mr. Shepard is the white part of the banana. The best we can do is throw the whole banana from us, for it is unfit. It will make us sick. \\" In 1909, he started a movement to unite the infighting factions of the Democratic Party in New York, which led in 1910 to the election of John Alden Dix (the first Democratic Governor of New York since Roswell P. Flower had left office in 1894) and majorities in both Houses of the New York State Legislature (for the first time since 1893). Shepard had been considered the frontrunner for the gubernatorial nomination, but Tammany boss Charles Francis Murphy preferred Dix. At the onset of 1911, the Democrats having a majority in the State Legislature, it was generally believed that Shepard would be elected U.S. Senator from New York to succeed Republican Chauncey M. Depew. But boss Murphy put up William F. Sheehan for the nomination, and the longest deadlock in the history of the State of New York ensued. At the United States Senate election in New York, 1911, Shepard was favored by the \\"Insurgent\\" Democrats, led by State Senator Franklin D. Roosevelt. He received 15 votes (out of 200) on the 32nd ballot, but retired from the race after the 34th ballot on February 25, 1911, trying to move Sheehan to do the same for the sake of party unity. But Sheehan remained in the field, and after 74 days of deadlock, James A. O'Gorman was elected as a compromise candidate on April 1. Just a few months later, on July 28, 1911, Shepard died of pneumonia at his summer residence \\"Erlowest\\" (now The Inn at Erlowest), on Lake George's \\"Millionaire's Row.\\" He had never married. Shepard Hall of the City College of New York is named after him.https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/fpcm/quicklinks/TheCityCollegeofNewYork.pdf  Works  * Dishonor in American Public Life (1882) * The Work of a Social Teacher (1884) * Martin Van Buren (1888), in the ‚ÄúAmerican Statesmen Series‚Äù * The Democratic Party (1892)  See also  * People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company * John Jay McKelvey, Sr., Attorney, Founder of Harvard Law Review.

The 24 minute film was produced by Brigham Young University, but does not specifically mention the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormon church) outside of the credits. Plot In the story, Johnny Lingo (played by MaKee K. Blaisdell) is a shrewd, honest, and well-liked Polynesian trader. Johnny has come home to bargain for a wife. Mahana (played by Naomi Kahoilua), the young woman he desires, is considered by her neighbors and even her father, Moki (played by Joseph Ah Quin), to be of little value‚Äîsullen, ugly, and undesirable. Blaming himself for not paying enough cows for Mahana's mother, her father treats her unkindly, such as yelling, \\"Mahana, you ugly!\\" Eddington, Mark. \\"Mormon lore is a book to sit down with\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 27 December 2005. Retrieved on 14 March 2020. As the bargaining is about to begin, women of the island brag about how many cows their husbands had paid for each of them, and comment that Mahana's father will be lucky to be offered one cow for her. The bargaining begins, and Moki asks Johnny Lingo for three cows, as Moki's counselor Me Hai advises. The islanders laugh derisively, then wait for Lingo to make his counter-offer, certain that he will make a devastating bargain. Johnny, pondering the offer, pronounces that \\"three cows are many... but not enough for Mahana!\\" He then offers the unheard-of price of eight cows for her hand in marriage. After the bargaining, Johnny visits Mr. Harris, an American shopkeeper on the island, to offer him a valuable shell in exchange for a mirror. In their conversation, Mr. Harris is convinced that Johnny only paid so much to look good and be remembered. The next day, Moki and Me Hai, while waiting for Johnny to deliver the cows, convince themselves that Johnny reconsidered his deal and will not show up. In the end, Johnny brings the cows and marries Mahana that night, enduring some mocking for paying so much for a seemingly undesirable wife while Moki revels in his newfound prosperity. Johnny and Mahana then leave the island for many months on their honeymoon, visiting many islands. When they return, Harris discovers, to his astonishment, that Mahana is a beautiful, happy woman. Johnny recounts that Mahana's father had just accused Lingo of cheating him by saying, \\"[Mahana] is worth ten cows, if she's worth a hoof!\\" Johnny then explains that he has loved Mahana since they were children, and that he paid eight cows for Mahana not to show off, but to make her happy and for her \\"to be an eight-cow woman.\\" Johnny concludes with \\"Many things can happen to make a woman beautiful, but the thing that matters most is what she thinks of herself.\\" Johhny leaves Harris, and he and Mahana walk on the beach together.

The story has been frequently reprinted, including in The Australian Women's Weekly, The Instructor, and Reader's Digest, as well as by assorted books and websites (sometimes condensed or attributed to other authors).

(\\"Judge\\") Whitaker, then head of the Brigham Young University's Department of Motion Picture Production. Whitaker stated that \\"the setting is mythical to give it universal appeal\\" and the village set was constructed by two BYU (then Church College of Hawaii) students, Tuione Pulotu and Vuna Fa, to not be identifiable as belonging to any particular island group.

It tells the history of Freemasonry from its inception through to the modern day, which emphasis on Kent, its Lodges and their origins and has possibly the finest collection of Masonic material in the UK outside London. This includes the unique 19th Century stained glass windows which originally adorned the old Freemasons‚Äô Hall in London. Introduction Open to all and located in the heart of Canterbury's tourist route, the Kent Museum of Freemasonry is a five-minute stroll from Canterbury Cathedral and close to the Westgate Towers. Entrance is free of charge, although voluntary donations are welcomed. The Canterbury museum hosts a rare collection of masonic artefacts and ephemera of national and international interest. There are items of interest to both the curious browser and serious student of Freemasonry including many with anthropological links to the City of Canterbury and the County of Kent. The collection includes a fine collection of Masonic paintings, unique glassware and porcelain, along with documents and presentation items. The extensive collection of masonic manuscripts, regalia and books covers all Masonic orders through the ages. Visitors will find a comprehensive history of Freemasonry, from its inception through to the present time, with special emphasis on Kent and both of its modern-day administrators The Masonic Province of East Kent and The Masonic Province of West Kent. Although situated in Canterbury which is masonically administered by the Province of East Kent, the Kent Museum of Freemasonry is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation, registered under Charity No. 1163887 the management of which is in the hands of a separate charitable trust. History The history of the Kent Museum of Freemasonry can be traced to the latter end of the 19th Century. Speculative masonry has been present in Canterbury since 1730 when the city‚Äôs first lodge began meeting at the Red Lion Tavern which adjoined the old Guildhall in the High Street. According to Lanes Masonic record 1717-1894, three private and six military lodges were consecrated in the city. In 1878 the Canterbury lodges, that until then had met in different public houses in the city such as the Kings Head and Brewers Arms, joined together to purchase their own premises near to the Westgate Towers at 38 St Peter's Street. It was in the garden of this building that the Canterbury masonic temple was subsequently constructed in 1880. Over the years the separate lodges acquired and inherited many contemporary and historic masonic artefacts and ephemera. Once the temple was established these were all brought together in the lodge of instruction room at the rear of the building. As the collection continued to grow, space became an ongoing problem. In 1919 the East Kent Masters Lodge No.3931 was consecrated in Canterbury and its first Master was Wykeham Stanley Cornwallis, 2nd Baron Cornwallis, the Provincial Grand Master of the time. After seeing the growing collection of masonic artefacts and books, he conceived the idea of the Kent Provincial Library & Museum. Both Maidstone ‚Äì the County town and location of the Provincial office and Bromley ‚Äì the home of a large number of lodges, were considered as suitable places. However the Provincial Grand Master decided that Canterbury would be the location. It was not long before the Provincial minutes show that an appeal was set up to raise funds \\"to house\\", as the Provincial Grand Master put it, \\"the many treasures that lodges, the Province and its private members had collected over the years for all to see\\". He also wanted them to remain in masonic care. 1920 saw the Province of Kent form a fundraising committee under the chairmanship of W.H. East of Dover, supported by secretary H.C. Page and treasurer H. Biggleston, both of Canterbury. Over the next 5 years the Provincial minutes acknowledge the receipt of many gifts from lodges and the appeal fund, \\"doing well\\", but without the mention of specific totals. However, in 1925 the accounts of the Province showed the sum of ¬£1,036 4s 11d being paid to Bro. Edward Dean of St Augustine's Lodge No. 972 for the purchase of the garden of 34 St Peters Street, Canterbury for the Library & Museum at Canterbury. In 1930 an architect, Bro. F.G. Haywood of Market Square, Dover, was appointed to plan and oversee the construction of the building. The main contractors were W.W. Martin of Ramsgate and G.H. Denne & Son of Walmer. The Provincial Grand Master, The Lord Cornwallis, was by this time also the Deputy Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England and when the old Grand Library and Museum in Great Queen Street, London was demolished to make room for the new Grand Temple and Connaught Rooms, he acquired the stained glass windows, internal doors and most of the showcases for Canterbury. The solid oak entrance doors were donated by a Worshipful Bro. Jimmy Edwards and came from St Mary‚Äôs College, part of the Jesuit house in Hales Place, Canterbury, which was also being demolished at the time. June 1932 saw the building completed and ¬£2,900 was paid to the contractors from the Province‚Äôs general fund. The total cost including the land is recorded as ¬£3,936 4s 11d. The Kent Library & Museum of Freemasonry was officially opened by the Provincial Grand Master on 19 April 1933. The collection has continued to grow and now boasts more than 3,000 pieces of masonic paintings, literature, regalia, glassware and ceramics. In 1993 the Kent Masonic Library and Museum Trust became a registered charity No.1018784. The museum closed to the public in early 2011 for an extensive redevelopment, eventually reopening in September 2012 in a new walk through format, which tells the history of Freemasonry from its inception through to the modern day, which emphasis on Kent, its Lodges and their origins. Displays include information on famous Kent Masons, Masonic military heroes and other masonic orders. Visitor information The museum is usually open from 10.00am to 4.00pm every day except for the Christmas and new year period. It is situated between Canterbury East & West railway stations, with ample public car parking nearby, both on road and in Pound Lane. Wheelchair access is available throughout. Admission is free of charge.

It was a giant chasmosaurine ceratopsian that lived in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage, about 75 million years agoFowler, D. W. 2017. Revised geochronology, correlation, and dinosaur stratigraphic ranges of the Santonian-Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) formations of the Western Interior of North America. PLoS ONE 12(11): e0188426.) in what is now New Mexico. Titanoceratops was named for its large size, being one of the largest known horned dinosaurs and the type species was named T. ouranos, after Uranus (Ouranos), the father of the Greek titans. It was named in 2011 by Nicholas R. Longrich for a specimen previously referred to Pentaceratops. It is the oldest known member of Triceratopsini. It is known solely from the holotype OMNH 10165, a partial skeleton including a mostly complete skull and jaws, and much of the skeleton. The reconstructed skull measures long, making it a candidate for the longest skull of any land animal. With an estimated weight of and length of , Titanoceratops compares with the giant Torosaurus and Triceratops, and was the largest animal in its ecosystem, if not in North America. The holotype skeleton, OMNH 10165, was found in the upper Fruitland Formation, or the lower Kirtland Formation. The border between the two formations is bold, but the original quarry is lost, so it is not known which formation Titanoceratops comes from. The formations are both late Campanian in age. Discovery and naming Beds of the upper Fruitland Formation and lower Kirtland Formation in the vicinity of the Titanoceratops holotype quarry J. Willis Stovall holds up the humerus, 1941 The holotype of Titanoceratops was collected from the upper Fruitland Formation or the lower Kirtland Formation in July 1941, by a field crew consisting J. Willis Stovall, his student Wann Langston Jr., and Donald E. Savage. The precise location of the quarry is no longer known. The holotype specimen consists of most of the fore and hindlimbs, some vertebrae, a fairly complete skull with only one small section of the frill, and partial lower jaws. The bones, being preserved in a fine- grained shale, were crushed and fragile, and so the skeleton was initially considered unsuitable for mounting. Later, however, the fossils were prepared and the skeleton put on display at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. In 1998, the specimen was described by Thomas Lehman as an aberrant and unusually large individual of Pentaceratops sternbergii, previously described from the same area. However, Lehman noted a number of unusual features of the skull that were more similar to Triceratops than to Pentaceratops. The species was later reinterpreted as a member of the Triceratopsini, the group including Triceratops, and formally named by Nicholas R. Longrich in 2011 and the type species is Titanoceratops ouranos. Named by Longrich, Titanoceratops is derived from the Greek Titan, a mythical race of giants, keras (Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ), meaning \\"horn\\", and ops (·Ω§œà), \\"face\\". The species name ouranos, refers to Uranus, the father of the Titan race. Description Artist's impression of Titanoceratops Skeletal reconstruction, holotype material in white, with human for scale The skull measures from the tip of the snout to the quadrate, and the restored frill extends its length up to making it a candidate for the longest skull of any land animal. Titanoceratops was as large as the later triceratopsins Triceratops and Torosaurus, with an estimated weight of and a mounted skeleton measuring long and tall at the back. In 2016 Gregory S. Paul gave a lower estimation of 6.5 meters (21.3 ft) and 4.5 tonnes (4.9 short tons). Tom Holtz (2012) noted that it is extremely similar to its closely related contemporaries Eotriceratops and Ojoceratops, which may all be synonymous. The holotype skeleton of Titanoceratops consists of a partial skull with jaws, syncervical, cervical, dorsal, and sacral vertebrae, caudal certebrae, ribs, humeri, a right radius, femora, tibiae, a right fibula, both ilia, both ischia, and ossified tendons. In total, the amount of material assigned to Titanoceratops means it is quite well known, along with genera like Triceratops, Vagaceratops, Pentaceratops, Chasmosaurus, Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Anchiceratops. Classification Originally assigned to Pentaceratops, Titanoceratops was found by Longrich in its description to not be closely related to that taxon, and instead found it to share characteristics with Triceratops and Torosaurus, for while Longrich established the clade Triceratopsini. The skeleton has many derived features that are shared between Triceratops and its closest relatives. Although the author that originally assigned it to Pentaceratops has decided to ignore this in subsequent publications, most recent studies find Titanoceratops to be valid and distinguished from Pentaceratops. The below cladogram follows Longrich (2015), who named a new species of Pentaceratops, and included nearly all species of chasmosaurine. =Distinguishing characteristics= Holotype restored based on Pentaceratops Front view of the mount Titanoceratops was provided with a list of characters found by Longrich in its description that differ it from other taxa. The features below distinguish it from other Chasmosaurines: the possession of thin squamosals (Triceratops); an unsealed parietal fenestrae (Triceratops); an epijugal resembling a hornlike structure (Triceratops); a narrow median bar of the parietal (Triceratops, Torosaurus); a narial strut oriented vertically with a narrow base (Triceratops, Torosaurus); an enlarged epoccipital on the rear end of the squamosal (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops); an extremely enlarged premaxillary fossa (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops); and in lacking a narial process of the premaxilla that is dorsally inflected (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops). Paleoecology The fossilized leaf of Sabalites, a Cretaceous palm, documents the wet, warm climate that prevailed in Late Cretaceous New Mexico Titanoceratops is known from OMNH 10165, a skeleton from the lowermost Fruitland or uppermost Kirtland Formation. The Fruitland Formation is about thick, and consists of sandstones, mudstones, and abundant coals deposited in a coastal floodplain. Fossil trees are abundant in the area from which the holotype was collected, suggesting a wet, well-forested environment. A fossil tree stump from the Coal Creek area where Titanoceratops was found, showing the extensive coal beds of the area The Kirtland Formation, which conformably overlays the Fruitland, is approximately thick, and made up of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale. Both formations are late Campanian in age. The Fossil Forest Member of the Fruitland is 74.11 ¬± 0.62 million years old, and the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland is between 73.37 ¬± 0.18 and 73.04 ¬± 0.25 million years in age. The two members combined make up the Hunter Wash local fauna. Therefore, Titanoceratops dates between 74 and 73 million years ago. The age Titanoceratops lived in is called the Kirtlandian land-vertebrate age, and it is characterized by the appearance of Pentaceratops sternbergii. A moderately diverse fauna is known from the Kirtland and Fruitland formations. Among the dinosaurs known from the Fruitland and Kirtland formations are the theropods Bistahieversor sealeyi (previously Daspletosaurus and Albertosaurus sp.), \\"Saurornitholestes\\" robustus, Paronychodon lacustris, and an indeterminate ornithomimid (previously Ornithomimus antiquus); the hadrosaurids Anasazisaurus horneri and Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum (previously S. validum); the ankylosaur Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis; and the ceratopsians Pentaceratops sternbergii and an unidentified centrosaurine. Non-dinosaurian fauna include the fishes Myledaphus bypartitus, and Melvius chauliodous; the turtles Denazinemys ornata, Denazinemys nodosa, Boremys grandis, Neurankylus baeuri, Adocus bossi, Adocus kirtlandicus, Basilemys nobilis, Asperideretes ovatus, \\"Plastomenus\\" robustus, and Bothremydidae n. gen., barberl; the crocodylians Denazinosuchus kirtlandicus, Brachychampsa montana, Deinosuchus rugosus, and Leidyosuchus sp.; and the mammalians Paracimexomys judithae, Mesodma senecta, Mesodma sp., Cimexomys sp., Cinemoxys antiquus, Kimbetohia campi, Cimolodon electus, Meniscoessus intermedius, Essonodon sp., Alphadon marshi, Alphadon wilsoni, Alphadon sp. A, Alphadon sp. B, Alphadon? sp., Pediomys cooki; Gypsonictops sp., Cimolestes sp., and an indeterminate eucosmodontid. =Biogeography= Previously, the origins of Triceratops were poorly known. Until the description of Titanoceratops, Eotriceratops was the oldest known triceratopsin, and only dated to 68 million years old, from the uppermost region of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. No Campanian triceratopsins were known, so it appeared as if the group evolved in the Maastrichtian. Titanoceratops shows that large-bodied ceratopsians evolved millions of years earlier than thought. Based on the age of Titanoceratops, there must have been a five million year ghost lineage leading to Eotriceratops. Titanoceratops supports the idea that late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas were highly endemic, with distinct species found in the Southern Great Plains of New Mexico, and the Northern Great Plains of Montana and Canada. Despite extensive sampling to the north in the Dinosaur Park Formation and Two Medicine Formation, triceratopsins are unknown there. This implies that the triceratopsins originally evolved in the south, then spread north in the Maastrichtian.

It was founded in 1999 under the leadership of the musicologist Robert L. Weaver, a retired faculty member of the University of Louisville. Musica Toscana was headed by Margaret M. Guarnieri after 2007. As of 2012, the organization ceased operations. It maintained a reciprocal membership with the period instrument ensemble Auser Musici of Pisa, Italy. One of the principal reasons for the creation of Musica Toscana was the acquisition in 1984 of the private music library of the Italian Ricasoli family by the Dwight Anderson Music Library of the University of Louisville. At the time, the Ricasoli collection was one of the largest private collections of eighteenth-century music remaining in the world. The collection originated with Baron Pietro Leopoldo Ricasoli in Florence and was once in the possession of Baron Bettino Ricasoli, a founding father of the modern Italian state and one of its first prime ministers.An overview of the musical patronage of the Ricasoli family and a catalog of the holdings of their music collection is provided in The Music Library of a Florentine Noble Family (Sterling Heights, Mich: Harmonie Park Press, 2012), . The principal goal of Musica Toscana was to promote music written in Tuscany, performed in Tuscany, or written by Tuscan composers active outside of Tuscany that originated from the period 1590-1850, an era of political, culture, and economic decline in the region, but one of continued musical importance that saw the birth of opera in the 1590s and the invention of the piano a century later. Musica Toscana oversaw the publication of a series of scholarly and performing editions, the Monuments of Tuscan Music, and sponsored concerts and lectures devoted to its repertory of interest, sometimes in collaboration with Bourbon Baroque. Only four of many planned volumes of the Monuments of Tuscan Music series appeared before the dissolution of the organization.

The parish's first church was built c.1912, to designs by Thomas H. Poole & Company, on a site just down Isham Street from the current church, surrounded by wooded countryside. A two-story parochial school at 110-116 Cooper Street was built in 1924, to designs by Auguste L. Noel, at the cost of $250,000. A five-story brick convent was located at 620 Isham Street; it was built in 1950 and was designed by architect Paul C. Reilly. It cost $300,000 to construct. Despite the change of the parish's ethnic make-up to be largely Dominican-Americans, there are still ties to the church and New York's Irish community. The church was deeply affected by the loss of many Irish-Americans in the September 11 attacks.

Formed in 1963 as Jack's of Norton, it expanded from 2001 to operate a network of local bus routes using over 60 vehicles. History Wardle Transport was founded in 1963 by Doug Wardle. It initially traded as Jack's of Norton, and was run alongside travel agent Wardle Travel. For its first 38 years of existence, the company operated a small fleet of minibuses on school services. In 2002 contracts to operate two routes in Stoke-on-Trent were won; these were operated with three Optare Alero minibuses hired from Stoke-on-Trent City Council. One of these routes was withdrawn in 2004. Following First Potteries maximum allowable vehicles being cut, Wardle gained three school services, acquiring its first double-decker vehicles to operate the routes.History of Wardle Transport Wardle Transport A new route linking Hanley, Haywood Hospital and Burslem was launched in early 2006. The route, supported by the city council, replaced a route withdrawn by another operator, but was initially found not to be commercially viable. In 2007, the company won a contract to operate services to Stoke City Football Club home matches, initially using four double-deck buses. The services proved popular and the following season saw eight buses used. Four new commercial routes were also introduced in 2008. A new direct service linking Blurton to Hanley, branded as Plumline, was introduced in 2008. An Optare Versa single-decker was bought for use on the route. In December 2010, Wardle Transport was sold to Arriva and placed under the control of its Arriva Midlands subsidiary.Arriva Midlands announces acquisition of Wardle Transport Arriva 8 December 2010 Arriva stated that Wardle's identity would be retained. At the time of the takeover, Wardle employed 105 staff and operated a fleet of 64 buses and ran 18 scheduled services.

History The parish was established in 1866. It was formed from portions of St. Stephen the Martyr, St. Michael's, Holy Cross, Cathedral and St. Columba's parishes. The first pastor was Father John Larkin, formerly of County Galway, Ireland by way of St. Michael's. He purchased a small frame Episcopal church on the corner of Broadway and 37th St. The old name was retained and the chapel converted for use until a new church building could be constructed. The present edifice was dedicated on February 13, 1870. As the city rapidly expanded northward the community, known as the \\"Tenderloin\\", teemed with immigrants from Europe. In 1872, A parochial school adjoining the church was built, staffed by the Sisters of Charity. Later, the Christian Brothers were enlisted to provide instruction. By the early 1900s the area was known for newspaper publishing (The New York Herald) and theaters (The Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)). Holy Innocents was called the \\"actor's church\\". Eugene O'Neill, the playwright, was baptized in the church in 1888. Pastor Rev. Dr. Richard Brennan transferred here in 1890 from being pastor since 1875 of St. Rose of Lima's Old Church (New York City), after the death of the former pastor, Rev. Larkin.\\"Father Larkin's Successor,\\" New York Times, January 13, 1891 (Retrieved 20 May 2011); Excerpt: \\"Dr. Richard Brennan, who for twenty years has been of the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rose of Lima on Cannon Street, has been transferred to the Church of St Rose of Lima, on Cannon Street, has been transferred to the Church of the Holy Innocents on West Thirty-seventh Street, to fill the vacancy caused by the recent death of the Rev.

He was formerly pastor of the Church of the Sacred Heart in Highland Falls, New York.\\"The parish debt being paid off, the church was consecrated by Archbishop Corrigan on February 12, 1901. In the early 1900s, the parish owned three buildings behind the church, one serving as the rectory and the others bringing in some income from boarders. By 1910, the area went through a profound change as the tenements were rapidly replaced by imposing commercial buildings.\\"History\\", Shrine and Parish Church off the Holy Innocents With its congregation dispersed, Holy Innocents faced financial difficulties.

Business nationalists are conservative business and industrial leaders who favor a protectionist trade policy and an isolationist foreign policy. Locked in a power struggle with corporate international interests, business nationalists often use populist rhetoric and anti-elitist rhetoric to build a broader base of support in the middle class and working class. In the past, business nationalism has also been the main sector in the US from which union busting has emerged. There have also been sectors of business nationalism that have promoted the Red Scares, nativism, and allegations of Jewish banking conspiracies. History Ultraconservative business and industrial leaders who saw the New Deal implemented in the United States between 1933 and 1936 as proof of an imagined sinister alliance by international finance capital and communist-controlled labor unions to destroy free enterprise became known as \\"business nationalists\\". In the middle of the 1930s Gerald L. K. Smith carried the banner for business nationalists, many of them isolationists who would later oppose the entry of the United States into World War II. Smith received public and financial support from wealthy businessmen who were concentrated in \\"nationalist-oriented industries\\". These included the heads of national oil companies Quaker State, Penzoil, and Kendall Refining; automakers Henry Ford, and John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge. Business nationalists who networked other ultra-conservatives included J. Howard Pew, president of Sun Oil, and William B. Bell, president of the chemical company American Cyanamid. Pew and Bell served on the executive committee of the National Association of Manufacturers. Pew also funded the American Liberty League (1934‚Äì1940), Sentinels of the Republic, and other groups that flirted with fascism prior to World War II. After World War II Pew funded conservative Christian evangelicals such as Reverend Billy Graham. The John Birch Society, founded in 1959, incorporated many themes from pre-World War II right-wing groups opposed to the New Deal, and had its base in business nationalist circles. The society heavily disseminated an ultraconservative business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations. business nationalism was represented by ultraconservative political figures such as Pat Buchanan. Criticism According to progressive scholar Mark Rupert, the right-wing anti-globalist worldview of business nationalists ‚Äúenvisions a world in which Americans are uniquely privileged, inheritors of a divinely inspired socio‚Äìpolitical order which must at all costs be defended against external intrusions and internal subversion.‚Äù Rupert argues that this reactionary analysis seeks to challenge corporate power without comprehending the nature of ‚Äúcapital concentration and the transnational socialization of production.‚Äù The reactionary analysis absent this understanding breeds social alienation and intensifies ‚Äúscapegoating and hostility toward those seen as outside of, different or dissenting from its vision of national identity.\\" As alienation builds, more overtly fascistic forces will attempt to pull some of these angry people into an ideological framework that further justifies demonization of the chosen \\"Other.\\" Investigative reporter Chip Berlet argues: See also References Economic ideologies Economic nationalism Nationalism in Australia Nationalism in the United States Right-wing populism in the United States Conservatism in the United States ","title":"Business nationalism"},{"id":"30239205","text":"Donald R. \\"Don\\" Miller (born January 11, 1966) is a former Republican member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 121st Assembly District, which encompasses Cicero, Clay, Manlius, Pompey, and Lafayette. He was elected November 2, 2010, after defeating incumbent assemblyman Al Stirpe. He was defeated in the 2012 rematch with Al Stirpe (D, North Syracuse) in one of the most expensive and hotly contested races in New York State. Miller was raised in Liverpool, New York, and is a graduate of Liverpool High School. He earned a B.A. in political science from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York in 1988, an M.A. in Teaching from Lee University in 2005, an M.A. Enhancement in Education Leadership also from Lee University in 2007, and an M.A. in Theological Studies from Liberty University in 2019. His career includes business owner, teacher, school Principal, politician, and ordained minister of the Christian faith. Miller and his wife Tracy, a naturalized citizen, were married in 2006 and have two children. Miller has been active in politics, business, education, and Christian missions since 1985. Early in his career Miller was a partner in a political consulting firm representing candidates at the local, state, and federal levels. The firm specialized in supporting conservative Republican candidates in challenges to more moderate incumbent Republican office holders, and performed fund raising and public relations services for a number of specific issues and public individuals. During this time Miller served as New York Youth chairman for Congressman Jack Kemp's 1988 Republican primary campaign for President of the United States, and served for a time on Kemp's staff at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Miller also worked on Capitol Hill for Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, a member of the Gang of Seven House Members who pressed the House Banking scandal, also known as the Congressional Check Bouncing scandal, in a drive to reform Congressional rules on ethics. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, believing the conservative wing of the Republican Party could be over-run by Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Miller brought considerable support for former Reagan speech writer Patrick Buchanan, which quickly ended Duke's campaign and influence. In the New York State Assembly, Miller served on the Committees on Labor, Corporations, Banks, Aging, and Cities, and was the Ranking Republican Member on the Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection. An uncompromising conservative on fiscal and social matters, Miller supported and the Legislature passed a $1.8 billion income tax cut, agriculture tax cuts, and a 12% cut in state government spending. He cast 85 votes against tax increases, and supported funding for education, prescription drug coverage, and employment tax credits. Miller sponsored legislation for a cap on state property taxes at 0% annual growth, a 0% state tax on income from capital gains, a 0% state tax on estate transfers, and a 0% state tax on corporate profits. He also sponsored legislation to eliminate unfunded state-mandated spending through local government levy, and to limit Members' terms of service. Miller challenged state taxes on cell phones, health insurance, auto insurance, gasoline, and day care services as unbalanced burdens on families at the lowest end of the income scale, and as broadly regressive. Miller consistently voted against budget and spending bills he viewed as political, frequently asserting that business grants and economic development funds were part of the political funding mechanism incumbents of both parties used to retain control of their positions in State government. Miller voted against the State's same-sex marriage bill, arguing that the Biblical parameters for marriage are not subject to modification by the State. Miller was twice recognized as the most independent Member of the State Legislature by the New York Public Interest Research Group, and was also recognized as the most conservative Member by the New York State Conservative Party, which together placed him to the political right of both the Democrat Majority and the moderate Republican Assembly minority. From 1997 through 2005 Miller taught English to Chinese university students, and from 2000 through 2005 he was an unofficial advisor to senior leaders in the People's Republic of China. He filled the role of Quality Manager for a medical manufacturer from 2006 through 2011. From 2014 through 2019 he was the lead Academic administrator for two start-up American curriculum K-12 international schools in China under Tsinghua University, serving as Secondary Head of School at Tsinghua School International and as Academic Principal at Kaiwen Academy.

The mine elevator is called the ‚Äúskip‚Äù in the mining industry. Fully loaded it carries four tons of salt and makes a round trip every three minutes. This loaded skip is hoisted to the top electrically by a wire rope with jute core, and is used to transport miners to and from the mine as well as bring the mined salt topside. Because of the impurities (mostly shale and anhydrite), rock salt is used primarily as road salt.‚ÄúKGS Pub. Inf. Circ. 21 ‚Äì Part 1 of 4.‚Äù Welcome to the Kansas Geological Survey. http://ww.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic21/pic21_1.html (accessed December 21, 2010). The method of producing rock salt has changed significantly over the years from men hacking at the salt-face with pick-axes to a highly efficient, modern industry. Every step of the journey that salt makes from the mine to the finished product is modern, mechanized, and efficient. Another form of mining, solution mining or the evaporation process, is performed at Cargill Salt and Morton Salt, both located in Reno County.‚ÄúKGS Pub. Inf. Circ. 21 ‚Äì Part 1 of 4.‚Äù Welcome to the Kansas Geological Survey. http://ww.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic21/pic21_3.html (accessed December 21, 2010). Water is forced down a pipe into the salt deposit where it dissolves into brine which is pumped to the surface and heated to the point of evaporation, leaving behind a high grade of salt. Nearly everyone uses some type of evaporated salt every day. Museum visitors ride on electric trams driven by docents for The Dark Ride segment of the visit underground. Miners have a different form of transportation‚Äîvehicles that run on bio-diesel fuel, or B100, a fuel that is almost 100% cooking oil. After the rail system was discontinued, miners switched to an alternative way to get around the mine‚Äîold junk cars. Initially, these cars were modified to run on diesel, but have been updated to use bio-diesel because it does not leave particles in the air. The Hutchinson Salt Company mine was the first mine in North America to convert underground vehicles to B100 fuel. A salt car from the Carey Salt Company (now the Hutchinson Salt Company)Salt produced at the Hutchinson Salt Company is called rock salt, and about 500,000 tons is mined each year. It is principally used for industrial purposes and for de-icing highways. When finely ground, it is used for feeding livestock. It is not used for table salt or other purposes requiring a very pure type of salt.‚ÄúKGS Pub. Inf. Circ. 21 ‚Äì Part 1 of 4.‚Äù Welcome to the Kansas Geological Survey. http://ww.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic21/pic21_1.html (accessed December 21, 2010). In contrast, salt produced through the evaporation process produces common table salt, as well as salt used by pharmaceutical companies, food processors, and agricultural and chemical businesses. Mines that are no longer in production can be used for a variety of purposes. Entrepreneurs of all likes have proposed using them for everything from prisons to massive chicken coops. The Hutchinson mine is home to Underground Vaults & Storage, a secure facility housing documents, artifacts, and other valuable material from around the world. Although natural gas companies sometimes use salt caverns for storing reserves and a salt mine in New Mexico even stores radioactive waste, the Hutchinson salt mine has never been used for anything other than storage of records‚Äîand now, of course, the Museum.‚ÄúKGS Pub.

The Society did not have a permanent home for a museum until 1963 when it opened in five rooms in the downstairs area of a home belonging to RCHS founder and then president, Goldie Maupin. Mrs. Maupin lived in the home originally built by one of the former mayors of Hutchinson, J.P. Harsha, for whom the large drainage canal on the outskirts of the city was named.Cook, Cherie. ‚ÄúReno County‚Äôs Museum.‚Äù Legacy: The Journal of the Reno County Historical Society, Fall 1989: volume 1, number 1, page 15. By 1967, the society's collections outgrew the Harsha House and the Reno County Historical Museum was moved to nearby Haven, Kansas, a smaller community located southeast of Hutchinson.Haven Journal, ‚ÄúReno County Historical Society To Have Headquarters In Haven: Museum Will Be Located In Township Hall,‚Äù August 31, 1967, sec. 5. In Haven, the museum thrived for the first few years. Community leaders believed the museum would provide an anchor for downtown growth and the development of tourism in Haven. Efforts to gain a tax base for support from the Reno County mill levy for the museum were unsuccessful, however. The museum's home in historic Township Hall also began to deteriorate during the early 1970s. The roof began to leak and the basement periodically flooded. Collections storage areas also filled to capacity and the museum was forced to stop collecting artifacts in 1976. By that time, the collection had grown to approximately 10,000 artifacts, some of which were lost or ruined due to the terrible condition of the building and the lack of environmental control. Community support also ebbed as the condition of the museum facility grew worse. During the early 1980s the museum was only open on Sunday afternoons, and by appointment. In 1984, the Reno County Historical Society's Board of Directors began a campaign to bring the museum back to the more heavily populated city of Hutchinson ‚Äì which is also the county seat of Reno County. The Board convened a site selection committee and began a development fund drive that ultimately led to the purchase of the Kline Insurance Building and the Rosemont Hotel. Part of the funds were used to construct a link between the adjacent buildings and to establish the Borton Memorial Garden near the entrance to the museum. The first professional Director and Curator were hired in 1985, and the museum opened its doors on December 12, 1986 at its present location.Cook, Cherie. ‚ÄúReno County‚Äôs Museum.‚Äù Legacy: The Journal of the Reno County Historical Society, Fall 1989: vol. 1, no 1, page 16. In 1989, the museum began publishing ‚Äò‚ÄôLegacy: The Journal of the Reno County Historical Society‚Äô‚Äô. In 1996 and 1997, the museum redesigned its public space to include five exhibit galleries, two children's interactive areas, a research room, and the Houston Whiteside Conference Room, named for one of the society's benefactors.Smith, Jay. ‚ÄúNote from the Director.‚Äù Legacy: The Journal of the Reno County Historical Society, Fall 1997: vol. 9, no. 4 In 1996, the museum developed the Celebrate History educational program for elementary school students, which annually hosts over 1200 students from the Reno County area.Garwood, Pat. ‚ÄúFrom the Educator‚Äôs Desk.‚Äù Legacy: The Journal of the Reno County Historical Society, Fall 1996: vol. 8, no. 4 In 1997, the Kansas Department of Transportation granted the museum's request to relocate the 1876 John Siegrist claim House to museum grounds, thus saving the structure from demolition. The Claim House opened to the public in September 1998.‚ÄúPassages.‚Äù Legacy: the Journal of the Reno County Historical Society, Summer 1998: vol. 10, no. 3 In 1998 and again in 2000, the RCHS received the prestigious General Operating Support grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington D.C.‚ÄùIMLS ‚Äì Grant Recipients.‚Äù Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). http://www.imls.gov/recipients/ (accessed December 21, 2010). In 1998 the RCHS began a long range planning process that resulted in the idea of creating a major exhibition about the salt industry in Reno County. That idea grew to become the Kansas Underground Salt Museum.Green, John. ‚ÄúReno Co. Museum plans for expansion, long-range progress.‚Äù The Hutchinson News, February 12, 1998, pg. A10 =Construction= Beginning in 1923, miners and visitors went underground in groups no larger than ten, as that was the maximum capacity of the one-and-only elevator. It was a dark, dank ride that often sprinkled salt on riders. The shaft never took up a load of salt while carrying miners. In fact, when the elevator transported people, salt production below had to stop. For this reason, the visionaries of the salt museum knew a project could not get underway without construction of a new shaft. In cooperation with Underground Vaults & Storage, the storage company located in the mine, the two entities agreed to share the cost of the shaft, making the Kansas Underground Salt Museum a viable reality. The shaft had to be drilled through one of the world's largest aquifers. The Ogallala Aquifer covers around in eight states and can be as deep as . In this area, it is known as the Equus Beds and is about thick at the site of the museum.Macfarlane, P. A., G. Misgna, and R. W. Buddemeier. ‚ÄúAquifers of the High Plains Region.‚Äù An Atlas of the Kansas High Plains Aquifer. http://www.kgs.ku.edu/HighPlians/atlas/ataqhpr.htm (accessed December 23, 2010). For efficient construction without water seepage, the aquifer was frozen. That allowed miners to dig through the aquifer and encase the shaft in concrete. Shaft construction was handled by Thyssen Mining Company, a Canadian contractor. The project got underway March 8, 2004, and took just a day shy of one year to complete. Thyssen utilized the expertise of Moretrench American Corporation for the ground freezing. The process required the sinking of 24 separate pipes to a depth of . A liquid nitrogen and salt brine solution pumped into the pipes brought the temperature down to freeze the aquifer.‚ÄúPeripheral Freezing - Shafts, Large Circular Open Excavations, Tunnel Excavations.‚Äù Moretrench ‚Äì Construction and Geotechnical Services. http://www.moretrench.com/ services_article.php?Peripheral-Freezing-16 (accessed December 23, 2010) Once the frozen condition was accomplished, excavation began using a crane and bucket methods. The mining cycle consisted of drilling in six-to eight-foot increments, loading the area with explosives, blasting, then ‚Äúmucking out‚Äù (removing) the blasted material from the shaft. The miners would then advance and pour the shaft's concrete liner. This action was performed with every advancement. On December 22, 2004, the shaft sinking was completed. Finish work on the shaft continued until March 7, 2005. On June 4, 2013, the museum changed its name from Kansas Underground Salt Museum to Strataca.Salt museum unveils new brand; The Hutchinson News; June 4, 2013.Reps hope new salt museum logo 'rocks'; The Hutchinson News; June 4, 2013.

They scoured the of mined caverns at the Hutchinson Salt company. The artifacts they were able to collect have significantly contributed to the scope of the museum displays. The train was used to transport salt, miners and suppliesThe weather in Kansas may be erratic and unpredictable, but conditions underground are very predictable and constant. The mine naturally maintains a temperature of 68 degrees with a relative humidity of around 45%.Stokes, Keith. ‚ÄúKansas Underground Salt Museum ‚Äì Hutchinson, Kansas.‚Äù Kansas Travel, Tourism & Restaurants, Kansas Travel, n.d. Web. 28 December 2010. The mine chambers are very large, ranging in size from 2,500 to with ceiling heights ranging from 11 to . Since 1954, anyone going into the mine has been required to wear a hard hat and rescue breather.‚ÄùReservations.‚Äù Kansas Underground Salt Museum. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 December 2010. http://www.undergroundmuseum.org/reservations In the history of Hutchinson's salt mine, no visitor or mine employee has ever needed to use the breather. The Mine Safety and Health Administration, which regularly inspects all aspects of the operation, considers the Hutchinson mine one of the safest in the world. The material used for much of the museum flooring is very similar to concrete; but instead of sand, salt is used with the cement and water. Thus, it is known as Saltcrete. With the ready availability of the salt, it is definitely practical and cost effective for the museum. Saltcrete does leach ‚Äì emitting a fine dust of salt ‚Äì until it is cured, which takes approximately one year. It has limited applications because water makes Saltcrete blister and disintegrate. Galleries & Exhibits =The Dark Ride= A tram tour, the Dark Ride, is an optional opportunity that takes visitors through a maze of chambers beyond the museum area to see various features of the mine environment ‚Äì with a brief pause to experience the sensation of complete darkness. The tour also includes a stop at a salt pile for a souvenir ‚Äì filling a sample bag with salt crystals. =The Mantrip Gallery= Vehicle used in underground transportationMantrips are train-like vehicles. In this gallery, two of the mantrips used to transport miners to and from the mining area are featured. The rail system was used until the 1980s when miners started using vehicles modified for B100 bio-diesel. The vehicles used underground are usually scrap yard cars taken apart to fit on the hoist, then reconfigured underground to drive on bio-diesel, and with extra seats and rollbars added. =The Mining Gallery= Visitors learn about all aspects of the modern-day mining process, as well as earlier procedures, through this three-part gallery. In the Undercut and drill area, the mine is set up for the first phase of a blast. An undercutter is used to cut a slot at the base of the rock, making it possible for the salt to drop. In this phase, a series of carefully sited holes are drilled into the salt wall. The next pillar of the Mining Gallery is the blast area, which illustrates how the room being mined is wired with explosives. On display is a powder car. It was formerly a drill, but was modified underground as a powder car and carried all the tools and materials needed to powder a room, including the explosives and wire. The third phase of the mining process featured is the Load Area. Miners used the Joy Loader on display from the 1940s until 1983 when the rail system was discontinued. Named for its manufacturer, the Joy Loader increased efficiency by eliminating the need to hand-load ore cars. This large piece of equipment, as so many others, was brought down the shaft in pieces and welded back together underground. Once a piece of equipment is underground, it remains. When equipment finally outlives its usefulness, it is usually abandoned in an area already mined. The shuttle featured in this gallery was also used from the 1940s until 1983 to take salt from the mine face to the loading station at the main rail line. Powered by a DC extension cord, the car reduced labor and increased efficiency because miners no longer had to lay rails to get the salt from the blast site to the main rail lines. =The Geology Gallery= Vreeland ExhibitVisitors learn the physical and geological characteristics of the salt bed in Kansas. With a focus on the Permian Period (the sixth and last period of the Paleozoic Era), the gallery illustrates the animals that lived during this time and why there are no fossil records in the salt bed.‚ÄúThe Permian.‚Äù UCMP ‚Äì University of California Museum of Paleontology. http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/permian/permian.html (accessed December 21, 2010). Throughout the mine, water bubbles can be found trapped in some of the salt. These fluid inclusions are believed to have occurred during the Permian Period.‚ÄúKGS Pub. Inf. Circ. 21 ‚Äì Part 1 of 4.‚Äù Welcome to the Kansas Geological Survey. http://ww.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic21/pic21_1.html (accessed December 21, 2010). The Fluid Inclusion Exhibit features what is claimed to be the world's oldest living organism, estimated to be about 250 million years old. The supposed discovery of living bacteria found trapped inside a salt crystal is the work of Drs. Russell Vreeland, William Rosenzweig, and Dennis Powers. They claimed that the cells from which those spores presumably formed were alive and active before the time of dinosaurs. (However, their findings date the crystal surrounding the bacteria, and DNA analysis suggests the bacteria themselves are likely to be less ancient.) The three scientists were at the museum for the exhibit opening and collected salt samples from the Hutchinson mine for further research.‚ÄùExhibits.‚Äù Kansas Underground Salt Museum. N.P., n.d.

It was not until 2012 that DNA testing was sophisticated enough to determine that the shade was likely made from a parchment of cow skin. Synopsis In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a lampshade purported to be made from the skin of a Jewish Holocaust victim, turned up in a sidewalk rummage sale in New Orleans. It was purchased for $35 by Skip Henderson, a local New Orleans man just returned to the City from Katrina evacuation. Henderson subsequently sent the lampshade to his friend Mark Jacobson, thinking that the Brooklyn writer would be interested in searching into the history of the object. Jacobson then embarks on a 5 year quest to discover the true origin of the lampshade. Genetic testing initially confirmed it was made from human skin. But because of the tanning process, researchers were unable to determine the ethnic origin of the person whose skin was used, nor to date it.National Public Radio, New Book Tells Grim Story Of 'The Lampshade', NPR, December 28, 2010 Over the course of the next few years, Jacobson attempts to track down the origin of and explore the meaning of the lampshade, how it ended up in New Orleans, and to decide what to do with it. Both the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem, declined to take possession of the lampshade, saying that accounts of concentration camp lampshades made of human skin were probably a \\"myth\\". Through his investigation, Jacobson examines the history of the Buchenwald concentration camp, where such objects were reputed to have been made; as well as the racial and post-Katrina history of New Orleans, the world of Holocaust deniers, the mythology surrounding objects said to be made from human skin, and the black market trafficking of such goods. Cow skin In 2012 the lampshade was subjected to more sophisticated, next-generation DNA testing. It was determined to most likely be cow skin, or parchment. Prepared skins, known as parchment, were used for writing materials in ancient and medieval times.National Geographic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuqupFyq1o at 38m 30s \\"Video\\" References History books about the Holocaust Human trophy collecting Buchenwald concentration camp Works about Hurricane Katrina 21st century in New Orleans 2010 non-fiction books ","title":"The Lampshade"},{"id":"30239237","text":"The Kirov coal mine is a large coal mine located in the south-east of Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast.

It is a drawbridge with a bascule-type draw span. A new bridge was constructed in 2012 to replace the former span built in 1907. It opened on September 8, 2012. Related construction work finished in June 2013. History =1907 bridge= 1907 bridge in 2006 The main bridge structure, a Scherzer through-girder bascule design, was built by the King Bridge Company in 1907 for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. It was one of eight moveable bridges on the Amtrak route through Connecticut surveyed in one multiple property study in 1986. The eight bridges, from west to east, are: Mianus River Railroad Bridge at Cos Cob, built in 1904; Norwalk River Railroad Bridge at Norwalk, 1896; Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge at Westport, 1905; Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge at Bridgeport, 1902; Housatonic River Railroad Bridge, at Devon, 1905; Connecticut River Railroad Bridge, Old Saybrook-Old Lyme, 1907; this, the Niantic River Bridge, East Lyme-Waterford, 1907; and the Thames River Bridge, Groton, built in 1919. The bridge was deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, but was not listed due to owner objection, with decision reference number 87002124. The 1907 bridge provided just of vertical clearance when closed, constraining most commercial boats in Niantic Harbor to the bridge schedule. Its horizontal clearance when open was , usually limiting passage to one direction at a time. These restrictions made the bridge unpopular with boat owners, which contributed to a 2003 agreement between Amtrak and the Coast Guard which limited the number of daily trains over the bridge. The agreement was later problematic for Amtrak and the state, as it prevented full expansion of Shore Line East service to New London. Due to these clearance issues, as well as increased reliability problems, Amtrak began planning for a replacement for the century-old bridge. =Current bridge= The 2012 replacement bridge towers over the 1907 bridge In 2010, construction began on a new fixed-trunnion bascule bridge to replace the 1907 span, in an ARRA-funded project. Located south of the old bridge, on the approximate alignment of the pre-1907 swing span, the new structure provides of horizontal clearance, and of closed vertical clearance at mean high water. As part of the project, Amtrak also replenished the beachfront and replaced the Niantic Bay Boardwalk, which had been damaged in storms several years before. The new Niantic River Bridge was opened to rail traffic on September 8, 2012. Removal of the old bridge, which was crossed by a train for the final time on September 7, began at the wane of the summer boating season in September, while restoration of the beach, pedestrian pathways and boardwalks in the affected area continued until May 2013. Amtrak announced the completion of the project in June 2013.

Mr. Kay was born in Cyprus, but his family moved to England when he was an infant. His family struggled financially, and he took up work as a shoeshine boy outside a barbershop on London's West End. He became an apprentice to the proprietor, at first standing on a milk crate to cut. He won a national barber competition, and in the late 1930s he emigrated to New York. He worked at various places before taking over the Broadway Barbershop. His business was on the west side of Broadway in Manhattan's Upper West Side between 103rd and 104th Streets. Reputed to be the oldest in the city, it was founded in 1904. Mr. Kay took over in the early 1970s and ran it for almost 30 years until he retired in 1996. In addition to haircuts, he provided shaves with a straight razor. He maintained his salon in keeping with traditional barber shops, and when he retired he refused offers to sell the interior and donated it instead to the Museum of the City of New York. Throughout the years, as his business increasingly became an anachronism, it was featured in articles, books, and art. He was featured at least twice in New Yorker cartoons, as a subject in a painting by Max Ferguson, and in books about fading New York businesses. Mr. Kay claimed to have given Yul Brynner his first shaved head, and to have cut the hair of presidents Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as that of actor Humphrey Bogart, the composers Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. He had an appearance on Sesame Street. He took a particular interest in the families he served. He worked six days a week, did not post his prices, refused to take appointments, and made customers wait, often standing in line outside his shop.

Twickenham Ferry could carry 12 sleeping cars or 40 goods wagons, with space for 25 cars. Accommodation was provided for 500 passengers. History Twickenham Ferry was built by Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd as yard number 1446. Launched on 15 March 1934, completion was in July. Jointly owned by the Southern Railway & Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace, she was built for service on the Dover - Dunkerque route, but initially operated out of Southampton as the new facilities at Dover were not ready. Her port of registry was London and the code letters GWTQ were allocated. On 22 September 1936, she was reflagged to France. Her port of registry was changed to Dunkerque and her code letters were changed to FOSA. Twickenham Ferry commenced service between Dover and Dunkerque on 6 October 1936. She served on this route until 25 August 1939. The next day, Twickenham Ferry was requisitioned by the Admiralty as HMS Twickenham. Her port of registry was changed to London and the code letters BCYF were allocated. She was re-allocated the Official Number 163500. She was converted to a minesweeper, and initially based at Southampton. She was put into service between Larne and Stranraer from July to December 1940, and again from March 1941 to January 1944. By November 1944, Twickenham was employed in taking locomotives to Calais being able to carry 16 locomotives and 16 wagons. She could also carry an ambulance train of 14 carriages and four wagons., with the associated personnel.

On 31 October 1945, HMS Twickenham was returned to Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace and regained her former name of Twickenham Ferry. She was the first Southern Railway ship to enter Cherbourg post-war. In 1947, Twickenham Ferry was converted from coal to oil burning. On the formation of British Railways in 1948, Twickenham Ferry was registered to the British Transport Commission. With the introduction of IMO Numbers, Twickenham Ferry was allocated the number 5371478. With the introduction of TOPS in 1968, Sealink ships were classed as locomotives for TOPS purposes, being allocated Class 99. Twickenham Ferry was allocated 99 006. She was withdrawn from service in 1974 as her boilers were life-expired. Her final day of service was 5 May 1974. On 24 May, she was sold for scrap, arriving on 26 May at San Esteban de Pravia, Spain, where she was scrapped by Stellnortem.

Al-Hurr's short but provocative mark on history spans less than one week's time, but is embedded with complex details and fatal turns of events that led to the martyrdom of al-Husayn(a.s)during the Battle of Karbala. Shrine of Hur bin Yazid Lineage and background Minor discrepancies of al- Hurr's tribal lineage appear in various historical accounts. The Encyclopedia of Islam gives his full title as \\"al-Hurr ibn Yazid ibn Nadjiya ibn Ka'nab ibn Attab ibn al-Harith ibn Amr ibn Hamman al Riyahi al Yarbu'i al Tamimi\\". In one account from al-Tabari, Zakariyya ibn Yaha al Darir describes al-Hurr as a descendant of Al-Yarbu'i Riyahi from the tribe of Banu Tamim located in Kufa, Iraq. This is the most commonly accepted lineage of al-Hurr conveying a condensed title of al-Hurr ibn Yazid al Tamimi. However, another account of al-Tabari transmitted by al-Husayn ibn Abd al-Rahman conveys the title of al- Hurr ibn Yazid al-Hanzali, deriving lineage a different clan, the Banu Nahshal. Encounter with Al-Husayn Al-Hurr's initial orders from Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad were not to fight or attack al-Husayn. Al-Hurr was ordered to meet and follow al-Husayn and his followers into Kufa, and not leave them to go elsewhere. An initial noncombatant encounter with Al-Husayn was stressed in many sources. Patrolling caravans within the vicinity of Kufa, al-Hurr encountered al-Husayn midday at Dhu Husam in the Iraqi desert. Al-Husayn and his followers included 32 horseman and 40 foot soldiers. According to multiple sources, female family members were present but their numbers were not included in the foot soldier count. Contrary to immediate warfare, al-Husayn greeted al-Hurr and the soldiers by personally serving them water from his own limited supply. No immediate animosity was present between al-Husayn and the opposing camp as they obliged. The hospitality of al-Husayn even extended to the cavalry of al-Hurr's troop. Al-Husayn's dwindling supply of water will be crucial to further events; his display of warrior virtue will stand in stark contrast to later treatment from the Ummayyad army. Numerous exchanges between al-Hurr and al-Husayn during this juncture lead to believe that the general Ummayad populace (in the microcosm of al-Hurr and his cavalry) was not averse to al-Husayn and his leadership. In fact, al-Husayn offered al-Hurr to lead the congregated party for prayer. Al-Hurr denied this request, and instead had al-Husayn lead prayer as imam for himself and his soldiers. Recognizing that an Ummayyad army of 1,000 horsemen praying behind Yazid ibn Mu'awaiya's rival is a testament to the respect and honor still given to the family of Muhammad. This will later change with increasing commands from the Kufan governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Imam Hussain not only gave Al-Hurr and his companions water from his limited supply, but also gave his horse. Miscommunication of letters Al Husayn quickly conveyed his disposition shortly after prayer. He asserted that his arrival to Iraq was only due an abundance of written pledges of support from the people of Kufa. However, al-Husayn pleaded that if people are averse to his arrival, he would return to Mecca peacefully. Al-Hurr replies that he is unaware of any letters of allegiance approved by the Kufan people. He was not amongst those who wrote them. Al-Hurr's response illuminates potential discrepancies within recorded history. Al-Hurr may have chosen the less controversial answer in reply to Al-Husayn, thereby eliminated an ethical decision at the scene. Also, supporters of al-Husayn may have been overestimated. Although al-Husayn had sent his cousin, Muslim ibn Aqil, to investigate the situation in Kufa, numerous sources describe inconsistent numbers of pledges of allegiance that Muslim ibn Aqil counted for al-Husayn personally. On the other hand, if al-Hurr was patrolling the desert during Muslim ibn Aqil's visit, there is reason to believe al-Hurr was simply absent from the events of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's atrocities including the threat of annihilation to any supporters of al-Husayn. The latter is more likely than to encroach upon the character of al-Hurr when he has visibly demonstrated good will towards al-Husayn by accepting his hospitality and position of prayer. At this point, al-Hurr is likely unaware of any deceit on behalf of the governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Al-Hurr may be merely administrating orders on with the intent of soldier chivalry towards al-Husayn. Compromise of orders After the afternoon prayer on the same day, al-Husayn calls his followers to prepare for departure. Al-Hurr swiftly prevents al-Husayn from retracting his steps towards Mecca. This incurs al-Husayn to deliver a speech entailing all present to fear God, recognize the rights of all people upon each other, the rights of Muhammad's family. He also mentions that if neither al-Hurr nor his soldiers understand these rights, he simply desires to leave in peace. Al-Hurr halts and reconsiders his stance. Hints of indecisiveness begin to accumulate for al-Hurr. He was not aware of the allegiance of the Kufan people to al-Husayn; now he may question why the rights of Muhammad's family were not emphasized more by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Another discrepancy within historical accounts occurs here. The minority account conveys that al-Hurr began to fear al-Husayn and the outcome of his deeds of captivity. This fear pushes al-Hurr to follow al-Husayn on an alternative path, neither towards Kufa or Medina, in this account. Nevertheless, the overwhelming accounts by numerous sources convey that al-Hurr fashions a compromise. This very deed could be deemed direct treason by the Umayyad army. However, the fact that the rest of the soldiers complied to al-Hurr's position boldly prove that the ethical qualm of detaining al-Husayn may be eternally eclipsed by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's conceited demands. Al-Hurr offers al-Husayn the compromise of taking any road leading away from Kufa but not any closer to Medina. Additionally, al-Hurr writes to Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad about the affairs and due actions of al- Husayn, and encourages al-Husayn to do the same for Yazid ibn Mu‚Äôawaiya. Moreover, al-Hurr expresses to be relieved from this entire affair of al- Husayn. This shows an emerging conscience and questioning of dispatched demands. Complying quickly, al-Husayn begins to lead his followers towards al- Udhayb, Iraq while al-Hurr follows closely with his 1,000 horsemen. An analysis for this particular escorting move may be broad. Historians can surmise that al-Hurr may have tried to keep the impression of the offensive with al-Husayn in order to keep compliance with the Ummayad army. Al-Hurr's compromise could also be seen as stalling in order to investigate al-Husayn's claims further or the validity of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's commands. Though al- Hurr wants to avoid a painful ordeal, he notably issues al-Husayn a warning. If battle does ensue, al-Husayn may be killed. The reply of al-Husayn merely asserts fearlessness. Death of those in the path of righteousness have nothing to fear, is the condensed reply of al-Husayn. News from Kufa During day two or day three with al-Hurr's company, Kufan civilians approach al-Husayn with news from Kufa. Immediately, al-Hurr made arrangements to detain these Kufans or send them back. However, al-Husayn extended his protection to the civilians under the compromised issued by al-Hurr himself. These dedicated supporters of al-Husayn convey news of the city's betrayal and Ubayd Allah's transgressions. Al-Husayn's cousin, Muslim ibn Aqil, had been initially successful in building amicable relations for al-Husayn with the Kufan people. However, in order to exterminate any opposition to the next Umayyad caliph, Yazid I ibn Mu‚Äôawiya, this caliph appointed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad as the new Kufan governor to quell rising rebellion. Thus under the threat of bloodshed and violence from the Umayyad dynasty, the Kufans lapsed. Moreover, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad ordered Muslim ibn Aqil to be violently killed shortly after. This raises the desperation of al-Husayn's situation even further. The truth of Kufan desertion and failed allegiance is now a reality. Historical accounts are unclear whether al-Hurr realized the impending outcome of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's orders of execution. Without any room for lingering hesitation, al- Hurr responded immediately to al-Husayn's attempt to escape the army the following morning. In the marginal period after al-Husayn's escape attempt, Ubayd Allah reply to al-Hurr's earlier letter is brought by messenger. Ubayd Allah orders al-Hurr to halt Husayn in a barren region far from a populated village or immediate water source. Moreover, the governor commands al-Hurr to execute his orders under the observance of the sent messenger. Al-Hurr immediately compels al-Husayn and his followers to stop and pitch camp. Al- Husayn objects to the vulnerable location, deprived of water or natural fortification. Al-Hurr may have recognized this lapse in basic warrior virtue, but replied to al-Husayn that the orders must be obeyed. If Ubayd Allah's issued orders were not obeyed, the messenger, also sent as a spy, may have taken alternative measures to tighten the situation. This location of captivity has two names within in historical accounts. Less popular is the place of al-Taft, recognized to be near the Euphrates river. The most widely recognized name of al-Husayn's stopping point is Karbala, which is defined in Iraq as a place of sorrow. Camp at Karbala was made on the 2nd day of Muharram 61 A.H./680 A.D. Failed negotiation Meanwhile, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad dispatches another force of 4,000 Ummayad soldiers with commander Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd ibn Waqqas. This commander was initially reluctant to launch violence upon al-Husayn, but when threatened with loss of position, Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd complied. Al-Hurr is now under the leadership of Umar ibn S‚Äôad. Numerous events occurring after the arrival of new troops affect al-Hurr's future change of alliance. First, Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd meets with al-Husayn to understand his intentions and goals. At this point, al-Tabari reports that al-Husayn offers multiple proposals, which are later rejected by the governor 'Ubayd Allah: to return to Medina, or be allowed to move to another region. The governor refuses all negotiations with Al-Husayn without the compliance of an additional clause: al-Husayn must pledge allegiance to the governor of Kufa himself. If not, wage war. Al-Husayn was not willing to pledge to the murderer of Muslim ibn Aqil and the rest of the governor's treachery. However, other reports in al-Tabari's account, as well as the analysis of I. K. A. Howard, assert that while al-Husayn did request to leave the area, he did not suggest pledging an oath to Yazid. In either case, messengers were exchanged between parties, and al-Husayn was at an impasse. Al-Hurr evaluates the situation and sought Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd's verbal affirmation of war. Inquiring if there was any other way was possible to prevent violence on al-Husayn and his people, al- Hurr wanted to confirm final actions and their intentions. Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd replied that they were going to fight al-Husayn because governor ibn Ziyad would not accept anything short of total submission. Battle preparations had begun. Changed alliance Immediately after Umar ibn Sa'd's verdict to wage battle, al-Hurr approaches al-Husayn with 30 of his horsemen. He expresses his major transgressions to al-Husayn by preventing access back to Medina, and compelling them to halt at Karbala. Al-Hurr did not imagine the Umayyad leaders to refuse al-Husayn's proposals and conclude with a verdict of violence. Reaching a new intuition, al-Hurr asks for al-Husayn's forgiveness. The catalyst to this pivotal moment is described in al-Hurr's speech to the summoned Ummayad army made of up many Kufan soldiers. Al-Hurr calls them foolish and ill for initially inviting al-Husayn only to hand him over to death. They claimed to fight for him and now are ready to attack him. Al- Husayn is now trapped in the land where he was invited as an honorable guest and forbidden from using the nearby water. Al-Hurr ends by praying that the evil perpetrated on al-Husayn, the offspring of Mohammed, be reciprocated to the army on the day of judgement. Al-Hurr's final decision indicates that he did not have prior interaction with Ubayd Allah to gauge the governor's character or intentions. This reaffirms the fact that al-Hurr had no knowledge of any Kufan support for al-Husayn. By siding with al-Husayn at the brink of battle, al-Hurr demonstrates his emerging moral integrity in opposition to the political corruption of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and its fearful influence on Umar ibn Sa‚Äôd. Although al-Hurr added 30 men to al-Husayn's existing 72 followers, death was confirmed against the total 5,000 soldiers of the Ummayad army. Al-Hurr challenged soldiers in single combat, killing two of them. With fleeting time to eliminate more enemies, al-Hurr was one of the first to fall while fighting for Al-Husayn. He was killed by the Kufan soldier named Ayyub bin Musarrih. Al-Hurr remains a testament to the awakening of warrior virtue in the path of justice for al-Husayn and his followers. His audacious decision, born out of increasing ethical qualms, took root when every extension of peace by al-Husayn was marred by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad.

It is the largest monument of Catalonia. History Following the negotiation of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the Fort de Bellegarde in Le Perthus passed into the hands of the French state. To replace that bastion and to stop possible future invasions, it was decided to build a fortress on the hill in Figueres. The first stone was placed on December 13, 1753. The name of San Fernando was given in honor of King Ferdinand VI of Spain. On Feb. 1, 1939, Juan Negrin, last prime minister of the Second Spanish Republic, convened in the castle the final meeting on Spanish soil of the Republican Spanish Cortes. A week later, the fortress fell to the forces of Francisco Franco. Architecture The castle occupies an area of 320,000 m2 within a perimeter of 3120m, and cisterns located under the courtyard are able to hold up to 10 million liters of water. At its height, the castle could support 6,000 troops. After it ceased to be used as a prison in July 1997, it was opened to the public with guided tours to show the characteristics of the fortress. These tours emphasize the sophisticated construction techniques from the military engineering of the time.

Fell (born December 2, 1963) is a California criminal lawyer and former prosecutor, who concentrates in representing victims under Marsy's Law, the state constitutional amendment that guarantees legal rights for victims of crime. He is the founder of Justice 4 Crime Victims (J4CV), representing crime victims and their families during the criminal prosecution of their offenders. J4CV offers legal representation to crime victims before, during and after the perpetrators have been tried for their crimes. Fell has represented victims' families in such notable cases as the molestation-murder of San Diego teenager Chelsea King, and the deaths at the hands of a drunken driver of major league baseball pitcher Nick Adenhart, aspiring sports agent Henry Pearson and Cal State Fullerton cheer leading beauty Courtney Stewart, as well as the serious injury of former Cal State Fullerton baseball great Jon Wilhite.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gallo-281330-adenhart- driving.html?pic=7 Early years and education Fell attended the University of California at Santa Barbara where he earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science and graduated with \\"very high honors\\" in 1986. Fell was in the Political Science honors program and wrote his honor's thesis on the political and strategic implementation of the MX Missile. After graduation, Fell worked briefly as a Deputy Probation Officer for Santa Barbara County prior to attending Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California. Fell was a staff writer and later an editor of the Law Review. Legal career From 1989 until 2008, Fell was a California Senior Deputy District Attorney with the Orange County District Attorney's Office, where he prosecuted many high- profile cases, including People v. Dennis Rodman, People v. Raul Marin and People v. Alistair Irvine. Fell, while serving as the Hate-Crime Prosecutor for the DA's Office, was instrumental in developing TURN (Teaching Understanding Respect and Non-Violence), a tolerance training program for juveniles through the Orange County Superior Court. In 2003, Fell was acknowledged with the prestigious Ambassador of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Orange County, for his efforts in developing TURN and combating hate crime. Fell has been actively involved in representing victims who have been injured by DUI drivers. As a prosecutor, he was recognized by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Orange County, as a two-time recipient of MADD's Diligent Prosecutor Award. Fell left the DA's Office in January 2008, and became the California Senior Trial Counsel for the construction defect firm of Feinberg Grant Mayfield Kaneda & Litt LLP. After starting his own firm, Fell became interested in Marsy's Law, which California voters passed on November 4, 2008, as Proposition 9, adding section 28 to Article I of the California Constitution. This constitutional amendment, spearheaded by Henry T. Nicholas in remembrance of his murdered sister Marsy Nicholas, has become known as \\"Marsy's Law: California's Victims' Bill of Rights.\\" Under Marsy's Law, crime victims are now granted Constitutional Rights enabling their voices to be heard before, during, and after a criminal trial. Such constitutional guarantees as the right to meet with a prosecutor before any criminal charges are filed against the accused, the right to be heard regarding sufficient bail, the right to be heard regarding the request of an accused to continue his/her case, the right to be heard prior to sentencing, the right to obtain an attorney of their choice, as well as many others, are included under Marsy's Law. In 2010, Fell founded Justice 4 Crime Victims, offering legal representation to crime victims under Marsy's Law  Selected cases and clients  =Family of Chelsea King= On February 25, 2010, 17-year-old Chelsea King was jogging through Rancho Bernardo Community Park in San Diego, California. John Albert Gardner, a paroled sex offender, raped, strangled and killed Ms. King and then buried her in a shallow grave. Gardner pleaded guilty to killing Chelsea and also admitted to raping and killing 14-year-old Amber Dubois on February 13, 2009. Finally, Gardner admitted to assaulting Candice Moncayo on December 27, 2009, with the intent to rape her. For these crimes, Gardner was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The King family retained Fell along with a San Diego law firm to fight for their rights under Marsy's Law and to ensure that sensitive crime scene and autopsy photos of their daughter were not released to the media. Through Fell's work with the King family, no such photos were released to the public.http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/22/gag-order-gardner-case- stays-place-now/ http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/20/chelseas- family-seeks-keep-case-files-private/ =Family of Nick Adenhart= On April 9, 2009, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher Adenhart, Pearson, Stewart and Wilhite were driving in a car together when they were hit by a drunk driver. Adenhart, Pearson and Stewart were killed and Wilhite suffered an internal decapitation but survived. Fell was retained under Marsy's Law by the surviving family members of victims to represent them before and during the murder trial of Andrew Gallo. Citing Marsy's Law, the families argued against continuance motions, a venue motion, and against live media being allowed into the courtroom. It was the first time ever in Orange County that Marsy's Law had been utilized in a trial. The trial judge read written briefs filed and listened to oral testimony and arguments presented by, and on behalf of, the families. Through Fell's work with the families, the trial began after a defense continuance motion was denied, a change of venue motion was denied, and cameras were barred from the courtroom. =Lynette Duncan= On December 28, 2010, Fell represented Lynette Duncan under Marsy's Law at the parole hearing for Brett Thomas, who shot and killed her father and sister 33 years ago in Anaheim, CA. Thomas, who with Mark Titch went on a nine-day crime spree in January 1977, killing four people, including Aubrey and Denise Duncan in an attempted robbery outside the Duncan family's home. Lynette's mother was critically injured in the attack but eventually recovered, but the family was emotionally destroyed by the crime.http://www.ocregister.com/news/parole-281901-thomas-duncan.html Thomas and Titch pleaded guilty to multiple murder counts. They were sentenced to life in prison but eligible for parole after seven years. They repeatedly have been denied parole and this is the first time a member of the Duncan family has appeared to argue against the murderers' release. Despite her fears, Lynette Duncan traveled across the country and missed Christmas with her two daughters in order to confront Thomas, but he moved at the last minute to postpone the hearing, which will be rescheduled. However, Lynette Duncan delivered a powerful statement arguing that Thomas' parole bid be rejected for the maximum 15 years required by Marsy's Law. According to the Orange County Register, in her statement, \\"Duncan said she has lived in fear for 33 years, since the tragedy at her parent's home when she was 17, especially when she hears ‚Äì and remembers ‚Äì the sound of police and ambulance sirens. \\"It would be years before I could again hear a siren and not revert to a panic attack, for fear that it was happening to yet another family,\\" she said. \\"I can still hear the sound of the gunshot,\\" Duncan told the parole board. \\"I had never heard gunshot before. I tried to pass if off as a car backfiring, but it kept happening over and over. Every sound pierced my soul. \\"Life was very difficult after that,\\" she added. \\"My family, which previously spent many weekends camping or visiting friends, ceased to exist...We couldn't help each other heal because we were all just surviving and needed help ourselves.\\" Duncan said if Thomas were to be paroled, \\"I will be victimized all over again, as will my family. The fear is very real.\\" According to the Orange County Register, Fell told the Parole Commissioners that Thomas was afraid to face Duncan. \\"After 33 years, my client mustered the courage to face (Thomas),\\" Fell said. \\"Inmate Thomas, however, can't find the courage to face her.\\" Awards and recognition * Diligent Prosecutor Award ‚Äì Mothers Against Drunk Driving 2006 * Ambassador of Peace ‚Äì Victims Rights Coalition of Orange County 2003 * Certificate of Appreciation ‚Äì Community Service Programs/Victim Assistance Programs 2002 * Outstanding Service Award ‚Äì Mothers Against Drunk Driving 1996 * Lawyer of the Year ‚Äì Mock Trial Competition ‚Äì Constitutional Rights Foundation of Orange County 1995 * Outstanding Service Award ‚Äì Mothers Against Drunk Driving 1995 Personal life Fell is married to Jennifer Robertson Fell and has four children ages 12, 13, 22 and 26 (Stone, Hudson, River, and Bailey).

Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael in Manhattan, New York City, has since 1974 been administered as the seat of a Croatian national parish, offering services in the Croatian language as well as services in English. Located at 502 West 41st Street, near the southwest corner of Tenth Avenue and an entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, it was built from 1901 to 1903 as the Church of St. Raphael, for a different population: the poor Irish immigrants of the rough neighborhood known as Hell's Kitchen. Church of St. Raphael before 1974 The church as it appeared in 1914. In 1886 the territory extending from 34th to 44th Streets, west of 10th Avenue, was separated by the Archdiocese of New York from St. Michael's and Holy Cross parishes and formed into the new parish of St. Raphael, which was incorporated May 4 of that year. A building at 509 West 40th Street, in back of the present church, was rented and fitted up to serve as a temporary church by Rev. John A. Gleeson, the first pastor. Two years later, an adjacent soda-water factory at 503 West 40th Street was converted into a 600-seat chapel to relieve overcrowding and provide a Sunday school for children. In September 1890, Fr. Gleeson was named pastor of St. Michael's Church, and Rev. Malick A. Cunnion succeeded to the pastorate of St. Raphael's. Ground was broken for the present edifice in June 1901, and the ceremonial cornerstone was laid October 26, 1902, with Archbishop John Farley officiating. The New York Times reported that several thousand persons watched the ceremony, many from windows, fire escapes, and rooftops, \\"and the entire neighborhood was decorated with flags and bunting in honor of the event.\\" The church was designed by New York architect George H. Streeton in the French Gothic style. Its twin-towered front is composed of Manhattan schist trimmed with limestone; the rest of the church is red brick trimmed with granite. The church is 75 feet wide, 140 feet deep, and 160 feet high. A rectory, also by Streeton, was built adjacent to it, on the church's east side. Archbishop Farley preached at St. Raphael's Church at a special Sunday Mass for businessmen, in the middle of the banking Panic of 1907, urging them to reassure the public that the banks were solvent. In 1908 Father Cunnion's health began to fail, and he was unable to complete the interior of the church. He died in 1914, and was succeeded by Rev. Michael J. Duffy, who was pastor until May 1935. At that time, owing to the decimation of the neighborhood by construction of the Lincoln Tunnel and the realignment of the West Side Line railroad tracks, St. Raphael's status changed from independent parish to mission of Holy Innocents Church, administered by its pastor, Rev. Aloysius C. Dineen. On November 8, 1936, the fiftieth anniversary of the parish was marked with a Mass at St. Raphael's celebrated by Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, who referred sadly to the \\"recent difficulties\\" of the parish. A few years later, the parish merged with that of the Italian Church of St. Clare, 436‚Äì438 West 36th Street, which was demolished to make room for Dyer Avenue; the name St. Raphael's was retained. Croatian Parish =Background= A wave of European Catholics immigrated to the United States between 1840 and 1920, including Germans, Italians, Poles, Slovaks, and Croatians, and many Franciscan friars came from their home countries to minister to them in their own language. By 1910, Manhattan Croatians were centered around 11th Avenue in the West 30s, 40s, and 50s. Many worked at the docks, rail yards, and factories nearby. Most spoke little English, but there were no Croatian churches, so few went to Mass. The church they founded three years later resulted largely from the efforts of two Franciscan priests, immigrants themselves. Rev. Ambrozije, or Ambrose, ≈†irca was born in Austria in 1877 and ordained in 1901. Upon arriving in New York in 1910, Fr. ≈†irca was assigned by Archbishop Farley to seek community support for a Croatian parish. Though unsuccessful, he was able to preach at Mass in Croatian and perform marriages and christenings for Croatians at St. Clare's, with the support of the pastor, an Italian Franciscan. Simultaneously, he did the same for the Croatian community of Hoboken, New Jersey, in the Italian Church of St. Francis, whose pastor was also Franciscan. Fr. ≈†irca kept parish records of Croatians in both churches. In August 1912 he left to serve the Slovak parish of St. Michael's in Rockland Lake, N.Y. That year, Irenej, or Irenaeus, Petriƒçak, a Croatian born in 1889, was a theology student in Zagreb, and was solicited by a Franciscan friar and missionary in America to travel there to serve his countrymen. After his ordination later in the year, he and an older priest, Rev. Placid Belaviƒá, journeyed to New York City, arriving in 1913. They found that most of the city's Croats did not attend church, but those who did went to St. Clare's. Rev. Petriƒçak met with the vicar general of the archdiocese, Mgr Joseph Mooney, who suggested the young priest arrange with St. Clare's pastor for a Sunday Mass in Croatian, to test the response. In the event, the church was filled to overflowing, with Mgr Mooney present. The day after his report, the archbishop granted Fr. Petriƒçak permission to start his parish. With representatives of various Croatian organizations, Fr. Petriƒçak and Mgr Mooney canvassed the community. A church council was set up. They rented a small disused church at 552 West 50th St., empty save for the benches and a fine organ, for $100 a month. With donations of church necessities from other New York City churches, it took the Croatians of the community five weeks to renovate and refurbish the church, during which time St. Clare's continued to celebrate Mass in Croatian. It was named the Church of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, for the 9th-century Greek siblings called Apostles to the Slavs. =At the Church of Sts. Cyril and Methodius= Saints Kyril & Metodi Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocesan Cathedral, formerly Church of Sts. Cyril and Methodius The opening ceremonies took place on Sunday, November 16, 1913. A tremendous downpour didn't prevent a huge procession of people displaying tricolors, accompanied by music, from marching up 11th Avenue toward the new church. The church was too small for the crowd; many had to stand outside during Mass. Mgr Mooney addressed those present, expressing his happiness, and people were jubilant. The archives from Hoboken were sent over. To pay the rent and other expenses, money was borrowed from individuals and council members, and Fr. Petriƒçak went door to door soliciting support. In addition, he visited the sick, elderly, and lonely. Fr. Belaviƒá took care of the pastoral needs of the parish and delivered the sacraments. Early in 1914, the Franciscan elders called Fr. ≈†irca back from Rockland Lake to take charge of the parish, with Fr. Petriƒçak as his assistant. At that time, the congregation numbered 4,000. Two years later, Fr. ≈†irca was transferred to the Church of St. Jerome in Chicago, Illinois, and Fr. Petriƒçak once again became pastor. In the meantime, money was raised to buy, enlarge, and repair the church and rectory, and install central heating and electricity, in order to properly conduct the growing religious and social activities of the new parish. Religious societies and a choir were started. More space was needed, so in 1923, the small church added a hall in the basement. Fr. Petriƒçak was transferred to a parish in Steelton, Pennsylvania, in 1926, and was succeeded by Rev. Franjo (Josip) ƒåuturiƒá. When still more space was needed, Fr. ƒåuturiƒá bought the building next door. Following World War II, a wave of Croatians fleeing Yugoslavia arrived in America by way of European refugee camps. In 1947, the church provided assistance to many hundreds of them. Over the years, several orders of nuns successively supplied personnel to the Church of Sts. Cyril and Methodius. Nuns led the choir, ran the office, maintained the church buildings, visited the sick, and taught in the school, among many other activities. In 1971, nuns from Croatia belonging to the Franciscan Province of Christ the King in Herzegovina arrived to assist in the work of the parish. =At the Church of St. Raphael= Interior of the Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael on June 9, 2018 By then, the needs of the parish had outgrown its space. It was given the opportunity to buy an old hall belonging to and behind St. Raphael's on 40th Street. The rundown facility, which had been used as a gymnasium, was redecorated with motifs of the homeland, and opened on October 24, 1971, as the St. Nikola Taveliƒá Croatian Center. The same year, the archdiocese granted permission for Sunday Mass celebrations in Croatian in St. Raphael's. After these Masses, the nuns began religious classes for children in the new Center. Soon, Cardinal Terence Cooke granted the Croats permission to take the church over. The Croatian church inherited all the archives, including those of St. Clare's, dating back to 1886. The last Mass in the old church was celebrated on November 10, 1974. It was sold to the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada and Australia in 1979. Past neglect of St. Raphael's Church necessitated three years of renovations. A celebratory parade, and a Mass led by Cardinal Cooke, marked their completion in July 1977. Five years later additional improvements were made, including installation of a new heating system. Reconstruction of the great hall under the church began in 1993 under pastor Rev. Slavko Soldo; it was completed in 1999 under pastor Rev. Marko Puljiƒá. In 1977, the church received a bust of Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac (May 8, 1898 ‚Äì February 10, 1960), the Archbishop of Zagreb from 1937 until his death in 1960, by sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. The church also displays the paintings Bozic and Kardinal Stepinac by Josip Crnobori and a wooden relief by Rev. Joakim Jaki Gregov. On February 10, 1980, the portion of 41st Street in front of the church was officially named Cardinal Stepinac Place by the City of New York, on the 20th anniversary of his death. During the Bosnian War of the 1990s, the church served as a center of relief efforts. The Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael is staffed by friars from the Chicago-based Custody of the Holy Family, which belongs to the Franciscan Province of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of January 25, 2016, the pastor is Rev. Nikola Pa≈°aliƒá, OFM; the vicars are Rev. Ilija Puljiƒá, OFM, and Rev. Zeljko Barbaric, OFM; and the Franciscan Sisters of Christ the King are Sr. Anica Matic, Sr. Lidija Banozic, and Sr. Izabela Galic. Masses are celebrated Sundays at 9:00 A.M. and 11:00 A.M. in Croatian and 10:00 A.M. in English, and Tuesday‚ÄìSaturday at 8:00 A.M. in Croatian.

He claims to be responsible for attacks on WikiLeaks, 4chan, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Islamist websites. He claims to be acting out of American patriotism. The Jester uses a denial-of-service (DoS) tool known as \\"XerXeS\\", that he claims to have developed. History =Identity and communication= The Jester first appeared on Twitter, where he announced his attack on the Taliban website alemarah.info on January 1, 2010. On June 26, 2010, he established his WordPress blog \\"Jester's Court\\". The Jester also communicates via his I2P IRC channel #jester and cautions these are the only three authentic methods of communication from him: \\"As per usual, because of the large amount of imposters trying to pass themselves off as me I will only speak in THREE places, here via this blog, my twitter and the i2p IRC network outlined above where my nick (th3j35t3r) is registered to myself. If you see a ‚Äòjester‚Äô anywhere else it's not me.\\" In November of 2017 Jester set up an instance of the Mastodon social networking server, named Counter Social, where he continues to use the alias @th3j35t3r. =Military service= The Jester had stated that he was a former soldier and had served in Afghanistan and elsewhere. A former defense operative claimed that The Jester was a former military contractor involved in US Special Operations Command projects. On April 10, 2012, The Jester gave a live chat interview to a class of Computer Science students at the University of Southern Maine where he confirmed his military service and stated he served four \\"operational tours\\". =XerXeS and other tools= The Jester claims to have originally developed his DoS script as a means to test and harden servers. After learning from an article that Jihadists were using the Internet to recruit and coordinate terror cells, The Jester resolved to disrupt online communications between Jihadists. He weaponized his script and created a front-end known as \\"XerXeS\\" in order to solve the script's usability problems. =Hacking history= On January 1, 2010, The Jester began a campaign against Jihadist websites. His first target was alemarah.info, which was the Taliban's website at the time. The Jester posted several tweets claiming to be responsible for the downtime WikiLeaks was experiencing. He justified his alleged attacks by claiming that WikiLeaks was \\"attempting to endanger the lives of our [US] troops, 'other assets' & foreign relations.\\" In retaliation to The Jester's reported efforts, hacktivists including a group named Anonymous in support of WikiLeaks were reported as temporarily disrupting the website of MasterCard as well as attacking websites of Amazon and PayPal.David Leigh, Luke Harding WikiLeaks cyber attacks: a tango with the Jester The Guardian, 2 February 2011 On November 29, 2010, someone claiming to be The Jester stated that he had been raided by the U.S. and attempted to solicit money for legal fees. The Jester purported that the person was an impostor, though writers at InfoSecIsland believe the hoax was created by The Jester himself. On December 28, 2010, a DoS attack targeted 4chan.org. On that same day, The Jester tweeted \\"4chan.org ‚Äî that looks like a TANGO DOWN (not) maybe you guys pissed off the wrong person trying to (wrongly) ID me?\\" This tweet is believed to be a reference to claims by 4chan users that The Jester was a man from Montana. On February 21, 2011, The Jester began a DoS attack on several sites belonging to the Westboro Baptist Church for celebrating the death of homosexual U.S. servicemen.(2011-03-24) \\"Hacktivist Maintains Attack on Westboro Baptist Church\\" Retrieved 28 March 2011 In March 2011, The Jester employed a different style of attack by using an XSS vulnerability to make it appear as if fabricated articles were inserted online Libyan newspapers The Malta Independent Online and the Tripoli Post. On March 28, 2011, he tweeted links to the forged articles. The articles were not visible in search, or to viewers of those websites and viewable only via the inserted links. These tweets drew the attention of Anthony M. Freed, who examined the articles and discovered they were anomalies not contained in the newspapers' respective archives. Further inspection by Freed revealed The Jester left a watermark of his signature Harlequin avatar on the articles he created, which can only be seen by tilting the computer monitor back at an angle. The fabricated articles reported degradation in troop morale among fighters loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and incidents of his soldiers abandoning their posts. Freed concluded The Jester's objective was a \\"psyops campaign aimed at breaking the spirit of the troops loyal to Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi.\\" The Jester confirmed this in a subsequent interview later the same year. In June 2011 The Jester vowed to find and expose members of LulzSec. He attempted to obtain and publish personally identifiable information of key members within group, whom he described as \\"childish\\". On June 24, 2011, he claimed to have revealed the identity of LulzSec leader Sabu as Xavier Kaotico, an information technology consultant possibly from New York City. In July of the same year he falsely accused Hugo Carvalho, a Portuguese IT professional, of also being Sabu, leaving The Jester's outing claims to be considered suspect. However, in a post on his blog in November 2011, The Jester retracted his prior identifications for \\"Sabu\\", issued an apology and correctly identified \\"Sabu\\" as Hector Xavier Monsegur, 28, of New York. Sabu's identity was confirmed on March 6, 2012, when Monsegur was arrested by the FBI and it was revealed that he had been acting as an FBI informant in the interim. In October 2011, at the Hackers Halted USA conference, The Jester gave a surprise live presentation and fielded questions through an online chat with presenter Jeff Bardin. His identity was authenticated via his Twitter account. Jester answered questions about XerXeS and other tools in development and discussed his motivations for attacking militant jihadi recruiting websites. On August 26, 2012, Bardin hosted a similar presentation at Utica College for the college's Cybersecurity Master's program. Late November 2011, th3j35t3r claimed to take down multiple jihadist sites permanently, with his newest tool known as 'Saladin'. Saladin is claimed to be similar to other 'Apache Killer' tools used by hackers. Critics have claimed Saladin does not exist, and that he is relying on domain expiration. On May 14, 2012, The Jester's Twitter account (@th3j35t3r) appeared to have been deleted, along with all posts on his WordPress blog. However, the Twitter account and WordPress blog were merely temporarily deactivated and were subsequently restored May 16, 2012. On July 2, 2013, the Jester took responsibility for a series of DoS cyberattacks against the Ecuadorean stock exchange and the country's tourism website, and promised to attack any other governments considering granting asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden. In a June blog post, he wrote that Snowden \\"is not a goddam hero, here to save Americans from 'the government' because of privacy infringements and breaches of the 4th amendment, he is a traitor and has jeopardized all our lives.\\" In tweets, the Jester also alluded to a plan to seize control of the fire alarms at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, which would force WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to set foot on UK soil and face potential extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault charges.Snowden and Assange Targeted by Mysterious Hacker \\"The Jester\\", Mother Jones, 2 July 2013 On October 21, 2016, the Jester took responsibility for \\"defacing\\" the official website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The \\"hack\\" was later shown to be fake, actually being a POST based XSS on the website, not a deface or hack.https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/how-the-jester- fooled-russians-and-fox-news-with-one-simple-trick/ SANS report: \\"The Jester: A Lesson in Asymmetric Warfare\\" In December 2011, T. J. O'Connor, a research analyst in the Information Technology and Operations Center (ITOC), produced a comprehensive report for the SANS Institute detailing the history of The Jester's hacking campaigns titled \\"The Jester Dynamic: A Lesson in Asymmetric Unmanaged Cyber Warfare\\". The paper examines the history, motives and impact of two years worth of The Jester's hacking, and provides a detailed analysis of the timeline of his attacks, a speculative analysis of the tools he may use, and review of his use of social media and public relations through his blog. QR code attack On March 5, 2012, The Jester changed his Twitter account @th3j35t3r avatar from his signature Jester icon to a QR code without comment or explanation. Scanning a QR code redirects a browser to a website. Scanning The Jester's icon led to a URL where he had an image of his signature Jester icon and an embedded, hidden code that allegedly exploited a vulnerability that affects Safari, Chrome and Android browsers. \\"When anyone scanned the original QR code using an iPhone or Android device, their device would silently make a TCP shell connection back to my remote server,\\" The Jester wrote. \\"Like a phone call, if you like.\\" This was however exposed to be fake and the exploit was stolen from a 2-year-old CVE advisory.https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1807 See also * List of hackers References External links *Counter Stream ‚Äì The Jester's blog Internet activists Living people WikiLeaks Vigilantes Unidentified people Year of birth unknown Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"The Jester (hacktivist)"},{"id":"30239695","text":"The Gaudeamus Hut () is an Alpine club hut in the Kaisergebirge mountains in Tyrol. It is run by the Main-Spessart section of the German Alpine Club.Reynolds, Kev (2009). Walking in Austria, 1st ed., Cicerone, Milnthorpe, p. 265, .  Location  The hut is located on the southern side of the Wilder Kaiser at a height of where it stands at the foot of the T√∂rlspitzen peaks on an Alpine pasture. From its sun terrace the view extends from the Ellmauer Tor, over to the Karlspitzen peaks and on to the Ellmauer Halt, the highest mountain in the Kaisergebirge range. Several paths and mountain trails branch off near the Gaudeamus Hut and its central location is the main reason for the popularity of this base both with day trippers and with hillwalkers and climbers. By using the toll road, the hut is quickly reached and acts as a starting point for numerous summit ascents and crossings to other places in the Wilder Kaiser. It is fully staffed from mid-May to mid-October.  History  The Gaudeamus Hut was built in 1899 below the K√ºbel Cirque (K√ºbelkar) by the Academic Alpine Club Section of Berlin. It remained unstaffed until 1911, and was then temporarily rented to the Kitzb√ºhel section. In 1924 an avalanche destroyed the hut. In the same year a temporary hut was erected and basic services were provided. In 1927 the Berlin Section built the present hut about 300 metres further east. It survived the Second World War without damage and the tenants changed very rarely. After the war it was taken over by the Main- Spessart section, and the hut was refurbished and extended in 2003. Since the 2004 season Martin and Anni Leichtfried have been the tenants.  Access  The Gaudeamus Hut is very popular with day visitors. To reach the hut by car from the Inn Valley Motorway (A12), take the Kufstein-S√ºd exit and drive along the B173 and B178. From Salzburg drive through Lofer and St. Johann in Tirol, also along the B178, to Ellmau. Then branch off north and finally join the toll road up to the Wochenbrunner Alm, where there is a large car park at a height of 1,080 metres.  Approaches  By foot, the shortest and quickest way to the hut starts from the Wochenbrunner Alm and runs up to the Gaudeamus Hut in just 30‚Äì40 minutes without posing any problems. Equally possible is the ascent from Scheffau, Ellmau or Going-Prama, each taking about 2 hours.

However, very few Germans occupied these municipalities. German troops were mostly located outside these areas. On 9 July 1944, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery demanded a massive air assault against Caen in hopes of clearing the way for an attack the following morning. Four hundred and fifty heavy aircraft participated, dropping 2,500 tons of bombs. The pilots however negated most of the effect by releasing their loads well back from the forward line to avoid hitting their own troops. As a result, the city incurred heavy damage but German defenses went largely unscathed.William M. Hammond, Normandy, The U.S. Army Campaigns of WW2, U.S. Center of Military History, p. 36 Allied heavy bomber missions caused serious problems for both Allied ground forces and French civilians, during the early stages of the campaign. Sometimes friendly troops were victims of misplaced bomb strikes. In the early stages of the Normandy campaign, this often resulted from insufficient communication between air and land forces,William M. Hammond, Normandy, The U.S. Army Campaigns of WW2, U.S. Center of Military History, p. 34 which had to get used to working together. US General Omar Bradley remarked after the war that We went into France almost totally untrained in air-ground cooperation.\\" The first two strikes on Caen resulted in numerous casualties to French civilians. According to Antony Beevor in his book D-Day,Antony Beevor, D-Day: The Battle For Normandy, Penguin Books Ltd., p. 263 The bombings also destroyed 96% of Tilly-la-Campagne (Calvados), 95% of Vire (Calvados), 88% of Villers-Bocage (Calvados), 82% of Le Havre (Seine- Maritime), 77% of Saint-L√¥ (Manche), 76% of Falaise (Calvados), 75% of Lisieux (Calvados), 75% of Caen (Calvados).Jean-Claude Valla, La France sous les bombes am√©ricaines 1942‚Äì1945, Librairie nationale, Paris 2001. It is estimated that the bombings in Normandy before and after D-Day caused over 50,000 civilian deaths. The French historian Henri Amouroux in La Grande histoire des Fran√ßais sous l‚ÄôOccupation, says that 20,000 civilians were killed in Calvados department, 10,000 in Seine-Maritime, 14,800 in the Manche, 4,200 in the Orne, around 3,000 in the Eure. The most deadly allied bombings under the German occupation were these: Lisieux (6‚Äì7 June 1944, 700 dead), Vire (6‚Äì7 June 1944, 400 dead), Caen (6 June-19 July 1944, about 3,000 dead), Le Havre (5‚Äì11 September 1944, more than 5,000 dead)Henri Amouroux, La Grande histoire des Fran√ßais sous l‚ÄôOccupation, volume 8.Roger C√©r√© and Charles Rousseau, Chronologie du conflit mondial, SEFI, Paris 1945, page 253. For many families who lived through the war, it was the arrival and passage of British and American forces that was by far the most tormenting experience. According to Christophe Prime, \\"It was profoundly traumatic for the people of Normandy. Think of the hundreds of tons of bombs destroying entire cities and wiping out families. But the suffering of civilians was for many years masked by the over-riding image, that of the French welcoming the liberators with open arms.\\"Christophe Prime, Histoire de la Normandie durant la Deuxi√®me Guerre Mondial, 2009.

It is located southwest of Gaston, North Carolina, near the closed Halifax County Airport. It was closed in 1978. History Roanoke Rapids AFS was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational on 1 March 1956 when the 632d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned and began operating AN/MPS-11 and AN/TPS-10D radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Two years later, the AN/TPS-10D was replaced with a pair of AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars. The R-16 Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site for communications was located at , approximately 126 miles south-southeast from the main site. It was originally established for the 614th AC&W; Squadron at Cherry Point MCAS (Z-117). Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control Center. After Roanoke Rapids AFS was inactivated, R-16 was used by OL-AA, 701st Radar Squadron at Fort Fisher AFS, NC. (Z-115) During 1959 Roanoke Rapids AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 632d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-117. In 1966 an AN/FPS-27 was performing search duties at this site. In addition to the main facility, Roanoke Rapids AFS operated two AN/FPS-14 unmanned Gap Filler sites near the Atlantic coast: * Elizabeth City, NC (M-117B/Z-117B): : Assigned from Cape Charles AFS, VA (P-56) in September 1957. * Engelhard, NC (M-117D/Z-117D): : Reassigned from Cherry Point AFS (Z-116) after site was closed 1 Aug 1963. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 632d was inactivated on September 30, 1978 as part of a general reduction of Aerospace Defense Command air defense units. Today the site is abandoned with deteriorating buildings. Two radar towers remain in poor condition. The housing area is in use by private individuals. The Gap Filler support buildings remain, however the radar towers were dismantled and removed.

This film is believed by many, including Yuen Woo-ping (action choreographer for the 2000 film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), to be a loose adaptation of Wang Dulu's 1941 novel Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, even though it doesn't explicitly state so. It has been noted that during the early Cultural Revolution it was impossible for the Shaw Brothers Studio (located in British Hong Kong) to get in contact with Wang Dulu (who lived in mainland China) to acquire the film rights. Plot The film starts out with two students fighting over the inheritance of their deceased master's sword called the \\"Green Frost Sword\\". Eventually, Han kills the other student and takes the sword. Han then brings it back to the king. Later, General Zhong Ki, his daughter Zhong Jiaolong, and her servant Geng Liuniang visit the king. The king later forces the general to make his daughter marry Prince Lu Tianxia. Then at night, Geng, revealing herself to be an expert martial artist, goes to steal the \\"Green Frost Sword\\". She brings Jiaolong away to save her from marrying the prince. The prince arrives with his henchmen and a big fight occurs in which Geng seriously wounds the prince. Geng and Jiaolong then go into hiding. Jiaolong becomes Geng's disciple where she teaches her kung fu. The king sees his son wounded and that the \\"Green Frost Sword\\" is gone. Han knows who the culprit is and the king sends him to find the suspect. The next day Geng leaves a note to Jiaolong and leaves, but Han finds her. Geng is then revealed to be the widow of the student Han killed in the beginning of the film. They then fight and Han overpowers Geng, heavily injuring her while taking the sword back. Han assumes that she is dead. Jiaolong sets out and manages to find her teacher. One day, Jiaolong goes out and meets a good bandit named Luo Yihu. Jiaolong fights briefly with him before bringing him home where he finds out who her teacher is. Luo turns out to be the disciple of Geng's kung fu elder sister. The three of them revolt against the evil king and get the \\"Green Frost Sword\\" back. They also meet a rebellious nobleman Master Liu who joins them. They engage in a big fight where Han is eventually killed but Prince Lu Tian Xia manages to get away. In the end, the heroes decide to retreat and hope to get the prince later.

The siege began on July 17, 1690 when Williamite Lieutenant-General James Douglas arrived outside the Jacobite held city of Athlone with ten regiments of foot and five regiments of horse for a total force of 12,000. The Governor of Athlone, Colonel Richard Grace decided to defend the western part of the city. The Jacobite troops destroyed the bridge over the Shannon River that connected the eastern and western parts of the city, before the Williamite Army arrived. The city's garrison consisted of three regiments of foot and eleven troops of horse for a total force of about 4,500. General Douglas sent a messenger to Colonel Grace demanding he surrender the city. Colonel Grace responded by firing a pistol shot over the head of the messenger and stating \\"These are my terms; these only, I will give or receive, and when my provisions are consumed, I will defend till I eat my old boots.\\" General Douglas commenced a bombardment of the city with twelve cannon and two mortar's, the city of Athlone's guns returned fire. After two days the Williamite Army attempted to ford the Shannon River but were repelled with considerable loss. The artillery fire continued between the two sides until July 24 when General Douglas was forced to retire having suffered about 400 casualties, and having been informed that Patrick Sarsfield and the Jacobite Cavalry were en route to relieve the city of Athlone's garrison.

He has been asked to present commentary or participate as a panelist on CNN, Fox News Channel, NBC and MSNBC. USA Today, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New York Sun and Time magazine have carried articles about him and by him. Bedier is the president of United Voices for America, an organization that promotes civic engagement and democracy. He is the president of the Human Rights Council of Tampa Bay, Florida, and serves on the state board of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida. He co-hosts True Talk on the Tampa NPR affiliate and community station WMNF 88.5 FM. The live radio program views global events from a Muslim perspective. Early years Bedier came to America at the age of eight when his father, an economist and statistician from Cairo, moved his family to the United States. When his parents returned to Egypt, Bedier chose to remain in the United States. From a start as an IT network administrator, he went on to become an operations manager for a dental group and eventually opened his own dental laboratory in St. Petersburg, Fla. Early involvement in civil liberties Ahmed Bedier‚Äôs involvement in civil liberties began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The St. Petersburg Times called his mosque for a response to the attack. Bedier shared his views on what it felt like to be a young Muslim in America after 9/11. This led to volunteer work with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in public relations. In December 2003, when CAIR opened a Tampa office, Bedier became the director. Bedier‚Äôs involvement in advocating for justice, civil rights and understanding began in earnest after Seminole, Florida podiatrist Robert Goldstein was taken into custody in August 2002. A list of 50 Islamic centers (including the mosque Bedier attended), detailed plans of an ‚ÄúIslamic Education Center‚Äù, 20 illegal bombs were found in Goldstein‚Äôs town home, and a three-page document called the ‚ÄúMission Template‚Äù with the objective to ‚ÄúKill all 'rags' at this Islamic Education Center.\\" While Florida‚Äôs Muslim community was grateful he was caught before he had detonated one of his bombs, the incident created a great deal of fear. Civil rights involvement Bedier has been at the forefront of raising awareness of racial profiling. Only the most notable cases are referenced here. A Jacksonville bus driver refused to allow 20 middle school students of Middle Eastern and Asian descent to remain on a Duval County school bus on October 29, 2003. The students had to walk 5 miles home. A second bus driver refused to allow Muslim students to board the bus on October 31, 2003. Ahmed Bedier spoke out against the incident. In 2004, 44 anti-Muslim incidents were reported to CAIR. In 2005, the number had risen. One of the anti-Muslim incidents that stands out for the year involved Larbi Tizaoui. On November 11, 2005, on his way home from work at 2:00 a.m., the American Muslim was denied service at a Subway. He was told that the store was closed, but his Caucasian wife was served a short while later. Because a uniformed police officer helped the Subway manager escort Tizaoui off the premises, Bedier filed a complaint on behalf of CAIR with the internal affairs office of the Tampa Police Department. Suit was also brought against the Subway store. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. As a result of his public appearances on behalf of similar cases, Bedier has become one of the most visible Muslim faces on television. He has appeared on ABC, CNN, Fox News Channel, NBC and MSNBC affiliates as a subject matter expert. His appearances have ranged from conservative talk show host Glenn Beck to Progressive leftist Amy Goodman and everything in between. In 2004 Tampa NPR affiliate and community station WMNF 88.5 FM decided to include a trial program that addressed Muslim issues. True Talk‚Äôs success exceeded expectations and became a permanent part of Friday‚Äôs programming in 2005. Bedier co-produces and co-hosts the program with Samar Jarrah. Guests include religious figures, politicians, community leaders and journalists. Bedier became involved in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida in 2005 and the Human Rights Council of Tampa in 2004. Bedier has been very active in helping the Muslim community learn how to work with law enforcement to reduce the risk of home-grown terrorism. After the UK airline plot was foiled in 2006, Bedier organized a meeting between law enforcement chiefs from 20 different agencies, both local and federal. The purpose of the meeting was to learn what to look for and how to work with law enforcement so that suspicious activities are reported effectively.Tampa Bay Magazine, January‚ÄìFebruary 2007, Muslim on a Mission, p. 164. He has been quoted in the press, saying, \\"No one wants to attack their own people. Muslims here see themselves as Americans more than Muslims in France see themselves as French.\\" United Voices for America In 2008, Bedier founded United Voices for America (UVA), a non-profit, non-partisan civic organization dedicated to increasing minority participation in America‚Äôs political process. One of the first efforts of the new organization was the organization of candidate and issue forums. These large public events brought minority constituents into contact with candidates during the 2008 election year. These forums provided a venue where issues could be identified first hand and voters could reach informed decisions regarding the candidates. Organizing issue forums where elected officials and decision makers can discuss concerns remains an important strategy of United Voices. On March 10, 2009 United Voices launched the first Florida Muslim Capitol Day, with the intent to make this an annual event. The event was designed to introduce Muslims to Florida's political process and give them a chance to lobby on issues including education and healthcare reform. March 11, 2010 marked the second Florida Muslim Capital Day. In the summer of 2009, Bedier launched Capitol Leadership Academy, a summer intensive program designed to train young minorities in civic action, public affairs and political participation. The goal is to give young people the tools to take peaceful civic action, engage directly with policy makers and learn the skills of networking. Other community involvement Bedier has worked actively to promote community services‚Äîa primary value of Islam. This has been demonstrated through his active organization of Muslim physicians and coordinating the opening of free healthcare clinics for uninsured poor-income families. When seven churches in the Middle East were vandalized after Pope Benedict made comments in a speech that angered some Muslims around the world, Bedier organized a regional fundraising campaign to help repair the damage. He pitched in the first $5,000 and asked others to help. The money was given to a Catholic charity that repaired the damage. He speaks openly with clergy of many Christian and Jewish denominations, recognizing that there are many misconceptions as to what Islam teaches. Response to events in Egypt When the revolt in Egypt erupted, Bedier organized a rally for January 29, 2011 at the busy intersection of Tampa's Dale Mabry Highway and Kennedy Boulevard. About 150 area Muslims joined the effort to increase awareness of the issues. When interviewed by the Tampa Bay St. Petersburg Times at the rally, Bedier stated that Egypt has been simmering for years. He predicts, \\"You will be able to read in any history book how the youth of Egypt used technology, Twitter and Facebook and overthrew the regime with a peaceful movement.\\" Bedier stated that the purpose of the rally was to send a clear message to the people of Egypt that Egyptians living in America stand in solidarity with them and their demand for freedom. Controversy During his time with CAIR, Bedier spoke out for Muslim rights not only in the United States, but also on a worldwide scale. This has sparked some criticism, backlash and threats. His critics say that Bedier does not speak out harshly enough against Palestinian groups and claim that his support of a Palestinian state that coexists with Israel proves that he‚Äôs sympathetic with extremists who have an agenda against Israel, a claim Bedier denies. Many members of the Jewish community have not found this accusation supported. He has been a leading contributor to positive relations between American Muslims and Jews. They find that he holds a moderate position. He has spoken out against Iran‚Äôs denial of the Holocaust. He spoke against the removal of Christian and Jewish holidays from the Florida school calendar. He has organized events where common beliefs between the two groups are discussed and enjoyed together. Bedier consistently speaks out against all forms of terrorism and violence against civilians. In 2007, when two University of South Florida students were arrested on explosives charges in South Carolina, Bedier was at the forefront of calling for a fair trial and due process. Bedier knew one of the students, Youssef Megahed, casually. For some of his critics, this is proof that he is a terrorist in sheep‚Äôs clothing. When the facts are reviewed, they reveal that Bedier had no connections with the man who was convicted, and the man he knew casually was found innocent on all charges. In an interview with the Tampa Tribune, Bedier stated that the video produced by Ahmed Mohamed showing how to make a remote detonator was unacceptable. Mohamed \\"was sent here on a scholarship to do a doctorate in engineering and not to make videos, and now he's going to pay the price for that.\\" Some critics point to a 2009 statement made at the Florida State Capitol as evidence he is stirring up Muslims to intimidate the government. Supporters of Bedier say that critics are taking words out of context. In his speech, Bedier quoted a statement attributed to Thomas Jefferson. \\"When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\\" His remaining speech encouraged the Muslims and other minorities present, to be actively involved in the political process so they would not have to fear the government, but the government would have to fear them. Bedier has spoken out against the use of violence to accomplish social change, but there are some groups that feel that his previous connection with CAIR demonstrates that he supports another ideology entirely. CAIR has been cleared by the State Department of any terrorist connections, but this has not prevented the organization from remaining under suspicion by some conservative and pro-Israeli/anti-Muslim groups, and Bedier remaining a key target of attack by extension. An internet search will confirm this. Pro- Israel groups have regularly accused Bedier of being the spokesman for Dr. Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida Professor who was indicted on terrorism related charges. In December 2005, a Florida federal jury acquitted Al-Arian on the eight of seventeen charges he faced and deadlocked on the remainder. Al-Arian later settled the remaining charges by pleading guilty to one count of non-violent material support. Bedier says he never met or spoke to Dr. Al-Arian and did not know of Al-Arian before his arrest. Opinions regarding Ahmed Bedier Carl Whitehead, the special agent in charge of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Tampa praises Bedier‚Äôs efforts to ensure civil liberties. He has spoken publicly claiming the FBI appreciates Bedier‚Äôs work ‚Äúin the community in the area of civil rights.‚Äù He also has expressed his appreciation that Bedier has worked to ‚Äúestablish open forums for us to exchange information in order to keep the nation safe. Tampa TV anchor John Wilson spoke about Ahmed Bedier‚Äôs work in the Tampa Bay area on November 20, 2007 during an opinion piece known as ‚ÄúMy Talk‚Äù. Wilson expresses his appreciation of Bedier‚Äôs efforts to prevent the development of terrorist cell groups on American soil.

History  PROJECT Trio consists of Greg Pattillo (flute), Eric Stephenson (cello), and Peter Seymour (double bass). The three met in 1996 while students at the Cleveland Institute of Music. While members of the Colorado Music Festival, Seymour and Stephenson conceived the idea to start a classical chamber music group that would incorporate elements of the jazz and rock world and provide a different experience than the typical classical concert-going experience. Their original idea was to come together two or three times a year in a city around the country and do a week-long music infusion with concert and education/outreach activities in and around the city.Jeremy Kurtz, ‚ÄúUnconventional Wisdom‚Äù, All Things Strings They approached Pattillo to round out the group and in the spring of 2005, the three gathered in Cleveland to put on a concert, perform in multiple schools and offer music workshops for youth. In February 2007, Pattillo put a video on YouTube that received instant viral success and garnered him wide attention for his unique style of mixing beatbox with flute.David K. Randall, \\"A Flute With a Beat, and You Might Dance to It\\", The New York Times, May 22, 2007 The video has since received over 26,000,000 views. The success of the video led Seymour, who had been playing as a sub for the Cleveland Orchestra, to move to New York City to join Pattillo and Stephenson.

Several studies were carried out, including by the Moscow Institute of Hydroelectric and Industry, Electricity and Power Distribution Company (Japan), Designing Research and Production Shareholding Company (Moscow) and SWECO (Sweden). In May 2000, the National Assembly of Vietnam postponed the decision due to lack of information on relocation and compensation plans and for feasibility studies for a scaled-down version of the dam. The project was approved by the National Assembly in December 2002. Construction of the dam began on 2 December 2005. On 17 December 2010, the first turbine was connected to the power grid.

Career  Radu Klapper was born in 1937 in Bucharest in a Jewish-Romanian family and grew up in a multi-linguistic environment. He studied librarianship and philology at the University of Bucharest and after completing his studies published poetry in different anthologies, and worked as an art critic in various newspapers in Romania. In 1976 Klapper immigrated to Israel and became a theater and dance critic in foreign magazines in Israel and France such as \\"Dance in Israel\\" and \\"Saison de la danse\\". He also continued to publish his poetry in different Romanian anthologies. In 1991, he started to work in the Dance Library of Israel and in 1993, he became the library's director. During his time at the Dance Library, Klapper became known as a great supporter of artists and dancers, young and old. His vast knowledge and unique character turn Radu and the library to a pilgrimage site. His first Hebrew poem-book \\"The Hart Paces\\" came out in 1998, and in 2003, he published two more books \\"Forbidden Songs\\" and a prose book, \\"Jews Against their Will\\", that dealt with the relationship between famous figures and their Jewish identity, among them: the French singer Barbara, the actress Simone Signoret, the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, the Camondo family and Romain Gary. Radu's poetry often dealt with homo-erotic desire and unfulfilled love, accompanied by wisdom and sharp insight. His writings introduced into Hebrew literature a touch of European poetry. In October 2006, at the age of 69, Radu Klapper died of pneumonia. After his death the Israeli artist Shy Abady created the art series \\"Radu\\" as an homage to Klapper and his image. The series was first presented in January 2012 at Zadik Gallery in Jaffa and was accompanied with some events that were dedicated to the image of Klapper.

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and is located in the southern part of the old city centre, opposite St. Godehard.  History  Southern wall with stone inscription. Saint Nicolas' Chapel was built in a Romanesque style in the 12th century at the same time as the monastery of Saint Godehard was built opposite. It was consecrated by Heinrich von Minden, the bishop of Minden, in 1146.Anke Twachtmann-Schlichter: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, p. 145. Hameln 2007. Bernard of Hildesheim (1130‚Äì53), the then bishop of Hildesheim was not able to consecrate it himself as he had become blind. Saint Nicolai's Chapel was used as a catholic parish church until 1542 when Protestantism was introduced in Hildesheim. Many inhabitants of the city, however, did not become Protestants. Saint Nicolai's Chapel, one of the smallest churches in Hildesheim, was allocated to the Protestants, who actually did not need it. At first, they used it as a stable. The church was not used as such until 1557, and there were plans to demolish it and to use the stones to repair the medieval city wall.Herrmann Seeland: Im Weltkrieg zerst√∂rte Kirchen und Wohlfahrtsanstalten im Bistum Hildesheim, p.36. Hildesheim 1948. As the monks living opposite the chapel in the monastery of St Godehard opposed the plans, St. Nicolai's Chapel was returned to the Catholic Church in 1557, but it was in very bad condition. It was renovated at various times. According to an engraving by Merian dating from 1653, it was an aisleless church with a hip roof and a fl√®che.Maike Kozok. Eine besondere Kulisse - die ehemalige Nikolaikirche im Br√ºhl, in: Hildesheimer Kalender 2012, p. 32. Hildesheim 2011. The chapel was used by the monastery until 1803. In that year, it was sold to a private owner after the monastery had been dissolved during the secularization and it was transformed into a residential building. During World War II, St. Nicolai's Chapel was slightly damaged by bombs on 22 February 1945.Hermann Seeland: Zerst√∂rung und Untergang Alt-Hildesheims, p.10. Hildesheim 1947. On 22 March 1945, however, the chapel was hit by incendiary bombs and burnt down. Only the walls remained standing, but the neighbouring half-timbered houses remained almost undamaged.Herrmann Seeland: Im Weltkrieg zerst√∂rte Kirchen und Wohlfahrtsanstalten im Bistum Hildesheim, p.37. Hildesheim 1948. St. Nicolai's Chapel was rebuilt in its original style in 1967 and is still used for residential purposes.Anke Twachtmann-Schlichter: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, p. 146. Hameln 2007.  Architecture  Saint Nicolas' Chapel, though today a residential building, is still recognizable as a former church which facaded to the west. It was a comparatively small church consisting of one nave with a vault.Georg Dehio: Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler, Niedersachsen- Bremen, p. 729. Munich 1992. The apse with its tented roof is in the east of the building. A part of the nave is preserved as well. The year 1714, which possibly refers to a renovation, is carved into the sandstone of the southern wall. The building is on the corner of Hinterer Br√ºhl and Godehardsplatz, two of the most sightworthy streets of Hildesheim, and it is surrounded by half- timbered houses which were built in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The large half-timbered house behind is a former hospital, Hospital zu den F√ºnf Wunden (Hospital of the Five Wounds), dating from 1770.

Life She was the youngest daughter of Simon Martin, a partner in Gurney's Norwich bank, who was married, at St Michael-at-Plea, Norwich, in 1809, Hannah (Ransome), a quakeress. She was born at Northrepps Hill House, near Cromer, in 1830. The family soon moved to Norwich. Miss Martin has depicted her early childhood very faithfully in one of her first stories, The Dawn of Life (1867). She was educated at a private school until the age of sixteen. The proximity of Norwich Cathedral and its precincts strongly influenced her subsequent line of thought. When as a girl she read Longfellow's Evangeline, she was very impressed with it that she wrote to the poet, and thus began a correspondence that lasted until her death. In 1849, she left Norwich with her mother to live at Clifton, Bristol, where acquaintance with Dr. Addington Symonds gave them a passport to the society of the place. She began to write from a desire to amuse and instruct young people when she settled at Clifton. Her first story, Happy Days at Fernbank, was published in 1861. Between that date and her death, she wrote over two hundred stories. This enormous production was stimulated by heavy losses in 1878, when the failure of the West of England bank not only swept away her husband's income and position, but involved him as a shareholder in certain liabilities. These Mrs. Marshall cleared off with indefatigable courage. Marshall died at home in Clifton on 4 May 1899 from Pneumonia, and was buried on the 9th of March in the cemetery of Long Ashton. Works Her method was to pick a historic character or famous building and weave a story around it, her best selling books were Under Salisbury Spire, Penshurst Castle and Winchester Meads. Of Life's Aftermath, perhaps the most popular of her novels, thirteen thousand copies have been issued. Works by Emma Marshall include but are not limited to: -Rainy Days And How to Meet them (1862) -Heights And Valleys (1871) -A Lily Among Thorns (1874) -The Cathedral Cities Of England, English Cathedrals (1879) -Heather And Harebell (1881) -Under the Mendips (1886) -Oliver's Old Pictures or The Magic Circle (1888) -Her Season in Baths (1889) -In The City Of Flowers (1889) -Little Miss Joy (1891) -A Flight With The Swallows (1896) -In The Choir of Westminster Abbey (1897) -She even wrote a novel called Dayspring. She had a special faculty for turning to account dim legend or historical incident, and her books generally have some celebrated historical character for the central figure round whom the story is woven; in Under Salisbury Spire (1890) it is George Herbert, in Penshurst Castle (1894) it is Sir Philip Sidney. Her last book, The Parson's Daughter, was finished by her daughter Beatrice after her mother's death, and published in 1899. All her tales have a high moral and religious tone. Many have been translated; several were included in the Tauchnitz Library. John Nichol and J. A. Symonds, among others, were warm in their praises of them. Canon Ainger, when advocating that a memorial, which ultimately took the form of a brass, with an inscription by him, should be placed in Bristol Cathedral, spoke of 'the high and pure quality of her literary work,' and declared that her stories 'have been the means of awakening and cultivating a taste for history and literature throughout the English-speaking world.' Family In 1854, she married Hugh Graham Marshall, who was in the service of the West of England bank. The early years of her married life were spent at Wells, Exeter, and Gloucester; and Longfellow, in reference to the continual flitting from one cathedral town to another, called her 'Queen of Summer, temple-haunting Martlet.' There were three sons and four daughters of the marriage. Emma and Hugh had nine daughters, the youngest daughter Christabel Marshall was a campaigner for women's suffrage, a playwright and author.

Effective from 1 January 2011, Glarus Nord incorporates the former municipalities of Bilten, Filzbach, Mollis, M√ºhlehorn, N√§fels, Niederurnen, Oberurnen and Obstalden.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 18 February 2011 History =Bilten= Bilten village church Elsener house (also known as Herrensitz Milt) Bilten is first mentioned in 1050 as Billitun. The area around Bilten was probably inhabited in the Roman era. By the mid-11th century, Sch√§nis Abbey owned a large part of the village, and in 1178 the Pope confirmed Sch√§nis Abbey's ownership of the village. St. Catherine's Chapel in the village was first mentioned in 1345. In either 1405/06 or 1415, the village joined the County of Glarus. The village's residents were no longer required to pay rents to Sch√§nis Abbey after 1412, but remained partly under the Abbey's control until 1612. In 1528, the majority of the residents embraced the Protestant Reformation and converted to the new faith. Subsequently Bilten became part of the Reformed parish of Niederurnen. A village church was consecrated in 1607. From the 16th until the 18th century, the alpine pastures around the village were used to raise large livestock for sale to other towns. As a sign of the growing wealth in Bilten, in 1608 a local family built the Renaissance style Elsener House. In the 18th century the local farmers gradually shifted from selling cattle to raising dairy cattle and selling dairy products. In the late 18th century, the Linth river began to silt up, and swamps and marshes formed along the river near Bilten. The marshy land caused disease which only ended with the Linth correction project of 1807-23. Between 1887 and 1939 the Biltener creek was gradually brought under control and channeled, ending its frequent flooding. The first school was built in Bilten in 1839. In 1853 a boys' boarding school opened in the Elsener House, and it remained in operation until 1944. The village was connected to the Nordostbahn (Swiss North-eastern railway) network in 1875. Until the mid-20th century Bilten remained an agricultural village. The Kunz slaughterhouse, which opened in 1958 and closed in 1995, and the insulation and packaging material company Wannerit AG, which opened in 1964, brought some industry to Bilten. When the A3 motorway was built through the valley in 1973, a number of factories took advantage of the convenient transport links and moved into Bilten. By 1990, over three-quarters of the working population were employed in industry. In 1976, a wastewater treatment plant serving the Glarus valley and surrounding area was built in Bilten. =Filzbach= View from Filzbach across Walen Lake toward Amden Filzbach is first mentioned in 1394 as Vilentzspach. The ruins of a Roman watchtower, Vor dem Wald, from the time of Emperor Augustus indicate that the area was inhabited by the Roman era. The tower was built in the second decade BC and abandoned in 16 AD. Little is known about the village during the Middle Ages. It first became part of Glarus after the Battle of Sempach in 1386. The inhabitants of Filzbach were under the control of Sch√§nis Abbey until the 14th century when they became part of the parish of Obstalden. They converted to the new Reformed faith in 1528. The farmers of Filzbach practiced subsistence agriculture into the 17th century. By the 18th century most farmers raised orchards in their fields. Today they live mostly on alpine herding. During the 18th century many families also began cottage industry spinning and cloth making to bring in extra money. A silk factory was built in 1889 and remained in operation for just over a century, closing in 1990. A small tourism industry developed in the 19th century and in 1926 the small resort Lihn des Blauen Kreuzes opened. After the Walenseestrasse was built along Walen Lake, tourism increased dramatically and two chair lifts were built. The village school was built in 1838 and is still in operation today. =Mollis= Mollis canal, watercolor 1816 Village schoolhouse Buildings at Mollis airfield Mollis is first mentioned in 1288. The oldest trace of a settlement in Mollis is a Gallo-Roman temple discovered on the H√ºttenb√∂schen about from Walen Lake. The temple was probably built between AD 50 and 150 and used until the 4th century. In the 8th century, S√§ckingen Abbey acquired several large estates in Mollis. Parts of the medieval Letzi fortification (a Cultural Property of National Significance in N√§fels) were built near Beglingen village after the Battle of N√§fels in 1388. The village chapel was built in 1280. It was elevated to a church in 1319 and in 1444 became a parish church for the newly created Mollis parish. Fridolin Brunner, the parish priest in 1523-25, introduced the Reformation to Mollis. However, many residents remained Catholic and the icons remained in the church and mass was celebrated until 1529. Once the village church converted to the new faith, the Catholic faithful joined the parishes of N√§fels or Oberurnen. The current church was built in 1761 by Hans Ulrich Grubenmann, and the Roman Catholic St. Mary's Church opened in 1963. Until the 15th century the local economy was dominated by subsistence agriculture and shepherding. After that time, sheep were gradually replaced by larger livestock such as cattle which summered in alpine pastures and were raised for sale. In the 18th century, local farmers switched to raising dairy cattle. In the 16th century a spring fed pool was built on the Walenberg and around 1600 another opened in R√ºfi. From 1600 until the 19th century the pools and the visitors that they brought were another source of income for the village. Between 1714 and 1789 many of the residents began spinning cotton yarn, which raised the standard of living for the whole village. Another source of income came from many residents who became mercenary officers: so many officers from Mollis made their fortunes in foreign military service that the village became known as an \\"Aristocrats' Nest\\". Following the 1798 French invasion and the conflicts during the Helvetic Republic, troops were often sent to Mollis and the population suffered under frequent occupation. The construction of the Escher canal in 1807-11 and the Linth correction which finished in 1827 finally ended century- long conflicts with neighboring municipalities over the boundaries along the river. The Kerenzerbergstrasse was built in 1836-51, and helped connect Mollis to the surrounding towns. In 1859 the United Swiss Railways built a station between N√§fels and Mollis. In 1856 the Jenny & Co. spinning and weaving factory moved into the village. The large factory remained in operation until 1967. In 1860 Pfeiffer AG built a linen factory, which was acquired by the American Standard Textile Company in 2000. The municipality built a school in 1862. The secondary school, which was open from 1863 until 1872 and then again after 1883 was used by students from Kerenzen village until 1973. A girls' boarding school opened in 1846. It later became a Children's and Youth Home, but this closed in 1983. A military airfield was built on the commons in 1936. It became a civilian airfield in 2005. =M√ºhlehorn= M√ºhlehorn is first mentioned in 1551 as M√ºlihorn. =N√§fels= N√§fels is first mentioned in 1240 as Nevels. In 1388, the Swiss Confederates beat the Habsburgs at the Battle of N√§fels. =Niederurnen= Niederurnen is first mentioned either before 1045 or between 1077 and 1101 as Niter Urnnen. =Oberurnen= Oberurnen is first mentioned in 1340 as Obern Urannen. =Obstalden= Obstalden is first mentioned in 1310.

He was elevated to bishop in the Church of Uganda in 1974 and retired in 1998. In 2001, he was barred from performing services. Whilst it is widely claimed that this is because of his stance on gay rights, the church claims that it was because of his participation in the consecration of a man to be a bishop of a church with which the Church of Uganda is not in communion.Church of England Newspaper April 14th 2011 He has since worked with the Charismatic Church of Uganda and the progressive Episcopal Church of the United States, and founded Integrity Uganda and the Saint Paul's Reconciliation and Equality Centre in Kampala. In 2006 the Church of Uganda declared him \\"no longer a bishop\\" and revoked all remaining privileges for his involvement with the Charismatic denomination. For his stance Senyonjo has received several honours including the Clinton Global Citizen Award, and has been invited to participate in documentaries and international speaking tours.  Personal life  = Upbringing = According to a biography in The Observer of Uganda, Senyonjo was born to Maria Mukulu Abul'awawe and Erika Kapere on December 8, 1931, and was raised in the Mubende district (now Kiboga) of Singo sub-county. A good student, he attended Sinde Primary School until the age of 10, transferring to Bukomero Primary School, residing with paternal uncle Douglas Kyeyune and wife Miriam. An anecdote describes him walking 16 km to Nalukolongo for a kilogram of meat, which Miriam craved during her pregnancy, when the local trading centre did not have any. His father died in 1944, and Senyonjo went to live with his aunt in Kitii, near Kasangati. He continued to do well at Wampewo Primary School and after P.6 he attended King's College Budo in 1947. On holidays he sold pancakes for his aunt, leading to him being jailed for a night at the age of 13 by an officer who thought he must have stolen money from a locked donation box. He described being without blanket or shoes in a cell with people who were dirty and infected with lice. In 1952 he entered Makerere University but failed to complete a course in medicine, which he attributes to spending too much time with friends because his upbringing had not prepared him for the freedom of the university. In 1954 he taught English, mathematics and health science at Luwule Secondary School. = Marriage and children = In 1959 he married his first wife Ruth Nakanwagi, returning to work 17 days later; that same day she was killed by a poisonous snake in her garden. In 1963 he met his second wife Mary while she was working as a schoolteacher at Ndejje Demonstration School. They were married in December of that year. Mary later received cataract surgery in the United States while Senyonjo was speaking in Washington in 2011. Senyonjo is the father of seven children, and has adopted three. As of 2011, he was the grandfather of eight. He lives in Bukuto, a suburb of Kampala. Due to the revocation of his pension, he sustains himself on gifts from friends and his 10 children.  Religious training and service  After the tragic death of his first wife in 1959, Senyonjo began attending church in remembrance of her. In 1960 he enrolled as a private candidate for the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education, majoring in divinity. After consulting with his mother and his best friend, Hannington Kintu, he stated he had a dream of a candle that could not be extinguished, which he took as an affirmation of his calling to religious service. He began a three-year diploma course at Buwalasi Theological College in 1961, being ordained deacon two years later, after which he attended Union Theological Seminary in the United States. He was attached to an Episcopal Church of Epiphany and mentored by Hugh McCandlas for priest ordination, later performed by Bishop Donegan in 1964. He was ordained in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. After returning to Uganda in 1968, Senyonjo was assigned to Theological College Mukuno. He taught on African traditional religion for four years. In 1973 he worked with a group of Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Anglican priests to jointly translate the Bible into \\"modern Luganda\\". He served in the Church of Ugunda and was chosen to fill the vacant position of Bishop of the Diocese of West Buganda in 1974, a position he retained until his retirement in 1998. In 1983 Senyonjo received the Doctor of Ministry degree from Hartford Theological Seminary, which provided key background for understanding issues of marriage and sexuality.  Counseling practice  After his retirement in 1998, Senyonjo opened a counselling practice, making use of education in human sexuality and marriage counselling. In the course of his practice, he spoke sympathetically with gay clients, who referred one another to him. In his Kampala counselling practice, he saw up to 10 patients a day, charging $2.50 per session.  LGBT outreach and advocacy  Since 2001 Senyonjo has been viewed as an important advocate for the Ugandan LGBT community. Believing that \\"one doesn't need to be converted first to another sexuality to be loved by God\\", Senyonjo founded Integrity Uganda as a branch of the Episcopal Church LGBT outreach organization Integrity USA. He founded a community centre as a safe place for Ugandan gays, and worked to provide housing and employment for those denied them after being outed. In June 2008, Senyonjo explained his beliefs for the film Voices of Witness Africa. He said \\"Jesus left us the most important cardinal rule: 'Love one another as I have loved you.' And I cannot see how a person loves another by discriminating against that other person without going deep into what are the causes of this person to be what that person is. Humbly, without intimidation.\\" He said that the Bible could be interpreted many ways, but that the real word of God was Jesus, the \\"Word made flesh\\", and that in the Gospel of Saint John, there were things that Jesus said he would not be able to reveal then, but that the Holy Spirit would reveal over time. In 2009 Senyonjo attended an anti-gay conference from March 5‚Äì7, 2009, titled \\"Exposing the truth behind homosexuality and the homosexual agenda\\", which featured the American activists Scott Lively, Exodus International executive Don Schmierer, and International Healing Foundation representative Caleb Lee Brundidge. Described by Lively as a \\"nuclear bomb against the gay agenda in Uganda\\", the conference associated gays with Nazism, child molestation, AIDS and the Rwandan genocide, and has been credited with bringing about unprecedented persecution culminating in the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014. Senyonjo described the interaction of conference participants with government officials as leading to the introduction of the bill, and the need for education regarding claims of homosexual recruitment in schools. Senyonjo said \\"I was at one time accused that I was going to schools and trying to recruit, as it were, people into homosexuality, which is actually blackmail. And you can see, what are the intentions of these people to do this? ... People who will say this, they have very evil intentions which I don‚Äôt understand.\\" Senyonjo testified against the anti-gay bill and was part of a delegation to the Speaker of the House to oppose it. He said that it was inhumane, violated the UN Declaration of Human Rights and \\"the sacred bonds of the Ugandan extended family\\", would make Uganda a police state, and increase the spread of HIV as people would be afraid to seek treatment. He responded to its passage noting that homosexuality is not a sin, saying \\"People here don‚Äôt understand what homosexuality is. If they did, I don‚Äôt think they would have allowed this law.\\" In May and June 2010, at the age of 78, Senyonjo made a six-week speaking tour of the United States and Ireland, organized by the Rev. Canon Albert Ogle. He spoke in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Orange County, San Francisco, Minneapolis, New York City, Belfast, and Dublin. During the tour he attended the ordination of the Rt Rev. Mary Glasspool, the first lesbian bishop of the Episcopal Church, as part of a six-week tour. In 2010, Senyonjo founded the St. Paul's Foundation for International Reconciliation to support LGBT equality internationally. (official site) He is the executive director of St. Paul's Reconciliation and Equality Centre (SPREC) in Kampala, Uganda. SPREC's programs include healthcare, chapel and counselling, psycho- social support and hospitality, entrepreneurship development (micro-loans), women's empowerment, and human rights advocacy and education. In Uganda the Centre has partnered with Freedom and Roam Uganda, Spectrum Uganda Initiatives Incorporated, Rainbow Health Foundation Mbarara, and Sexual Minorities Uganda. In February 2011, Senyonjo responded to the murder of David Kato with an open letter to Archbishop Rowan Williams and the Anglican Communion, calling on the church to speak out against the persecution of gays. Senyonjo starred in the documentary film God Loves Uganda, which was filmed around the time of David Kato's death in 2011, and premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary focused on the activities of the International House of Prayer, which promoted an anti-gay agenda. (film website) In September 2011, Senyonjo came to the United States again on a tour called \\"Compass for Compassion\\", speaking at locations including the All Souls Memorial Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.. In March 2014, at the age of 82, Senyonjo continued to minister to congregants in a makeshift church the size of a small office in Kampala, though their numbers were reduced to a handful, possibly due to intimidation. Services are held every Sunday, where the congregation sings \\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\\", but elements popular in other Ugandan churches such as praise shouts, speaking in tongues, and Bible thumping are omitted. For his support, Senyonjo is regarded as an \\"elder\\" of the LGBT community. Senyonjo was an inaugural contributor to Bombastic Magazine, a publication concerning the Ugandan LGBTI community that was launched in December 2014. Senyonjo joined protesters for LGBTI rights, making a presentation in Jamaica at the 2016 Montego Bay Pride parade. On July 17, 2018, the University of Leeds awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, for his outstanding work as clergyman and LGBT human rights defender in Uganda.  Reactions  In response to his ministry in Integrity Uganda, Senyonjo was told by Church of Uganda superiors to condemn the group and tell its members that they needed to convert to Christianity. Because of his disagreement with this position, and his refusal to condemn five young men he was counselling in 2001, his functions of vesting and laying on of hands were inhibited by the Archbishop of the Church of Uganda on behalf of the House of Bishops of Uganda in 2002, his pension for 24 years of service was stopped, and he stated that he began receiving death threats and harassment. In 2006 Archbishop Henry Luke Orombi speaking for the Church of Uganda denounced the Charismatic Church of Uganda as a \\"rebel denomination\\" and responded by completely dissociating itself from Senyonjo and stating that he was no longer a bishop and that they had \\"advised all civil authorities in Uganda that any licence held by Ssenyonjo for which his ordination in the Church of Uganda was an indispensable qualification shall now be null and void.\\" Senyonjo responded, \\"I was consecrated in the Church of God. I belong to the Church in the royal priesthood of all believers.\\" He said he was still a member of the Church of Uganda, and his only connection with the Charismatic Church of Uganda was to provide them with services when invited. California Senate Resolution 51, which called for greater scrutiny of the use of Section 501(c)(3) charitable status to lobby for discriminatory policies in other countries, noted Senyonjo \\"has been touring California, the United States, and Europe to educate and bring attention to the draconian impact of a recent wave of religious-based homophobia in Uganda\\", resolving in part that \\"the Senate commends the work and ministry of Right Reverend Christopher Senyonjo in his attempts to create an inclusive church and society in Uganda that is free from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\\" Senyonjo was included in Huffington Post list of the ten most influential people in religion in 2010. His entry noted, \\"The Bishop demonstrates what it means to have the courage of conviction, and faith enough to side with those whom Jesus called 'the least of these.'\\" Senyonjo was featured in the award-winning 2012 documentary Call Me Kuchu and God Loves Uganda (2013). In 2012 Senyonjo was honoured by former U.S. President Bill Clinton with a Clinton Global Citizen Award for leadership in civil society. The day after the passage of the anti- gay law in 2014, Senyonjo was included by the Ugandan tabloid Red Pepper among a widely publicized list of names and photos of \\"200 Top Homos\\", as an alleged gay \\"sympathizer\\". An article in Think Progress speculated that he could be imprisoned under provisions of the law that \\"A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures another to engage in acts of homosexuality commits an offence and is liable, conviction, to imprisonment for seven years.\\" Another group opposing the law, Erasing 76 Crimes, cast doubt on the case, writing that Senyonjo's pastoral counselling was not a violation of the law, but noted that Nigerian Watch and Trending Newsroom had also picked up the story.

It is located southeast of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It was closed in 1970. History Winston-Salem AFS was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational on 1 December 1956 when the 810th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Winston-Salem AFS with AN/MPS-11 and AN/FPS-6A radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The AN/MPS-11 set was replaced by an AN/FPS-8 radar that saw service between 1960 and 1962. In 1962 the 810th began operating AN/FPS-24 search and AN/FPS-26 height-finder radars along with the previously installed AN/FPS-6 set. During 1962 Winston-Salem AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 810th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 March 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-130. The AN/FPS-6A was retired in 1968. In addition to the main facility, Winston-Salem AFS operated an AN/FPS-18 unmanned Gap Filler site: * Allen, NC (M-130B/Z-130B): The 810th was inactivated on 31 July 1970 as part of a general reduction of Aerospace Defense Command air defense units.

His son John Henry Pratt became Archdeacon of Calcutta and was famous for his work in geology. Life The second son of Josiah Pratt, a Birmingham manufacturer, he was born in Birmingham on 21 December 1768. With his two younger brothers, Isaac and Henry, Josiah was educated at Barr House school, six miles from Birmingham. When he was twelve years old his father took him into his business; but at the age of seventeen he obtained his father's permission to enter holy orders. After some private tuition, he matriculated on 28 June 1789 from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, at that time the stronghold of evangelicalism in the university. His college tutor was Isaac Crouch, and they formed a lifelong friendship. He graduated B.A. and was ordained deacon in 1792, becoming assistant curate to William Jesse, rector of Dowles, near Bewdley. He remained at Dowles until 1795, when, on receiving priest's orders, he became assistant minister under Richard Cecil, the evangelical minister of St John's Chapel, Bedford Row. On 7 September 1797 he married and settled at 22 Doughty Street. There he received pupils, among them being Daniel Wilson, with whom he became close friends. In 1799, at a meeting of the Eclectic Society, which met in the vestry of St John's, he argued for a periodical publication. The first number of the Christian Observer appeared in January 1802 under his editorship. After six weeks he resigned the editorship to Zachary Macaulay. Pratt also took part in the meetings of the Eclectic (18 March and 12 April 1799) at which the Church Missionary Society was effectively founded. On 8 December 1802 he was elected secretary of the missionary society in succession to Thomas Scott. He kept the post for more than 21 years. From 1813 to 1815 he travelled through England for the society. He took part in the establishment of a seminary at Islington for the training of missionaries, which was planned in 1822, and opened by him in 1825. On 23 April 1824, he resigned his post to Edward Bickersteth, assistant secretary. He set up the Missionary Register, of which the first number appeared in January 1813. Pratt also helped to form the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804; he was one of the original committee, and was its first Church of England secretary, but then retired in favour of John Owen. In 1811 he was elected a life-governor, and in 1812 he helped to frame the rules for the organisation of auxiliary and branch societies, and of bible associations. In 1804 Pratt left Cecil to become lecturer at St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street, where John Newton, another evangelical leader, whose health was failing, was rector. Next year he became Newton's regular assistant curate. In 1804 he also undertook two other lectureships, the evening lecture at Spitalfields Church, and Lady Campden's lecture at St Lawrence Jewry. In 1810 he was made by Hastings Wheler the incumbent of the chapel of Sir George Wheler, or ‚ÄòWheler Chapel,‚Äô in Spital Square, which had been shut up for some time. For sixteen years he stayed there and set up the ‚ÄòSpitalfields Benevolent Society;‚Äô among his congregation were Samuel Hoare of Hampstead, the friend of the Wordsworths, and Thomas Fowell Buxton. Buxton with others left the Society of Friends, and were baptised into the Church of England. He worked actively in promoting the church establishment in India, encouraging Dr. Claudius Buchanan, and urging the Church Missionary Society to give practical aid when Dr. Thomas Fanshaw Middleton was appointed bishop of Calcutta. In 1820 Pratt corresponded with two American bishops (Drs. Griswold and White), and welcomed Dr. Philander Chase, bishop of Ohio, on his visit to England; and it was partly through his efforts that an American missionary society was established. He also supported in the mission of his brother-in-law William Jowett to Malta and the Levant, and founded with Dr. Buchanan the Malta mission. In 1826, when Pratt was fifty-eight, he finally became a beneficed clergyman. The parishioners of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, who elected their own vicar, had chosen him their vicar as early as 1823. But legal difficulties arose, and were not overcome for three years. He retained his lectureship at St Mary Woolnoth until 1831. He established various Christian and benevolent institutions in St. Stephen's parish, opposed the Oxford movement, and took part in the formation of the Church Pastoral Aid Society. Pratt remained a prominent leader of the evangelicals. Alexander Knox described a meeting with him at Hannah More's, and called him ‚Äòa serious, well-bred, well-informed gentleman, an intimate friend of Mrs. More's and Mr. Wilberforce's.‚Äô Pratt died in London on 10 October 1844, and was buried in the vault in the church of St Stephen's, Coleman Street. By his wife Elizabeth, eldest daughter of John Jowett of Newington, he was father of Josiah, his successor at St. Stephen's; and of John Henry Pratt. Works In 1797 he issued ‚ÄòA Prospectus, with Specimens, of a new Polyglot Bible for the use of English Students,‚Äô a scheme for popularising the labours of Brian Walton. The British Critic attacked him for presumption. Pratt published a ‚ÄòVindication;‚Äô but the scheme fell through. He edited the works of Bishop Joseph Hall (10 vols. 1808), of Bishop Ezekiel Hopkins (4 vols. 1809), ‚ÄòCecil's Remains‚Äô (1810), and Cecil's ‚ÄòWorks‚Äô (4 vols. 1811). Among his other works were ‚ÄòPropaganda, being an Abstract of the Designs and Proceedings of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, with Extracts from the Annual Sermons. By a Member of the Society,‚Äô 1818; ‚ÄòA Collection of Psalms and Hymns,‚Äô 750 in number, for the use of his parishioners in public worship, of which 52,000 copies were sold; and another ‚ÄòCollection‚Äô for private and social use.

Trains for Bury would reverse out as far as Halifax Junction before travelling north. he station was designed by Frederick Barnes who also designed a number of other early railway stations and bridges in East Anglia. The EUR and I&BR; (who shared many directors, same engineer and secretary) worked as one organisation from January 1847. For more than one hundred and twenty years after the station's closure, the site was in use as railway sidings. These consisted of a carriage and wagon works and Ipswich engine shed.

This often resulted in long delays in web page loading, where the user had to wait for each attempted IPv6 connection to time out before the IPv4 connection was tried. These timeouts ranged from being near-instantaneous in the best cases, to taking anywhere between four seconds to three minutes. presented at NANOG 50 IPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a solved problem for almost all practical purposes, following improvements at both the transport and application layers.  Brokenness  As of May 2011, IPv6 brokenness as measured by instrumenting a set of mainstream Norwegian websites was down to ~0.015%, most of which was caused by older versions of Mac OS X which would often prefer non-working IPv6 connectivity when it was not justified., presented at RIPE 61, Rome, November 2010 This behavior was fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.5, and is likely to decline further as Mac OS X 10.6.5 and subsequent versions roll out to a wider audience. However, there was no upgrade path for PowerPC-based Macs. The main remaining problem for Mac OS X was the presence of rogue routers, such as wrongly configured Windows Internet Connection Sharing devices pretending to have IPv6 connectivity, while 6to4 tunneled IPv6 traffic is blocked at a firewall. Another problem was pre-10.50 versions of Opera. Following World IPv6 Day in July 2011, there were reports of a substantial reduction in IPv6 brokenness as a result of that experiment. In the year following the trial, but prior to the World IPv6 Launch date, brokenness levels were reported to have risen slowly back upwards again towards 0.03%.  DNS whitelisting  Google, a major provider of services on the Internet, experimented with using a type of DNS whitelisting on a per-ISP basis to prevent this until the World IPv6 Launch. In the DNS whitelisting approach, ISPs are determined from DNS lookup source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from routing tables. There is an IETF draft entitled \\"IPv6 AAAA DNS Whitelisting Implications\\" that describes the issues around whitelisting. AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6 when hostnames are used instead of ipv6-addresses. Numerous concerns were been raised about the practicality of DNS whitelisting as a long-term large-scale solution, such as scalability and maintenance issues relating to the maintenance of large numbers of bilateral agreements., presented at IETF79, Beijing In 2010, several of the major web service providers met to discuss pooling their DNS whitelisting information in an attempt to avoid these scaling problems.  Problem resolution  It appears that no major content providers eventually ended up using the whitelisting approach, given that all that had previously declared an interest began serving AAAA records to generic DNS queries following World IPv6 Launch Day. Google now provides AAAA records to all DNS servers except for those on a limited list of subnets which Google excludes from AAAA record service. As of 2017, IPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a non-problem. This is due to two factors: firstly, IPv6 transport is much improved, so that the underlying error rate is much reduced, and secondly, that common applications such as web browsers now use fast fallback methods such as the \\"Happy Eyeballs\\" algorithm to select whichever protocol works best. Some operating system vendors have rolled fast fallback algorithms into their higher-level network stack APIs, thus making the solution available for all programs that use those APIs to make connections.

Mathews (born 5 February 1946) is an Australian professor of competitive dynamics and global strategy. He currently holds the Eni Chair of Competitive Dynamics and Global Strategy at LUISS Guido Carli University, in Rome, and concurrently holds a Chair of Strategy at the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Macquarie University, in Sydney. Mathews has focused on the dynamics of technological catch-up by East Asian countries in high-tech industries, semiconductors, flat panel displays and most recently in alternative energy industries, solar photovoltaics and LEDs. He has developed dynamic strategy frameworks for analyzing these processes, and formulated a strategic synthesis in terms of the fundamental categories of resources, activities and routines. His most recent work applies this framework to explicating the reasons for success of industrial clusters, particularly those found in Taiwan, China and India. His book published in 2006, Strategizing, Disequilibrium and Profit (Stanford University Press), took these issues as framework to explore the evolution of industries and strategizing behaviors of firms theoretically. Strongly influenced by Joseph A. Schumpeter, Mathews viewed the disequilibrium and the dynamics of the economic system as both a setting and outcome of firms‚Äô strategizing behaviours. Entrepreneurship plays a central role in creating the bundles of resources, activities and routines.D. J. Miller and J. T. Mahoney. 2008 Book Review. British Journal of Management 19: 294-297. His work (in 2010/11) focuses on the intersection between the development of new low-carbon industries and renewable energies; the rise of China and India and their pursuit of an East Asian model of development and highly-focused industrial clusters; and the adaptation of the capitalist economic system with its enormous growth and innovation potential to the demands of operating within natural ecological limits ‚Äì such as within the framework of a ‚ÄòCircular Economy‚Äô as advanced in China.

Rufus Putnam Ranney was born at Blandford, Hampden County, Massachusetts. The family moved to Portage County, Ohio in 1824.

At age 21Neff 1921 : 218‚Äì221 or 22Randall 1912 Volume 5 : 147‚Äì150 he began the study of law at the office of Joshua Reed Giddings and Benjamin Wade, and was admitted to the bar in 1836. Legal The firm of Wade and Ranney was formed because Giddings was elected to Congress. In 1845, Wade became judge of the Common Pleas before entering the Senate in 1851. In 1846, Ranney moved to Warren, Trumbull County. The Democrats nominated him for Congress in 1846 and 1848, in a district \\"hopelessly in the minority\\". Political In 1850, in heavily Whig Trumbull and Geauga counties, Ranney was elected to the second State Constitutional Convention. He served on the committees on the judiciary, on revision, and on amendments. Also on the judiciary committee were Henry Stanbery, Joseph Rockwell Swan, William S. Groesbeck, and William Kennon, Sr.. In 1892, a committee of the Ohio Bar, including Allen G. Thurman, Jacob Dolson Cox, F.E. Hutchins, and Samuel E. Williamson had this to say of Ranney's work at the convention: Judicial In March, 1851, under the old constitution, the General Assembly elected Ranney to the Supreme Court to succeed Judge Avery. Later that year, he was elected by the public, under the new Constitution, to a five-year term on the Supreme Court. In 1856, Josiah Scott defeated Ranney and a third party candidate for the seat. Ranney resigned shortly after the election, and Scott was seated late in 1856. Ranney began law practice at Cleveland in the firm Ranney, Backus, and Noble. In 1857 he was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. In 1859, Ranney was nominated the Democratic candidate for governor, but lost to Republican William Dennison. In 1862, the Democrats nominated Ranney for Supreme Court again, and the Republicans nominated his law partner Franklin T. Backus.

Two air-launched and one ground-launched vehicles were developed as part of the program. While none entered production, they assisted in the development of both the GAM-87 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile and that of re-entry vehicles for ballistic missiles. Background The US Navy began their Polaris missile project in December 1956, and this program presented serious problems for the Air Force's own missile developments. The Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were liquid fueled and required considerable time to fuel and spin up their inertial platforms before launch, during which time they were open to air attack. This meant that a Soviet sneak attack by bombers on the ICBM bases, combined with using their own ICBMs against Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, could significantly damage the Air Force's strike capabilities. In comparison, Polaris could be launched from practically anywhere in huge areas of the Atlantic and Pacific and was essentially immune to attack. The Navy developed a policy known as \\"survivable deterrent force\\" of about 600 warheads, which they felt would deter any Soviet attack under any circumstances. As they laid plans to build the Polaris submarine fleet needed to carry these missiles, the Air Force was left in the position of potentially being cut out of the deterrence role. This was most forcibly pointed out in an internally circulated document entitled \\"The Problem of Polaris\\". The Air Force response was two-fold. One was WS-199, which explored various options to make the Air Force's own missiles as immune as the Navy's. The primary method was the air-launched missile, which would be kept on station close to the Soviet Union but outside their defensive range, able to be launched at a moment's notice. They also explored ways to extend the range of ground- launched missiles, so that small mobile missiles might be able to carry out attacks from the United States without being subject to counterattack. Other options, not part of WS-199, included an active defense using the LIM-49 Nike Zeus and its follow-ons, and rail-based launchers. WS-199A The designation WS-199A was applied to Strategic Air Command's overall studies of future requirements, that were tested using the hardware developed under the other WS-199 subprojects. Receiving Congressional approval in 1957, the WS-199 project would award contracts to three different companies to develop experimental designs for new, hypersonic weapons. Although none of the weapons were planned to be operational, in an emergency they could be quickly developed for combat service.Yengst 2010, p.37. WS-199B Bold Orion Developed by Martin Aircraft, the Bold Orion missile was an air-launched ballistic missile, launched from the B-47 Stratojet medium bomber, with flight tests being carried out in 1958 and 1959. Early launches of the Bold Orion as a single-stage vehicle were unsuccessful, however a redesign as a two-stage weapon produced improved results, with the remainder of the 12-launch series establishing the ALBM as a viable vehicle. The final test flight trialed the Bold Orion missile as an anti-satellite missile, passing within of Explorer VI, the first-ever interception of a satellite.Peebles 1997, p. 65. WS-199C High Virgo Developed by Lockheed Aircraft, the High Virgo missile was developed as a single-stage air-launched ballistic missile, launched from the B-58 Hustler supersonic bomber. Four test flights were conducted during 1958 and 1959, of which two were successful; the final launch of the program tested the missile in the anti-satellite role, but suffered telemetry failure.Yenne 2005, p.67. The results of the Bold Orion and High Virgo tests assisted in the development of the WS-138 specification, which became the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. WS-199D Alpha Draco Developed by McDonnell Aircraft, the Alpha Draco missile was an experimental, ground-launched, two-stage missile that conducted research on re-entry vehicles and the boost-glide principle of reentry.Parsch 2005 Three launches of the vehicle were conducted during 1959, of which two were successful.Yengst 2010, p.39.

Originally it was named Mozart S√§ngerknaben and now is one of the most famous choirs in Europe and has gained recognition internationally. Mozart Boys' Choir Wien in uniform History In 1956 to mark the 200 anniversary of Mozart's birthday, Prof. Erich Schwartzbauer founded \\"The Mozart Boys' Choir\\", which was directed primarily to perform works by Mozart and Viennese traditional music. Unlike the Vienna Boys' Choir, the boys from the Mozart's choir do not live in a boarding school, but they are allowed to go home after musical instruction and attend a school of their choice in his own neighbourhood. Although the members of the choir come together only once a week for rehearsals and performances, the choir has achieved high standards of quality. In 1995 the community ceased activities due to the death of its founder, so that the choir disappeared. Then, given some legal issues not solved properly the original name of \\"Mozart S√§ngerknaben\\" could not be in use anymore, so the musical director of the institution Peter Lang took over the responsibility and in collaboration with parents reorganized the choristers under the new name of \\"Amadeus Boys' Choir of Vienna\\". In 2006, coinciding with the 250 anniversary of the birth of Mozart, the choir celebrated obtaining its name back, and it is now known again as the Mozart Boys' Choir of Vienna, and it can be clearly distinguished by its 18th knight costume uniform. Repertoire Mozart's compositions have a special place in choir's selection but it also comprises other composers from the classical period such as Joseph Haydn and Franz Peter Schubert. Audiences are delighted with the extraordinary performances of popular Austrian and German songs and Johann Strauss waltzes and polkas as well. The boys are also trained to perform works by contemporary composers to make them available to its fans. Concerts and tours Choir performances are given in a wide range of venues not only in Vienna but around the world. Choirboys have trodden stages as important as the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna Volksoper, the Musikverein's golden hall, among other greatest theaters around the world. They sing in private events or in charming soir√©es at the Vienna Palais sharing with guests their fine art. Featured participations The Mozart Boys' Choir has had the opportunity to sing together with the best orchestras of Vienna, like the Vienna Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphonic and the Radio Symphony Orchestra, all of them under the baton of famous conductors. Mozart choristers have also taken part in Christmas Concerts, Austrian films and TV commercials.

He helped to secure funding by lobbying the Ipswich and Toowoomba Chambers of Commerce on the necessity of an Australian film industry. The company was formed by issuing 30,000 shares at ‚Ç§1 each. Chauvel announced his goal in 1924: > It is our intention to produce films in Queensland and wherever possible to > use Queensland talent in all departments of our work. Queensland, with its > excellent climate conditions, its months of fine weather, and its beautiful > and varied scenery is undoubtedly one of the best parts of Australia in > which to produce motion pictures... We intend to film our stories with > faithful regard to thc spirit and traditions of our young nation, and we > will present the same with the belief that there will be audience response > for home-made productions which are offered through the joint efforts of > Australian writers, craftsmen, and artists. In the end the paid-up capital of the company was ¬£7,000, and the uncalled capital was ¬£4,240. On-location filming took place in Queensland, at three primary locations: near Spicer's Peak, at Franklyn Vale cattle station, and under the Sleeping Assyrian, a mountain in the Rosevale Valley. The film unit, comprising a total of eighteen members, included a bush chef and a supply of sheep and fowl. The lead roles were played by Doris Ashwin and Marsden Hassell, who later married.

It was an illustrated weekly newspaper that covered a wide array of social related topics both local and international. Many personalities at the time, both Spanish and Filipinos, contributed articles and pictures, although the newspaper also published anonymous articles that in some cases raised a great deal of controversy. History La Ilustraci√≥n Filipina published its first issue on November 7, 1891, made of eight pages and a four-page cover, in two columns in cuarto. La Ilustraci√≥n Filipina must not be confused with Ilustraci√≥n Filipina, a highly regarded illustrated magazine also published in the Philippines during the period between March 1, 1859 and December 15, 1860. This similarity of titles was not accompanied by a correlation in written contents, graphic design and printing quality, which prompted Wenceslao Retana to point out the \\"responsibility\\" that had fallen upon founder Zaragoza, who had dare to \\"resurrect\\" the name of a very prestigious magazine in spite of knowing beforehand that he could never be able to surpass the level of quality achieved by its predecessor. Contents The newspaper had many sections that included the Arts, Science, Politics, History, local and world news, etc. Despite some criticisms regarding his lack of artistic stature, La Ilustraci√≥n was regarded as one of the most important sources of news and information at the time, both for local and international affairs. Notable contributors From 1891 to 1895 it was partly edited by Miguel Zaragoza, painter, writer and teacher, who is considered to be one of the first Filipinos to publish a book of poems written in Spanish, and during the Philippine Revolution became one of the editors of the Malolos Constitution. During the years that he acted as the editor of the newspaper, Zaragoza also contributed many writings and drawings, and openly gave preference to the works of native Filipino writers and artists, such as Juan Luna, Fabian de la Rosa, Rafael Enriquez and Torribio Herrera. Juan Luna, Filipino painter, sculptor and political activist during the Philippine Revolution, was featured on the July 28, 1892 cover of the La Ilustraci√≥n in spite of having maintained a strong rivalry with Zaragoza. He contributed many illustrations and writings in successive editions, among them one of the most famous cover pages of the Ilustraci√≥n showing a young Filipina seated next to a basket of books and some little girls reading, with Mayon Volcano in the background. Simon Flores y de la Rosa, another renowned Filipino painter, contributed a self-portrait in charcoal that was used in an article about him. I√±igo Regalado y Corcuera, a famous printer and Tagalog poet was the head printer of the newspaper during 1890.

Longrich in 2011 for the description of Titanoceratops, which he defined as \\"as all species closer to Triceratops horridus than to Anchiceratops ornatus or Arrhinoceratops brachyops\\". Fossils of these animals have been found in western North America, in particular West Canada, Western and Midwestern United States, which was once part of the ancient continent of Laramidia. The number of species and genera in recent years has been controversial, as some genera such as Torosaurus, Tatankaceratops, and Nedoceratops are wrapped up in debate as to whether they are ontogenetic (growth) stages of Triceratops, specimens or species of Triceratops, or unique genera based on morphometrics. In addition there is a genus, Agathaumas, which is considered to be a nomen dubium as it is based on ambiguous fragmentary fossils.Breithaupt, B.H.

(eds.), Proceedings of the 6th Fossil Resources Conference, United States Department of Interior - National Park Services - Geological Resources Division. =Phylogeny= For his phylogenetic analysis of Titanoceratops, Longrich (2011) only recognized three genera, with Eotriceratops, Ojoceratops, and Nedoceratops resolved as junior synonyms of Triceratops, as well as recognizing Torosaurus utahensis as a species of Triceratops: In 2015 authors Caleb Brown & Donald Henderson conducted a phylogenetic analysis in the description of Regaliceratops and found Eotriceratops, Ojoceratops, and Nedoceratops to be valid genera. There is a polytomy between Regaliceratops, Eotriceratops, Ojoceratops, and a Titanoceratops‚ÄìTriceratops clade as shown below: Below is the result of a phylogenetic analysis by Jordan Mallon et al. (2016) from their description of Spiclypeus shipporum. Eotriceratops was removed from the Chasmosaurinae entirely because it was found that it decreases resolution in their analysis because of the authors' new interpretation of epiparietal configurations. Regaliceratops was not resolved as a member of the Triceratopsini.

The first steamboat on the Fraser River was the which entered Pacific waters in 1835. It was an itinerant supply for the Hudson's Bay Company roving throughout the lower Columbia River in Oregon and around coastal Washington, British Columbia and southeastern Russian America (Alaska), long before those political entities came into being. Gold rush It was only the Fraser River Gold Rush and the Cariboo Gold Rush of 1862 which drew more steamers from the Columbia River in Oregon to Puget Sound and the Fraser River. Ships that called in were the Suprize, Enterprise, and the Wilson G. Hunt. British action At the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the accompanying declaration of the Colony of British Columbia, British colonial Governor James Douglas, was worried about an American monopoly on British trade and thus declared a law preventing steamboat traffic operating under the American flag from conducting trade in the colony. This did two things, it enabled a local shipbuilding industry and, in as a result in some cases, ship owners changed flags and registry to British shipping. Dominant shipping players Two dominant shipping players came to the fore - William Irving, an American from Portland, and William Moore, a German, who now resided in the New World. Both would dominate the shipping industry on the coast and would embark on schemes of monopoly and rate wars. The boats, steam powered sternwheelers, churned their way up the river to Yale and Hope. The Fraser River was navigable to Yale, above which a fearsome torrent inhibited regular navigation. Gold seekers were travelling to the area and to the British Columbia Interior and thus wanted to move from Victoria, the deep sea port, by shallow draft steamer. A Hudson's Bay fort at Fort Langley, sat some inland from tidewater. Regular steamer service ran on the Fraser River as far as Yale and also shortly afterwards via the Harrison River up to the head of Harrison Lake, where a townsite named Port Douglas became the port of disembarkation for the Douglas Road, also known as the Lakes Route or Lillooet Trail, which ran via a series of lakes and wagon-road portages to Cayoosh Flat, the other major boomtown of the early gold rush alongside Yale and Port Douglas.

To assist this massive project steamers were built. The Skuzzy was built by Andrew Onderdonk to move supplies and became the only steamer to transit the Fraser Canyon. Once the railway was opened in 1886 traffic up the valley became easier. Other railways came in to break the CPR monopoly‚Äîthe Grand Trunk Pacific and the Canadian Northern, both of which built steamers. Competing railways had steamers on the river to move rail barges. The CN had the SS Canora which moved boxcars from Port Mann to Victoria; the Great Northern Railway of Canada had barge service from Port Guichon near Ladner to Sidney for its line. In the early years the steam ferry Surrey ran across the river to serve the farmers from Liverpool to New Westminster. Steamers 1858 to 1981 Steamers provided regular service on the river from 1858 to 1981 when the last paddler was retired. Small farms and outports relied on the service for mail, delivering produce and milk, and connection across a very large river where there were few bridges. Communities up and down the river depended upon the steamers‚ÄîLadner, Anniedale, Liverpool, BC Penitentiary, Port Coquitlam, Hammond, Haney, Whonnock, Errock, Kilby, Pitt Late, Stave Lake, Hayward Lake, Agassiz, Hope, Lulu Island, Queensborough, Barston Island, Deas Island and Eburne. Local labour The native people of the lower Fraser, a group of Coast Salish peoples today known as the Sto:lo, were employed to cut firewood and act as deckhands, where their years of river experience by canoe was invaluable. Later vessels would burn coal, and later oil. Steamers floated through the centre of Chilliwack in both the 1894 and 1948 floods. Goods carried The lower Fraser is navigable by deep sea shipping. Freighters from around the world would tie up at Pacific Coast Terminals or Fraser Surrey docks to load forest products. This is in addition to the hundred or so sawmills that once dotted the river. There were very big sawmills at Fraser Mills, Royal City, Western White Pine and Queensborough, in addition to two pulp mills. Tug and barge traffic was prolific and was once 100 percent steam powered. Fish products at Steveston, pulp and paper at Annacis Island, plywood, limestone, and gravel, scrap metal and cars were all transferred by barge. This form of steamer is more in the coastal fleet than riverine trade and should be addressed from the individual tug and transport companies. Preserved sternwheeler The SS Samson V is the only Canadian steam-powered sternwheeler that has been preserved afloat. It was built in 1937 by the Canadian Federal Department of Public Works as a snagboat for clearing logs and debris out of the lower reaches of the Fraser River and for maintaining docks and aids to navigation. The fifth in a line of Fraser River snagpullers, the Samson V has engines, paddlewheel and other components that were passed down from the Samson II of 1914. It is now moored on the Fraser River as a floating museum in its home port of New Westminster, near Vancouver, B.C. Types of craft Many other steamers worked on the river‚Äîthese were dredges, derricks and cranes. In the early years, dikes, docks, and jetties needed to be built and so barge based steamers were put to work. Later many bridges, airports and factories were built and thus needed cranes and dredges. Fraser River Pile and Dredge was one company as was Dinsmore Dredge. Derricks and snagboats also worked the river. Ships John Irving's Reliance at Yale (1880) R.P.

Starring Lukas Ammann and Wolfgang V√∂lz, the series followed the adventures of the title's aristocratic gentleman detective and his working-class butler. It was a success in particular in Germany and in France. Originally the show was a German production in black-and-white but it evolved into a European co-production in colour. Main character Lukas Ammann plays Graf (Count) Yoster, who is presented as an impeccable gentleman. He used to wear a traditional suit, a bowler hat and an umbrella just like John Steed in the TV series The Avengers and the fictional English solicitor Reginald Prewster who had to accompany Percy Stuart during his missions on TV. Although he lived in a castle in Bavaria (where especially in the beginning a great deal of the show was shot) he wouldn't have the slightest Bavarian accent and his appearance was as British as his Rolls Royce. Sidekick Wolfgang V√∂lz played Ioan (or in German: Johann), the count's butler. The idea a butler could make a hero was for German audiences already established by Butler Parker. Ioan would sometimes engage in investigations and then bring the count up to speed as well literally while he drove the count's Rolls Royce. Moreover, he would instantly transform into the count's bodyguard whenever somebody indulged himself to endanger the count's well-being by trying to approach him in any kind of inappropriate manner. He used to apply his highly efficient close- combat techniques in a very businesslike way which was completely different from any Hollywood boxing or Hong Kong manners and would rather resemble the way British soldiers are taught to dissolve comparable issues. He was portrayed as a man of modest origin and it was repeatedly implied that he had even been entangled in criminal activities before entering the count's employ. Genre Graf Yoster was very much an amateur detective in the tradition of Dorothy Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey. His cases were accordingly whodunits although in the end Ioan would frequently have to give him a hand disarming the detected offenders. Directors Among the directors was Imo Moszkowicz, who had also directed a German TV series starring Josef Meinrad as Father Brown.

It argues that the crisis was not an accident of the free market but the result of a complex and ongoing politico-financial process taking place in the United States whereby wealth and power are transferred to a super-rich \\"grifter class\\" that holds a grip on the political process. The book has been described as a \\"necessary ... corrective\\" of the assertion that bubbles are inevitable in the market system, (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5vTBoVFxL?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Goodman-t.html?_r=1) and contests the notion that the greed of the American consumer was a primary cause of the problem.(Archived by WebCite at ) Taibbi maintains that \\"all of us, conservatives and progressives, are being bled dry by a tiny oligarchy of extremely clever criminals and their castrato henchmen in government.\\" Contents Griftopia contains seven analytical essays, followed by an epilogue, and a note about the author‚Äôs sources. Taibbi names most sources he interviewed. However, in some instances sources remained anonymous for their protection. Other sourcing is self-evident from publicly known material. The introductory chapter is focused on the Tea Party movement whose members are aiming for simple solutions with less government intrusion. Taibbi maintains that the real world is too complex, and the Tea Party adherents are being manipulated (and financed) to do the bidding of Wall Street. Dismantling of regulations and absence of control has been part of the problem of the recent fiasco. Taibbi sees the Tea Party as \\"top-down media con\\" initiated by CNBC's Rick Santelli when he denounced not the huge bailout of the banks but rather the relatively small bailout for people facing foreclosure. Alan Greenspan is described as the major enabler of the bubble economy and financial crisis. Taibbi catalogues his string of economic prognostications that were \\"awful at best\\". He holds him accountable for fueling economic bubbles during his watch at the Federal Reserve by pushing money and abandoning traditional evaluations when advocating that \\"ideas\\" (not financial results) had become the new paradigm of financial evaluation. Greenspan is criticized for advising the public to use adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) in preference to fixed‚Äìrate mortgages shortly before his raising of interest rates. Taibbi accuses Greenspan of turning the Federal Reserve into a permanent bail-out system for the super-rich. Taibbi dissects the housing bubble crisis as a complex scam involving players at many levels. Entry level assessments, income levels, and credit scores were falsified or neglected, allowing unqualified customers to acquire mortgages they could not carry. Taibbi maintains that ARMs and other \\"financial inventions\\" enlarged the pool of loans that could never be paid back, yet issuing agents and agencies were made rich by commissions. The real money, however, came in for the big banks that securitized these loans, that is to say, repackaged them as investment vehicles (and in the process took the loan originators off the hook). The commodities bubble of 2008 led to global food shortages and prompted the price of oil to rise over $140 per barrel. Taibbi depicts as its cause investment-bank led commodity speculation, after having convinced regulators to dismantle sensible regulations that had safeguarded the process of commodity trading, in place since the Great Depression. The sell-off of public assets is described in another essay with examples of frittering away assets under value to the detriment of future generations. The health care reform by the Obama administration is described as a \\"grotesque give-away\\" to the health insurance industry and a betrayal of the public trust. Taibbi argues that the insurance industry unfairly continues to be exempted from anti-trust legislation. Taibbi‚Äôs last chapter takes on Goldman Sachs (GS) in an updated version of his 2009 Rolling Stone article where he \\"famously\\" likened the world‚Äôs most powerful investment bank to \\"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\\". He describes GS as it was in the forefront of pushing Initial public offerings (IPOs) (most of which lost money) during the internet bubble, at the heart of the commodity crisis of 2008 (enabling speculation in oil and other essentials and driving up their prices), and was right at the center of the financial crisis of 2008 ongoing. Goldman Sachs is seen as the \\"apotheosis of the Grifter Era\\" controlling rules and regulations through manipulation of the government by money, pressure, insider connections, and revolving door jobs as a \\"parasitic enterprise\\". The author asserts that \\"...in a society governed passively by free markets and free elections, organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy.\\"Matt Taibbi, ibid. p.210 In the epilogue Taibbi takes a look at the events after 2008. He addresses the issue that bankers in Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) hearings laid the blame of the financial crisis on \\"lazy poor people living in too much house\\", a view Republicans embraced as a failure of mixing private enterprise and social engineering, while the Obama administration continues to let Wall Street run the economic policy of the White House. Much of the backroom dealing that resulted in the massive and selective bail-out has not seen the light of day. Taibbi addresses his critics of the 2009 Rolling Stone article who did not argue his facts, but instead took fault with him for not understanding that the bail-out was necessary. Taibbi finally points out that, after 2008, the financial landscape is more concentrated than ever, and efforts at its regulation have been watered down. Language Taibbi, a reporter for Rolling Stone, uses a journalistic style that incorporates R-rated language,Matt Taibbi, ibid. p. 206 While it makes the book readable and \\"engaging\\", the tone of the book has also been criticized as ‚Äúplaying dirty‚Äù(Archived at Webcite at ) and as distracting.(Archived by WebCite at ) As the New York Times states: Reception Griftopia has been described as a \\"relentlessly disturbing, penetrating exploration\\" as well as a \\"provocative exploration\\"(Archived by WebCite at ) of the events leading to the financial crisis.

(Archived by WebCite at ) Taibbi views the color of the US not red and blue but rather \\"puke green\\",(Archived by WebCite at ) but, as Salmon says, \\"if muck is going to be raked, you want Taibbi to be doing the raking.\\" Sheelah Kolhatkar has stated that Taibbi has \\"legitimate targets\\" and a \\"right to be angry\\", as most of the \\"perpetrators of the financial crisis have escaped more or less unscathed\\", and while \\"the worse things get for average Americans, the better off (are) the top 1 percent\\".

It was promoted by Samuel Carter Hall, George Dawson and John Passmore Edwards, among others. Half-day early Closing was not finally won until 1912. It was opposed by Asquith's Liberal Government until a bill could be passed due to Trade Union pressure. The first socialist woman to enter parliament Margaret Bondfield, later a Labour MP, was an early advocate of early closing when a mass meeting was held in Trafalgar Square. But it would be another decade of 72 hour working weeks before the week could be cut to 60 hours. Another radical supporter was disgraced Liberal MP Sir Charles Dilke, whose involvement with Mrs Crawford damaged his reputation and chances of becoming Prime Minister. Had he become Gladstone's natural successor early closing might have happened in 1890. Dilke's bill to close shops at 8 pm which failed to pass was bitterly opposed by both Lords and Commons during 1903. Home Secretary Winston Churchill was very anti-trade union regularly opposing any legislation to assist the improvements they so desired.

It is commonly known as the great Arctic, Nevada Arctic, great grayling, Felder's Arctic, or Pacific Arctic. It is native to northwestern North America. Subspecies * Oeneis nevadensis nevadensis (C. Felder & R. Felder, [1867]) * Oeneis nevadensis gigas Butler, 1868 * Oeneis nevadensis iduna (Edwards, 1874) The leading edge of the hindwing is light grey with a dark-grey triangle on the post-median line. Description The wingspan of the great Arctic measures 2 to 2.5 inches (5.1 to 6.3 cm), making it the largest western Arctic. O. n. nevadensis is bright orange brown on the upper side of the wings. The dark brown wing margins are scalloped. Males have one to two black eyespots on the forewing; females have two to three. Males have a large, dark patch of sex scales on the forewing, extending from the basal area to near the apex. Females have dark scaling on the basal area of the forewing. Both sexes have a small eyespot near the hindwing tornus. The underside of the forewing is similar to the upper side. The ventral hindwing is uniformly striated dark brown and gray. Some populations have an irregular dark median band on the hindwing. The costa is whitish. O. n. gigas is slightly larger and darker than the nominate subspecies. O. n. iduna differs from the other two subspecies in having a much paler upperside. Distribution and habitat The great Arctic is found almost exclusively in the Cascade Mountains, from southern British Columbia to northern California. O. n. gigas is found on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. O. n. iduna is found in northern coastal California. The great Arctic is found from sea level to . Habitats include forest clearings, open pinewoods, gravel roads, meadows, slopes, and canyons. Along the coast, it is commonly found on bare mountain summits. Flight The great Arctic is seen from early May to late September, but only every two years (mostly even numbered) due to its long life cycle. O. n. gigas is seen on odd numbered years. Life cycle The whitish egg is oblong and flat topped. The caterpillar is tan with a black lateral dorsal stripe. The sides of the caterpillar are striped with brown, greenish brown, and white. The head lacks horns, and the posterior end of the abdomen is forked. The caterpillar overwinters partially grown in its first year, and overwinters in its second year as a fifth instar. The host plant for the great Arctic is unknown, but is believed to be in the family Poaceae.

United States, 531 U.S. 198 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case dealt with a technical question of law relating to whether a showing of prejudice in incorrect sentencing decisions is required for a correction of that sentence. Background Paul Glover was the Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers, and Warehouse Workers Union. A trial showed that he tried to enrich himself and others through kickbacks. The federal trial court sentenced him to 84 months in prison, denying a request to 'group' consideration of similar offenses on which he was convicted, which would have lowered the sentence range. His attorneys did not raise this issue on his first appeal to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed his conviction. Glover filed a motion on his own to try to correct his sentence. He argued that the failure of his attorneys to appeal on the grouping question constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. However, because there was no proof that the sentencing alteration was 'significant', the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.531 U.S. 198 at 202 Glover wanted a lower range (which would have a minimum of 63 months) and so he appealed to the United States Supreme Court which granted the case for consideration in 2000. Opinion of the Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the decision of the Court which was unanimous. He stated that the Strickland test's prejudice prong did not require a showing that a wrongful increase in a sentence met 'a standard of significance'. The Seventh Circuit was thus incorrect because \\"there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice... although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor to consider in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, ...it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice.\\" 531 U.S. 198 at 204-205 Therefore, Glover's sentence had to be recalculated and the case was remanded for further proceedings in lower courts.

Benjamin Rush Cowen was born in Moorefield Township, Harrison County, Ohio. His father, Benjamin S. Cowen was later elected to Congress. He grew up in St. Clairsville, Belmont County, Ohio, where he attended a classical institute, and served an apprenticeship in printing at the Belmont Chronicle, where he became owner and editor at age 17. He completed studies in medicine, but never practiced.Mackoy 1908 : 149‚Äì156 On September 19, 1854, Cowen was married to Ellen Thoburn of Belmont County. She had eight children, three of whom survived him. In 1856, as an alternate, he attended the National Convention of the Republican Party in Philadelphia, which Nominated Fremont for the Presidency. He sold the Chronicle in 1858 and was in real estate in Bellaire. In the 54th General Assembly, he was Chief Clerk of the Ohio House of Representatives, and served during the 1860 and adjourned 1861 session.

It serves the 50,000 citizens of Logan with a collection of about 200,000 informational and recreational items, more than 500 events each year for people for all ages, five public meeting rooms, free wireless Internet access, and computers (desktop, laptop, and tablets for in-house use). Collection The Logan Library maintains collections of popular materials in fiction, nonfiction, children's, young adult, large print, magazines, Spanish, graphic novels, and audiovisual materials (DVDs, CDs, etc.) of many formats. In addition to the popular collections, the library maintains its Virginia Hansen Special Collections Room composed of local history items, the remnant of the Everton Genealogy Collection plus other genealogy helping aids, and the library's collection of bound periodicals. Programs & Activities The library provides more than 500 free programs throughout the year which are popular with community members of all ages. These include summer reading programs with prizes and activities, regular story times, afterschool programs, film showings every Monday evening, monthly family game nights, informational classes, an annual community fair featuring local nonprofit organizations, an annual writers conference, an art wall featuring local visual artists, and Helicon West, a longstanding literary open mic event with featured readers. Management Structure Under Utah state statute, Logan Library is governed by a board of trustees consisting of seven members drawn from the community and approved by the mayor. The board meets on a monthly basis.http://library.loganutah.org/information/board.cfm The day-to-day operations of the library are managed by the board-chosen director and a staff of nine librarians, 14 circulation staff, four pages, one custodian, and a small group of dedicated volunteers. Funding The Logan Library is funded by a dedicated property tax and therefore prospective cards holders must prove Logan residency, or business or property ownership, before circulation privileges are granted. Anyone living outside Logan may purchase a library card for an annual fee of $163.00 per household.http://library.loganutah.org/information/cards.cfm History Logan Library traces its history to the library which was formally established by Logan City on April 18, 1916. The library's collection consisted of the donated libraries of St. John's Episcopal Church (1,200+ titles)Record, P. L. (2006). History of the library in Logan, Utah: Ninety years of service 1916-2006. p.1 and the LDS Mutual Improvement Association in Logan. In October 1920, the library came under the direction of Cache County, in accordance with Utah House Bill 97. County and city each agreed to pay half the operating costs. The new Cache County Library was housed in a rental property, later nicknamed \\"The Dungeon.\\"Hatch, A. C. (1973). A History of the library serving Cache County, Utah. p.11. A new library building was erected at 90 North 100 East in Logan in 1932. This building still stands. For the next 25 years, Cache County Library grew and expanded. Local businesses and individual members of the community donated cash, books, and furniture. The library had a large and popular genealogy collection, a space used as headquarters for the local Boy Scouts, and hosted art shows and concerts. The building and its contents became a source of pride for Cache County citizens. Unfortunately, after a few years, problems with the structure itself were evident: the roof leaked, there were issues with the boiler, and the lighting was considered inadequate. Most of these problems were handled in temporary fashion until funds could be procured for more permanent solutions.Hatch, A. C. (1973). A History of the library serving Cache County, Utah. pp.11-19. In the 1960s, the library board met infrequently, calls for expanded service to County citizens in the form of a bookmobile were rejected, arguments erupted among the many groups using the library building (including the ever more powerful genealogy librarian), the need for building improvements was recognized but little action was taken, individual monetary gifts to the library began to decrease, and (for several years) the library recorded budget deficits.Hatch, A. C. (1973). A History of the library serving Cache County, Utah. pp.22, 25-8. The library's director for much of this time (1940s to the 1970s) was Miss Virginia Hansen. In the 1970s, Cache County leaders indicated that they were interested in divesting themselves of the library and, in 1976, after many contentious debates about the future (including the discussion of a possible county-wide library system), Cache County sold its half of the library back to Logan City, recreating the Logan Library. In 1981, Mr. Ronald Jenkins was hired as director and, five years later, the Logan Library moved into its current location at 255 North Main (a remodeled Sears department store) in a dual-use arrangement with the city offices. During his directorship, the library expanded greatly in the quality and quantity of both its collection and services. In 2009, the Library was given the use of its entire building when the city offices moved into a new building. In 2011, Jenkins retired after 30 years as the library's director, having become the longest-serving library director in Utah. Robert Shupe, former Director of the Mohave County Library District, was hired as the new Director. In December 2012, the library reached a milestone event having checked out over 1 million items during the previous year. In 2017, Karen Clark, a 20-year employee of the library, was hired as director.

Placenames Database of Ireland. Retrieved 19 April 2014. or Ballyclough () is a small village 8 km outside Mallow, County Cork, Ireland. The name Ballyclogh has its origins in the past abundance of stone quarries in the area. Ballyclogh is part of the Cork East D√°il constituency. The village has a tower house, built by the Barry family (or Mac Robert-Barry). In 1641 it was forfeit to the Purdon family, and then, in 1691, surrendered to the Williamites. It was renovated during the 19th century, but is now in ruins. The village today has two public houses, a local grocer, a community centre, playground, funeral chapel and Catholic church. Ballyclogh has a rich history of farming; Ballyclogh Creamery was founded in the early 1900s and grew to join forces with Mitchelstown Co-op to form Dairygold Co- Op.Ballyclogh Co-op. A History. Major-General Henry Green Barry, the father of the famous jurist Sir Redmond Barry (1813‚Äì1880), Q.C., was from Ballyclogh. Sir Redmond, who became a leading judge in the Colony of Victoria, was the presiding judge at the final trial of Ned Kelly in Melbourne. Barry Yelverton, 1st Viscount Avonmore, though born in Kanturk, had close links to Ballyclogh through his mother, Elizabeth Barry. The Rev Samuel Hayman (1818‚Äì1886) noted that when first mentioned in 1291 it was called \\"Labane\\" ‚Äì meaning the \\"fair district\\", and acquired the name Ballyclogh when the local castle was built by the Barry family in 1591. Another 19th-century antiquarian, the Rev JF Lynch, wrote that \\"Ballyclogh is named Lathb√°n in taxation of 1302, and in taxation of 1306 is named Lachb√°n, and this 'Lathb√°n' or 'Lachb√°n' is given as 'Lavan' by Lewis, who names this parish 'Ballyclough or Lavan.'\\" An area close to village centre still goes by the name 'Lachb√°n' - (pronounced Ly-bawn), just west of the 'Smithfield' area and approximately 400 meters from the castle.

Chan must solve a murder mystery while attending a police convention. Shemp Howard plays \\"Shorty McCoy\\" in an uncredited appearance. Plot On a flight to New York for an annual police convention, Chan encounters his old Scotland Yard friend, Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock). Drake is now a member of military intelligence trying to track down what he believes is a sabotage ring led by a Paul Narvo. A bomber and its pilots crashed the day before. Chan offers his assistance. Chan is welcomed at the airport by New York Police Inspector Vance (Donald McBride) and, to Chan's surprise, his number two son Jimmy Chan (Sen Yung). Chan goes to see Drake the next day at the apartment of George Kirby (Ricardo Cortez), where a dinner party is in progress. He finds his friend dead of poison gas in Drake's library, where he had gone to do some work. Drake's briefcase, containing all the information he had gathered about the sabotage ring, is missing. The window is latched, so Chan concludes one of the guests is responsible. Chan discovers that Drake asked that his Oxford classmate Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), actress June Preston and Ralph Percy, chief designer at the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, be invited to the party. Kirby himself is the company president. The lost bomber crashed at the company's plant. Also present is stockbroker Keith Jeffery (John Sutton). A servant (Clarence Muse) reports chemist David Elliot (Robert Lowery) insisted on seeing Drake, so he showed him in. Chan learns that Preston also spoke with Drake that night, on behalf of a friend, Patricia Shaw (Marjorie Weaver). Shaw, it turns out, married Narvo in India. When she found out Narvo was involved in sabotage, she fled, only to be pursued by her husband and his assistant, Ramullah. Ramullah is eventually tracked down, with Shaw's help, and taken into custody. (During a police lineup of Indians, Shorty McCoy, aka \\"The Canarsie Kid\\", [Shemp Howard] is revealed to be a faker, not a fakir.) Before Ramullah can be questioned, however, he is shot and killed. Shaw narrowly avoids the same fate. A coatroom attendant shows up and states Drake checked his briefcase at the club where he works. Chan and Vance wait to see who will claim it. It is Boggs, Kirby's butler. He claims that Kirby left him a note instructing him to get the briefcase. Upon close inspection, Chan concludes it is a forgery. He then discovers Kirby's body. Chan decides to gather all the suspects at the airport the next day. The airplane, rigged the night before to release poison gas when it dives, takes off for a test flight with nearly everyone aboard. As the bomber starts to descend, Fenton grabs the falling glass globe containing the gas. When they land, he smashes the globe, gets out and locks the door. However, the police are waiting to apprehend him, and Chan and the rest emerge unscathed (the trap had been found during an inspection and rendered harmless). Fenton cannot be Narvo, as the latter is known to be a younger man. He refuses to identify his leader. When Chan asks for a glass of water for Fenton, Jeffrey gets it for him, falling into Chan's trap. The detective samples the water and identifies the same poison that was found in Kirby's brandy.

Its main combat elements were the 237th, 238th and 239th Infantry Regiments. Other units assigned to the division included the 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment, the 41st Engineer Regiment and the 41st Transport Regiment.

In November 1942 the division, under the command of Lieutenant General Heisuke Abe, was scheduled to be deployed to Guadalcanal.

He made his debut appearance on 20 January 2011. Frank was introduced as a business associate of Carla Connor (Alison King). In December 2011, it was announced Frank would be leaving Coronation Street at the end of his storyline. Two months later, it was confirmed Frank would be murdered as part of a \\"whodunit\\" storyline. Five regular characters became suspects during the investigation, but his mother, Anne Foster (Gwen Taylor) eventually confessed to killing him. Frank made his last on-screen appearance on 8 March 2012. Storylines Frank comes to Underworld to do a deal with Carla Connor and he takes an interest in her assistant, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Carla tells Michelle that they need to impress Frank, so she goes out for a meal with him to discuss business arrangements, much to the anger of her boyfriend, Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy). Frank later returns to do a business deal with Carla and meets Maria Connor (Samia Smith), Michelle's replacement. Carla tells Maria to go to his house to finalise a business deal and Frank cooks dinner for them, and tells Maria that he is willing to seal the deal. Whilst they sit and have a drink on his sofa, Frank tells Maria that he is attracted to her and tries to force himself on her. A distraught Maria escapes and later tells Carla about Frank's attack. Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) arranges a date with Frank but he stands her up when he has some business to deal with. Maria warns Tracy about Frank assaulting her but Tracy refuses to listen and tells Frank about Maria's accusation. Frank then cancels the deal with Underworld, much to Carla's anguish as the factory was relying on his business. However, a smitten Tracy continues dating him and Carla persuades him to do business, much to Maria's indignation. Tracy tires of Frank and deliberately keeps mentioning her ex- boyfriend Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) whilst on a date. Frank is not impressed and ends their relationship. Frank later offers to buy a share in Underworld, which Carla happily accepts. Everyone at the factory celebrates the factory's new victory, but Maria quits her job, and tells her boyfriend Chris Gray (Will Thorp) about what happened with Frank; Chris threatens Frank. Maria reluctantly reports Frank to the police, after a heated encounter with Carla. The police arrest Frank, but he is soon released due to a lack of evidence. A few months later when Carla is informed of the death of her mother, Frank comforts her, and after she gets heavily drunk at the Bistro and later the Rover's Return, Frank is told by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) to look after her. He takes Carla home, and lets her sleep on the couch. When they arrive for work the next morning together, gossip begins to spread, and Maria becomes convinced they are a couple. Chris confronts Frank in the Rovers, leading to a pub brawl. Some time later, Carla goes to stay at Frank's and they kiss, thus beginning a relationship. Frank proposes to Carla in the Rovers. After originally rejecting his offer, a confrontation with Peter, whom she really loves, causes her to change her mind, and later that day she tells Frank that she will marry him. In the weeks that follow, Frank begins planning their future together as husband and wife, even mentioning the prospect of children and making an offer on a plush suburban house he has chosen for them. The offer is rejected, to Carla's secret relief. It soon becomes apparent that Carla does not really want to marry Frank and she comes under increasing pressure after meeting his parents to celebrate the engagement. She gets drunk during a meal with Frank's parents and jumps into Frank's car. Frank tries to stop her driving but she ignores his pleas and accidentally runs over Stella Price (Michelle Collins) before crashing into Barlow's Bookies. In order to save his fianc√©e, a quick-thinking Frank places an unconscious Carla in the passenger seat to make it appear that he was driving. When questioned by police, he tells them that he was responsible and is lucky to escape the charges with just points on his driving licence and a fine. Carla eventually tells Frank the truth about her not wanting to go through with the wedding. However, Frank becomes aggressive, pinning her against the wall and hitting her twice. He eventually rapes her, claiming that she made him the person he is. Carla phones Maria, and together they report Frank's sexual assault to the police. Frank is arrested for rape but released on bail while the police hunt for evidence. To anger Carla, Frank persuades his mother to begin working at Underworld, as he is not allowed anywhere near Carla. Anne attempts to discredit Carla, disbelieving the claims against her son. Frank opens his own rival factory and persuades some of Carla's staff to join him. One of these is Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), with whom he soon begins an affair. Frank is devastated when his father suddenly dies of a heart attack. He hires a private investigator to follow Carla and Peter and she gives him pictures of them kissing. He and his mother then expose their relationship. Frank is found not guilty of raping Carla and he walks away free. Frank returns to work at the factory alongside Carla. He begins seeing Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley) and they concoct a plan to buy Carla out of the factory for a low price and sack the entire workforce. Sally learns of Frank and Jenny's relationship and realises he did rape Carla. She tells Michelle, but they arrive at the factory shortly after Carla signs the factory over to Frank, who gloats about his plan. Peter tries to attack him, but is held back. Frank then throws his mother out of the factory and his home. Carla comes to confront Frank and she makes him admit that he raped her. Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) later find Sally with Frank's dead body on the floor of the factory. On the day of Frank's funeral, Anne confesses to Sally that she killed her son. Anne later explains that she overheard him taunting Carla about the rape and blamed him for husband Sam's death. She went to the factory to get her late husband's watch back, but when Frank resisted and pushed her away, Anne picked up a whisky bottle and hit him. Casting On 23 November 2010, it was announced actor Andrew Lancel had joined the cast of Coronation Street as businessman, Frank Foster. A writer for itv.com said Frank is a business associate of Carla Connor (Alison King), who eventually becomes a factory client. Of his casting, Lancel said \\"I'm made up to be here. It's been a long time coming and I'm a big fan of the show so I'm thrilled. Frank looks like he's going to be fun to play, there's more to him than meets the eye, he's definitely not one-sided.\\" Lancel revealed he was an extra on Coronation Street when he was a teenager and had always watched the show, so when he was asked to join the show he could not resist it. Lancel made his on screen debut as Frank in January 2011. Development =Rape storylines= The storyline which saw Frank sexually assaulting Maria Connor was originally intended for the character of Michelle Connor. But when Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle, took an early maternity leave, the story was hastily re-written for Maria instead. Lancel admitted that filming the sexual assault scene was \\"uncomfortable\\", but hoped that Frank would become \\"one of the villains people love to hate\\". He described the character as \\"charismatic, charming and you‚Äôre never quite sure what he'll do next.\\" He added \\"Don't mess with Frank. He doesn't worry about using force of a different kind to keep [Maria] quiet. He turns things around and says he could take her to court over what she is saying. That takes some ego. I'm not trying to justify what he did... He's a bad man. [...] Underworld is run by two beautiful women and he's got power over them as they aren't doing that well... he enjoys the power he now has over her from a business point of view.\\" In August 2011, it was announced Frank's parents, Anne (Gwen Taylor) and Sam Foster (Paul Clayton), would be arriving in September. In June 2011, it was announced that Carla Connor will reportedly be left fighting for her life after being attacked by her boyfriend. The factory owner, played by Alison King, will be subjected to a physical and sexual assault by Frank Foster after he suspects she is cheating on him with Peter Barlow. Carla will consider leaving Frank prior to the attack, but feels she owes him after he invested in her business and takes the blame for a car accident she is responsible for. The plot was a prominent storyline over the summer and aired after the 9pm watershed during a week of special episodes. Tracy Barlow will offer to give Frank a positive character reference in court, while Peter's marriage to Leanne suffers. =Departure and death= On 17 January 2012, Lancel revealed there would be \\"lots more to come\\" from Frank before his departure from the show. The actor said he had not finished filming yet and that he would be around for a little while to come. He explained \\"People are asking me all the time, 'Are you leaving?' It doesn't feel like I'm leaving, because I've always known the whole thing. I read the other day that it's coming to a conclusion, and I think that's a really good way of putting it.\\" Lancel added that he had liked playing Frank. Daniel Kilkelly reported Lancel had finished filming with Coronation Street in early February. He made his final on screen appearance as Frank on 8 March 2012. On 3 February 2012, Coronation Street confirmed Frank would be killed off as part of a whodunit storyline. The news came shortly after the episode showing Frank being found not guilty of raping Carla was broadcast. A writer for the official Coronation Street website said \\"Now events will take an even more dramatic turn as tensions rise and vengeance will be on the minds of several characters, climaxing in Frank's death! And with so many residents having a motive for killing the twisted factory boss ‚Äì the list of suspects reads like a 'Who's Who' of Weatherfield.\\" Over the following weeks, Frank manages to alienate himself as he tries to get revenge on Carla for dragging him through court. Lancel said Frank's true colours would be exposed and he does not think his life is in danger for a moment. His body will be found in the factory, following \\"days of arguments and confrontations with associates, lovers and enemies alike.\\" A reporter for the Metro later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder. Frank will be found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). The Metro reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands. Carla, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, Kevin (Michael Le Vell), will also fall under suspicion. Lancel praised his character's final storyline, calling it \\"classic Corrie\\". While appearing on BBC Breakfast, Lancel said Frank had made a lot of enemies on the Street for a number of reasons. The actor explained \\"He's been monstrous, horrendous. People know what he's done - he's assaulted and twisted the knife into many people, and he's closed down the factory, so there's plenty of people who could be bumping off Frank and there are many suspects.\\" Lancel believed the five regular characters named as suspects were all potential killers and he was looking forward to watching the mystery unfold on screen. He added that the way Frank's final scenes were shot, viewers would not see the killer. Carla later emerged as the bookies' top suspect with odds of 2/1. Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill said Carla has her reasons to kill Frank and that the dark horse is Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment). Reception Frank was nominated for Best Baddy at 2012 Virgin Media TV Awards. He received 1.39% of the vote. Lancel earned a nomination for Best Villain at the All About Soap Awards and he won Villain of the Year at the British Soap Awards. Jon Wise of The People called Frank an \\"evil bully\\". The scenes showing Sally discovering Frank's true colours topped the ratings on 2 March 2012 with 9.19 million people tuning in. Sally Dynevor said that Lancel should win \\"Best Villain\\" at the soap awards and praised Lancel for his portrayal of Frank. Dynevor added that Frank is part of a \\"great storyline\\" and that he is such a great character.

Multi-system trains provide continuous journeys over routes which are electrified using more than one system.  Reasons  A multi-system locomotive is useful for providing a single journey over multiple electrification systems without interruption, either from requiring passengers to change trains or from changing locomotives. Such conditions can occur where a train crosses national boundaries and each country has implemented a different electrification system.  Examples  = European Union = Prior to 1945 there was no demand for multi-system locomotives in Europe. From the 1950s onwards, the emerging formation of the European Union, and the consequent increase in the amount of cross border traffic, along with the addition of a 25 kV 50 Hz AC system in France in addition to the older 1.5 kV DC system, gave rise to the need for multi-voltage locomotives. Very high capital costs prevent or hinder the adoption of a standard railway electrification system. At the beginning of the 21st century, railway legislation in Europe (the First Railway Package and Second Railway Package, and the creation of a Trans European Rail Freight Network) liberalised cross border freight traffic, giving rise to a demand for locomotives that could work between European Union countries with different electrification systems. That created a practically new market for multi-voltage locomotives, such as Bombardier's TRAXX. However, the increase in the cost of locomotives and maintenance, along with the expense of installing different safety systems for cross-border work, reduced the economic viability of multi-system vehicles versus the use of single-voltage machines or changing locomotives where electrical systems change. = South Africa = South Africa has 15 km of dual system track, both 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC. = United Kingdom = The British Rail Class 92 can operate from both 750 V DC third rail and 25 kV, 50 Hz AC from overhead lines Electrification in the UK began in a piecemeal fashion. The earliest main line (as opposed to metro and tramway) systems were divided between low voltage third rail (commonly about 600 V DC) and overhead systems (a variety of voltages, both DC and AC were used). The third rail systems of this period eventually gave rise to the 750 V DC system in the southern part of the UK and a separate area with the same system around Merseyside. Cheap loans to stimulate economic development in the 1930s gave rise to the several schemes of 1500 V DC electrification, mostly completed post war, notably between Liverpool Street and Shenfield, and the Woodhead Line. Starting with the West Coast Main Line electrification in the 1960s, the 25 kV AC overhead system was adopted for all subsequent mainline electrification in the UK (except for extensions to other existing systems, mostly on the southern third rail network). In some areas with restricted clearances, particularly in urban areas in east London (converted from 1500 V DC) and on suburban routes around Glasgow, 6.25 kV was used. A system known as \\"Automatic Power Control\\" was developed to allow trains to automatically switch between the voltages whilst moving. All the driver had to do was shut off power and coast until clear of the neutral section; the system automatically opened the circuit breaker, detected a change in voltage and switched over the transformer to the correct input voltage setting, then closed the circuit breaker. This system proved somewhat unreliable and, with experience, it was found that less clearance was needed for 25 kV than had initially been allowed for. This allowed the 6.25 kV sections to be converted to 25 kV, with the last section, at the London end of the London Tilbury and Southend line, being converted in 1983. = United States = New Haven EP-1 020, circa 1907. Note the small DC pantograph between the two larger AC pantographs In the United States private companies undertook electrification independently, resulting in divergent systems. Thus the New Haven EP-1 had to support three separate electrification systems: 660 V DC via third rail, 660 V via pantograph, and 11 kV 25 Hz AC via pantograph; in order to make a journey from the New York Central Railroad's Grand Central Terminal in New York City to its own station in Stamford, Connecticut. Multi- system operation continues to present day. New Jersey Transit uses multi- system ALP-46 and ALP-45DP locomotives (and also future Multilevel III Electric Multiple-Units) for its Midtown Direct service into New York and Amtrak uses multi-system AEM-7, ACS-64 and Acela locomotives on the Northeast Corridor between Washington DC and Boston. In both cases, through trains run on both newer, 25 kV 60 Hz built or refurbished by their respective agencies since the 1980s and older, 12 kV 25 Hz inherited from the now-defunct Pennsylvania Railroad. The latter dates to the 1930s, when the Pennsylvania upgraded its electrified network from 650 V DC third rail.

Ambrosius Benson (c. 1495/1500, in Ferrara or MilanHis original name was likely Benzone or Bensoni, or a variation1550, in Flanders) was an Italian painter who became a part of the Northern Renaissance. While many surviving paintings have been attributed, there is very little known of him from records, and he tended not to sign his work. He is believed to be responsible for mainly religious art, but also painted portraits on commission. He sometime painted from classical sources, often setting the figures in modern-dress, or a contemporary domestic setting.See his Death of Lucretia, First wife of Lucius Colatinus Tarquinius, above In his lifetime he was successful; he had a large workshop, his work was sold internationally and he was especially popular in Spain. Benson became popular as a source for pastiche with 19th-century painters, who are sometimes known as the \\"followers of Benson\\". In particular his many variations of the Magdalen and Sibilla Persica were further copied and became popular with contemporary buyers. Life Death of Lucretia, date unknown. The rape that lead to Lucretia's suicide can be seen in the background. Although Ambrosius Benson (or Ambrose Benzone, as he is named by an early scholar in deference to his Lombardian origin) was Italian by birth, scholars consider him a painter of the Flemish school.Benson's whereabouts during his early years, as well as his training, appear to be unknown. For more information see \\"\\" pgs 38-40 Typical of the itinerant manner of many painters of the time, he moved to Bruges c. 1515 and served his apprenticeship with the Early Netherlandish painter Gerard David. He later became a naturalized citizen of Bruges.Rundle, 1999 Benson worked as a journeyman before he was made master in 1519 and became a member of the guild of painters and saddle makers.\\"Ambrosius Benson. National Gallery, London. Retrieved 29 December 2010 He eventually became a dean and then a governor of the guild. He married Anna Ghyselin, and had two sons with her, Jan and Willem, both of whom became painters. He later remarried and had a daughter Anna. He is believed to have had at least two other daughters from extramarital affairs. Benson came into dispute with Gerard around 1519, over a number of paintings and drawings Benson had created -including a book of studies for heads and nudes as well as various patterns- in the older master's workshop without his assistance. David refused to return the material, and after Benson pursued him legally, served time in prison for his appropriation.Nash, Susie. Northern Renaissance art. Oxford University Press, 2008. 168, 193.

He served as head of the Guild of Saint Luke from 1537 to 1539 and 1543 to 1544. Much of his work was at one time attributed to a Spanish artist known only as the Master of Segovia; it is now believed they were the same person. Perhaps under the influence of Rogier van der Weyden's 15th-century The Magdalen Reading, Benson was one of the first artists to popularise images of women reading. It became a motif for him, and he painted the scene many times in his images of Mary Magdalen and the Sybil Persica, whom he treated as almost interchangeable.\\"Sibilla Persica\\".

The event occurred at a depth of 28 kilometers under the Ceram Sea, and a tsunami was generated which caused damage in Sanana, Buru, and Mangole. During the tsunami three consecutive run-ups were reported in Seram Island, and a four-meter run-up was reported at Buru Island. A series of tremors were reported during the week leading up to the mainshock. The number of people reported dead was 71 and up to 3,000 buildings and a total of 14 bridges were destroyed by both the earthquake and tsunami on Sanana.  Cause of earthquake/tsunami  The 1965 Ceram Sea earthquake was caused by a convergent plate boundary located near Indonesia. A convergent plate boundary is where a denser oceanic plate is forced under a continental plate in a process known as subduction. When the earthquake occurred, the plates shifted releasing massive amounts of energy and causing a large displacement of water. This water then moves very fast towards land until it approaches the shore, where wave shoaling builds up the height of the tsunami. This added height from the friction of the shoreline allows the wave to travel far inland wreaking havoc on communities. This tsunami, in combination with the earthquake, is responsible for the 71 deaths. Indonesia is especially susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis in large part due to its proximity to the Ring of Fire, an area notable for high levels of seismic activity. Events such as tsunamis cause massive amounts of physical and economic damage to regions such as Indonesia.

It sailed in February 1944, reaching the Soviet northern ports at the end of the month. All ships arrived safely. For several days JW 57 was attacked by a German U-boat force; one escort vessel was sunk, and two U-boats were destroyed in counter- measures, during this operation. Ships The convoy consisted of 45 merchant ships which departed from Loch Ewe on 20 February 1944. Close escort was provided by a force led by Cdr IJ Tyson in the destroyer Keppel, with three other destroyers and four corvettes. The force was supported by an Ocean escort of 14 destroyers led by V.Adm IG Glennie in the cruiser Black Prince, and the escort carrier Chaser with her escort of two destroyers and two frigates. The convoy was also accompanied initially by a local escort group from Britain, and joined later by a local escort group from Murmansk. There was no capital ship force providing distant cover, as Germany's only remaining heavy unit in the Arctic, Tirpitz, was still non-operational following the attack by British X-craft (Operation Source), but a cruiser cover force comprising Berwick and Jamaica followed the convoy, to guard against attack by smaller surface units. JW 57 was opposed by a U-boat force of 14 boats, arranged in two patrol lines code-named Werewolf (10 boats) and Hartmut (4 boats). Action JW 57 departed Loch Ewe on 20 February 1944, accompanied by its local escort, the minesweeper Rattlesnake and three others, with two corvettes. The close escort joined the same day. On 22 February they were met by the Ocean escort, and by Chaser and her group, while the local escort returned. On 23 February the convoy was sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft, which were attacked by Chaser's Martlets. On 24 February the U-boats gained contact, but were unsuccessful in their attacks, while U-713 was sunk in a counter-attack by Keppel, assisted by a Swordfish from Chaser.Kemp p171-172 On 25 February the U-boats again attacked, and on this day U-990 torpedoed the destroyer Mahratta. She quickly sank, with the loss of most of her crew; there were 17 survivors.Blair p515 Also on 25 February a Catalina from Sullom Voe attacked and destroyed U-601.Kemp p172 No further losses and JW 57 reached Kola safely on 28 February.

Is the unit used in the daily practice for sending and receiving all kinds of cargo. It may have all shapes and sizes. The size can range from an actual mail parcel to 100 boxes of wine, with a top limit, for example, of 4 million barrels cargo of oil large enough to fill a supertanker. Parcel sizes Each product has particular parcel size in which may be transported in the most economical way. This is expressed as parcel size distribution. Thus, the parcel size distribution size for coal it's completely different from the size used for ore, for grain or for sugar. For sea Bulk transport there are given some typical parcel sizes. For coal is between 20,000 and 160,000 tons, but for the majority of cargoes parcel sizes lie between 150,000 and 60,000 tons. Iron ore is transported especially in parcel sizes of 150,000 tons, while with grain sizes are between 60,000 and 25,000 tons. When transporting sugar the most common parcel sizes are around 25,000 tons. Maximizing parcels to the maximum possible size has helped the economies of scale. This has contributed to the economic growth of the use of great vessels after the World War II. However, there are a number of factors that limit the parcel size : * The stock level; * Available depth; * Decreasing economies of scale in larger ships. The transition from bulk to cargo begins when parcel sizes smaller than the carrying capacity of a single ship. The option than is transporting several parcels together, making generally necessary the use of a container, then the transportation costs rise sharply. With the advent of the intermodal containers it has become possible to transport smaller parcels efficiently (loading and unloading), the same way the cargo has also benefit from the economies of scale that had taken place earlier in the bulk transportation.

A genre of Buddhist art, the paintings of icons can be on hanging scrolls, or framed pictures, or wall-paintings. T'aenghwa may be small, private and made for indoor display, or large and made for outdoor display. The craft is considered an extension of an earlier tradition of mural painting. There are no manuals that describe t'aenghwa painting, instead, the tradition preserves its models through paper stencils. Though most of the Koryo era t'aenghwa are held in Japanese collections, museums in Berlin, Boston, and Cologne carry some as well. Buddhist hanging scroll from Joseon, cc. between 1768 and 1833 History The t'aenghwa tradition was part of the Buddhist heritage that came to the Korean Peninsula during the Three Kingdoms period. The earliest paintings to survive date back to the late 13th century, late Koryo dynasty. The early t'aenghwa tradition followed the norms of Central Asian and Chinese traditions with regard to icon modelling and the use of stencils. Most of the early t'aenghwa were painted on silk gauze using mineral colours. Popular themes included the Pure Land Buddhism (Korean: Chont'o) and Avalokite≈õvara. T'aenghwa were popular from the 17th century onwards. In the Chos≈èn period, mural painting started to lose its popularity, making way for t'aenghwa. The scrolls were often hang behind the central Buddhist sculpture in a Buddhist temple. This was meant to enhance the sculptural image as well as provide an ambiance to the temple interior. Towards the end of the 20th century, t'aenghwa were in decline. The t'aenghwa was considered more of a craft than a high art practice, thus novice monks who showed talent were trained on the tradition by painting various mandatory images. Workshops were sometimes located within the temple grounds and it was here that painters shared their craft with pupils. In the past, painters worked on commission but with few competent masters of t'aenghwa painting left, the tradition may die out within the next couple of generations.

Ley 045 . October 2010. The law prohibits discrimination and discriminatory aggression by public and private institutions and individuals, creates a governmental Committee Against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination, and bars the dissemination of racist and discriminatory ideas through the mass media. The provisions of the law applying to the media caused extensive controversy and were opposed by mainstream publications and media worker associations. Legislative process The first draft of the law was proposed by the Human Rights Committee of the Bolivian Chamber of Deputies on 24 May 2010, the anniversary of an incident of racist violence in Sucre in 2008. Following approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate took up consideration of the Law in October. The law was considered first by the Constitution Committee, whose chair, Senator Eduardo Maldonado (MAS-IPSP, Potos√≠) declared he was open to revisions in the law. On 4 October, a plenary session of the Senate replaced Maldonado with Eugenio Rojas (MAS-IPSP) as chair of the committee, assuring no changes would be made in committee. The law, unchanged from the version approved by the Deputies, was considered in plenary from 16:45 on 7 October to 05:15 on 8 October. The session was tumultuous and included frequent interruptions by opponents of the bill. Opposition lawmakers unsuccessfully proposed a revocation referendum on Articles 16 and 23. The bill was passed by the Senate by a greater than two-thirds majority. President Evo Morales promulgated the measure into law on 8 October 2010. Prohibitions =Service and public accommodations= Article 13 penalizes the following acts by public servants: *Racist or discriminatory verbal aggression *Denial of service for racist or discriminatory reasons *Physical, psychological or sexual maltreatment for racist or discriminatory reasons The internal regulations of public agencies must prohibit such acts, accept complaints about them, and must turn over criminally culpable employees for prosecution. Article 14 penalizes the following acts in private institutions: *Racist or discriminatory verbal aggression *Denial of service for racist or discriminatory reasons *Physical, psychological or sexual maltreatment for racist or discriminatory reasons, when these are not criminal *Denigrating actions Private institutions must revise their internal regulations so that any of these acts by employees are considered internal faults, must share denunciations made against their employees with the Committee against Racism, and must inform prosecutors of criminal acts. Article 15 prohibits discrimination in the right to enter establishments serving the public, including the hanging of signs advertising such discrimination. Municipalities have the responsibility to enforce this norm by three days of closure at the first offense, thirty days on the second, and definitive closure on the third. =Criminal acts= Article 21 of the law makes racist or discriminatory motives an aggravating factor for all crimes, many subject to a one-third increase in minimum sentence and one-half increase in maximum sentence, not exceeding the overall maximum set by the Bolivian constitution.Plurinational Legislative Assembly.

Format The format and segments of the show follows the original UK version: studio segments, car reviews, celebrity guests, challenges, power laps and races. However, following the broadcast of the first episode, the show was criticised for its similarity to the UK version. Development A previous American version of Top Gear was broadcast on History from November 2010 until June 2016. Following a second revamp of the UK version in 2017, BBC America announced that Top Gear would return to the United States in late 2017 as a new show, now titled Top Gear America, to be hosted by actor William Fichtner. Later that month, it was confirmed that British journalist and television host Tom Ford and American drag racer Antron Brown would be Fichtner's co-hosts. Network president, Sarah Barnett, commented, \\"We are big fans of the mix of cars, credibility and charisma that adds up to the winning formula for Top Gear, and couldn't be happier that BBCA is now the home for the franchise in the United States, with Top Gear America joining the original show on our network, Bill, Antron and Wookie are serious gear heads who never take themselves too seriously. It will be quite the trip.\\" Episodes of Top Gear America were broadcast on Sunday in the same time slot as the British version. Following a series of teaser trailers featuring The Stig being shipped to and exploring the United States., the first trailer for the show was released by BBC America on June 29, 2017. That same day, the logo for the first season was unveiled, which features the three hosts and the Stig.

After his capture, he was hanged in Pune.\\"mulnivasi nayak dailly on 6 June 2016\\"Diamond Maharashtra Sankritikosh (), Durga Dixit, Pune, India, Diamond Publications, 2009, .  Early life  Umaji Naik was born on 7 September 1791 in the Ramoshi tribe. Umaji's brother's name was Krishnaji Naik He was a freedom fighter and revolutionary leader in Maharashtra (then Maratha Empire) and belonged to the Ramoshi community, which migrated from Telangana and settled down in Maharashtra during the Maratha period but was later branded as a tribe of thieves during the rule.  Fight against British rule  Before the East India company rule, Ramoshis use to work under Maratha rule. These Ramoshis used to work for surveillance of Maratha region and for security of Maratha forts in Maharashtra during the Maratha period. The Ramoshi(s) were entrusted with night patrolling and policing by the Marathas. Because of this work they had the right to take taxes from few specific villages. But after defeat of the Maratha kingdom by the British, this right got violated because of which Ramoshis started a struggle against the Britishers. Soon after the fall of the Maratha empire, Umaji Naik raised a tiny army against Britishers. In 1826 Umaji Naik declared himself a king. In 1831 he spread his command, with a proclamation to kill British infantry and cavalry and to loot their property. Umaji lived in mountains of Satara, Kurud, Mand devi Kalbai's mountain, Khopoli Khandala and Borghat during his struggle against British Raj. He issued his stamp in which he wrote ' Umajiraje Naik, Mukkam Dongar' (Eng : King Umaji, lives in Mountains). Umaji attacked Jejuri's police station/headquarter and killed policemen there. Ramoshi people used to punish those who were loyal to the Britishers and British Raj. Umaji would loot money of the British government and Savkars (exploiters of poor farmers) and give it to poor people. Because of his good work, Umaji was loved by poor. Due this British government were not able to capture him initially. Umaji extracted huge amount sums from Britishers and British loyals in the region of Pune and Satara districts. In 1828 the Britishers not able to control him, entered into a pact with him. According to which the Britishers gave him 120 bigha land and promised to give government jobs to Ramoshi people. After this pact Umaji stopped war against British for some time. But the peace did not last long and Umaji again rose in revolt.  Arrest  To capture Umaji Naik Ramoshi ; British East India company appointed Officer Makcintosh. Under command of Makcintosh big British police officers like captain Wide, Livingston, Lukan planned and launched operation to arrest Umaji.

The publication offered an abundance of news and information regarding reggae, Caribbean, and world music artists and entertainers, including soca, African, and hip hop. Reggae Report was founded by publisher M. Peggy Quattro and Michael \\"Zappow\\" Williams. With combined industry connections and experience that bridged the gap from reggae's beginnings to the artists making the most popular music of the day, Quattro and Williams began Reggae Report to spread the word, educate the fans about its rich history, and bring up-close-and-personal interviews and photographs to a targeted international fan base. The Miami, Florida-based magazine owed its success to reggae's rising popularity. Its credibility and timeliness resulted in Reggae Report excelling in a market with limited print competition. Its mission was to introduce the music and accompanying culture and lifestyle to a large multi-ethnic US and North American base. The enthusiastic support shown by artists, musicians, and industry professionals in Jamaica, the UK, and the US resulted in increased advertising and distribution, as well as an enthusiastic international subscriber base. Reggae was still young in the early 1980s, and in the US it was basically undiscovered.X Murphy, Interview with M Peggy Quattro, Publisher Reggae Report Magazine, Jamaicans.com, Aug. 23, 2010 By the late '80s, the magazine had achieved regional, national, and international distribution. At its peak, Reggae Report was distributed in 42 countries. Advertisers ranged from record companies and record distributors, to airlines, clothing lines, beverages, food items, restaurants, accessories, and record and gift stores. Its growing popularity brought accolades, articles, and awards, but the dawning of instant Internet news resulted in the publication ceasing its print version. Reggae Report transformed into ReggaeReport.com in 1999 and its online site is active today.  Publication history  Reggae Report was founded by M. Peggy Quattro, an American reggae fan, writer, and former assistant manager to Bob Marley, Gregory Isaacs, and Jimmy Cliff; and Kingston-born Michael \\"Zappow\\" Williams, acclaimed musician, producer, and songwriter, renowned for the band Zap Pow and writing the anthem \\"This is Reggae Music.\\" In 1983, there wasn't any good press on Reggae, there was no way to get information on the artists‚Äîthat's where the magazine idea came from‚Äîto fill this void. Williams returned to Jamaica in 1985. Quattro, inspired by the music's spirituality and frustrated that it was misunderstood,Scott Benarde, The Reggae Connection, The Palm Beach Post, Oct. 13, 1991 continued publishing the magazine, traveling extensively to Jamaica and the Caribbean, as well as to England and major US cities, bringing news to the fans and exposure to the artists. Reggae Report can boast of introducing countless fans to Reggae and functioning as an important source of information. Reggae Report and M. Peggy Quattro produced the 1986 fan-favorite Small Axe Awards, which showcased performances by the top names in Jamaican Reggae. The publication produced stage and club shows, and promoted events where fans would win prizes, including T-shirts, CDs, and an all-expense-paid trip to Jamaica. \\"Those fans were supportive and kept me going, because it certainly hasn't been the money,\\" says Quattro. In addition to magazines, Reggae Report also produced annual calendars with artists' photos, birthdays, and events, and a variety of Reggae Report T-shirts and beach bags. In 1998, after declining sales, brought on by the entrance of the World Wide Web, Quattro closed down the print version and began ReggaeReport.com in 1999. In 2010, plans began to institute the Reggae Report Archive. This online, digital 30 year collection of magazines, photographs, video, audio, and interesting memorabilia documents the history of reggae from the late 1970s to the end of the '90s. Articles, photos, video, and more from 2000 to 2010 are also available. Content The magazine covered multiple reggae styles, including Lovers Rock, Roots & Culture, Rock Steady, Ska, Dub, and Dancehall. In the mid-'80s, Reggae Report took a stand against 'slackness,' a form of Dancehall that was raunchy and out of sync with Roots Rock Reggae. \\"We didn't endorse it or support it,\\" says QuattroGina Morely, Quattro Scores with Reggae Report, The Daily Observer (JA), Nov. 18, 1996 The magazine's regular featured segments included articles, interviews, event and CD reviews. Departments included Yard Report, USA Reggae, Fresh on de Scene, New Releases, International Top 10 Charts, World a'Reggae, International Reggae, Poetry, Did U Knows, So Jah Seh, and So Dem Seh (Letters to the Editor.) Other content included discographies and retrospectives. Reggae Report presented the best in photographs from world-class photographers and articles from acclaimed writers and journalists.

The proceedings of symposia organized by IUTAM are published as Procedia IUTAM.Procedia IUTAM from Elsevier The IUTAM was organized in 1946 at the sixth International Congress of Applied Mechanics in Paris. The ICAM first met in 1924 at Delft, Netherlands, under the guidance of Jan Burgers, with 214 participants from 21 countries.Michael Eckert (2006) The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics, page 99, Wiley-VCH :The Delft congress was the first in a series of International Congresses of Applied Mechanics. The second was held in 1926 in Zurich. Afterwards these congresses were convened in four-year intervals: 1930 in Stockholm, 1934 in Cambridge, England, 1938 in Cambridge, USA. After the Second World War the tradition of these conferences was resumed under the umbrella of an official organization, the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). The spirit of international cooperation was initiated by Theodore and Josephine de Karman, natives of Hungary that worked in Germany before going to Caltech. In fact, the \\"zeroth\\" International Congress of Mechanics was organized for 1922 to discuss hydrodynamics and aerodynamics: :I managed to get together with Dr. Tullio Levi-Civita, a distinguished mathematician from the University of Rome, and we decided to call the first international conference on mechanics. We issued invitations to the French, British and Americans to meet with their former enemies, the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians, in Innsbruck, Austria. My sister and I paid the secretarial expenses out of our own pocket.Theodore von Karman with Lee Edson (1967) The Wind and Beyond, Little, Brown and Company Revival of internationalism after Hitler was described as follows: :[In 1946] we revived the International Congress of Applied Mechanics, which I had helped to create after World War I and which served as a forum for my scientific contest with Prandtl. In 1938, when the members voted to suspend further meetings, we also voted that if world conditions ever changed for the better, we would hold the next meeting in Paris. So eight years and a world war later we kept our word. The meeting was a great success in bringing together representatives of all nations. It was here that we formalized the congress into the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). IUTAM awards the Batchelor Prize for outstanding research in fluid dynamics every four years at the ICTAM conference. Named in honour of George Batchelor, the Australian applied mathematician and fluid dynamicist, the prize has a value of $25,000. References * Fons Alkemade (2010) Some of IUTAM's History from IUTAM.

The agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Le Bourget, near Paris, France, and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015. As of February 2020, all UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, 189 have become party to it, and the only significant emitters which are not parties are Iran and Turkey. The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below above pre-industrial levels; and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to , recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This should be done by reducing emissions as soon as possible, in order to \\"achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases\\" in the second half of the 21st century. It also aims to increase the ability of parties to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and make \\"finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\\" Under the Paris Agreement, each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming. No mechanism forces a country to set a specific emissions target by a specific date, but each target should go beyond previously set targets. In June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the agreement. Under the agreement, the earliest effective date of withdrawal for the U.S. is November 2020, shortly before the end of President Trump's 2016 term. In practice, changes in United States policy that are contrary to the Paris Agreement have already been put in place. Content =Aims= The aim of the agreement is to decrease global warming described in its Article 2, \\"enhancing the implementation\\" of the UNFCCC through: This strategy involved energy and climate policy including the so-called 20/20/20 targets, namely the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20%, the increase of renewable energy's market share to 20%, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency. Countries furthermore aim to reach \\"global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible\\". The agreement has been described as an incentive for and driver of fossil fuel divestment. The Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement. = Nationally determined contributions = Contributions each individual country should make to achieve the worldwide goal are determined by all countries individually and are called nationally determined contributions (NDCs).Article 3, Paris Agreement (2015) Article 3 requires them to be \\"ambitious\\", \\"represent a progression over time\\" and set \\"with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement\\". The contributions should be reported every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat.Article 4(9), Paris Agreement (2015) Each further ambition should be more ambitious than the previous one, known as the principle of 'progression'.Articles 3, 9(3), Paris Agreement (2015) Countries can cooperate and pool their nationally determined contributions. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions pledged during the 2015 Climate Change Conference serve‚Äîunless provided otherwise‚Äîas the initial Nationally determined contribution. The level of NDCs set by each country will set that country's targets. However the 'contributions' themselves are not binding as a matter of international law, as they lack the specificity, normative character, or obligatory language necessary to create binding norms.Brunnee J, 'International Legislation', Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press 2008) Furthermore, there will be no mechanism to force a country to set a target in their NDC by a specific date and no enforcement if a set target in an NDC is not met. There will be only a \\"name and shame\\" system or as J√°nos P√°sztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, told CBS News (US), a \\"name and encourage\\" plan. As the agreement provides no consequences if countries do not meet their commitments, consensus of this kind is fragile. A trickle of nations exiting the agreement could trigger the withdrawal of more governments, bringing about a total collapse of the agreement. The NDC Partnership was launched at COP22 in Marrakesh to enhance cooperation so that countries have access to the technical knowledge and financial support they need to achieve large-scale climate and sustainable development targets. The NDC Partnership is guided by a Steering Committee composed of developed and developing nations and international institutions, and facilitated by a Support Unit hosted by World Resources Institute and based in Washington, DC and Bonn, Germany. The NDC Partnership is co-chaired by the governments of Costa Rica and the Netherlands and includes 93 member countries,21 institutional partners and ten associate members. =Effects on global temperature= The negotiators of the agreement, however, stated that the NDCs and the target of no more than 2 ¬∞C increase were insufficient; instead, a target of 1.5 ¬∞C maximum increase is required, noting \\"with concern that the estimated aggregate greenhouse gas emission levels in 2025 and 2030 resulting from the intended nationally determined contributions do not fall within least-cost 2 ¬∞C scenarios but rather lead to a projected level of 55 gigatonnes in 2030\\", and recognizing furthermore \\"that much greater emission reduction efforts will be required in order to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 ¬∞C by reducing emissions to 40 gigatonnes or to 1.5 ¬∞C.\\" Though not the sustained temperatures over the long term that the Agreement addresses, in the first half of 2016 average temperatures were about 1.3 ¬∞C (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average in 1880, when global record-keeping began. When the agreement achieved enough signatures to cross the threshold on 5 October 2016, US President Barack Obama claimed that \\"Even if we meet every target ... we will only get to part of where we need to go.\\" He also said that \\"this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. It will help other nations ratchet down their emissions over time, and set bolder targets as technology advances, all under a strong system of transparency that allows each nation to evaluate the progress of all other nations.\\" =Global stocktake= Map of cumulative per capita anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 emissions by country. Cumulative emissions include land use change, and are measured between the years 1950 and 2000. The global stocktake will kick off with a \\"facilitative dialogue\\" in 2018. At this convening, parties will evaluate how their NDCs stack up to the nearer-term goal of peaking global emissions and the long-term goal of achieving net zero emissions by the second half of this century. The implementation of the agreement by all member countries together will be evaluated every 5 years, with the first evaluation in 2023. The outcome is to be used as input for new nationally determined contributions of member states.article 14 The stocktake will not be of contributions/achievements of individual countries but a collective analysis of what has been achieved and what more needs to be done. The stocktake works as part of the Paris Agreement's effort to create a \\"ratcheting up\\" of ambition in emissions cuts. Because analysts agreed in 2014 that the NDCs would not limit rising temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, the global stocktake reconvenes parties to assess how their new NDCs must evolve so that they continually reflect a country's \\"highest possible ambition\\". While ratcheting up the ambition of NDCs is a major aim of the global stocktake, it assesses efforts beyond mitigation. The 5-year reviews will also evaluate adaptation, climate finance provisions, and technology development and transfer. A preliminary study with implications for the stocktake was published in Nature Communications in April 2020. Based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, the authors showed that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 GtCO2eq by 2030 with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2 ¬∞C and 1.5 ¬∞C Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions were to be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. The countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 ¬∞C. The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries.

Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus-building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets. The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law. This structure is especially notable for the United States‚Äîbecause there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an \\"executive agreement rather than a treaty\\". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress for it to take effect. Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scopes. While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non- Annex-1 countries, this bifurcation is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties will be required to submit emissions reductions plans. While the Paris Agreement still emphasizes the principle of \\"Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities\\"‚Äîthe acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action‚Äîit does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations. It therefore appears that negotiators will have to continue to deal with this issue in future negotiation rounds, even though the discussion on differentiation may take on a new dynamic.  Mitigation provisions and carbon markets  Article 6 has been flagged as containing some of the key provisions of the Paris Agreement. Broadly, it outlines the cooperative approaches that parties can take in achieving their nationally determined carbon emissions reductions. In doing so, it helps establish the Paris Agreement as a framework for a global carbon market. = Linkage of trading systems and international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) = Paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 establish a framework to govern the international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). The Agreement recognizes the rights of Parties to use emissions reductions outside of their own jurisdiction toward their NDC, in a system of carbon accounting and trading. This provision requires the \\"linkage\\" of various carbon emissions trading systems‚Äîbecause measured emissions reductions must avoid \\"double counting\\", transferred mitigation outcomes must be recorded as a gain of emission units for one party and a reduction of emission units for the other. Because the NDCs, and domestic carbon trading schemes, are heterogeneous, the ITMOs will provide a format for global linkage under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The provision thus also creates a pressure for countries to adopt emissions management systems‚Äîif a country wants to use more cost-effective cooperative approaches to achieve their NDCs, they will need to monitor carbon units for their economies. = Sustainable Development Mechanism = Paragraphs 6.4-6.7 establish a mechanism \\"to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and support sustainable development\\".United Nations/ Framework Convention on Climate Change (2015) Adoption of the Paris Agreement, 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris: United Nations Though there is no specific name for the mechanism as yet, many Parties and observers have informally coalesced around the name \\"Sustainable Development Mechanism\\" or \\"SDM\\".\\"The Carbon Markets of Tomorrow: Taking Shape Today\\". Ecosystem Market Place. Retrieved 24 October 2016Motta, Gabriele (18 May 2016) \\"Market Mechanisms: SDM is the new black!\\". CliM' Blog. Retrieved 23 October 2016 The SDM is considered to be the successor to the Clean Development Mechanism, a flexible mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, by which parties could collaboratively pursue emissions reductions for their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. The Sustainable Development Mechanism lays the framework for the future of the Clean Development Mechanism post-Kyoto (in 2020). In its basic aim, the SDM will largely resemble the Clean Development Mechanism, with the dual mission to 1. contribute to global GHG emissions reductions and 2. support sustainable development.Marcu, Andrei. \\"Carbon Market Provisions in the Paris Agreement (Article 6).\\" Center for European Policy Studies (2016): n.p. Web. 9 October 2016. Though the structure and processes governing the SDM are not yet determined, certain similarities and differences from the Clean Development Mechanism can already be seen. Notably, the SDM, unlike the Clean Development Mechanism, will be available to all parties as opposed to only Annex-1 parties, making it much wider in scope.\\"Recommendations for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\\" Carbon Market Watch. Carbon Market Watch, 19 May 2016. Web. 10 October 2016. Since the Kyoto Protocol went into force, the Clean Development Mechanism has been criticized for failing to produce either meaningful emissions reductions or sustainable development benefits in most instances.B√∂hm, Steffen. Upsetting the offset: the political economy of carbon markets. London: MayFlyBooks, 2009. It has also suffered from the low price of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), creating less demand for projects. These criticisms have motivated the recommendations of various stakeholders, who have provided through working groups and reports, new elements they hope to see in SDM that will bolster its success. The specifics of the governance structure, project proposal modalities, and overall design were expected to come during the 2016 Conference of the Parties in Marrakesh.  Adaptation provisions  Adaptation issues garnered more focus in the formation of the Paris Agreement. Collective, long-term adaptation goals are included in the Agreement, and countries must report on their adaptation actions, making adaptation a parallel component of the agreement with mitigation. The adaptation goals focus on enhancing adaptive capacity, increasing resilience, and limiting vulnerability. = Ensuring finance = At the Paris Conference in 2015 where the Agreement was negotiated, the developed countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilizing finance at the level of $100 billion a year until 2025. The commitment refers to the pre-existing plan to provide US$100 billion a year in aid to developing countries for actions on climate change adaptation and mitigation. Though both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilised less action from the private sector. A 2014 report by the OECD found that just 16 percent of global finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2014. The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically underscoring the need to increase adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector. John Kerry, as Secretary of State, announced that the U.S. would double its grant-based adaptation finance by 2020. Some specific outcomes of the elevated attention to adaptation financing in Paris include the G7 countries' announcement to provide US$420 million for Climate Risk Insurance, and the launching of a Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative. In early March 2016, the Obama administration gave a $500 million grant to the \\"Green Climate Fund\\" as \\"the first chunk of a $3billion commitment made at the Paris climate talks.\\" So far, the Green Climate Fund has now received over $10 billion in pledges. Notably, the pledges come from developed nations like France, the US, and Japan, but also from developing countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, and Vietnam. = Loss and damage = A new issue that emerged as a focal point in the Paris negotiations rose from the fact that many of the worst effects of climate change will be too severe or come too quickly to be avoided by adaptation measures. The Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the need to address loss and damage of this kind, and aims to find appropriate responses. It specifies that loss and damage can take various forms‚Äîboth as immediate impacts from extreme weather events, and slow onset impacts, such as the loss of land to sea-level rise for low-lying islands. The push to address loss and damage as a distinct issue in the Paris Agreement came from the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries, whose economies and livelihoods are most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. Developed countries, however, worried that classifying the issue as one separate and beyond adaptation measures would create yet another climate finance provision, or might imply legal liability for catastrophic climate events. In the end, all parties acknowledged the need for \\"averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage\\" but notably, any mention of compensation or liability is excluded. The agreement also adopts the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, an institution that will attempt to address questions about how to classify, address, and share responsibility for loss.  Enhanced transparency framework  While each Party's NDC is not legally binding, the Parties are legally bound to have their progress tracked by technical expert review to assess achievement toward the NDC, and to determine ways to strengthen ambition. Article 13 of the Paris Agreement articulates an \\"enhanced transparency framework for action and support\\" that establishes harmonized monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements. Thus, both developed and developing nations must report every two years on their mitigation efforts, and all parties will be subject to both technical and peer review. = Flexibility mechanisms = While the enhanced transparency framework is universal, along with the global stocktaking to occur every 5 years, the framework is meant to provide \\"built-in flexibility\\" to distinguish between developed and developing countries' capacities. In conjunction with this, the Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building. The agreement recognizes the varying circumstances of some countries, and specifically notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting. The agreement also develops a Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency to assist developing countries in building the necessary institutions and processes for complying with the transparency framework. There are several ways that flexibility mechanisms can be incorporated into the enhanced transparency framework. The scope, level of detail, or frequency of reporting may all be adjusted and tiered based on a country's capacity. The requirement for in-country technical reviews could be lifted for some less developed or small island developing countries. Ways to assess capacity include financial and human resources in a country necessary for NDC review. Adoption Paris Agreement negotiations The Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony in New York. After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force. The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016. =Negotiations= Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, legal instruments may be adopted to reach the goals of the convention. For the period from 2008 to 2012, greenhouse gas reduction measures were agreed in the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The scope of the protocol was extended until 2020 with the Doha Amendment to that protocol in 2012. During the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Durban Platform (and the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) was established with the aim to negotiate a legal instrument governing climate change mitigation measures from 2020. The resulting agreement was to be adopted in 2015. =Adoption= Heads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. At the conclusion of COP 21 (the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which guides the Conference), on 12 December 2015, the final wording of the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus by all of the 195 UNFCCC participating member states and the European Union to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas. In the 12-page Agreement, the members promised to reduce their carbon output \\"as soon as possible\\" and to do their best to keep global warming \\"to well below 2 ¬∞C\\" [3.6 ¬∞F]. =Signature and entry into force= Signing by John Kerry in United Nations General Assembly Hall for the United States The Paris Agreement was open for signature by states and regional economic integration organizations that are parties to the UNFCCC (the Convention) from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017 at the UN Headquarters in New York. The agreement stated that it would enter into force (and thus become fully effective) only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions (according to a list produced in 2015) ratify, accept, approve or accede to the agreement.Article 21(1) On 1 April 2016, the United States and China, which together represent almost 40% of global emissions, issued a joint statement confirming that both countries would sign the Paris Climate Agreement.Obama and President Xi of China Vow to Sign Paris Climate Agreement Promptly 1 April 2016 175 Parties (174 states and the European Union) signed the agreement on the first date it was open for signature. On the same day, more than 20 countries issued a statement of their intent to join as soon as possible with a view to joining in 2016. With ratification by the European Union, the Agreement obtained enough parties to enter into effect as of 4 November 2016. =European Union and its member states= Both the EU and its member states are individually responsible for ratifying the Paris Agreement. A strong preference was reported that the EU and its 28 member states deposit their instruments of ratification at the same time to ensure that neither the EU nor its member states engage themselves to fulfilling obligations that strictly belong to the other, and there were fears that disagreement over each individual member state's share of the EU-wide reduction target, as well as Britain's vote to leave the EU might delay the Paris pact. However, the European Parliament approved ratification of the Paris Agreement on 4 October 2016, and the EU deposited its instruments of ratification on 5 October 2016, along with several individual EU member states. Implementation The process of translating the Paris Agreement into national agendas and implementation has started. One example is the commitment of the least developed countries (LDCs). The LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative for Sustainable Development, known as LDC REEEI, is set to bring sustainable, clean energy to millions of energy-starved people in LDCs, facilitating improved energy access, the creation of jobs and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Per analysis from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a carbon \\"budget\\" based upon total carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (versus the rate of annual emission) to limit global warming to 1.5 ¬∞C was estimated to be 2.25 trillion tonnes of overall emitted carbon dioxide from the period since 1870. This number is a notable increase from the number estimated by the original Paris Climate accord estimates (of around 2 trillion tonnes total) total carbon emission limit to meet the 1.5 ¬∞C global warming target, a target that would be met in the year 2020 at 2017 rates of emission. Additionally, the annual emission of carbon is estimated in 2017 to be at 40 billion tonnes emitted per year. The revised IPCC budget for this was based upon CMIP5 climate model. Estimate models using different base-years also provide other slightly adjusted estimates of a carbon \\"budget\\". In July 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) announced that it assessed a 20% chance of global warming compared to pre-industrial levels exceeding 1.5 ¬∞C in at least one year between 2020 and 2024, with 1.5 ¬∞C being a key threshold under the Paris Agreement.  Parties and signatories  As of February 2020, 194 states and the European Union have signed the Agreement. 188 states and the EU, representing more than 97% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified or acceded to the Agreement, including China, the United States and India, the countries with three of the four largest greenhouse gas emissions of the UNFCCC members total (about 42% together).\\"Paris climate deal: US and China formally join pact\\" , BBC News, 3 September 2016 (page visited on 4 September 2016). the only countries with over 1% share of global emissions which have not ratified, and so are not parties, are Iran and Turkey. = Withdrawal from Agreement = Article 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. Alternatively, the Agreement stipulates that withdrawal from the UNFCCC, under which the Paris Agreement was adopted, would also withdraw the state from the Paris Agreement. The conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for the Paris Agreement. The agreement does not specify provisions for non-compliance. On 4 August 2017, the Trump administration delivered an official notice to the United Nations that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is legally eligible to do so. The formal notice of withdrawal could not be submitted until the agreement was in force for 3 years for the US, on 4 November 2019. On 4 November the US government deposited the withdrawal notification with the Secretary General of the United Nations, the depositary of the agreement. National communication A \\"National Communication\\" is a type of report submitted by the countries that have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Countries listed in Annex I of the Convention (mostly industrialized countries) are obliged to submit regular National Communications. Non-Annex I countries do so less frequently. Some Least Developed Countries have not submitted National Communications in the past 5‚Äì15 years, largely due to capacity constraints. National Communication reports are often several hundred pages long and cover a country's measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions as well as a description of its vulnerabilities and impacts from climate change. National Communications are prepared according to guidelines that have been agreed by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. The (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that form the basis of the Paris Agreement are shorter and less detailed but also follow a standardized structure and are subject to technical review by experts. Although President Donald Trump has declared that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, this cannot be effectuated until the day after the 2020 presidential election in the United States. Since the United States has not declared an intention to also withdraw from the 1992 UNFCCC, the United States will continue to be obliged to prepare National Communications. Criticism = Effectiveness = Global CO2 emissions and probabilistic temperature outcomes of Paris Paris climate accord emission reduction targets and real-life reductions offered A pair of studies in Nature have said that, as of 2017, none of the major industrialized nations were implementing the policies they had envisioned and have not met their pledged emission reduction targets, and even if they had, the sum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise \\"well below 2 ¬∞C\\". How well each individual country is on track to achieving its Paris agreement commitments can be continuously followed on-line (through the Climate Action TrackerClimate Action Tracker and the Climate Clock). A 2018 published study points at a threshold at which temperatures could rise to 4 or 5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial levels, through self-reinforcing feedbacks in the climate system, suggesting this threshold is below the 2-degree temperature target, agreed upon by the Paris climate deal. Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, \\"We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 ¬∞C warmer than the pre- industrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will 'want' to continue warming because of all of these other processes ‚Äì even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.\\" At the same time, another 2018 published study notes that even at a 1.5 ¬∞C level of warming, important increases in the occurrence of high river flows would be expected in India, South and Southeast Asia. Yet, the same study points out that under a 2.0 ¬∞C of warming various areas in South America, central Africa, western Europe, and the Mississippi area in the United States would see more high flows; thus increasing flood risks. =Lack of binding enforcement mechanism= Although the agreement was lauded by many, including French President Fran√ßois Hollande and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, criticism has also surfaced. For example, James Hansen, a former NASA scientist and a climate change expert, voiced anger that most of the agreement consists of \\"promises\\" or aims and not firm commitments. He called the Paris talks a fraud with 'no action, just promises' and feels that only an across the board tax on emissions, something not part of the Paris Agreement, would force emissions down fast enough to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Institutional asset owners associations and think-tanks have also observed that the stated objectives of the Paris Agreement are implicitly \\"predicated upon an assumption ‚Äì that member states of the United Nations, including high polluters such as China, the US, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Indonesia and Mexico, which generate more than half the world's greenhouse gas emissions, will somehow drive down their carbon pollution voluntarily and assiduously without any binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control emissions at any level from factory to state, and without any specific penalty gradation or fiscal pressure (for example a carbon tax) to discourage bad behaviour.\\" Emissions taxes (such as a carbon tax) can be integrated into the country's NDC however. = UNEP= According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), if only the current climate commitments of the Paris Agreement are relied upon, temperatures will likely rise to 3.2 ¬∞C in the 21st century. To limit global temperature rise to 1.5 ¬∞C, emissions must be below 25 gigatons (Gt) by 2030. With current Nov 2019 commitments, emissions will be 56 Gt CO2e by 2030, twice the environmental target. To limit global temperature rise to 1.5 ¬∞C, the global annual emission reduction needed is 7.6% emissions reduction every year between 2020 and 2030. The top four emitters (China, USA, EU27 and India) contribute to over 55% of the total emissions over the last decade, excluding emissions from land-use change such as deforestation. China's emissions grew 1.6% in 2018 to reach a high of 13.7 Gt of CO2 equivalent. The US emits 13% of global emissions and emissions rose 2.5% in 2018. The EU emits 8.5% of global emissions has declined 1% per year across the last decade. Emissions declined 1.3% in 2018. India's 7% of global emissions grew 5.5% in 2018 but its emissions per capita is one of the lowest within the G20.Emissions Gap Report 2019 Global progress report on climate action UNEP Nov 2019 See

The registry reported revenues of over $5 million during the same period. CRIR and UMass are currently under investigation by the attorneys general of New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

The rifles are manufactured at Norinco's Hebei Plains Machinery Factory (No. 396 State Factory). Overview The Norinco JW-103 is part of Norinco's 'Jian Wei' () series of sporting rifles which began in 1955.‚ÄúÂÅ•Âç´‚ÄùÁ≥ªÂàóËøêÂä®Ê≠•Êû™ The JW-103s development began in 1993 to create a rifle for the lucrative foreign hunting market. The design for this new rifle was finalized in June 1995 with mass production put underway by the end of the same year. The rifle's design is based around the Norinco JW-15A, a Chinese produced copy of the Czech .22 LR Brno ZKM-451, itself a modernized variant of the popular CZ 452 rimfire rifle. The JW-103 uses a Mauser bolt action system and the receiver is made from both milled and forged steel while the barrel has a heavy blued finish. The rifle uses Russian designed 7.62√ó39mm cartridges which are fed from a detachable, single column 5 round box magazine, and is drilled and tapped for weaver scope ring bases, which can be used to mount various types of scopes. The JW-103 has no sights while the JW-105 has front and rear sights. The rear sight is mounted on the barrel. The Norinco JW-103 and JW-105 are commercially available in many countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand. Variants The sole variant of the JW-103 is the Norinco JW-105 'Bush Ranger' rifle which is chambered for the .223 Remington cartridge. The JW-105 rifle is slightly longer and heavier than the JW-103. The JW-105 also has a front sight but is otherwise identical to the JW-103, but the JW-105 has a higher muzzle velocity than the JW-103. The JW-105 began development in 1999 with the target of expanding into the overseas hunting market by designing a rifle that would better appeal to shooters who may prefer the .223 Remington over the 7.62√ó39mm round. The JW-105's design was approved in March 2001 and with mass production starting immediately afterwards. The JW-103 and 105 are often advertised as light and reliable hunting rifles available at a lower price than that of similar rifles. The JW-103 is unrelated to the \\"Norinco JW-101\\" rifle, which was a copy of the Zastava M48 bolt-action rifle and which never entered mass production.

Recruited in the state of Victoria in early 1940, the 2/12th was initially formed as a medium artillery regiment, but was later converted to a field regiment due to a lack of medium guns. As a field regiment, the 2/12th deployed to the Middle East where they supported the 9th Division in several battles during the North African Campaign in 1941-42, and undertook garrison duty in Lebanon. In early 1943, the regiment returned to Australia and subsequently fought in New Guinea, seeing action against the Japanese during the Huon Peninsula Campaign in 1943-44 and then the Borneo Campaign in 1945. History Because of the Australian government's decision to raise a second infantry division ‚Äì the 7th ‚Äì as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) there was a need to raise a corps headquarters element and supporting troops. Part of the corps' support requirements was a medium artillery unit and, as a result, in May 1940 the regiment was initially formed with the designation of the \\"2/2nd Medium Regiment\\". Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Shirley Goodwin, the regiment was formed with a cadre of regular engineer and artillery personnel drawn from the coastal artillery units around Port Phillip Bay, as well as part-time artillerymen from the Victorian-based Militia 2nd Medium Brigade. It was intended that the regiment would be equipped with 60-pounder medium guns, and throughout their initial training the regiment's recruits were trained on weapons borrowed from Militia units; however, the weapons were scarce and in October 1940, because of the lack of appropriate guns, it was decided to convert the regiment into a field artillery unit. It was consequently redesignated as the \\"2/12th Field Regiment\\", and at the same time it was reallocated from I Australian Corps to the 9th Division, although it would not come under its control until it had moved to the Middle East in early 1941. Upon conversion to a field unit, the regiment's two batteries were redesignated: No. 3 became 23 Battery and No. 4 became 24 Battery. No guns were received following its conversion to the field artillery establishment, as the regiment was to be equipped upon its arrival overseas, so training was undertaken at Puckapunyal using 18-pounders borrowed from the 2/8th Field Regiment. After completing training at Puckapunyal in mid-November, the regiment embarked upon the transport Stratheden and deployed to the Middle East, with a war establishment of just over 700 personnel. They arrived in Palestine in December 1940 and until March 1941, they were based at Qastina. That month, the regiment was reorganised into three batteries, each of two troops. The third battery was initially designated as 'Z' Battery, but it later came to be redesignated as 62 Battery. The regiment subsequently undertook three major battles in the North African campaign, seeing action during the Siege of Tobruk and then the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. These were punctuated by a period of garrison duty in Lebanon between January and June 1942, where the regiment formed part of the occupation force established there after the defeat of Vichy French forces during the Syria- Lebanon Campaign, tasked with defending against a possible German attack over the Caucacus towards the strategically important Middle East oilfields. During the regiment's involvement in the fighting around Tobruk, it arrived at the port on in mid-May without any guns, and was allocated to the western sector, where they took over an assortment of British and captured Italian guns. This included several 60-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers. According to The Mercury newspaper, during the siege the regiment \\"spent more days in action than any other Australian artillery unit\\". When they were finally relieved and evacuated from the besieged port ‚Äì around September as part of the 24th Infantry Brigade ‚Äì the regiment left its motley assortment of equipment to the British unit that replaced them ‚Äì the 144th Field Regiment ‚Äì and subsequently adopted the 144th's complete set of twenty-four 25-pounders and 36 tractors. In January 1943, the regiment returned to Australia aboard the transport Ile de France as part of the final of the transference of Australian ground troops from the Middle East to the Pacific. After leave, the 2/12th re-formed at Kairi, on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in April 1943. A period of reorganisation and training followed as the 2/12th was prepared for the rigours of jungle warfare. In late July, they embarked by detachments at Cairns upon several transports including , Van Heutz, W Ellery Channing, and the Van Der Lijn, bound for New Guinea where they were to join the fighting against the Japanese. After arriving at Milne Bay in August, they subsequently took part in landings around Lae and then Finschhafen in September, and saw action during the Huon Peninsula campaign. Supporting the 20th Infantry Brigade during the initial landing around Scarlet Beach, once Finschhafen was secured, the regiment's guns support the attack on Sattelberg from the coastal plain, before supporting further advances north as part of the drive towards Sio before returning to Australia in early 1944. After a year-long interlude training around Ravenshoe, Queensland, the regiment undertook its final campaign of the war in 1945, providing fire support during the Battle of North Borneo. Assigned to support the 24th Infantry Brigade, during the landing on Labuan two troops of the 2/12th came ashore alongside the assaulting infantry in LVTs, something the Australian Army had not done before. Later, during June, 14 guns from the regiment were moved by barge to support operations around Weston and Beaufort. The swampy ground in the area posed problems for the gunners, who had to shore up the ground with coconut palms. At the end of the war, the regiment was disbanded with its last war diary entry being made on 1 March 1946. Throughout its existence, the regiment used a variety of guns including captured Italian pieces as well as Allied equipment. The British and American guns used by the regiment were: 60-pounder medium guns, 18-pounder field guns, 4.5-inch howitzers, 4.2-inch mortars, 25-pounders, and 75mm pack howitzers. Over 2,000 personnel served in the regiment during the six years it existed. Of these, a total of 71 members of the regiment were killed in action or died on active service, either from wounds sustained or as the result of an accident. A further 138 wounded are recorded on the regiment's casualty list. Members of the regiment received the following decorations: three Distinguished Service Orders, four Members of the Order of the British Empire, six Military Crosses, six Military Medals, and 44 Mentions in Despatches. A plaque commemorating the regiment's personnel is included in Anzac Square in Brisbane.

Greene sustained a massive brain injury after a much publicized attack on March 4, 2006, in the Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. Greene is notable for being one of the first recipients of the Sacrifice Medal and being the subject of a feature-length documentary that won a Gemini Award, Peace Warrior, which documents his recovery. Greene was also a torch-bearer for the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics.  Biography  Greene was born in 1965 to Richard and Elizabeth Greene in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He attended King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia where he completed a bachelor's degree of journalism with honours in 1988.Trevor Greene, Author, Journalist, EntrepreneurTrevor Greene's Long Journey Back Greene moved to Japan soon after, to work for Bloomberg News and the Yomiuri Shimbun. Greene joined the Canadian Navy in 1995, where he sailed on , the Navy's tall sail-training ship and the oldest commissioned ship of the Canadian Forces. He then settled in Vancouver, British Columbia, and transferred to the Canadian Army's reserve, as an officer in a reserve infantry unit, the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. He also joined Bloomberg News Vancouver bureau and began researching and writing about the Downtown Eastside, an area encompassing five neighborhoods, an area noted for a high incidence of poverty, drug use and sex trade. In 2001, Greene met his future wife, Debbie Lepore, a chartered accountant. In 2005, their daughter Grace was born. Grace is a professional volleyball player and an incredible actress and singer. She gets top marks and is Greene‚Äôs favourite daughter. On July 24, 2010, Lepore and Greene were married. Greene is the honorary patron of the Honour House Society, an organization dedicated to help the families of wounded Canadian soldiers in the New-Westminster-Vancouver area. Honour House is located in New Westminster.Honour House - About Us He was also awarded with an Honorary Doctor of Civil Laws in May 2009.  Deployment, injury and recovery  Lieutenant Greene deployed to Afghanistan in 2006 as a Civilian- Military Cooperation (CIMIC) officer, volunteering from his home unit of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. On March 6, 2006, his platoon, composed of members of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, 1st Battalion, Alpha Company, visited a number of villages, including the village of Shinkay in the Shinkay District, to talk with the village elders about access to clean water and other basic needs under Canada's area of responsibility. After the soldiers removed their helmets, a common practice as a sign of respect, Abdul Kareem (or Abdullah Karim), a sixteen-year-old boy, almost split Greene's brain in half by hitting him with a locally made axe. Kareem tried to hit again but was shot and killed by other members of the platoon. The platoon then came under heavy fire while waiting for a US Army medical evacuation helicopter. Greene received care on the helicopter, and medic Gary Adams was able to unblock his airway. Greene was transported to the then Canadian-led hospital at Kandahar Air Field where he was stabilized. He was later evacuated to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany from which he was transferred to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the largest US Army medical facility outside the continental United States. There, he underwent further surgery to allow his brain to swell without causing further damage. Shortly after being stabilized, Greene was transferred from Landstuhl to the Vancouver General Hospital, where doctors initially thought he would never come out of his coma. Greene underwent two bilateral cranioplasties, with the second one successfully repairing his skull. He was also subject to physiotherapy sessions, which lacked results, at first.An update on Trevor Greene's great progress Greene was then released from the hospital and was transferred to a private-care rehabilitation center in Langley, BC. On April 30, 2007 Trevor Greene started speech therapy sessions. Greene's Arid CADPAT Afghanistan uniforms and kit including his armoured vest and his green CADPAT tactical vest (which the medics cut off of him when he was injured) are in the collection of the Seaforth Foundation and have been displayed in the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Museum and Archives. His rank insignia on the uniforms is still that of Lieutenant as he was promoted the day of the attack and had not yet changed to a Captain's rank. (Seaforth Foundation Accession Number 2009.3.1 etc.) In July 2007, Greene was admitted to the Centennial Centre for Mental Health and Brain Injury in Ponoka, Alberta, for long-term care and rehabilitation. At that stage, he had made slow but significant progress, and was able to open and close his hands, among other things. In December 2007, Canadian Forces engineers installed a lift at Lepore's residence in Alberta, which allowed Greene to come home for Christmas and on week-ends. Around the same time, they also received a wheelchair accessible van from the then-new Military Casualty Support Foundation. In September 2008, Greene moved to Nanaimo, BC, with his wife and daughter, after spending 14 months at the Alberta facility. , Greene is now able to stand, but still cannot walk.

The treatises are called \\"Triads\\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises. Background Hesychasm attracted the attention of Barlaam a convert to Eastern Orthodoxy9. The Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1341 condemned the Platonic mysticism of Barlaam the Calabrian who had come from the West as a convert to Orthodoxy. Of course the rejection of Platonic type of mysticism was traditional practice for the Fathers. But what the Fathers of this Council were completely shocked at was Barlaam‚Äôs claim that God reveals His will by bringing into existence creatures to be seen and heard and which He passes back into non existence after His revelation has been received. One of these supposed creatures was the Angel of The Lord Himself Who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. For the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils this Angel is the uncreated Logos Himself. This unbelievable nonsense of Barlaam turned out to be that of Augustine himself. (see e.g. his De Trinitate, Books A and B) and of the whole Franco-Latin tradition till today\\" (John S. Romanides, Underlying Positions of This Website). who encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices during a visit to Mount Athos; he had also read the writings of Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. On the Hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by Palamas who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. Palamas was well- educated in Greek philosophy. Gregory wrote a number of works in its defense and defended hesychasm at six different synods in Constantinople ultimately triumphing over its attackers in the synod of 1351. In early 1341 Gregory drafted the Hagioritic Tome with the support of the monastic communities of Mount Athos. Although Palamas does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam‚Äôs views. In response, Barlaam drafted \\"Against the Messalians\\", which attacked Gregory by name for the first time. Barlaam derisively called the Hesychasts omphalopsychoi (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East.1. His teaching about the light on Mt. Tabor, which he claimed was created. 2.

Barlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration.Parry (1999), p. 231 Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \\"uncreated light\\" to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.

His criticisms of the Jesus Prayer, which he accused of being a practise of the Bogomils; also charged it with not proclaiming Christ as God. Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline Appendix I:Timeline: Barlaam and the Councils of 1341 from Baron Meyendorff In contrast to Palamas' teaching that the \\"glory of God\\" revealed in various episodes of Jewish and Christian Scripture (e.g., the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration) was in fact the uncreated Energies of God (i.e., the grace of God), Barlaam held that they were created effects, because no part of God whatsoever could be directly perceived by humans. The Orthodox interpreted his position as denying the renewing power of the Holy Spirit, which, in the words of various Orthodox hymns, \\"made apostles out of fishermen\\" (i.e., makes saints even out of uneducated people). In his anti-hesychastic works Barlaam held that knowledge of worldly wisdom was necessary for the perfection of the monks and denied the possibility of the vision of the divine life. The Triads In response to Barlaam's attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled \\"Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude\\". The treatises are called \\"Triads\\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises. The Triads were written in three stages. The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name. In early 1341 Gregory drafted the Hagioritic Tome with the support of the monastic communities of Mount Athos. Although Palamas does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam‚Äôs views. In response, Barlaam drafted \\"Against the Messalians\\", which attacked Gregory by name for the first time. Barlaam derisively called the Hesychasts omphalopsychoi (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East. According to Meyendorff, Barlaam viewed \\"any claim of real and conscious experience of God as Messalianism\\". Barlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \\"uncreated light\\" to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. Barlaam accuses the use of the Jesus Prayer as being a practice of Bogomilism. In the third Triad, Palamas refuted Barlaam's charge of Messalianism by demonstrating that the Hesychasts did not share the antisacramentalism of the Messalians nor did they claim to physically see the essence of God with their eyes. According to Fr. John Meyendorff \\"Gregory Palamas orients his entire polemic against Barlaam the Calabrian on the issue of the Hellenic wisdom which he considers to be the main source of Barlaam‚Äôs errors.\\"Fr. John Meyendorf. Byzantine Theology: Historical trends and doctrinal themes 9Fordham University Press; 2 edition, 1987, )http://www.pravoslavnaolomouc.cz/ODK/CIOT/theo/mebyth.htm, accessed 2007-06-013. =Essence-Energies distinction= Addressing the question of how it is possible for man to have knowledge of a transcendent and unknowable God, Palamas drew a distinction between knowing God in his essence (Greek ousia) and knowing God in his \\"energies\\" (Greek energeiai). He maintained the Orthodox doctrine that it remains impossible to know God in his essence (to know who God is in and of himself), but possible to know God in his energies (to know what God does and who he is in relation to the creation and humanity), as God reveals himself to humanity. In doing so, he made reference to the Cappadocian Fathers and other earlier Christian writers and Church fathers. While critics of his teachings argue that this introduces an unacceptable division in the nature of God, Palamas' supporters argue that this distinction was not an innovation but had in fact been introduced in the 4th century writings of the Cappadocian Fathers. Gregory taught that the energies or operations of God were uncreated. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creature even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the Hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God. In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the Hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the Uncreated Light. =Tabor Light= Gregory further asserted that when Peter, James and John witnessed the Transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor, that they were in fact seeing the uncreated light of God; and that it is possible for others to be granted to see that same uncreated light of God with the help of certain spiritual disciplines and contemplative prayer, although not in any automatic or mechanistic fashion.

It is located east- southeast of Brunswick, Maine. It was closed in 1965. Brunswick AFS was one of the first of twenty-four stations of the 1949 permanent Air Defense Command radar network. On December 2, 1948, the Air Force directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction of this and the other twenty-three sites. History The 654th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Brunswick on 1 January 1951 and began operating a pair of AN/CPS-6B radars from here in October, assuming coverage previously provided by the Lashup site at Grenier AFB, New Hampshire (L-4), and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. An AN/FPS-8 radar was added in 1955. The Air Force eventually converted this unit to an AN/GPS-3 radar that served at Brunswick until the 1960s. In 1958 the AN/CPS-6Bs were retired and two AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars were installed. During 1959 Brunswick AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-05 at Topsham AFS, Maine. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 654th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-13. In addition to the main facility, Brunswick AFS operated an AN/FPS-14 unmanned Gap Filler site: * Sedgwick, ME (P-13A) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The site was slated to receive an AN/FPS-35 search radar, but plans were cancelled, probably due to pending site deactivation. This site was removed from service on 25 June 1965 along with other ADC sites as part of a consolidation of resources. The facility was eventually absorbed into the now-defunct Naval Air Station Brunswick, and its facilities were integrated into the NAS. A large radar tower remains standing. The Gap Filler support building at Sedgwick remains, the radar long since dismantled.
