Self-cultivation is the cultivation, integration and coordination of mind and body. It is associated with attempts to go beyond normal states of being, and enhancing and endless polishing of a person's capacities and potentials. Self-cultivation is a psychological process that belongs to the Confucian philosophy system, which refers to the action and effort of keeping the balance between inner and outer selves, and between self and others. Self-cultivation (xi≈´ y«éng \\"‰øÆÂÖª\\") in Chinese is an abbreviation of xi≈´-xƒ´n y«éng-x√¨ng (\\"‰øÆÂøÉÂÖªÊÄß\\"), which literally translates to \\"rectifying one‚Äôs mind and nurturing one‚Äôs character (with a particular art or philosophy)\\". Although this term applies to cultural traditions in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, the goals of self-cultivation and the state that each person should aspire to are completely different.  History and origin  Confucianism is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life. It developed from the teachings of Confucius (551-479 BCE), a Chinese philosopher, and what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought. Confucianism embodies metaphysics of self. It develops a complex model of self-cultivation (xi≈´ y«éng \\"‰øÆÂÖª\\"). The cohering key concept is 'intellectual intuition', which is explained as a direct cognition of knowledge, or an insight of reality, with no inference or logical reasoning. Confucianism combines both the outer and inner self in terms of spiritual cultivation, which is world redemption and vindication, as well as self- cultivation. Self-cultivation is a traditional Chinese philosophical concept that forms a fundamental level of understanding of Confucianism. This philosophy aims to achieve a harmonious society and it is dependent on personal moral cultivation. The process entails the pursuit of moral perfection and knowledge. Self-cultivation also alludes to philosophical models in Buddhism and Taoism, and is an essential component of well- established East-Asian ethical values.  Theoretical background  = Confucian self-cultivation as a psychological process = In the Analects that Confucius is depicted to transmit instead of innovate, there are two types of persons. One is the \\"profound person\\" (j≈´n z«ê ÂêõÂ≠ê), and the other is \\"person with vile character\\" (xi«éo r√©n Â∞è‰∫∫). These two types are opposed to one another in terms of developed potential. Individuals are not defined in terms of basic potential, as Confucius summarises in the Analects, that \\"All human beings are alike at birth (17.2)\\" and \\"The profound person understands what is moral. The small person understands what is profitable (4.16)\\". The junzi is the person who always manifests the quality of ren (jen) in his person and the displays the quality of yi (i) in his actions (4.5). Confucius highlights his fundamentally hierarchical model of relations by describing how the junzi (\\"profound person\\") relates to their follow human beings: \\"The moral force of the junzi is like the wind, whereas the xiaoren's is like the grass. The grass shall bend when the wind is let to blow over it\\". According to D. C. Lau, yi (\\"rightness\\", \\"righteousness\\") is an attribute of actions, and ren is an attribute of agents. There are established conceptual links between li, yi, de and the junzi. According to what is yi (\\"fitting\\", \\"aesthetically, morally, and socially proper\\"), the junzi exerts the moral force, which is de, and thus demonstrates ren (\\"the virtue of co-humanity in an interdependent, hierarchical universe\\"). The following passage from the Analects points out the pathway Confucius taught towards self-cultivation, with the ultimate goal of becoming the junzi: \\"The Master's Way is nothing but other-regard and self- reflection.\\" (4.15); \\"From the age of fifteen on, I have been intent upon learning; from thirty on, I have established myself; from forty on, I have not been confused; from fifty on, I have known the mandate of Heaven; from sixty on, my ear has been attuned; from seventy on, I have followed my heart's desire without transgressing what is right\\".(2.4) In the first passage, \\"self- reflection\\" is explained as \\"Do not do to other what you do not desire for yourself\\" (15.24). Confucius considers it extremely important for one to realise the necessity of concern and empathy for others, which can be achieved by reflecting upon oneself. The deeply relational self can then respond to inner reflection with outer virtue. The second passage indicates the life-long time scale of the process of self-cultivation. It can begin during one's early teenage years, then extends well into more-mature age. The process includes the transformation of the individual, where they realise that they should be able to distinguish and choose from what is right and what is desired. Self- cultivation, as Confucius expects, is an essential philosophical process for one to become junzi by maximising ren. He aims to reflect upon a self that is able to compare itself with moral and social principles of tradition. Confucius, as a scholar who represents early Chinese philosophy and school of thought, does not suffer from the Cartesian \\"mind-body problem\\" as H. Fingarette has demonstrated. In Confucianism, there is no division between inner and outer self, thus the cumulative effect brought by Confucian self- cultivation is not just limited to one's self or personal, but rather social and even cosmic. Monument of Confucius = Purposes and applications = Self- cultivation is an essential component of the context of existential relations, which enhances individuality and personal growth. As Confucius centralises the idea of Self-cultivation and the agency of human, Self-cultivation is a psychological process that cultivates one's mind and body, who attempts to reach beyond the normal states of being. By enhancing their coordination and integration of thoughts and beliefs, it aims to polish a person's capacities and potentials endlessly. = Self-Cultivation: Cultural and Philosophical Psychotherapies = During their history of evolution, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have adopted parts of doctrine from one another to form new branches and sects. Some of them had been disseminated to neighbouring East Asian regions including Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.  Confucianism and the Relational Self  Confucius believed that one's life is the continuation of their parents' life. Therefore, followers of Confucianism teach their children in such way that the younger generation is educated to cultivate themselves to live with a satisfactory level of self-discipline. Even though individuals see a clear-cut boundary between one's self and others, each person of a dyadic relationship is seen embedded in a particular social network. By respecting the parents, the elder and the superior, they are always raised to be morally upright to take others' expectation into consideration. From certain perspectives, it implies a form of social burden and stress from interpersonal relationships, and can cause disturbance and conflicts.  Taoism and the Authentic Self  Chinese Philosophy ‚Äì Five Elements (Cycle of Balance and Control)Whilst the Confucian way of self-cultivation might seem to be emotionally and spiritually restraining at times, Taoism tends to focus on linking the body and mind to the Nature. Taoism advocates the authentic self that is free from legal, social, or political restrictions. It seeks to cultivate one's self by healing and emancipating individuals from the ethical bounds of the human society. Taoism interprets the fortune or misfortune in one's life in terms of one's destiny (ÂëΩ), which is determined by the person's birth date and time.By avoiding the interference of personal desires and by relating everything to the system of the opposing elements of yin and yang, the cosmology of Taoism aims to keep individuals and everything in the harmonious balance. The explanation of self-cultivation in Taoism also corresponds to the equilibrium of the Five Transformative Phases ( Wu Xing ‰∫îË°å): metal (Èáë), wood (Êú®), water (Ê∞¥), fire (ÁÅ´), and earth (Âúü).  Buddhism and the Non-self  The ultimate life goal defined by Buddhism is nirvana. By attaining the non-self, individuals are encouraged to practice self- cultivation by detaching themselves from their desires and ego. Instead of requiring people to completely clarify or understand themselves, Buddhism values altruism and followers believe that by giving their possessions to those who are more in need, the attitude and kindness shall assist them in becoming a better self with no hindrance. There are also Buddhist scholars who emphasize that the key in self-cultivation is the uncovering of the so-called \\"original mind\\" and the experience of sudden enlightenment, which can allow an individual to become a Buddha or a sage. In Japan, the Buddhist practice is equated with the notion of shugyo or personal cultivation.  Influences of Self-cultivation on Chinese Philosophy  = Cultural and Ethical Values involved = As one of the key principles of Confucianism, Self-cultivation may be considered the core of Chinese philosophy. The latter can be seen as the disciplined reflections on the insights of Self-cultivation. While E. Balazs asserted that all Chinese philosophy is social philosophy and that the idea of the group takes precedence over conceptions of the individual self as the social dimension of the human condition features so prominently in the Chinese world of thought, Wing-tsit Chan suggests a more comprehensive characterisation of Chinese philosophy as humanism: 'not the humanism that denies or slights a Supreme Power, but one that professes the alt=unity of man and Heaven‚Äô Similar to the Western sense of guilt, the Chinese sense of shame is studied to amplify that social approval and other external factors, such as the impression from others, defines the fundamental morals the Chinese society holds, rather than internal psychological sanction. In Chinese ethics, the prevalent sociological literature on the mechanism of \\"mi√†n z«ê/Èù¢Â≠ê\\" (which directly translates to 'saving face') and \\"guƒÅn x√¨ / ÂÖ≥Á≥ª\\" (networking) exhibits the importance of Chinese interpersonal and social relationships via the understanding of Self-cultivation. = Cultivation of self in East Asian philosophy of education = In the East Asian cultures, self-cultivation has always been one of the most important concerns in regards to personal growth. Therefore, in order to help students and the younger generation understand the true meaning of being a person, philosophers (mostly considered scholars) tried to explain their own definition of self with various theoretical approaches. The legacy of Chinese philosopher Confucius, and many others (for example, Laozi, Zhuangzi and Mencius) from thousands of years ago, has provided a rich and unique domain of Chinese-philosophical cultural heritage in East Asia. Firstly, the ultimate goal of education, and essentially, one's most noble goal in life, is to properly develop oneself in order to become a \\"profound person\\" (j≈´n z«ê ÂêõÂ≠ê). The youth was taught that it was shameful to become a \\"person with vile character\\" (xi«éo r√©n Â∞è‰∫∫), as that was the exact opposite to j≈´n z«ê/ sh√®ng r√©n (‚Äúsage\\", Âú£‰∫∫). However, as both Confucian and Daoist philosophers adopted the term sh√®ng r√©n, there has been possible divergence that lead to differences in educational concepts and practices. Besides Confucianism and Daoism existing as the ideas accepted and understood by the majority, the Hundred Schools of Thought in Ancient China also had Buddhist and various other branches of philosophy, offering different thoughts on the ideal conception of self. In modern era, some East Asian cultures have abandoned some of the archaic conceptions, or have replaced the traditional humanistic education with more-common modern approach of self-cultivation that adapts the influences of globalisation. Nevertheless, the East Asian descendants and followers of Confucius still consider an ideal human being essential for their life-time education, with their cultural heritage deeply influenced by radical Confucian values.  Modern practices  = The \\"self\\"-concept in Western culture = The \\"self\\" concept in western psychology originated from views of a number of empiricists and rationalists and empiricist. By its very nature, the concept of \\"self\\" has continued to exhibit high involvement in Western educational psychology. Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) established a more comprehensive belief of self-consciousness. That is, by observation, our subject-object consciousness stimulates our rationale and reasoning, which then guides human behaviour. The 3-part model of the psyche Freud (1856‚Äì1939) developed comprises the Id (Das Es), the Ego (Das Ich), and the superego (Das √úber-Ich; Freud, 1923). Freud's self-concept has established an influence on Erikson (1902‚Äì1994), who emphasized self-identity crisis and self-development. Following Erikson, J. Marcia described the continuum of identity development and the nature of our self-identity. The more commonly- recognised concept, self-consciousness, is derived from self-esteem, self- regulation, and self-efficacy. The subject's concept of \\"self\\" is defined in how the individual perceives and builds the link between their self and the world around them. = Morita therapy = Morita Masatake (1874‚Äì1938) aka. Morita Shoma (Ê£ÆÁî∞ Ê≠£È¶¨) Through case-based research, Japanese psychologist Morita Masatake (1874‚Äì1938) introduced Morita therapy. Morita Therapy is developed based on Masatake's theory of consciousness. With assistance from his four- stage therapeutic method, Morita Therapy is described as an ecological therapy method that focuses on purpose through individuals' responses. Morita Therapy is cognate with rational-emotive therapy by American psychologist A. Ellis. Commonalities have also been established between Morita Therapy and existential and cognitive behavioral therapy. = Naikan Therapy = Naikan (\\"ÂÜÖË¶≥\\", looking inside) is a Japanese psychotherapeutic method introduced and developed decades ago by Japanese businessman and Buddhist monk (J≈çdo Shinsh≈´) Yoshimoto Ishin (1916‚Äì1988). Initially, Naikan Therapy was more often used in correctional settings, however its recent adaption has been switched to situational and psychoneurotic disorders. In comparison to Morita therapy, Naikan Therapy requires shorter period of time and is able to regulate longer periods of meditation on the daily basis, where the focus of introspection is moved to the resolution of conflicts. Similar to Morita therapy, Naikan requires a relatively total subordination to a carefully structured period of \\"retreat,\\" that is compassionately supervised by the practitioner. Contrary to Morita, Naikan is shorter (seven days) and utilizes long, regulated periods of daily meditation where introspection is directed toward the resolution of contemporary conflicts and problems. \\"In contrast to Western psychoanalytic psychotherapy, both Naikan and Morita tend to keep transference issues simplified and positive, while resistance is dealt with procedurally rather than interpretively.\\" = The Theory of Constructive Living (Constructive Living Therapy)= Based largely on the adaptions of two Japanese structured methods of self-reflection, Naikan Therapy and Morita therapy, Constructive Living is a Western approach to mental health education. Purpose-centered and response-oriented, Constructive Living (sometimes abbreviated as CL) focuses on the mindfulness and purposes of one's life. It is considered as a process of action to approach the reality thoughtfully. It also emphasizes the ability to understand one's self by recognizing the past, in which it reflects upon the present. Constructive Living highlights the importance of acceptance, of the world we live in, as well as the emotions and feelings individuals have in unique situations. D. Reynolds, Author of Constructive Living and Director of the Constructive Living Center in Oregon, U.S.A, argues that before taking the actions which may potentially bring positive changes, people are often hold back by the belief of \\"dealing with negative emotions first\\". According to Reynolds, the most crucial component of the process of effectuating affirmations is not getting the mind right. However, one's mind and emotions are effectively adjusted during the process of self-reflection, which indicates that there shall be a behavioural change taken place beforehand. F. Nietzsche (1844-1900) = Nietzsche's Ethics of Self-Cultivation = \\"If you incorporate this thought within you, amongst your other thoughts\\" he maintains \\"It will transform you. If for everything you wish to do you begin by asking yourself: 'Am I certain I want to do this an infinite number of times?' this will become for you the greatest weight.\\" (KSA 9:11 [143]) Nietzsche worked on the project of reviving Self-cultivation, an ancient ethics. \\"I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my own activity\\"(HL 2:1) \\"It follows therefore that he must conceive eternal recurrence among other things as a practice that stimulates self-cultivation. In fact in one of his characteristically grandiose moments he identified it as 'the great cultivating thought' in the sense that it might weed out those too weak to bear the thought of living again (WP 1053). In a more tempered fashion, however, he framed the thought of recurrence as part of an ethics of self-cultivation and self-transformation.\\"  See also  *Self * Neo-Confucianism * Eastern philosophy  References  Bibliography * *Confucian Self-Cultivation and Daoist Personhood, H.Wang Gramsci, A.

Satellite babies (also called Satellite children) refer to immigrants‚Äô children who are temporarily sent back to their home country by their parents to be reared by extended family. Typically, the satellite babies are born in the host country and sent back as infants, returning to their parents in time to start schooling or when their parents have established financial stability. Research and media articles on satellite babies have predominantly focused on the topic from a Chinese-American context. Satellite babies have become more prevalent in recent decades due to globalisation, prompting researchers and social workers to raise concerns about the psychological impacts of repeated attachment disruptions and acculturation associated with satellite babies.  Definition  Satellite babies is a term coined in the 2009 research paper Satellite Babies in Transnational Families: A Study of Parents‚Äô Decision to Separate from their Infants. In the paper, the researchers focus on the children of Chinese immigrants in North America. However, the practice also occurs in immigrant households of South Asian, African, and Caribbean origin and occurs in many Western countries, such as Australia. Despite this diversity, research on satellite babies has mainly been conducted on ethnically Chinese children in North America. Satellite babies should not be confused with parachute kids, which refer to elementary or secondary international students living alone in a foreign country whilst their parents remain in their home country. Furthermore, while satellite babies are quite similar to left-behind children, researchers argue that the two groups are sufficiently different as satellite babies suffer more attachment disruptions, are separated across a vaster geographical distance, and need to adjust to a different culture and language upon reunification.  History  Many societies, including Chinese society, have traditionally endorsed kinship care. In particular, the practice of grandchildren being cared for by grandparents while the parents migrate for work has become widespread within China due to rural-urban migration. As increasing numbers of Chinese people immigrate to Western countries, many choose to continue this practice transnationally. According to a New York Times article from 1999, 10 to 20 percent of mothers at the New York Chinatown Health Center sent their children back to China, and up to half of all expectant mothers at a nearby clinic stated their intention to do the same. A 2009 study surveying pregnant and postpartum women at prenatal care workshops at a community health centre in New York‚Äôs Chinatown revealed that 57 percent of respondents intend to send newborns back to China, with 74 percent stating they plan to bring their children back after four years. In 2019, the director of the Chinese-American Planning Council stated that 70 percent of Asian-American children in its school-age childcare program were satellite babies.  Factors influencing parent decision-making  = Economic factors = Surveys of Chinese immigrant mothers in Canada and The United States of America revealed that economic necessity was the predominant factor influencing their decision to send their children back to China. The participants stated that they require time to focus on retraining or developing their careers, and considered their infant children as obstacles to those goals. Furthermore, participants also stated they could not afford to work whilst keeping their children with them due to the prohibitive cost of child-care services in North America. The importance of financial stability in parents' decision-making is also demonstrated by the timing of when children rejoin the parental household; children tend to return after parents have bought houses, found stable higher paying jobs, or after moving to an area with good schools, which are believed to be indicators of economic success. However, despite economic necessity being the predominant factor, the practice is also prevalent in middle-class, highly educated Chinese immigrant households. = Cultural factors = According to surveys, the expectation of kinship care is a major factor influencing parents' decision making.Wong, Kitching R. (2015). \\"The Fengsu- Driven Practice of Sending Infants to China: The Experiences of Chinese Immigrant Mothers in New York.\\" CUNY Academic Works. https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/1190 Many Chinese parents chose to send their children to be cared for by extended family because they themselves were raised by their grandparents. Parents were also pressured to send their children back; surveys of former Chinese satellite babies cited that many grandparents enjoyed taking care of their grandchildren as it brought them meaning in retirement and gave them the opportunity to raise a daughter or son that they were not able to have. Another factor influencing Chinese parents' decisions was the wish for their children to be exposed to the culture of the home country so that traditional values and the native language would be preserved. = Other contributing factors = Additional factors that parents attributed to their decision to send their newborns back include a lack child- rearing experience. Many Chinese mothers of satellite babies stated in interviews that they did not know how to raise a child and would prefer to have their more experienced parents look after their grandchildren. In addition, the mothers of satellite babies also identified their immigration status an impediment to raising children in the host country. Moreover, immigration laws in the host country that prevent the child's grandparents from visiting for extended periods of time were also a contributing factor to parents' decision to send their children back the home country for child- rearing. Another factor that contributed to parents' decision to separate from their child was living conditions. Many mothers stated in interviews that living conditions were poor in the host country, and they would prefer that their child grow up in the home country where living conditions were better. = Detracting factors = However, many mothers of satellite babies stated in interviews that they believed their child would exhibit behavioural problems, pointing to the lack of bonding that would result in disobedience and difficulty disciplining their child, which detracted from their decision to separate from their child. Another detracting factor was concerns about the health of the child; a majority of mothers interviewed believed their child's medical needs would not be better met in the home country, as the healthcare services in the host country are more robust. Furthermore, while some parents believed that the child's grandparents would be better at raising the baby, there was also a fear that grandparents' child-rearing style would spoil the baby and cause bad habits, such as little emperor syndrome. Moreover, many parents expressed a desire for their child to assimilate into the new culture of the host country as soon as possible, including parents who wanted to preserve traditional values. The parents expected that extended stay overseas would result in language and cultural barriers, which would hamper the ability of their children to adapt to the culture of the host country. Despite these fears, many parents of satellite babies reported feeling that they did not have a choice, and must send their children back to their home country out of necessity or for the greater good.  Impacts  = Impacts on the child = The importance of strong attachment between infants and their primary caregiver on child development is well documented; research has shown that attachment disruptions are a predictor of poor mental health, increased crime rates, and relationship quality. Satellite babies suffer at least two major attachment disruptions: the first when they are separated from their mother, and another when they are separated from their family caregiver to be returned to their mother. Upon reunification with their parents, satellite babies may exhibit a range of both externalising and internalising behaviours that indicate emotional trauma, including oppositional behaviour, separation anxiety, and social isolation. According to interviews with parents, some children exhibit anger and hostility towards their parents for separating them from their grandparents, who were considered primary attachment figures by the children, whereas parents are sometimes considered strangers; other children fear further separation, become clingy towards their parents, and agitated whenever parents are out of sight; others show social withdrawal and depression. These behaviours, which are associated with attachment disruptions, are exacerbated by adjustment difficulties related to starting school and acculturation. Acculturative stress can occur when satellite babies, upon return, are suddenly exposed to vastly different cultural norms and expectations both in school and within society, and required to learn a new language. Some parents of satellite babies also reported that their child had difficulty making friends, which they attribute to adjustment difficulties, including not being able to properly communicate in English and attachment disorders. Surveys of former satellite babies reveal that many satellite babies experience ambivalence towards their situation. In some cases, the children harbour resentment towards their parents, but understand the logic behind their parents' decisions and acknowledge the economic success that has been achieved through these decisions. Researchers have proposed that this ambivalence could be indicative of former satellite babies' confusion about their identity. The researchers suggest that this confusion arises from satellite babies subscribing to two conflicting cultural models of familial relationships and child-rearing: the Western model of intensive parenting that prioritises the parent-child relationship, and the more collectivist model of an open, expansive family that shares childcare responsibilities that is prevalent in countries such as China. = Impacts on mothers = In interviews, Canadian-Chinese mothers of satellite babies have displayed symptoms of depression and stress due to the separations. Generally, the respondents expressed a lack of control and resignation about their situation. Many mothers are aware of the possible psychological repercussions of separation on their children, and experience guilt for having to send their children back. When satellite babies return to their mothers, the mothers feel that they lack confidence in raising their child, due to them not having developed the relevant parenting skills. Furthermore, the loss of the bonding period between the mother and the satellite baby, which hinders the development of mutual trust and understanding, can cause mothers to feel disconnected from their child. These emotions could possibly compound the adverse psychological effects experienced by satellite babies.  Perspectives towards satellite babies  In most cases, voluntary family separations are stigmatised in Western countries. Researchers point out that articles on satellite babies highlighted in the media generally depict parents as uncaring, which can intensify judgement of immigrant families. Some studies suggest that the Western ideal of a nuclear family may cause the more collectivist family model, which is generally subscribed to by mothers who choose to send children back to extended family, to be viewed as somehow deficient. Researchers have suggested that clinicians need to better understand the cultural context behind the phenomenon of satellite babies to better serve the diverse needs of new immigrant families. According to a study interviewing former satellite babies, around 15% of respondents viewed their separation as a positive experience. These respondents believed it was normal to be raised by extended family, and understood separation to be a good solution to the financial hardships experienced by first-generation immigrant parents. These respondents also appreciated their grandparents' undivided attention, which their parents may not have been able to provide, and the feeling of being part of a strong family community. Former satellite babies who viewed separation as a negative experience suggested that clearer communication and explanation of their parents' decision-making would have better prepared them for the separation.

He was best known as the president of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) from 2012 to 2015. He directed the Subaru telescope project, which housed the largest monolithic primary mirror in the world from its commission until 2005. Kaifu researched in radio astronomy, extragalactic astronomy, cosmic magnetic fields, non-stable stars, and infrared astronomy. The minor planet 6412 Kaifu is named in honor of him. Kaifu died of pancreatic cancer on 13 April 2019, at the age of 75. Career Kaifu graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1972 with a PhD in radio astronomy. In the early 1980s, he organised bilateral collaborations with British astronomers, including the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, which improved relations with international astronomers. He also began working with astronomers in China, South Korea, and Taiwan, and formed the East Asian Core Observatories Association, which eventually created the East Asian Observatory in 2014. He became the chairman of the Radio Astronomy Division of the National Astronomical Observatory of Mitaka from 1988 to 1990, and associate director from 1992 to 1996. In 1990, he was invited to join the Japanese Large Telescope Project, and became the founding director of the Subaru telescope. The telescope still remains as one of the largest telescopes in the world. From 2000 to 2006, Kaifu was the director of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), and led the construction of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, which became Japan's first large inter-university research facility in astronomy. He then served in the Science Council of Japan as president of the Natural Science & Engineering Division from 2005 to 2011. He acted as the single point of contact for the International Year of Astronomy 2009 in Japan. Kaifu taught at the Open University of Japan from 2007 to 2012, and from 2012 to 2015, was elected president of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). In his lifetime, he published over 150 papers and 30 books, and was a regular reviewer of the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun.  Scientific achievements  Kaifu became widely known for his research into radio spectroscopy. While working on the 6-meter millimeter wave telescope at the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, he developed radio spectrometers, and after the telescope's completion in 1982, began to detect several molecules in the atmosphere. He also helped develop the acousto-optical spectrometer used in the Nobeyama 45 meter radio telescope. This spectrometer had more than ten times the bandwidth and channels of other spectrometers at the time. He and his team carried out surveys of spectral lines, and discovered more than a dozen molecules, most of which were organic. His work also helped develop the first clear evidence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Kaifu led research on star formation, and laid the foundations for fields such as the direct observation of exoplanets and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.  Personal life  Kaifu is a cousin to Nobel laureate physicist Makoto Kobayashi, and former Japanese prime minister Toshiki Kaifu.

Australia is home to lithium miners, Orocobre, Galaxy Resources, Pilbara Minerals, Mineral Resources and Altura Mining with most of the large lithium miners producing lithium from hard-rock spodumene in Western Australia.  Initial development  Talison is a leading producer of lithium and one of the first mining companies to begin development in Australia, from its prized Greenbushes Lithium Operations, \\"Greenbushes was Australia‚Äôs first hard rock lithium mine\\", with its first lithium plant being commissioned in 1985. Galaxy resources founded in 1996, commenced production of spodumene out of its Mt Cattlin mine, north of Ravensthorpe in Western Australia, in November 2010. Mineral Resources was established in 1992 and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2006.  Current situation  \\"The Faculty of Science & Engineering have established an enviable suite of facilities to conduct research and teaching, allowing staff and students access to world-class facilities.\\" On the 16th of March 2016, Platypus Minerals and Lepidico executed a binding term sheet for the acquisition by Platypus of 100 percent of Lepidico. Lepidico is a company with lithium exploration assets and proprietary metallurgical processing technology. From a policy perspective, the Australian Government is encouraging investment in the lithium industry. As of 10 April 2019, The Federal Government and the State Government along with industry have agreed to fund a new modern national lithium research centre valued at $135 million which \\"will operate out of Curtin University in Perth\\", for $53 million. The facility aims to make Western Australia a hub for battery-making and research surrounding lithium battery manufacturing. Orocobre is a lithium chemicals supplier headquartered out of Brisbane, Australia. Its key lithium assets include the Olaroz Lithium facility, Cauchari Lithium Project and its processing facilities of Borax Argentina S.A. It also has a 33.5 percent stake in Advantage Lithium. The company's lithium assets at Olaroz are owned by Sales de Jujuy, an Argentine company, which Orocobre has a 66.5 percent stake. The remaining partners on the project are Toyota Tsusho Corporation, who owns 22.5 percent and Jujuy Energia, 8.5 percent. In 2018, Orocobre raised A$361 million of capital \\"to fund the expansion of the Olaroz Lithium Project Stage 2 and construction of a lithium hydroxide plant in Japan\\". According to Orocobre, \\"the lithium market experienced strong demand during FY18 encouraged by upward revisions to key forward indicators including EV plans of car manufacturers, further battery capacity expansions and growing investment supporting EV uptake and ESS development\\". Orocobre expects lithium demand to reach 800ktpa of lithium carbonate by 2025. As of the first quarter 2018, Galaxy Resources classification on the Australian Securities Exchange is as a mining producing entity. The company has three main projects. Sal de Vida project is Galaxy's lithium brine project located in north-west Argentina, recognised globally \\"as one of the world's largest and highest quality, undeveloped brine deposits\\", is currently in development phase, with specialists in engineering, permitting and government attempting to establish the most economic process route. Mt Cattlin is the company's spodumene project and James Bay is its lithium pegmatite project located in Quebec, Canada. Pilbara Minerals produces out of its Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum project located in Western Australia's Pilbara region. The site is located 120km from Port Hetland. The company through its Pilgangoora project \\"has attracted a group of high quality, experience global offtake partners including Gangfeng Lithium, General Lithium, Great Wall Motor Company and POSCO\\". The company is exploring its options to scale the project. Mineral Resources \\"is an Australian based mining service, contracting, processing and commodities production company\\". Its Wodgina lithium project has commenced sales of spodumene concentrate and Mt Marion has continued sales of spodumene concentrate to Ganfeng \\"pursuant to offtake arrangement\\". Altura Mining operates the Altura Lithium Mine at Pilgangoora in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The mine produces 220ktpa of spodumene concentrate, commencing production in 2018. It has recently completed a definitive feasibility study on a stage 2 expansion to 440ktpa. It will be deciding on whether to pursue the project in 2019.  Lithium production  Ravensthorpe, Western Australia Location: 541 km (336 mi) ESE of Perth; 50 km (31 mi) NNW of Hopetoun Orocobre's Olaroz Lithium Facility increased production in FY2018 by 5 percent to 12,740 tonnes. Olaroz produces lithium carbonate at an average operating cost of US$4,194/tonne in FY2018. \\"Throughout FY18 Orocobre and TTC progressed plans for a 10,000 tonnes per annum Lithium Hydroxide Plant to be built in Naraha, Japan\\". Galaxy Resources Mt Cattlin operation in Ravensthrope produced 156,689 tonnes of lithium concentrate in 2018. Galaxy Resources has acquired new mine tenements which it seeks to actively explore in 2019. Galaxy resources James Bay project contains approximately 40.3Mt at 1.4 percent lithium oxide. The site is currently in \\"pre-work engineering by Hydro-Quebec involving the design and construction of a powerline and connection infrastructure for future power supply to the project\\". Pilbara minerals commenced construction of its Pilgangoora project in January 2017 which was completed in late July 2018, producing its first lithium concentrate one month later. Pilbara Minerals delivered 111,199 dry metrics tonnes (dmt) to date for 2019 financial year with forecasted production for its March quarter between 47-52 thousand dmt. On the 28th of March Pilbara announced it will commence a partnering process to support its expansion of the Pilgangoora project. According to Mineral Resources 2019 half year report, 186 000 wet metric tonnes of spodumene concentrate was delivered. Mineral Resources has affirmed it expects to meet production of 450 000 dry metric tonnes per annum. Specifically, year to date March 2019, Mt Marion production delivered 297kwmt at an average cost of A$596.8/wmt. Wodgina mine is currently not producing, however plant commissioning has commenced. Annual production from its Mt Marion and Wodgina mine is 450kt at 6 percent lithium oxide and 750kt at 6 percent lithium oxide respectively. Project life for each mine is over 20 years and 30 years. Altura Mining has a global resource 50.5 million tonnes, \\"capable of supporting a mine life over 25 years\\". The company declared commercial production in March 2019. Annual production is at 220ktpa of 6 percent spodumene concentrate. Altura estimates the cost per tonne to be approximately $430 per tonne. Altura delivered 4 shipments in the December quarter totalling 24kdmt and expects that this can be sustained at 3 shipments per month. In its presentation to the Lithium and Battery Metals Conference, Altura stated \\"Shipments have exceeded customer expectations with grades as high as 6.3 percent.\\"  Statistics  Mining in Australia Lithium mining In 2013, Australia produced 12,700 metric tonnes of lithium. In 2018, production reached 51,000Mt, providing an average year on year growth of approximately 32.05 percent. In 2013, Chile produced 11,200Mt of lithium. In 2018, production reached 16,000Mt, providing an average year on year growth of approximately 7.4 percent. In 2013, China produced 4,700Mt of lithium. In 2018, production reached 8,000Mt, providing an average year on year growth of approximately 11.22 percent Worldwide production increased by 74 percent from 2016 to 2017, predominantly due to a \\"threefold increase in Australia's spodumene production\\". According to the United States Geological Survey, \\"five spodumene operations in Australia and two brine operations each in Argentina and Chile accounted for the majority of world lithium production\\". \\"The leading spodumene operation in Australia increased its spodumene concentrate production by about 40 percent in 2018 and remained the world's largest lithium producer\\".  Investment in Australian lithium mining companies  Reserve Bank of Australia, 65 Martin Place, Sydney NSW 2000 Lithium, being a commodity, means it must be mined or produced from lithium brines. The difference between hard-rock mining and brines is evident in the capital outlay required between the two projects. The capital outlay for hard-rock spodumene exceeds that of lithium brines. This plays a role when identifying whether a project is worth an investment or conversely, if it should be abandoned. Market demand is another major factor. The rapid growth and expansion of the electric vehicle sector has caused a surge in demand for lithium to support the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. The surge in demand translates to higher revenues for existing and new market entrants, reported by the Sydney Morning Herald \\"Pilbara Minerals managing director and chief executive Ken Brinsden said the demand for higher quality battery materials put WA in the drivers seat\\" The rising demand in the market for lithium \\"shows no signs of slowing\\" in Australia, which hosts the \\"highest economic concentrations of lithium via several hard rock deposits\\". However, as reported by the Australian Financial Review, as supply of lithium grows, the value of existing companies falls. Supply continues to grow as a royal settlement struck by Chilean producer SQM gives the company permission over the next 7 years to more than triple its production, also reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, \\"but federal forecasts in the resources and energy quarterly found while WA will be pulling out a record 419,000 tonnes of lithium ore spodumene from the ground, it won‚Äôt reap the same high prices the industry has experienced.\\" References ","title":"Lithium mining in Australia"},{"id":"60458288","text":"The 1992‚Äì93 Marquette Warriors men's basketball team represented the Marquette University in the 1992‚Äì93 season.

It is perhaps best known for producing sheepskin boots. History The brand was founded by Tom Romeo in 2001 with the purpose of, according to its website, redefining casual footwear by utilizing sheepskin to create comfortable and stylish footwear. In one of the most competitive footwear market segments, with UGG Australia and EMU Australia as main competitors for producing sheepskin footwear, Bearpaw has carved out a niche area by providing customers with comfort and sensibility to set itself apart. The first Bearpaw retail store opened in Citrus Heights, California in 2011, where the brand is headquartered. In 2018, the brand started producing vegan made boots (non- sheepskin), specifically with vegan microsuede (polyester), polyester blend lining, and rubber outsoles. In June 2018, Bearpaw acquired Flip Flop Shops, a brand owned by Cherokee Inc. Products Bearpaw's signature products are its sheepskin boots, otherwise known as ugg boots, which come in various styles and colors. The brand also produces hiking boots, slippers, sneakers and accessories for men, women and children. Legal issues In November 2010, Deckers Outdoor Corporation, which owns the UGG Australia brand, filed a lawsuit against the Bearpaw brand for copying UGG brand designs (both Bearpaw and UGG Australia produce immensely similar products, especially their sheepskin boots). The litigation was resolved mutually by both parties in February 2012. Tom Romeo faced legal trouble in 2014, when he was charged by a federal grand jury of Sacramento, California for evading nearly $5.6 million in customs duties, where his employees created false invoices that undervalued footwear he imported from China.

Thomas himself called his first feature a \\"lighthearted existential horror film\\", while four festival reviewers described it in neo-noir terms. Having won over critics, and an award from the Eugene International Film Festival, Thomas was able to attract investors for his next project, Ally Was Screaming. Synopsis Sixteen years ago, a teenage Joseph Rickman (Jeremy Thomas) found a missing girl on sheer intuition, seeing something that others could not. Rickman, now a charismatic schoolteacher, has since come to the conclusion that everything in life has been predetermined, including his own life, and can point to many signs which appear to suggest if not confirm it. He tries to explain himself to those close to him, who treat him as though he may be developing paranoid schizophrenia, as his father did many years ago. An exception to this response is an adoring student, Katie (Katie Webber), who seems to share some of his psychic abilities. Even so, sometimes he, too, thinks he is losing his mind. As his mental state deteriorates, he has a growing sense of dread. Feeling compelled to walk into the woods one night, he sees a robed, limping man in a tragedy mask and images of people being kidnapped and buried alive as strange little beings look on. A stranger in strange clothing has in fact been seen lurking the dark streets in town at about the times that people have been inexplicably disappearing. Confiding in his long-time friend, Detective Clara Wilkie (Ella B. May), the pair become convinced that what he has seen are visionary premonitions, and they work on the case together, which involves not only multiple kidnapping but serial murder. Tensions increase between them as they spend more time together, and as her feelings for Rickman grow, she is increasingly concerned about his mounting obsession as the case edges delicately towards a bizarre and shocking conclusion. Cast *Jeremy Thomas as Joseph Rickman *Ella B. May as Clara Wilkie *Katie Webber as Katie *Darren MacDonald as The Figure ‚Ä¢ Lobotomized Man ‚Ä¢ Activator Scientist Production =Background and filming= Before shooting his first feature film, Jeremy Thomas had made short films as a student at the University of Calgary, where he joined the campus station NUTV to use the equipment, just as director Michael Dowse was leaving. The End was shot on video. =Financing= A low- budget film, The End was largely self-financed, though it did receive support from the National Film Board's Filmmaker Assistance Program. At the 2008 Fantasia International Film Festival, Thomas was apparently apologetic about the film, offering what seemed like \\"excuses or explanations ‚Äì they had less money than the short film that precedes it, but it is long for a zero-budget indie,\\" among other details. Release The End had its premiere at the Calgary International Film Festival on 24 September 2007. Its American premiere was at the 2008 Cinequest Film Festival, an official selection. The film was also screened at Fantasia, the Edmonton International Film Festival, the Eugene International Film Festival (where it won an award), and the International Film Festival of England. =Home media and streaming= The End is available on DVD and for streaming from IndiePlaya. Reception =Critical response= The End generally received \\"great\\" reviews at film festivals and led to Thomas attracting producers for his next film, Ally Was Screaming. Appreciative critics were \\"tying themselves in knots not to reveal its mid-plot twist.\\" Simon Laperri√®re calls the film a \\"stunning appearance on the landscape of DIY cinema\\", a \\"gobsmacking cross\\" between Charlie Kaufman and William Shakespeare, and \\"unquestionably the most original Canadian film of the year.\\" Pam Kelly, writing for the Edmonton Sun, agreed, suggesting that if Woody Allen, David Lynch and M. Night Shyamalan ever had a \\"forbidden love child,\\" it may \\"look something like The End, a wolf in sheep's clothing that looks and feels like a modern noir, but ... which burns in flames any conventional relationship an audience has with fictional cinema.\\" > Thomas has created a notably insightful and thought provoking piece of work > that is intricate and employs numerous twists and surprises serving up > continuous adventure using equal parts horror, drama, thriller and mystery. > This clever and refreshing film will have you utterly compelled right up to > its artfully unexpected conclusion. Praising the acting and the film's originality, Mike Phalin said it \\"is a prime example of how ingenuity prevails in the face of obvious budgetary restraints\\"; a \\"pleasant surprise\\" and \\"an inspiration ... to the low budget/do-it-yourself filmmaking community.\\" The first half of the film has \\"charm\\", and then \\"turns the screws on the viewers in a highly unexpected way.\\" Kevin Matthews avers The End \\"cannot be explained... It must be shown.\\" It is difficult \\"to discuss any of the storyline's developments or the main plus points\\", because to do so would be \\"to ruin a sublime, surreal, cinematic joy.\\" The film is \\"intelligent, often humorous\\", and \\"manages to both touch on themes that have been used effectively elsewhere and to provide something completely new to film fans.\\" Jay Seaver finds the opening of the film \\"kind of clunky\\", but notes that it has \\"one of the rare mid-thriller twists that makes the movie funnier rather than more grim.\\" Thomas cleverly lays out some of the ideas he's going to be playing with early, and seems to have fun elaborating on his plot twist, \\"finding new ways to push things just a bit further as the movie goes on.\\" As for the acting: > Thomas isn't bad at all. At times, he seems a little artificial, but at > others he seems real in an \\"I'd probably be a bit awkward in this situation, > too\\" manner.

This type of poetry is written specifically for sharing, most commonly on Instagram, but also Twitter and Tumblr. The form usually consists of short direct lines in aesthetically pleasing fonts that are sometimes accompanied by an image or drawing, with or without a rhyme scheme.  History  Instapoetry developed as a result of poets trying to share their work to expand their readership. Writers of this \\"sub-genre\\" began using social media as their preferred method of distribution rather than traditional publishing methods. The term \\"instapoetry\\" was created by other writers trying to define and understand the new extension of \\"instant\\" poetry in a digital age. In its most basic form, Instapoetry usually consists of byte-sized verses that consider political and social subjects such as immigration, domestic violence, sexual assault, love, culture, feminism, gun violence, war, racism, LGBTQ and other social justice topics. All of these elements are usually made to fit social media feeds that are easily accessible through applications on smartphones.  Supporters  Despite challenging the structure of traditional poetry, supporters argue that while a reader can easily dismiss the simplicity of the style, Instapoetry provides a modern take on traditional poetic principles. They argue that many works by writers in the literary canon were once criticized for deviating from the standards of their time. While Instapoets may be looked down upon by academia, these writers have opened a door to poetry in a way that traditional education has failed to do. Some academics appreciate the way in which it has stimulated interest in poetry.  Criticism  Some critics view this style of poetry as a disgrace to \\"real\\" poetry. Vinu Caspar reflects on the ways Instapoetry has turned poetry into a \\"capitalist\\" endeavor. He believes that the words are emotionless and written to attract followers. The rate at which these instapoets produce new material, he argues, steals from \\"[p]oets who spend years honing their craft, carefully writing and rewriting every line, practicing their performance over and over...\\". The feeling is that instapoetry is a collection of words with little to no meaning, \\"under the guise of poetry.\\" Similarly, Thom Young, a poet and high school English teacher, created a \\"parody\\" Instagram page as a way to mock instapoets and their work. He states \\"the younger generation is mostly interested in fidget-spinner poetry. Like they‚Äôre just scrolling on their devices, to read something instantly, while the libraries are empty. I think people today don‚Äôt want to read anything that causes a whole lot of critical thinking.\\" The page was created to show how effortlessly anyone can become an instapoet, and to display the lack of difficulty in writing this form of poetry.  Statistics  Reading statistics show that \\"leisure-reading\\" overall in the US continues to drop. From 2004 to 2017 \\"Americans who read for pleasure...[have] fallen by more than 30%\\" The drop in reading is also true for Canada, although less drastically, at around 1% per year. Looking specifically at poetry sales, however, Booknet Canada reports that \\"in 2016, poetry sales increased 79% over 2015, and between 2016 and 2017 the units sold increased by another 154%\\" Similarly, in the UK Nielsen BookScan states that \\"...sales grew by just over 12% last year, for the second year in a row.

From its origins when it separated from the Galician Latin in the 9th century until the introduction of Castilian in the 16th century there was peace, and from the 16th century until the present there were various conflicts.  The First inhabitants of Galicia  The first inhabitants of Galicia were of pre-indo European origins, and they left a few samples of Galician behind. Thus, pre-indo European words (\\"amorodo\\", \\"lastra\\", \\"veiga\\", etc.), were discovered. Likewise, the first inhabitants of Galicia received certain linguistic and cultural influences of the Celtic peoples in the Iberian Peninsula with words such as (\\"berce\\", \\"bugallo\\", \\"croio\\") that came from the Cetlic language in a direct way or through Latin.  The Romans  The Galician province under Diocletan. The Romans arrived in Galicia in the second century BCE, although their conquest was not consolidated until the first century B.C.E., the process of \\"Romanization\\" began, which led to the incorporation of indigenous people to the language and the culture of the Roman conquerors. Latin became the language of the area, its assimilation was not an immediate process, but gradual, through the colonization of the Roman citizens and the cultural and administrative advantages of Roman citizenship and distribution of land, among other factors. The process of Romanization was similar to that of other places, the Romans being able to speak strongly as a romanized elite while the majority of the inhabitants of Galicia use a degraded variant of vulgar Latin, that will result in the creation of the so-called Romance languages: Castilian, Catalan, Romanian, French, and Italian, among others.  The arrival of the Germans  From the 5th century C.E. people of Germanic culture and language came to Galicia, but due to their small demographic weight they were unable to fully assimilate into the Galician-Roman population, which ended their assimilation. Also during the High Middle Ages, refugees coming from the Britannic Islands arrived and the zone was even occupied briefly by the Arabians during the eighth century. Even though its cultural significance is insignificant compared to the background of Latin culture, these people provide various loanwords with several Germanic (alberca, espeto, roupa, etc.) and Arabic terms (often through indirect sources)(laranxa, aceite, azucre, etc.,).  The formation of Galician  alt= The transformation of Latin into Galician occurred in a progressive and unnoticeable form. It is impossible to provide an exact date of transformation. But from the preserved written testimonies it can be said that from the eighth century the language of the church and the administration was very different than classic Latin, although it often appears full of vulgarisms and idioms that will later be transmitted to Galician. However, the first writings in a language considered similar to Galician do not appear until well into the twelfth century and Latin continues to be the language of the culture, the administration, the liturgy and of teaching, not only in the territory of old Gallaecia but in a majority of Medieval Europe. The oldest literary document that is currently preserved is a satiric song Ora faz ost'o senhor de Navarra by Joam Soares of Paiva, written sometime close to the year 1200. The first non-literary documents in Galician date from the beginnings of the thirteenth century; for example, the \\"News of Torto\\" (1211) and the Testament of Alfonso II of Portugal (1214). Recently the oldest document written in Galician was found, dated to the year 1228. It came from a meeting in the town of Castro Caldelas, granted by Alfonso IX in April of the year of the municipality of Allariz.Foro do bo burgo de Castro Caldelas, consellodacultura.org The oldest document of Latin-Galician- Portuguese was found in Portugal and was a donation to the Church of Sozello, which was found in the National Archives of Torre of Tombo and is dated around the year 870 C.E. Since the 8th century, and as the Muslim invaders consolidated their conquests in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, Galicia constituted a political unit with the medieval rulers of Asturias and Le√≥n, although it maintained certain autonomy that allowed it to on occasion emerge as an independent kingdom in certain moments of the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries. In this context Galician is, for the most part, an exclusively oral language, with a decreasing competition with Latin in the written field. The progressive demographic weight of the Galician speakers little by little introduced Galician together with Latin in notarial documents, administrative documents, lawsuits, etc. even though Latin continues to possess a superior cultural position.  Medieval splendor  Cantigas of Santa Mar√≠a From the 14th century and from its unification, Galician literature lives its period of its greatest splendor. Galician became the language par excellence of Lyric poetry. In this period Galician attained an international rank, since it was being used by authors of many European languages: Galician, Portuguese, Leonese, Castilian, Occitan, Sicilian, etc. and was present in royal and stately courts, although its use was concentrated mostly in the Iberian Peninsula. The \\"Songs of Santa Mar√≠a,\\" poetic compositions performed in praise of the Virgin Mary, are the main display of the religious aspect of the Galician-Portuguese lyric poetry and constitute the body of the most important medieval Marian poetry in all of the Iberian Peninsula and across Europe. They were composed in the court of King Alfonso X \\"the wise man\\" of Castile, who was in charge of the management of the poetry and on occasion participated directly in its composition. These are examples of the prestige gained by Galician as a literary language by the end of the thirteenth century. The splendor spans not only the kingdom of Castile, but also the neighboring kingdom, where the king himself, Dionsio I of Portugal, was a prominent composer of Galician-Portuguese lyric poetry. In comparison with lyric poetry, the medieval literary prose in Galician is scarce and belated. It is necessary to keep in mind that the central cultures of the period, the monasteries and the monastic schools, were where the use of ecclesiastical Latin prevailed. Nevertheless, from the end of the thirteenth century and more significantly in the fourteenth through fifteenth centuries, the most widely disseminated literary themes in Europe were collected in the Galician language. Various examples are the stories of the so-called \\"Breton Cycle\\" around the legendary figure of King Arthur, the texts regarding the history and destruction of Troy, such as the \\"Trojan History\\" and the \\"Trojan Chronicle\\" and the \\"Miracles of Santiago\\", sets of stories about the destruction of Jerusalem to the miracle intervention of Saint James the Apostle in different situations. Also it is necessary to include other texts in prose that are translations or versions of other languages with their own elaboration, such as the \\"Galician Chronicle Xeral\\", \\"General Estoria\\", \\"Galician Chronicle of 1404\\" and \\"The Chronicle of Santa Maria of Iria\\".  The dark centuries  The end of the Middle Ages (fourteenth-fifteenth centuries) coincides with the end of the splendor of the Galician language and the beginning of the progressive period of decline, both in the common and literary use of the language. Several factors influenced this progressive decline, especially the progressive centralization of the kingdom of Castile and the subsequent consolidation of absolutism. Also important is the settlement in Galicia of a foreign nobility outside of the Galician culture and language, that replaced the native nobility that was defeated on several occasions in the succession and dynastic struggles of the crown of Castile. First in the war between Pedro I \\"The Cruel\\" and Enrique II of Trast√°mara and later (1475‚Äì1479) in the war between Juana the Beltraneja and Isabel the Catholic; the absence of a strong bourgeoisie capable of defending its interests, the decline of the population, the reform of the church, and the loss of autonomy of the Galician Church, etc. These facts, together with the growing centralist and interventionist policy of Castile, progressively strengthen the current \\"de-galicianizing\\" movement, especially in the upper classes of society, which prevents the consolidation of Galician as a cultured and literary language. This process is aggravated by the formation of modern states and the appearance of the concept of the \\"nation-state\\", which entails a linguistic uniformity and administration as a factor of cohesion of political structures. thumb200pxThe illustrated Friar Benito Jer√≥nimo Feijoo claimed the recognition of the Galician language . During a long period of three centuries (the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth) denominated the \\"dark centuries,\\" the Galician language, compared to Castilian and Portuguese, was practically absent from written works in the Iberian Peninsula and during this period began a process of codification and grammatical and spelling fixation that gives a category of cultural languages. In addition, their use extends over the entire population of the states of Spain and Portugal, respectively. In contrast, the exclusively oral use of the language has led to a progressive dialectalization and fragmentation of the language, disabling its literary and scientific use. In this way the Galician language was left out of the literary trends of the Renaissance and Baroque, which coincide with the so-called \\"Golden Age\\" of Castilian literature. There are, however, scarce written testimonies (such as letters addressed to Diego Sarmiento of Acu√±a, count of Gondomar), documents and a few literary samples that allow us to appreciate the situation of the language at the time. Parallel to the space in scholarly literature, a popular poem survives in lullabies, blind songs, carnival songs, riddles, legends, romances, tales, farces, etc. Many of these literary expressions survived until today through oral transmission. In the eighteenth century, some voices of denunciation of the so-called \\"enlightened\\" arose that showed their concern for the underdevelopment of Galicia and offered renewing proposals for economic, social and cultural life. Among this minority group of intellectuals, the figure of Father Mart√≠n Sarmiento forcefully stands out, a versatile character-naturalist, linguist, and book lover who defended the use of Galician in teaching, administration and the church, that is, its normalization as the language of the Galicians. Also participating were Father Benito Jer√≥nimo Feijoo, the first scholar to reject the status of the \\"dialect\\" of Galician and Father Sobreira, who continued the lexicographical work of Sarmiento. His work constituted the first call of attention to the linguistic problem that will manifest itself in its entirety starting in the second half of nineteenth century.  The Resurgence  \\"Rexurdimento\\" (Resurgence) is the name by which the nineteenth century is known in the history of Galician language and expresses a clear path of recovery, not only literary, but also cultural, political and historical. Since the French invasion and the War of Independence in 1809, and later among the clashes between absolutists and liberals in the whole of Spain, texts written in Galician arose, in loose sheets or journals used for propaganda. Some called the peasants to defend the country, others defended liberal ideas. Throughout the century, after the end of absolutism and the start of a constitutional monarchy, various Galician movements were born, based in the defense of the uniqueness of the different personalities of Galicia. The first of them, emerged around the decade of the 1840s is called \\"Provincialism\\", which denounced the social marginalization of Galicia and looked for a social revaluation of its art, customs and history. The provincials were separated from politics after their support for the failed military uprising of Miguel Sol√≠s and the execution of the Martyrs of Carral, and the survivors and followers of this movement were limited in the cultural and literary world. The second Galician generation gave rise to the movement of \\"Regionalism\\" that combined culture and politics, making the Galician language their primary concern. On the road to linguistic and literary recovery, the first Floral Games were celebrated in the city of Coru√±a in 1861. Award-winning compositions, together with samples of contemporary poetry, were collected a year later in the \\"Charity Album\\", the first anthology of the Galician Resurgence. The first Galician book published in the nineteenth century is \\"The Galician Bagpipe\\" by Xoan Manuel Pintos in 1852, but the publication of \\"Galician Songs\\" in 1863, the work of the renowned poet Rosal√≠a de Castro is the work that definitively opens the Resurgence. 1880 was also a fruitful year for publications in Galician, compositions from the most famous poets of the era appeared: \\"Follas Novas\\" by Rosal√≠a de Castro,\\"Aires da mi√±a terra\\" by Manuel Curros Enr√≠quez, and \\"Saudades gallegas\\" by Valent√≠n Lamas Carvajal. Six years later \\"Queixumes dos pinos\\" by Eduardo Pondal appeared. The quality of the work by Rosal√≠a de Castro transcends the borders of Galician and with her publications in Castilian \\"In the shores of Sar\\" she also becomes a prominent poet in the Castilian language and in universal literature. Her verses have been the subject of many studies and have been translated into many diverse languages. Manuel Curros Enr√≠quez is one of the most popular Galician writers of his time. No doubt because of his poetry denouncing the injustices of Galician society (forums, oppression, emigration...) and defending progressive ideas. He established a tradition of combative poetry that numerous Galician authors would continue (Ram√≥n Cabanillas, Celso Emilio Ferreiro, etc.). Eduardo Pondal, author of \\"Queixumes dos pinos\\" (which was adapted and converted into a Galician hymn), investigates the prehistoric roots of Galicia, highlighting the Celtic element and creating a poem to enhance the individuality of the Galician language. He tried to reinforce the language as a literary and cultural language. These and other authors broadened the literary boundaries of the Galician language, which was spread by lyric, narrative, essay and didactic prose. The consolidation of Galician prose does not happen until the twentieth century, but at the end of the nineteenth century some important precedents already existed. Such as \\"M√°xima ou a filla esp√∫rea\\" (1880) by Marcial Valladares, the first contemporary Galician novel. A work that was widespread among the working class \\"O catecimos do labrego\\" by Valent√≠n Lamas Carvajal. \\"A tecederia de Bonaval\\", \\"Castelo de Hambre\\" and \\"O ni√±o de Pombas\\" made Antonio L√≥pez Ferreiro the best prose writer of the time. The theater was the least cultivated genre. Since the publication of \\"A Casamenteira\\" in 1812 until the decade of the 1880s no theater-related writings were published. Also in the last decades of the nineteenth century the first grammatical rules and dictionaries of the Galician language emerged. Essential for its normalization, among those that stand out, the \\"Compendio de gram√°tica gallega-castellana\\" (1864) by Francisco Mir√°s, and \\"Gram√°tica Gallega\\" by Saco and Arce, a scholarly study of the Galician language. The presence of the Galician language in journalism contributed enormously to its prestige. In the year 1876 \\"O T√≠o Marcos da Portela\\" is published, edited and promoted by Valent√≠n Lamas Carvajal, the pioneer of newspapers written entirely in Galician. The success of this newspaper, which was marked with a nature of tyranny, was spectacular. Between the years 1886 and 1888 journalism in Galicia was gradually consolidated, with the appearance of new monolingual initiatives: ‚ÄúO Galiciano‚Äù in Pontevedra; \\"A Monteira\\" in Lugo; and \\"As Burgas\\" in Ourense. One of the last demonstrations of the Resurgence, already in the 20th century, was the constitution of the Royal Galician Academy in 1905.  The Twentieth Century  = The Start of the Twentieth Century = A. Vilar Ponte was an important member of the Irmandades of Fala. At the end of the nineteenth century, the recovery of Galician as a literary, historical and cultural language was confirmed; in addition, a decrease in the level of oral use became obvious, in a large part due to the consolidation of teaching in Castilian. The Galician language had not yet reached a normalized situation, which caused a social setback in the upper and middle classes, especially in urban environments. The socio- political activity contrasts with the prolific cultural activity. The Galician society of the early twentieth century is still characterized by the concentration of economic power in sections of minority, with an agricultural system in which medieval influences remained and with a growing emigration that demographically emptied the country. Agrarian associations rose that channeled social protests and had powerful resonance among the peasants; this was the case of the Agrarian League of Galician Action. The awareness of the peasantry, encouraged by the access to land ownership, together with the progressive evolution of Galicians towards nationalism, provoked a qualitative jump in the utilization of the Galician language. Nationalism was linked to language as the essence of collective identity, whose first manifestations were the \\"Irmandades da Fala\\". These associations, created for the defense, dignity, and cultivation of the language, arose first in Coru√±a in 1916. They were followed by other main cities and villages of Galicia, Ferrol, Ourense, Betanzoa, Santiago de Compostela, etc. For the diffusion of their ideas, they created a newspaper of expression, completely in Galician: \\"A Nosa Terra\\". Its most outstanding members were the brothers Villar Ponte, Antonio Losada Di√©guez, Vicente Risco, and Ram√≥n Cabanillas. In 1918 the \\"First Galician Nationalist Assembly\\" was held, which demanded the full integral autonomy of Galicia and the inclusion of Galicia in the League of Nations in Geneva. The Irmandades promoted the elaboration of dictionaries and grammatical books, linguistics studied and reclaimed the presence of Galician in administration and teaching. They promoted publishing activity in the main cities of Galicia, Celtic in Ferrol, Lar in Coru√±a, Alborada in Ponteverda and many others, as well as frequent sections in Galician in the Castilian press. In this context, the magazine \\"N√≥s\\" by Vicente Risco appears, Ram√≥n Otero Pedrayo and Florentino Cuevillas, that formed the so-called \\"Grupo N√≥s\\". The figure of Alfonso Daniel Rodr√≠guez Castelao will later be linked to them. = 1920 and 1930 = The members of \\"N√≥s\\", with a wide and diverse intellectual formation, set its goal of eliminating the burden of nineteenth-century folklore in Galician culture through its updating, normalization and universalization of literary, artistic and scientific trends of the period.http://culturagalega.gal/imaxes/docs/expo_europa.pdf Europa e a xeraci√≥n N√≥s. The journal \\"N√≥s\\" counted on the collaboration of diverse authors (Portuguese, Irish, Catalans, French...), that supported different European perspectives, in addition to the translation of various articles of scientific‚Äîarchaeological, anthropological, sociological‚Äîand literary nature. The use of Galician in scientific studies was promoted by the creation of \\"Seminar of Galician Studies\\" (1923) dedicated to investigations about Galician reality in all of its manifestations. It was founded by a group of young university students: Ferm√≠n Bouza Brey, Filgueira Valverde, Lois Tob√≠o...which others soon joined, such as Ricardo Carvalho Calero, Antonio Fraguas, or Xaqu√≠n Lorenzo. The literary work of these intellectuals, who covered fields like the essay, opened new horizons that provided Galician prose with a comprehensive development of the Galician language in European contexts. \\"Arredor de si\\", \\"Devalar\\" or \\"Os cami√±os da vida\\" by Ram√≥n Otero Pedrayo and \\"Os europeos en Abrantes\\" and \\"O porco de p√©\\" by Vicente Risco, are titles that incorporated Galician literature into universal, legendary themes and exotic, urban and philosophical thoughts of new creative techniques that were being developed in European literature. Castelao, One of the craftsmen of the first Statute of Galicia. The weak tradition of the dramatic genre received some momentum with the creation of the Irmandades of Fala of the National Conservatory of Galician Art in 1919, that would later become the Galician School of Drama. The avant-garde European movements were not oblivious to Galician verse. The authors of the so-called \\"Generation of 25\\"-Manuel Antonio, Luis Amado Carballo, Ferm√≠n Bouza Brey-demonstrated a great will for creative originality based on the confrontation of the traditional forms of poetry. The versatile figure of Castelao deserves mention. A classic in Galician literature, he manifested his art in diverse areas: novel, theater, short narrative and political essay as well as in the field of drawing. \\"Always in Galiza‚Äù, the ultimate work of Galician nationalism, and other works jointly reflect his capacity as an artist and a writer. Castelao entails a great political significance embodied in his essay works and in his active and direct participation in the politics of Spain (he was the Deputy of the Republic in the ranks of the Galician Party). The Galician Party was created in 1931, and it got the approval of the first Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, in which the Galician language first acquired its recognition as the \\"official language of Galicia\\". This important achievement did not have a practical implication in reality because of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), which marked the beginning of the most difficult period for the unofficial languages of Spain. = From 1936 to 1950 = The end of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of Franco's dictatorship brought about the disappearance of the Galician language from the public scene, as well as teaching and social economic activities.Lenguas silenciadas a golpe de prohibici√≥n Archived 6 April 2009 en Wayback Machine., Public (in Castilian). Many Galician intellectuals‚ÄîCastelao, Eduardo Blanco Amor, Luis Seoane, Rafael Dieste‚Äîhad to go into exile, but they maintained the culture and identity of Galicia while in exile. The cultural development of Galician was revived in the setting of emigration and exile in Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico and Cuba, among other countries. The social situation of the Galician language was worsened with the enforcement of obligatory schooling from a basic level and later with the popularization of media coverage, which used Castilian as its only vehicle of expression. In this adverse context Galician autonomy did not disappear completely, but rather, as Franco's dictatorship softened its measures of repression, it timidly began to manifest itself in the cultural environment, albeit dissociated from the politics of the previous period. In 1947, four works of poetry were published in Galician. Several decisive elements were the collection of Benito Soto poetry, the publishing house of Galician Bibliophiles and the weekly bilingual edition of the cosmopolitan newspaper \\"The Night\\". The key piece in the recovery of the written use of Galician was the creation of the Editorial Galaxia in 1950. Its main promoters, Ram√≥n Otero Pedrayo, Francisco Fern√°ndez of Riego and others, once again demonstrated the validity of the Galician language for any genre or theme. Galacia became the centerpiece of several published periodicals: \\"The Economic Magazine of Galicia\\", the magazine of culture and art \\"Atl√°ntida\\" and the journal of thought \\"Grial,\\" were prohibited one year following its emergence. = The 1960s = Beginning in 1960 a set of changes in the economic and social environment of Galician occurred that were accompanied by the lessening of censorship from Franco. Examples of this openness of the regime were the possibility of the appearance of previously prohibited publications like \\"Grial\\", the celebration of \\"The Day of the Galician Letters\\" promoted by the Royal Galician Academy, the expansion of the publishing world with \\"Castro Publications\\", as well as the rise of new cultural associations in defense of the Galician language, such as \\"O Facho\\", \\"O Galo\\", and the cultural association of Vigo. The Galician University was not left out of these concerns and took an active part in the creation of the Chair of Galician Language and Literature in 1965 headed by Ricardo Carvalho Calero. Six years later the Galician Institute of Language was born, with developed research work until today. The literary production of Galician, parallel to the rest of Spain, resumed a solid production. Once again the lyric poetry was responsible for the start of the literary revival. \\"Longa noite de pedra\\" (1962), by Celso Emilio Ferreiro, represents the social and civic line characterized by Galician poetry in the decade of the 1960s. Lueiro Rey, Bernardino Gra√±a and Manuel Mar√≠a are some of the authors of poetry that tried to combine the political discourse with the literary. Galician narrative suffers a gap from 1936 to 1951, the year that Ricardo Caravalho Calero published his first novel, \\"The People of Barreira\\". Between the decades of 1950 and 1960 three great authors emerge, √Ålvaro Cunqueiro, Eduardo Blanco Amor and √Ånxel Fole, who from their particular narrative forms created a work of universally recognized quality. Other authors of the 1960s are Gonzalo Mourullo, M√©ndez Ferr√≠n, they echo the literary innovations of the European narrative, constituting the so-called \\"New Narrative\\", a renewing and revitalizing movement of Galician prose. = 1970 and 1980 = The establishment of democracy as of 1975, after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco, allowed the consolidation of the previous genres and the opening of new horizons in different literary fields in response to the demands of a free society. Galicia went from being a land that primarily produced poetry to interesting and involving more people in literature, producing books, political chronicles, and reviews, as well as diverse types of Essays: sociolinguistic and literary (Basilio Losada, Francisco Pillado), theological and religious (Andr√©s Torres Queiruga, Chao Rego), philosophical (Mart√≠nez Marzoa), and historical (Ram√≥n Villares, Felipe Sen√©n, Xos√© Ram√≥n Barreiro). In narrative, the tendencies diversified and the authors who began to make themselves known before 1975 (like Maria Ros√© Queiz√°n, Alfredo Conde, Paco Mart√≠n, etc.) united in a very heterogeneous collection of writers (V√≠ctor Freixanes, Xavier Alcal√°, Carlos Gonz√°lez Reigosa, Suso de Toro, Manuel Rivas, Fern√°ndez Paz) that amplified the narrative types: historical, political, erotic, realistic, etc. There are also editions of books that arose aimed at younger readers in children's collections (Merl√≠n, Sotelo Blanco Infantil, etc.) and collections for young readers (Xabar√≠n, Doce por Vintedous, F√≥ra de Xogo, Gaivota, √Årbore, etc.), which constituted a large contribution to the normalization of Galician literature. Poetry was also renewed. M√©ndez Ferr√≠n and Arcadio L√≥pez Casanova, with the appearance of their poetry in 1976, marked a richer direction more open to multiple influences. Dar√≠o Xoh√°n Cabana, Xulio Valc√°rcel, Rodr√≠guez Fer, Manuel Rivas and many other authors contributed and continue to contribute to the enlargement of a genre established from the beginning of literature in the Galician language in the Middle Ages. The dramatic genre experienced an intense transformation in the second half of the twentieth century. The work of authors of the immediate post-war period, like √Ålvaro Cunqueiro or Ricardo Carvalho Calero, coexisted with the work of the new, such as Manuel Mar√≠a, Vidal Bola√±o, or Manuel Lourenzo, who sought a formal break with the old tendencies. They all opened the theatrical world to the tendencies of the novel. The emergence at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s of the phenomenon of the Independent Theater Groups (e.g., O Facho, Teatro Circo) stands out. In these years, associations are spreading that attempt to strengthen the theater, especially by approaching young audiences. In the year 1978, Galicia, like the rest of Spain, once again had a democratic constitution which in its articles proclaims it \\"will protect all of the Spaniards and the people of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions\\", while at the same time laying the foundation for a new legal-political configuration: The Autonomous State. With the democratic regime, Galicia converted to an autonomous community, taking Galician and Castilian as its official languages, although the constitution marks the right and duty to know Castilian to all citizens it only gave the duty to know Galician to Galician citizens. In parallel with legislation regulating the uses of the language, came the creation of a standard language beyond different dialects. The Institute of Galician Language, created in 1971, and the Royal Galician Academy proposed the \\"Orthographic and morphological norms of the Galician language\\" in 1982, which reached an official status with the enactment of the \\"Law of Linguistic Normalization.\\" The recent revising and updating of these norms, which incorporated some reintegration positions, is from the year 2003. In the year 1985 the Television of Galicia and Radio Galicia arose. The first was (and is) a fundamental channel to maintain the presence of the Galician language in audio-visual media communications and contributed to its normalization in this area that up until then was quite unsatisfied. As far as Radio Galicia was concerned, it also had the merit of maintaining a monolingual radio channel of quality and with interest in its own culture. Galician Television especially addressed topics and fought prejudices, showing people of diverse nationalities and times speaking in Galician.  The 21st century  In the beginning of the 21st century the Galician language remained alive, protected by the current legislation and its high number of speakers, yet it still faces challenges. From the current studies of the Galician social- linguistics,VV.AA., A sociedade galega e o idioma. A evoluci√≥n socioling√º√≠stica de Galicia (1992‚Äì2003), Consello da Cultura Galega, 2005. http://consellodacultura.gal/mediateca/pubs.pdf/lingua_sociedade.pdf an improvement is observed regarding the attitude and perception of Galician, most importantly in reading ability. However, at the level of a vehicular or habitual language, and also as a native language, the Galician language is currently losing speakers, so that in recent generations there are more Castilian speakers than Galician speakers. This data is confirmed, for example, among other sources in a report of the School Council of Galicia which notes that only 30% of the students in primary school use the Galician language (data from the courses 2002‚Äì2003, 2003‚Äì2004 and 2004‚Äì2005). For this reason it seemed necessary to have greater government involvement and in the year 2007 the Galician Parliament made a deal for the creation of a new agreement that guaranteed they would be able to reach a minimum of 50% of the teaching in Galician; this goal was also promoted by the creation of the Galician pre-schools, and nursery schools in which they use Galician as the vehicular language. According to a report from October 2007 from the Sociolinguistic Seminar of the Royal Galician Academy, only 20.6% of children have their initial language as Galician. In 1992 the same seminar estimated this datum to be 60.3%. In the cities the results are worse; it is estimated that only 1.6% of those from Ferrol and 4.3% of those from Vigo have Galician as their initial language, while in Coru√±a it is 6.3%, in Ourense 9.1%, in Ponteverda 9.4%, in Lugo 17.9% and in Santiago 18.4%.

The station was owned by Big Chief Broadcasting Company alongside KLPR radio (1140 AM, now KRMP). KLPR-TV was the second television station in Oklahoma City to be known as such. In November 1953, a previous \\"KLPR-TV\\", also associated with the radio station, had started up on channel 19. That station's actual callsign was KMPT; it would go dark in February 1955. History KLPR-TV, Inc., filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a new television station on channel 19 at Oklahoma City‚Äîthe same allocation used by the former KLPR-TV/KMPT‚Äîin 1962. The company, owned by KLPR radio owners Jack Beasley and Leon C. Nance and automobile dealer W.T. \\"Dub\\" Richardson, proposed to build TV facilities at the KLPR site on 600 SE 79th Street. The FCC granted the application February 24, 1965, and the station planned to go on air from facilities on the 23rd floor of the Sheraton Oklahoma City hotel downtown. The station would not go on the air from those facilities, however, nor would it telecast on channel 19. Before the station launched, the FCC would amend the UHF table of allotments nationwide in Docket 14229, requiring KLPR-TV to amend its filing to specify channel 14 instead of 19. During construction of the station's tower, a worker was trapped in the air for more than an hour and was rescued using an improvised safety system. The station went on air May 31, 1966, with a unique and pioneering schedule consisting almost entirely of country and western programming, matching KLPR, at the time Oklahoma City's only country music station. The only program out of the format was a contemporary teen dance show, which Oklahoma City did not have. In total, 25 of the station's 56 weekly hours of programming were live productions. KLPR-TV initially signed on at 4 p.m. and went off the air at midnight, carrying newscasts at :55 of every hour and a 15-minute newscast at 10 p.m. The news service utilized the resources of KLPR radio and also provided a daypart extension, as KLPR radio was (and is) a daytime-only station. Another highlight of the schedule was a talk show hosted by Beasley, \\"Tonight in Oklahoma\\". Local programs were produced from a studio in a building constructed next to the AM transmitter site. The station later expanded its broadcast day to start at 2:45 p.m., and in August 1967, it received FCC approval to transmit stock market ticker tape with background tape between 9:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. for a one-year trial. In September 1966, KLPR-TV suddenly found itself in the courts in two lawsuits. In one, the station sued two companies that provided low-light camera equipment that failed to work as expected for $55,000; in the other, singer Roy Wendell Ware claimed that the station failed to pay him for recording performances and other appearances. Some of the principals of KLPR-TV were also part-owners of a proposed station for Tulsa, KTOW-TV (channel 29), which would have had a similar format and shared programming with KLPR-TV; Beasley also sought to start up a similar TV station in Fort Smith, Arkansas. KLPR-TV went off the air in December 1967 or early 1968. In July 1968, the radio station applied to remove the TV antenna from its tower.FCC History Cards - KLPR Channel 14 would not reemerge in Oklahoma City until KTBO-TV signed on the air in 1981. However, KLPR-TV, Inc., would remain in the courts for years. The station had leased equipment from the Visual Electronics Corporation to begin broadcasting. After falling behind on its lease payments, the lease was renegotiated, and after channel 14 left the air, it was assigned to Noark Broadcasting, which held the construction permit for channel 36 at Fayetteville, Arkansas, KGTO-TV. Not long after KGTO hit the air in February 1969, it complained about the quality of the equipment and stopped making lease payments. In March 1971, a federal judge found that Visual knew the equipment was defective, a judgment reaffirmed the next year in appeals court in KLPR-TV, Inc., vs. Visual Electronics Corporation.

Born into a family of teachers, Gottschall was a resident of the Mennonite community of Franconia, Pennsylvania. His father, Jacob Gottschall, was a preacher and bishop as well as a sometime teacher; with his students he produced books of musical notation. Three of Samuel's siblings were educators as well; one, Martin, also produced fraktur. Neither of the two signed his work, and it is difficult to tell the two apart; their paintings have become popular among collectors because of the colors and imagery employed in their creation. Neither of the two men married; they worked as millers after the end of their teaching careers, operating a property on Perkiomen Creek in Salford. Samuel was a weaver as well, and among his surviving documents are his weaver's record book and weather diary, both of which have proven instrumental in identifying his work. Surviving frakturs from Gottschall date to the years 1833 to 1836, and do not appear to postdate his teaching career. Several of his works are in the collection of the Mennonite Heritage Center. Others are owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Free Library of Philadelphia and the American Folk Art Museum. Gottschall's style inspired other artists, including John Derstine Souder.

She gained world-wide media attention from a picture of her taken by Lana Haroun that went viral in April 2019. The image of Salah has been dubbed as \\"Woman in White\\" or \\"Lady Liberty\\" of Sudan. As a member of MANSAM, one of the main Sudanese women's networks who signed the 1 January 2019 Forces of Freedom and Change declaration, Salah gave a speech at the 29 October 2019 meeting of the United Nations Security Council, insisting that in the Sudanese transitionary institutions women have equal representation to men. Early life and education Alaa Salah was born in either 1996 or 1997. Her mother is a fashion designer and her father works in the construction industry. She studies engineering and architecture at Sudan International University in Khartoum. 2018‚Äì19 Sudan protests/Revolution Since December 2018, a series of protests against President Omar al-Bashir took place, demanding economic reforms and the resignation of the president. A state of emergency was declared in February 2019 as a result of the protests. 6 and 7 April saw the largest protests since the declaration of the state of emergency. In continuing protests, the army was seen protecting protesters from the security forces on 10 April. Eventually the protests led to the military removing al-Bashir from power, installing a transitional council in his place led by Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf, but the demonstrators, including Salah, claimed it was just a change of leadership of the same regime and demanded a civilian transitional council. =Photograph= As protests continued, on 8 April Lana Haroun took an image of an initially unnamed woman dressed in a white thoub standing on a car, who spoke to and sang with other women around her during a sit-in near the army headquarters and the presidential palace. The image was widely shared on social media and caught international media attention. The image has been described as symbolic of the crucial role of women in the success of the demonstrations, since the vast majority of protesters, almost 70 per cent, have been women. Sudanese women played major political roles in Sudanese and Africa-wide human rights struggles since the 1950s via the Sudanese Women's Union, continued creating organisations such as the No to Oppression against Women Initiative in 2009, and remained politically active during the 2018‚Äì2019 Sudanese Revolution. Salah's white robe, a traditional Sudanese thoub, recalled the dress of female Sudanese protesters against previous dictatorships, as well as that of student protesters who were referred to as \\"Kandakas\\" after ancient Nubian queens. Her golden earrings are traditional feminine wedding attire. Commentators called the pose \\"the image of the revolution\\". Hala Al-Karib, a Sudanese women's rights activist said: \\"It is a symbol of an identity of a working woman ‚Äî a Sudanese woman that's capable of doing anything, but still appreciates her culture.\\" =MANSAM and UNSC speech= As a member of MANSAM, one of the major Sudanese women's networks who signed the 1 January 2019 Forces of Freedom and Change declaration, Salah gave a speech at the 29 October 2019 meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Salah stated that despite women often having constituted 70% of protestors, they were \\"side-lined in the formal political process\\" of creating transitional institutions. She stated that women's representation in the new governance structure \\"[fell] far below [their] demand of 50% parity\\". She argued that \\"there is no excuse for [women] not to have an equal seat at every single table\\". She summarised her argument for women's representation stating, Salah also called for judicial accountability and disarmament; and for the political process to be inclusive of women, \\"civil society, resistance groups, ethnic and religious minorities, those who have been displaced, and people with disabilities to lead to sustainable peace\\".

A mezzo-soprano, she appeared in leading roles in many operas, particularly in the original productions of Berlioz's operas B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict and Les Troyens. Life She was born in Saujon, Charente-Maritime, and was taught music by Bizot of Bordeaux. In 1842 she made her d√©but there as Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor. She sang in Toulouse and in 1846 in Brussels. In July of the same year she made a successful d√©but at Drury Lane in London, as Madeleine in Le postillon de Lonjumeau and also appeared in La Juive in England in July, and with great success as Ang√®le in Le domino noir. In 1847 she married Jules-Antoine Demeur, a flautist from Belgium, whom she met at Drury Lane. He subsequently travelled with his wife on her engagements.\\"Charton-Demeur, Anne\\" Laura Williams Macy, editor. The Grove Book of Opera Singers. Oxford University Press, 2008. In 1849 and 1850 she was the principal female singer in John Mitchell's French opera company at St James's Theatre in London, and became highly popular in various light parts, many of which were new to England. These included Ang√®le, Henriette in L'ambassadrice, Isabelle in Le pr√© aux clercs, Zanetta in Auber's opera of that name, Laurette in Richard Coeur-de-lion, Ad√®le in Auber's Le concert √† la cour, Lucrezia in Act√©on, the Queen of L√©on in Boisselot's Ne touchez pas √† la reine, The Countess in Le comte Ory, Anna in La dame blanche, Camille in Zampa, Rose de Mai in Le val d'Andorre, Virginie in Le ca√Ød, and Catarina in Les diamants de la couronne. The critic Henry Chorley wrote: \\"She made an impression when singing in French comic opera by her pleasing voice and appearance and by a certain cosiness of manner which was very charming\\". In 1852 she appeared in July at Her Majesty's Theatre as Amina in La sonnambula, and in August in the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha's Casilda. Having sung with little success in 1849 and 1853 at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris, she adopted the Italian stage, and appeared successfully in St Petersburg, Vienna, in North and South America, and in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien as Desdemona in Rossini's Otello in 1862. In August of that year, Anne Charton-Demeur played the heroine in the original production of Berlioz's B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict, so much to the composer's satisfaction that he requested her to play Dido in Les Troyens, first produced at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, opening on 4 November 1863. Berlioz wrote in his M√©moires about her great beauty, her passionate acting and singing as Dido, although she had not sufficient voice wholly to realise his ideal heroine, and her generosity in accepting the engagement at a pecuniary loss to herself, a more lucrative offer having been made her for an engagement in Madrid. On the conclusion of the run of the opera she sang at Madrid, but afterwards returned to the Lyrique, where, in May 1866, she played Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. After formally retiring from singing about 1869, she appeared occasionally in concerts. She died in Paris in 1892.

Initially he made (cartoon-like) comics and landscapes with pencil and ink. During the last year of secondary school he painted his first oil paintings. In 1977 he started the teacher training course at the D‚ÄôWitte Lelie in Amsterdam. The autonomous artists training appealed much more to him but was frowned upon by his parents. Convinced that he was not learning anything at the art academy, he left after only six weeks, together with his girlfriend (also a student at the D‚ÄôWitte Lelie) who later became his wife, Laura de Grijs (1949-2010). As an autodidact he further developed his art and art skills. Having initially occupied himself with various themes and subjects, after several years he eventually devoted himself to still life painting, although he remained interested in the nude, portraits, landscapes and (dilapidated) cityscapes. Perspective (1982). Example of a cityscape (Collection Amsterdam Museum) After meeting graphic artist J.M. van Lieshout in 1979, M√∏hlmann taught himself the art of etching.

His goal was to enforce a more realistic view of the objects.(Dutch) Galerie Lieve hemel,14e jrg, no 1, Koen Nieuwendijk, exhibition 11 September ‚Äì 6 October 1981 Henceforth M√∏hlmann consistently painted 1:1, i.e. the actual size of the object as seen. During the eighties the painter began a number of projects and series. One of them being the so-called Cantoproject (later called the Canto Collection), which could very well be considered his \\"magnum opus\\" and comprises the period 1982-1993. It has the subtitle \\"a glance at reality\\", and includes 124 paintings. All paintings have the same size and always show one and the same tin can (of the fictitious brand Canto) at the same place in the painting. Furthermore, the tin has always been depicted in the same size and is perceived at the same angle. Due to the constantly changing environment of the can, the series as a whole grew into a kind of pictorial adventure within the context of (seemingly) everyday reality. He also produced the series ‚ÄòDamaged‚Äô or ‚ÄòDestroyed Canvasses‚Äô, in which the illusion is created that the canvas is torn or damaged.(Dutch) Galerie Lieve hemel, 16e jrg., no. 1, Koen Nieuwendijk, exhibition 11 September ‚Äì 18 October 1983(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôTussen waarneming en werkelijkheid,‚Äô‚Äô Kunstwerk 4, 1996 During 1984 he worked on ‚ÄòThe Cube‚Äô (‚ÄòA Contemporary Allegory‚Äô) for almost nine months. The work consists of 5 panels that together form a cabinet in which and on which all kinds of everyday objects are painted, often with a symbolic meaning.‚Äô‚ÄôThe Refined Image,‚Äô‚Äô Koen Nieuwendijk, uitg. Lieve Hemel Editions-Amsterdam , 1985, page 12-13 In 1985 the painter started with ‚ÄòThe Balance Series‚Äô, in which he placed a still life on an empty canvas. Initially this was a single object, but over time increasingly complex stackings emerged.(Dutch) Galerie Lieve hemel, 21e jrg., no. 1, Koen Nieuwendijk, exhibition 12 August ‚Äì 24 September 1988 = Further development as an artist = During 1990 M√∏hlmann paints his first ‚ÄòTop-down painting‚Äô. This is a still life that is observed perpendicularly from above, with the vanishing point at the centre of the earth instead of on the horizon. He developed this method after an idea in Canto 86 ‚ÄòGround pattern‚Äô, where the tin is seen lying on the ground. M√∏hlmann comes to the conclusion that in art there is the frog‚Äôs and bird‚Äôs-eye view, but not a line of sight from the zenith to the nadir. He calls this \\"falcon- perspective\\" and the work method \\"praying above the image\\". This, because he \\"floats\\" above his subject for a long time, in order to afterwards record it by heart in the painting.(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôBlik op de werkelijkheid‚Äô‚Äô, Atelier 75, juli-augustus 1998, \\"About an Absolute Realist\\" by Gerard van de Weerd In 1993 M√∏hlmann paints the last Canto, because, in his own words, ‚Äúhe also needs to bring home the bacon‚Äù. The 124 paintings are one complete series and therefore not one Canto has ever been sold.(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôRob verlangt zo naar zijn blikje‚Äô‚Äô, De Telegraaf, Weekeinde-bijlage, March 22nd 1997 (Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôHet Cantoproject 1982-1993‚Äô‚Äô, Van Soeren & Co-Amsterdam, 1997, with an introduction by drs J. Jacobs(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôCanto Collectie,‚Äô‚Äô Uitgave Museum M√∏hlmann-Appingedam, 2010, complete catalog In the years between 1993 and 2013, M√∏hlmann produces many still life paintings, with a predominant theme of dilapidation and decay of the objects. The painter tries to paint the objects as natural as possible. M√∏hlmann begins with another series called ‚ÄòFramed‚Äô(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôZoektocht naar de werkelijkheid‚Äô‚Äô, Van Soeren & Co-Amsterdam, 2003, with an introduction by D. Kraaijpoel en G. van de Riet (dated between 1998 and 2002). He places a frame somewhere in his studio, seemingly at random, and then paints what can be seen within the frame. It is noticeable that during the years 2000-2013 many dead animals (birds, mice, frogs) appear in his work, often painted from various angles. = Phasing out of artists career = After the death of his wife and muse Laura M√∏hlmann, in 2010, Rob M√∏hlmann hardly paints anymore. Since 2010 only a handful of works left the artist‚Äôs studio and he completed a few paintings which stood waiting, some of them for ten years. One of the last paintings is Broken Blue in which a self-portrait is combined with a very early drawing of Laura M√∏hlmann together with a still life of a broken blue bowl. After this he focuses mainly on the further development of Museum M√∏hlmann. Rob M√∏hlmann was awarded Damster of the Year in 2014 and Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2017. Museum M√∏hlmann successively received the public award in 2017 and 2018: the Golden Museum Discovery Award.  Autonomy and style  Although he works as a painter in the realistic tradition, specialized in still life painting, he does not belong to any particular school of thought or movement. Rather, he sees himself primarily as an independent realist painter. His work is characterized by the everyday nature of his subject matter, executed with great precision and a virtuoso expression of surface matter.(Dutch) Het messcherpe realisme van Rob M√∏hlmann, De Stem, 30 January 1997 In the field of still life painting he has contributed to (sometimes literally), new visual compository angles and a fresh, different approach. With this he has blown new life into the old-fashioned image of still life painting. Diederik Kraaijpoel, artist and advocate of figurative art, wrote: \\"His work is painted with a dissecting knife. (....) The object is disassembled and reconstructed. This is not merely about observing, but also seeking to understand what the world is made of. Therefore the objects are immersed in an immense feeling of intensity. It is as if the objects are charged with meaning, something they do not possess of themselves. Therein, and not only in the stories, lies the ‚Äòmagical‚Äô.\\"(Dutch) Zoektocht naar de werkelijkheid, Van Soeren & Co-Amsterdam, 2003, Diederik Kraaijpoel page 9(Dutch) Scherpschilder, Van Soeren & Co - Amsterdam, 1998 ; autobiography until 1998Ost Friesland Magazine-8, 2011, page 64 \\"In altmeisterlicher Feinmalerei un in der Tompe-L‚Äôoeil-Manier, also in der Art einer Augent√§uschung untersucht er in Farbe de Wirklichkeit und hat dabei zugleich die M√∂glichkeiten des klassischen Stillebens in vielvacher Weise ausgelotet und erweitert.\\" (Dr. L√ºbbert R. Haneborger).(Dutch) Zoektocht der Werkelijkheid, 2003, page 10: \\"Door ongebruikelijke gezichtspunten in te nemen breidt M√∏hlmann zijn waarnemingsveld uit en komt dan tot nog niet geziene dingen.\\" (Gezien van de Riet, kunstenaar, publicist).(Dutch) Stil even... 2004, page 23: \\"Wat zich door hem aan mij ontsloot was opnieuw een compleet universum aan visuele sensaties. .

Rob M√∏hlmann is a self-taught painter. He has developed himself autonomously in terms of technique and style, but also conceptually. Therefore, it is hard to detect any external influences in his work. Diederik Kraaijpoel wrote about M√∏hlmann‚Äôs painting: \\"We are reminded of the Flemish Primitives (...).\\"(Dutch) ‚Äô‚ÄôZoektocht naar de werkelijkheid,‚Äô‚Äô Van Soeren & Co-Amsterdam, 2003, Diederik Kraaijpoel page 9 One of the most famous Flemish Primitives, Jan van Eyck, appears in M√∏hlmann‚Äôs work as early as 1984 on a painted cube to which legs are attached thus transforming it into a table. Top right, in the \\"fourth plane\\" of The Cube, part of the painting Man with the Red Turban, is to be seen. This was presumably a self-portrait of Jan van Eyck. Portrait of a Man in a Turban (Jan van Eyck).jpgMan with the Red Turban (1433, presumably self-portrait Jan van Eyck) Rob M√∏hlmann, De Kubus, een hedendaagse allegorie, 1984-85, olieverf op paneel, 60x60x60cm.jpgThe Cube (1984-85), with above-right portrait of Jan van Eyck M√∏hlmann has a number of things in common with Van Eyck, such as the fascination for reflections, an in-depth observation of details and an exquisite expression of the paint surface. Detailed reflections, as can be seen in the mirror in the background of Van Eyck‚Äôs ‚ÄòPortrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife‚Äô (1434), are also common in M√∏hlmann‚Äôs work. An example of this is the reflection in the Christmas ball in the painting ‚ÄòHolland‚Äô (1985) where we can see the painter at work behind his easel as well as the window (with curtain) through which light enters. Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife (detail) - WGA7695.jpgVan Eyck, detail Rob M√∏hlmann Holland (1985) detail.jpgRob M√∏hlmann, detail In the speech M√∏hlmann gave in 2017 after receiving his royal decoration, he referred to the \\"loneliness\\" of the painter. In particular he mentioned Dick Ket, who, in the course of his short life, increasingly withdrew from public life. In his paintings Ket progressively focused solely on a few objects found around his house. These he rendered in razor-sharp still life paintings, working from a completely innovative \\"bird‚Äôs-eye view\\". With this he is a forerunner of M√∏hlmann, who takes this perspective even further by arriving at the so-called \\"falcon- perspective\\" observed perpendicularly from above. This resulted in M√∏hlmann creating a series of paintings called ‚ÄòTop-down paintings‚Äô. Dick-Ket (1902-1940), Stilleven met broodjes,1935, olieverf op doek 69,5x61cm.jpgDick Ket Still life with bread rolls, (1935) in bird-perspective Rob M√∏hlmann, Schilderstafeltje, 1990, olieverf op paneel, 40x50cm.jpgRob M√∏hlmann Painterstable, (1990) in falcon-perspective As well as an unusual perspective, M√∏hlmann and Dick Ket share an intensity of depiction, giving the still life objects a magical aura. Yet, with M√∏hlmann this cannot be called magical realism, because there is no other or higher reality present, let alone a hallucinatory or dreamlike world. Here reality is \\"exclusively\\" represented, although, due to the intensity of the paintings, we are able to perceive much more than everyday reality. Over time M√∏hlmann developed new ideas which resulted in a number of longer and shorter series, such as the 'Canto collection', the 'Balance series', the 'Framed series' and the 'Top- down paintings'. Rob M√∏hlmann could therefore be classified as a \\"conceptual realist\\". Next to his work as a painter, he also became a staunch advocate of realism and figuration.(Dutch) Voorvechter voor realisme, Dagblad van het Noorden, 28 September 2018(Dutch) https://www.volkskrant.nl/auteur/Rob%20M%C3%B8hlmann Completely against the spirit of the times, he defended figurative art in word and deed. From 1998 onward he continued this crusade by starting his own museum with yearly exhibitions and publications. In its 20 year existence, Museum M√∏hlmann has become a nationally recognized platform for figurative art.(Dutch) Het gaat puur om de schoonheid, Dagblad van het Noorden, 9 January 2018 An important yearly event is the Independent Realists' Exhibition (ORT - since 1998). The museum also houses a collection of contemporary figurative art, a collection of medieval art, 16th and 17th century prints, work and letters by Jan Mankes (1889-1920), work by M√∏hlmann's grandfather, J. C. Bus√© (1891-1974) and work by the painter himself.

The main task of the protecting agent is to protect the interest of his principal during the port call for which the shipping agent have been nominated or appointed by the party whose interest does not concur with those of the principal.Peter R. Brodie, Dictionary of Shipping Terms, 3rd ed. (Hong Kong: LLP Limited, 1997), 152. Premises A ship's port call requires an agent to handle a vast range of operations, which is usually take place at the remote locations far from ship owner's office. These operations are handled by the shipping agent on behalf of the ship owner. There could be two ways in which the shipping agents may become appointed or nominated to provide agency services. First, on the basis of the ship owner's own choice from the free agency services market. Second, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the charter party. In the latter case it is often the charterer's condition for the particular shipping agent to be appointed and it may be dictated by various reasons, but the most probably ‚Äì by the reason of close business relationships between the two. Also, local port regulations may leave no choice for the parties but to appoint certain agent. A shipping agent may be the part of the bigger stevedoring business that holds the contract with the charterer or shipper or simply be a \\"pocket agency\\" affiliated with the charterer. Such agent is commonly referred to as the charterer's agent.Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, Port Agency, 1st ed. (London: The Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, 2010), 109. Shippers may also insist on the particular agent to handle the port call when negotiating the sale contract. Whatever the background is, the charterer's agent will keep the loyalty to the party that generates business for such agent despite the fact that ship owner continue to be his principal. Tasks Unless specifically indicated in the appointment or instructions from principal, the protecting agent has no defined tasks, but rather supervises the tasks carried out by the shipping agent. All the tasks of the protecting agent are the mirror of the shipping agent's ones, which were not performed or anticipated to be not performed properly. *Checking disbursement proforma for the port dues and fees to be correct and competitive. *Advising the principal on the vessel actual turnover and providing any other useful information. *Providing ship husbandary services: crew changes, medical care, etc. *Verifying Statement of Facts and time sheet entries. *Signing Bill of lading on behalf of the master and releasing it according to the instructions. *Looking after the third parties that provide services to the principal: ship chandlers, suppliers. *Assisting in the disputes that arise during the port call and after departure. *Arranging for the ship surveys and P&I; correspondents attendance, legal services. *Participating in the accident and incident investigation. *Fulfilling any other tasks on the request from the principal. Legal aspects An agency relationship constitutes a fiduciary duty owed to the principal by the shipping agent and include the duty to act in accordance with the principal instructions, duty of loyalty, duty not to make secret profits, and duty of confidentiality.Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, Legal Principles in Shipping Business, 2016 ed. (London: The Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, 2016), 56. Despite this fact the shipping agent may breach this duty for the reason of the conflict of interests. Although the agent is liable for such a breach, in practice this is almost impossible for the principal to succeed in a court action because of many factors: foreign jurisdiction (a jurisdiction of the agent's residence), the lack of evidence and local rules knowledge as well as the factor of the time passed after the breach. The only defence against this situation or in case when the principal have no faith in the charterer agent is to appoint a protecting agent. Fees and funding Similarly to the shipping agent fees, protecting agent will charge the agency fee that may be either state regulated and thus fixed or negotiable. It is common practice to have a protecting agency fee as much as 50% of the full agency fee.Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, Port Agency, 1st ed. (London: The Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, 2010), 228. The principal may also choose to pay his port disbursement invoices through the protecting agent by placing him in funds and the latter shall release such funds to the shipping agent only after checking for the relevant items correctness.

History The Logs was built c.1868 to designs by J.S. Nightingale by the builder Charles Till for the engineer and developer Edward Gotto as Gotto's own residence. Gotto later added wings on either side of the house in 1876.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list- entry/1379149 A full page illustration and a profile of The Logs was featured in the 28 November 1868 issue of The Builder. The house cost ¬£9,000 to build. The house was for sale with freehold for ¬£10,000 in 1923 through Knight, Frank and Rutley. It was described as a \\"substantial and fairly modern house, with gardens of over an acre, near the highest part of East Heath-road.\\" The house was subdivided in maisonettes in 1951, the conversion was discussed in the 1955 book The Conversion of Old Buildings Into New Homes for Occupation and Investment. The grand central staircase of the house was preserved in the conversion. During its subdivision the house was partly known as Lion House.

The musician and performer Boy George has lived at The Logs since the 1980s. In 2015 a planning application to build an extension to improve the levels of natural light at the house with new floor to ceiling windows and to landscape the garden was rejected by Camden Borough Council. Syte Architects who were commissioned to produce the plans wrote that The Logs \\"...does not benefit from a great deal of natural light into its interior. Its frontage is orientated to the north east. The rear has a southwesterly orientation but a combination of factors mean that the interior often suffers from poor levels and quality of natural lighting\\". The council's planning department described the changes as \\"over-dominant and incongruous addition, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and wider conservation area\\". the designs were also opposed by the Hampstead Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CCAC). The landscaping works planned to remove an existing summer house and three mature trees. Design The eccentric design of The Logs has been much commented on. Nikolaus Pevsner writing in the London: North edition of the Pevsner Architectural Guides describes The Logs as a \\"formidable atrocity\\". Christopher Wade, writing in The Streets of Hampstead describes it as a \\"wonderful uncertainty between Gothic and Italian\\". Pevsner described The Logs as exhibiting \\"yellow, red and black brick and exscrecences in all directions, arches pointed and round, motifs Gothic and Frenchified, and a remarkable wilful tower with chateau roof'. The hall, vestibule and conservatory were paved with Mintons tiles upon completion. Burnham bricks with Portland stone dressings were used on the exterior alongside polished granite and red Mansfield stone.

He then studied painting with Professor Aur√©l Bern√°th at the Hungarian Academy for Fine Arts in Budapest from 1954 until his graduation in 1960. In 1959 he created the first of numerous works of art based on found photographs. In 1963, Lakner was approved for his first trip to Western countries. He visited the Federal Republic of Germany and attended the Venice Biennale in Italy in 1964. In 1968 he traveled on a scholarship from the Museum Folkwang, which permitted him a return to the Federal Republic of Germany and a visit to Switzerland In 1972, Lakner worked for two months in the famous guest house of the Museum Folkwang in the city of Essen, where Martin Kippenberger also worked in a studio some years later. In 1974, he was invited to Berlin with a DAAD scholarship for the DAAD Artists- in-Berlin Program and decided to emigrate to Germany. In 1976 he was awarded the Bremen \\"Art Prize of B√∂ttcherstra√üe\\" and in 1977 he was invited to the documenta VI in Kassel with several works exhibited from the fields of painting, drawing and book objects. In the same year he received the German Critics' Prize and worked during 1981-1982 with a scholarship from the Berlin Senate in New York at MOMA P.S.1 art studio and gallery, at the same time as the Essen sculptor Carl Emanuel Wolff. In 1998, he received the Kossuth Prize, the most prestigious Hungarian State Prize for his artistic work. In 2000, his self-portrait was included in the collection of the Uffizi Gallery / Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.

He also lectured in the Department of Art History at the Free University of Berlin between 1979 and 1980. In 1982 he was finally appointed to the University of Essen (now the University of Duisburg-Essen), where he taught as a professor of experimental design until his retirement in 2001. In these 19 years he worked in Berlin and in his studio in Essen, which he left after 2002 to settle permanently in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin. Lakner's professorship for experimental design, later occupied by J√∂rg Eberhard, required a multidisciplinary expertise, as he supervised students from both the University of Essen and the current Folkwang University of the Arts. His students from this period include, among others, the cabaret artist and photographer Dieter Nuhr, painters Dirk Hupe, J√ºrgen Paas, Eberhard Ross, photographer and stage designer Johannes Gramm, G√ºnter Sponheuer and Frank Piasta Tondo Mouth 1968, oil on canvas, √∏ 140 cm, Collection Janus Pannonius Museum, P√©cs  Development of artwork  Since his beginnings in the 1950s, Lakner's work has moved with great flexibility and ease among many artistic forms, such as realistic and object-free representations in painting, photography, textual work, film, objects and sculptures. Most of his work was powered by his conceptual way of thinking, and independent of the art form and media used. He turned his attention repeatedly to the same topics and motives within language, literature and the appearance of writing (see Paul Celan pictures ). The artistic results could be transformations of books or manuscripts through paintings or the integrations of books into art objects (see Buchaxt (book-axe) ). Other topics include the representations of heads and skulls (see Bandaged Heads ) as metaphors or symbolisms of death. When Lakner modified objects and written texts from famous artists and philosophers, he created a new artistic environment for them. The transition of one art form into another enabled Lakner to add complementary meanings to the quoted works, which would have been impossible if they remained in their original art form. This recontextualisation could inspire associations with powerful symbolic potential. Since his artistic origins are in realism, Lakner's artwork has evolved using a rich artistic language full of interwoven references and meanings. = 1950s to 1970s =  Painting  Lakner participated in IPARTERV exhibitions in Budapest in 1968 and 1969, which united the leading critical avant-garde artists in Hungary. In doing so, he presented works that subtly contained contemporary and cultural references. Besides object-free representations that were understood to be experimental, he was beginning to paint highly realistic images of found photographic documents in the late 1950s. Whilst demonstrating his virtuosity through painting, Lakner inspired associations between the history of art and contemporary political issues (see Seamstresses listen to a speech by Hitler ). Lakner also closely examined the appropriateness of the artistic media used in Eastern European countries with their respective social reality. His observations allowed him to delve deeper into the world of realistic painting. Lakner also created images that could be attributed to Pop Art (see Rose, 1968, Mund-Tondo / Mouth-Tondo, 1968, Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest ). He also experimented with assemblages (see Fugitives, 1966, Hungarian National Gallery and Letter to Barbara, 1964), monochrome paintings, posters and conceptual art; they incorporated sometimes humor. Furthermore, he also painted twin images that juxtaposed the same motif but with different details (see Danae, 1967, Ludwig-M√∫zeum, Budapest ). Here, Lakner examined the limitations and possibilities within his realistic representations, creating a lasting theme that he continued to work with in Germany. L√°szl√≥ Lakner, \\"Isa pur\\", 1982, mixed media on bed sheets, 260 √ó 220 cm. Lakner cites from the oldest Hungarian text written in Latin script, The Funeral Sermon and Prayer: ‚ÄúBehold, we are dust and ashes‚Äù  Conceptual art  In his conceptual art Lakner applies various methods of artistic transformation of literature as well as language. A major work in 1970 used a book on aesthetics, written by the Hungarian philosopher George Luk√°cs, who signed it for him. Lakner tied it shut using a piece of string. He then placed the laced book on his studio wall, photographed it and then transformed it into a screen printed image. This work (and its novel method of fabrication) was exhibited in 1972 at the Venice Biennale in the International Pavilion. Lakner continued working with this process by lacing other books, as well as creating photorealistic paintings of such situations. A similarly photorealistic painting is his naked self-portrait, in which he stands looking at the viewer, wearing only flip-flops and sunglasses. It is regarded as an outstanding political statement on the situation of the artist in the repressive Hungarian regime (see Self-portrait with self-timer, 1970, Uffizi Gallery, Florence. The wish for change inspired many of his works (see Monument of the Revolutions, 1971, Museum Folkwang, Essen and Barricade 1970 / oil on canvas / 150 √ó 200 cm). He continued to base his photorealistic paintings on photographic documents, often in brown-grey colours, brilliantly painting the change of sharpness in the depth of field from the original photo (Silence, Homage to Joseph Beuys, 1972 Ludwig Museum, Budapest ). His attention turned increasingly to historical documents from different centuries, such as letters, dispatches or testaments. He carefully re- represented manuscripts, often written by famous people, showing them in front of a spatial background (see After Schopenhauer / Fragment). This is the continuation of the previously mentioned usage of quotes in new artistic contexts, as well as an innovative exploration of using written text as a subject in paintings. This liberates the viewer to see them from a purely aesthetic perspective; as colour and shape (see C√©zanne's Last Letter, 1975, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam). During this time Lakner received a DAAD scholarship in Berlin and migrated to the Federal Republic of Germany (1974). Barricade 1970 / oil on canvas / 150 √ó 200 cm = 1980s to the present = Lakner's guest stay 1981-1982 in New York at MoMA PS1 studio and gallery was significant. Here Lakner experienced the illness and death of a good friend. During this time, he became also aware of graffiti on the walls of houses and in subway shafts. As a result, he painted on large bed sheets, in which individual words or slogans were applied with spray paint. \\"At that time, the graffiti of the Puerto Rican boys in the streets of New York meant more to me than anything else I saw in museums and galleries.\\" He wanted \\"Black Milk\\", the words from Paul Celan's poem Death Fugue, \\"written big on a wall with a flamethrower.\\" In Isa Pur, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, he cites the oldest Hungarian Funeral Sermon and Prayer written in Latin script: ‚ÄúBehold, we are dust and ashes‚Äù. The single letters above the patchy colored ground are created by spray paint, or the paint is scratched away, reinforcing his narrative about life and death. From the second half of the 1980s the abstract drawings, which could partly be read as rudimentary writing, were etched on thick impasto layers of paint. This technique resulted in pictures with graphic entanglements and lines above the color ground (see work group of splitted images on a box-like deep canvas, 1994). In addition, he also made realistic sculptural works in bronze, which integrated not only the human figure, but also books (see Babel, 1985). On the monument for the Hungarian poet Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti, Lakner shows his inner impressions and feelings, created by the poems, on the surface of an imaginary book, which is cast in bronze. The scripture on the tombstone of John Keats, the romantic English poet, ‚ÄòHere lies one whose name is writ in water‚Äô, inspired Lakner's painting, Keats' grave. From the mid-1990s, Lakner's interest returned to photography, which he was able to use conceptually. For example, in Paris he walked around in circles at the fictitious place where the poet Paul Celan committed suicide. Later, he created large-format photo sequences of these places (see exhibition 1999, Galerie Nothelfer, Berlin). In addition, representational images were also created with a new examination of the classical art of painting (see Berenice according to Edgar Allan Poe, 2004 ‚Äì 2010). Chinese Postcard, 1972 in the possession of the artist Interest in Asian cultures During the Vietnam war (1955-1975) Lakner's interest turned to Asia. Although he did not understand the meaning of calligraphies he saw, he was fascinated by their form and began to paint them. Often, he did not follow the method of calligraphy (painting with ink on rice paper with fast movements), but painted them with oil on canvas with meticulous precision. Not limiting himself with only that technique, he also completely reimagined the Little Red Book \\"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\\" and created a new version of it with the title MAO BIBLE. Instead of being a source of Mao's ideology for the Cultural Revolution, the book is tightly bound with ropes and it is not possible to open it. Some versions of this \\"Bible\\" are cast in bronze. Another work was produced from an idealised Chinese photo, depicting farmers in the mountains being helped by Chinese soldiers. Lakner enlarged it to create a human-size photorealistic painting. The hand-written greeting of the newspaper editor who sent the photo to him, is also painted on the canvas. Thus, the results of Lakner's Asian inspirations are artworks which are, despite their Asian topics, not copies of Asian art. They are rather transformations from Asian into Western traditions.

She played many positions in her junior career in the TAC Cup Girls and VFL Women's before she was drafted by the Bulldogs with the tenth selection in the 2018 AFLW draft. Brown debuted in the opening round of the 2019 season.  Junior career  Brown began her football locally in 2013 with Glen Iris in the Yarra Junior Football League. Throughout her junior career she also competed in netball and cross country running, which developed her endurance. Brown played for the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup Girls, polling eight votes in the league's 2018 best and fairest to finish equal sixth in the award. She represented Vic Metro at the 2018 AFLW Under 18 Championships and was named in the All- Australian side on the interchange. Brown played six matches in the VFL Women's for the Southern Saints, averaging the second-most disposals (20) and uncontested possessions (10) per match at the club. She tested at the 2018 AFLW draft combine, recording the second-fastest time trial at seven minutes and 29 seconds, behind eventual number-one selection Nina Morrison. Brown played a variety of positions in her junior career. She played in the midfield at her local club, but switched to the wing at Sandringham. She played both positions at the Southern Saints, but swapped to half-back after her performance in the position at the AFLW Under 18 Championships. Speaking at the draft combine, Brown said \\"I probably prefer the midfield because you can run around more, but I do like half back.\\"  AFLW career  Brown was drafted by the Western Bulldogs with the tenth pick in the 2018 AFLW draft, their first selection.

The manuscript is currently part of the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection. Background and library Ferdinand Columbus Ferdinand Columbus (1488‚Äì1539) was a Spanish bibliographer and cosmographer, and the son of the explorer Christopher Columbus.Book of Lost Books Discovered in Danish Archive Jason Daley, Smithsonian.com, 11 April 2019. Retrieved 12 April 2019. In the early sixteenth century he embarked on a project to create a library of every book in the world, assembling around 15‚Äì20,000 books during his lifetime and creating the largest library of his day. Unlike other collectors who sought Greek and Latin manuscripts, Columbus recognised the significance of print and prioritised printed books and ephemeral and popular printed material such as ballads and newspapers.Manuscript reveals lost books of Christopher Columbus' son's library. Interview with Edward Wilson-Lee, Newshour, BBC World Service, 10 April 2019. Retrieved 12 April 2019. The collection has been housed at Seville Cathedral since 1552, but only about a quarter of the books have survived; these form the Biblioteca Colombina of the Instituci√≥n Colombina. The Book of Epitomes To create the Libro de los Ep√≠tomes, Columbus used a team of readers and writers to prepare a summary of each book in his library. The entries vary from just a few lines for the smaller works to around 30 pages for major works such as the writings of Plato. There are close to 2,000 summaries in the book, which consists of 982 leaves (1,964 pages) and is thick. Rediscovery √Årni Magn√∫sson Biblioteca Colombina, 1913 The catalogue was positively identified in 2019, after Guy Lazure of the University of Windsor in Canada suggested it could be a \\"bibliographical tool\\" from Ferdinand Columbus's library. It had been thought lost since its existence was last recorded in Spain at the time of Columbus's death. It was found as part of the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection in Copenhagen, a collection established by √Årni Magn√∫sson (1663‚Äì1730), an Icelandic scholar who donated his collection to the University of Copenhagen at his death in 1730. The manuscript is currently part of the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection with the shelfmark AM 377 fol. N. Kƒ±vƒ±lcƒ±m Yavuz suggests that the volume might have arrived Denmark together with a collection of manuscripts brought by Cornelius Lerche who was an envoy to the Spanish court. A similar catalogue of Columbus's collection of some 3,200 prints was already known, and was published in 2004.McDonald, Mark. (2005) Ferdinand Columbus: Renaissance Collector (1488-1539). London: British Museum Press. (he also edited the 2 volume catalogue, published in 2004.) Significance and future work According to University of Cambridge academic Edward Wilson-Lee, author of a recent biography of Columbus and account of his library, The Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books, \\"It's a discovery of immense importance, not only because it contains so much information about how people read 500 years ago, but also, because it contains summaries of books that no longer exist, lost in every other form than these summaries\\". Plans for the manuscript to be digitised and transcribed were already hinted at in April 2019. In December 2019, Matthew James Driscoll from the Arnamagn√¶an Institute at the University of Copenhagen was awarded a three-year research grant by the Carlsberg Foundation to conduct further studies on the manuscript. The project is titled \\"The Book of Books: Hernando Col√≥n's Libro de los Ep√≠tomes\\" and is set to begin in April 2020.

Broadbridge became a lecturer in economics at North Staffordshire Polytechnic, and joined the Association of Teachers in Technical Institutions (ATTI), serving as its president in 1972. He became the treasurer of the north west region of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the president of the Staffordshire County Association of Trades Councils, serving from 1974 until 1976, and also vice chair of the West Midlands Regional Council of the Trades Union Congress. In the 1960s, Broadbridge wrote several articles for Labour Monthly, and a CPGB pamphlet, The Lancashire Cotton 'famine' (1861-65). In his spare time, he enjoyed canal boating, and in 1974 he wrote The Birmingham canal navigations: Vol.1, 1768-1846.

The system is roughly 399 light years from us. Discovery and nomenclature HD 102956 is located inside the Big Dipper. The name HD 102956 derives directly from the fact that the star is the 102,956th star catalogued in the Henry Draper catalog. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star. The star is one of the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky and is part of the Tycho-2 Catalogue.

First version The first Taxpayer First Act of 2019, H.R. 1957 was written to modify numerous policies at the IRS concerning \\"organizational structure, customer service, enforcement procedures, management of information technology, and use of electronic systems.\\" Among the provisions affected: * establish the IRS Independent Office of Appeals to resolve federal tax controversies without litigation; * require the IRS to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy; * continue the IRS Free File Program; * exempt certain low-income taxpayers from payments required to submit an offer-in-compromise; * modify tax enforcement procedures that address issues such as the seizure of property, issuing a summons, joint liability, referral for private debt collection, and contacting third parties; * establish requirements for responding to Taxpayer Advocate Directives; * permanently authorize the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program; * modify procedures for whistle-blowers; * establish requirements for cybersecurity and identify protection; * prohibit the rehiring of certain IRS employees who were removed for misconduct; * allow the IRS to require additional taxpayers to file returns electronically; and * increase the penalty for failing to file a return. The legislation also addressed identity theft protection and taxpayer rights during an income tax audit, directed the department to hire a Chief Information Office, as well including a provision that will establish the IRS Independent Office of Appeals to resolve federal tax controversies without litigation.The bill was reported to have bipartisan support, and passed the House of Representatives by voice vote on 9 April 2019; passage was praised by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. However, the bill was criticized in news media as being overly biased in favor of for-profit tax filing services. In particular, a provision in Sec. 1102(a)(4) called for the IRS to \\"continue to work cooperatively with the private sector to provide the free individual income tax preparation and the electronic filing services described in paragraphs (2) and (3).\\" This was interpreted by critics as banning the IRS from creating its own free tax preparation software. Notably, an investigation by ProPublica showed that companies which stood to benefit from the Free File provision, such as Intuit (producer of TurboTax) and H&R; Block, often steered taxpayers whom are eligible to file for free into using cost-associated services to file their taxes. The ProPublica report stated \\"just 3% of eligible U.S. taxpayers actually use the free program each year. Critics of the program say that companies use it as a cross-marketing tool to upsell paid products, that they have deliberately underpromoted the free option.\\" As a result, congressional action on this version of the bill stalled in the Senate. Second version A second version of the Taxpayer First Act of 2019, H.R. 3151, was passed in the House by voice vote on 10 June 2019 with the sponsorship of original sponsor Rep. John Lewis. This version dropped the Free File provision from H.R. 1957. The modified bill had the support of Sen. Chuck Grassley, and was subsequently passed by the Senate by voice vote on 13 June 2019.

Distribution  Candidula spadae is native to Central Italy. The species in sparsely distributed. It is found in the central Apennines. However, the IUCN asserts that the species is also found in extension to Gargano. It is found in the Sibillini Mountains, including Monte Vettore, and then southward to the Monti Reatini, the Gran Sasso d'Italia, and the Monti della Meta.  Description  The shell of Xerogyra spadae is pale white in color. Often, there are narrow light brownish color bands on the shell. The shell is almost smooth. The whorls are, to some extent, convex in shape. The number of whorls range between 5.5 and 6. The last two whorls increase more rapidly. The last whorl is weakly angulated. It does not descend near the main opening of the shell, the aperture. The aperture is clearly visible and large. The color inside the aperture is white or light yellowish. There is a lip inside the aperture which is white in color. The umbilicus is initially narrow, but at the last whorl it increases to one-fourth of the shell diameter.

It lives on pebbly grassland in the alpine tundra and subalpine zone up to the summit region.  Population  According to the IUCN, the size of the population, despite being not properly known, is showing a decreasing trend. The population declined remarkably in the decades 1990s and 2000s. This population decline was caused by an overall dryness in Central Italy's climate.  Interaction with humans and conservation status  Xerogyra spadae faces risk from the tourism industry and grazing activity. Activities associated with tourism, such as skiing, mountain biking, hiking, as well as rock climbing and mountaineering result in degradation of this snail's habitat quality. With the intensity of land-use in the Apennines described by the IUCN as \\"stable or even increasing\\", grazing activity such as pasturing also results in change of the natural vegetation with adverse effects.

Biography Groom was born at Corringham in Essex to a master mariner and his wife. She studied under the influential printmaker Claude Flight at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art before, in 1921, enrolling at Leon Underwood's Brook Green School to develop her skills as an engraver. Groom's prints featured areas of black outlined in white but with great attention to detail. In 1937 she produced two books for the Golden Cockerel Press, an edition of Paradise Lost by Milton and Roses of Sharon, a collection of Old Testament verses. Groom was a member of the Society of Wood Engravers, exhibiting some 18 prints with them, and also of a breakaway group, the English Wood Engraving Society. For many years she lived at Southwold before moving to Wenhaston in Suffolk, which was still her home when she died in 1958 in Norwich. Fourteen prints by Groom are held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and both the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Auckland Art Gallery in New Zealand also have examples of her work, while the British Museum collection includes two of her prints.

Biography Joel Deutsch was born in Nikolsburg, Moravia. He was a close student of rabbinical literature and an energetic collector of Hebrew books. In 1844, he became a teacher at the Allgemeine √∂sterreichische israelitische Taubstummen-Institut in Nikolsburg, a school for deaf Jewish children established that year by philanthropist Hirsch Kolisch at the suggestion of Catholic priest Dr. Franz Herrmann Czech. The school developed into one of the leading schools of its kind in Europe, and was one of the first schools for deaf children which started an intensive auditory education program, thanks to its close co- operation with otologist Viktor Urbantschitsch. In a letter to Edward Walter, director of the Institute for the Deaf in Berlin, Deutsch asserted that the students who had undergone their training programme were of decided intelligence, contrary to contemporary thought about deaf-mutes. In support of this contention, he sent an essay by one of his students, Bernhard Brill, and said that he doubted whether any non-disabled person \\"could match his lucid and incisive style.\\" Deutsch became director when the school was transferred to Vienna in 1852. In 1859 he was decorated with the Goldene Verdienstkranz and in 1869 received the title Kaiserlicher Rath. On 17 February 1870, Deutsch survived an attempted murder by a teacher named Isaac Bardach, who had been severely reprimanded by Deutsch for whipping several of the children unmercilessly. Deutsch retired from his position in 1888. His pupils became teachers in the schools for the deaf of New York City, London, Budapest, and Lemberg, and the leading Jewish schools for deaf children were influenced by his work.

All the activities in the field of public health in Sweden (including medical care) are either operated or controlled by public authorities. Public health is under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the chief of which is a member of the cabinet. The National Swedish Board of Health was the principal instrument of the State for governing, superintending and promoting the activities and the work of the institutions pertaining to this field. The board supervised the medical personnel, the hospitals and the pharmacies and had the direct control of the State Pharmaceutical Laboratory, the State institutions for forensic medicine, a unit for mass radiofluorography etc. The National Swedish Board of Health was dissolved in 1968 and became the National Board of Health and Welfare. History The National Swedish Board of Health originated from a corporation association of physicians in Stockholm, who first received certain privileges on 16 May 1663 under the name of Collegium medicorum (later Collegium medicum), which was confirmed and extended in particular by the so-called medical schemes of 30 October 1688. By letters patent on 27 January 1813, the collegium changed to a real administrative government agency under the name of the Sundhetskollegium (\\"Health Collegium\\") and initially consisted of 1 chairman, 1 vice chairman, 2 medical councillors (head of divisions) and 6 assessors, and the senior physicians and professors, who then held membership in the Collegium medicum for life. According to the instruction issued on 6 December 1815, the Sundhetskollegium received the oversight and the board over all that related to the state of health as well as the medical care and the sick care of both the country's inhabitants in general and in the armed forces on land and sea in peace and wartime. As early as 1821, two assessors' offices were abolished, and in 1841 all the other assessors and the vice-chairman, whereas the medical councillors was increased to four. The Sundhetskollegium received a far broader activity than Collegium medicum. Among other things, the obligation to give a statement in forensic purposes, to have control over the veterinary system, the dental and f√§ltsk√§r system, variolation and more, was allowed. However, only in 1876 did the board of directors of the hospital and mental health services (from the Serafimerordensgillet, \\"Seraphim Order Guild\\") be transferred to the Sundhetskollegium. From 1878, the agency name change to the National Swedish Board of Health. The state for the new agency was established on 1 June 1877, and instruction for the same was issued 2 November the same year. Minor changes were done over time, the most important of which occurred on 31 December 1900. The National Swedish Board of Health now consists of 1 chairman referred to as Director General and 5 medical councillors. The Director General and 4 of the medical councillors should be licensed physicians, the fifth medical councillor should be a licensed veterinarian. The staff of the chancellery consisted of 1 secretary, 1 registrar and 3 notaries, and at the accounting office of 2 accountants and 1 treasurer. In addition, the board was assisted by 1 ombudsman and 1 procurator fiscal, 1 chief inspector for mental health care, 1 hospital inspector and 1 architect, and by the necessary number of assistants and temporary officials. For the execution of bacteriological and forensic investigations, the board had at its disposal a state medical institution, the Statsmedicinska anstalten, with a bacteriological and a chemical chemistry department. The National Swedish Board of Health exercised the highest oversight of the general health care system in Sweden and dealt with matters concerning the state's medical health. The board had insight into everyone who was occupied with the expansion of the medical or pharmaceutical sciences, with the exception of university teachers as such, and acted as the national board of Sweden's hospitals and supervised the mental health of the insane in general. In addition, the board had oversight over the hospitals and the cottage hospitals, swimming facilities and other such health centers, as well as the pharmacy system, the midwifery and the f√§ltsk√§r system, as well as the practitioners of the dentistry and physiotherapy activities. The National Swedish Board of Health also had to provide the courts, public and municipal authorities and officials with the information that they wanted and which lie within the area of the board's activities, as well as investigating the forensic issues that arise. Finally, the board had to watch over the epidemic care operations and to exercise the highest level of insight into the variolation and the institutions established for it. From 1 July 1963, the National Swedish Board of Health was organized under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, which was the country's highest administrative body in the field. Its task was then to exercise the oversight over the work of the medical staff, the healthcare agencies and the pharmacy and to have the highest management of the state mental hospitals and other institutions. It was organized in nine bureaus. At its side, the National Swedish Board of Health had various advisory councils and committees taking independent decisions. In addition to the National Swedish Board of Health, some other central institutions operated in the area of general health care. The National Institute of Public Health (Statens institut f√∂r folkh√§lsan) with the main task of conducting scientific-practical investigations and conducting research activities in the areas of general hygiene, food hygiene and occupational hygiene, and thereby constituting a central investigative body for the food control according to the Food Charter. The institute also had to conduct some teaching. Questions about occupational hygiene were dealt with by the Institute of Occupational Health (Arbetsmedicinska institutet). The Central Board of Hospital Planning and Equipment (Centrala sjukv√•rdsberedningen) had the task to advise on the planning of hospital buildings and their equipment and to work for standardization and rationalization of the hospitals' utensils and operations and the National Bacteriological Laboratory (Statens bakteriologiska laboratorium) with the task of investigating, researching, producing serum, inoculants etc. in the bacteriological, virological and epidemiological fields of human medicine. As of 1 January 1968, the highest administrative body for health and medical care is the National Board of Health and Welfare, which was formed through a merger of the National Swedish Board of Health and the old National Board of Health and Welfare.

Early life  He is the son of businessman Roberto Sebel√©n and housewife Lucy Medina, Reynold is the youngest of four siblings. As a baby, his parents moved to the Dominican Republic and later at twelve years old, he moved back to Puerto Rico with his mother after his parents divorced. At age 13, he became a member of the Society of Young Magicians (S.Y.M.). Reynold became president of the Puerto Rican chapter, and was two-time First Place winner for ‚ÄúStage Magic‚Äù. He was later initiated into Society of American Magicians (S.A.M).  Career  Reynold's professional career started in 1998 at age 20, when he adopted ‚ÄúAlexander‚Äù as a stage name. His first show was at Fiji's, a small long-gone local bar in Condado (Santurce)Condado, Puerto Rico. In 2005, Reynold Alexander made the Capitol Building of Puerto Rico, a century-old structure located at the entrance of Old San Juan, disappear in front of a live audience. This event was transmitted live on the national television show Qu√© Suerte with host H√©ctor Marcano. Alexander, a Houdini fan, recreated his famously dangerous Chinese Water Torture Cell Escape in 2006. Reynold, handcuffed, was submerged upside down into a narrow tank containing 250 gallons of water and locked with six heavy duty padlocks. In 2006, Alexander briefly held the fastest suspended straitjacket escape Guinness World Record. While hoisted upside down fifty feet above the ground by his ankles with a burning rope. He had two minutes to escape from the regulation straitjacket before the fire burned through. He escaped in 1 minute and 45 secs. A few months later that record was broken by an English escape artist. Alexander caught a bullet shot by a Magnum .357 revolver with his teeth. The bullet and casing were marked by members of the audience before it was fired for later verification. Reynold has performed the bullet catch a handful of times. At least twelve magicians have died performing this stunt. Alexander repeatedly performed at The Magic Castle in Hollywood. In 2014, Alexander headlined his own show entitled ‚ÄúMagia‚Äù at the Debbie Reynolds Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada. Alexander collaborated with David Copperfield for a special act for his show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. = Charity work = Alexander performed at Grandes Ilusiones charity event in Murcia, Spain to raise money for children with autism. He has been involved with San Jorge Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico where he has performed for the children and their parents. = TV and media = His early TV life started with the Show Qu√© Suerte! with host H√©ctor Marcano. There he did stunts including escaping from a packing crate while suspended from a helicopter, driving a car while blindfolded and making the Puerto Rico's Capital Building disappear. Since then Reynold has appeared in all major Puerto Rico TV shows and was featured in the Dominican Republic, Spain and the United States. Magia Extrema was the name of his own two-hour TV special aired in 2012 in WAPA and WAPA Am√©rica. Magia Extrema was the highest rated show in that time slot. Alexander has done TV commercials for Plaza las Am√©ricas, Casino Metro, Puerto Rico Tourism Company and Mall of San Juan. He made a DVD (currently unavailable) featuring his Sobrevive la Magia show tour from 2006. = Residency = From 2010 to 2017, Alexander was the resident magician with his own show at the Casablanca Theater at the Conquistador Resort in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, the hotel was destroyed by Hurricane Mar√≠a in 2017. He performs at the Wyndham Rio Mar in Puerto Rico.

The infected person usually presents with a fever in the absence of a recent travel history. There is often no suspicion of malaria, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and often death. Other causes of imported malaria need to be excluded first. Most mosquitoes on aircraft do not carry malaria and the few that do are relatively inefficient invaders. The climate of the host country also offers natural protection. The detection and treatment is the same as of malaria in general. Prevention involves control of mosquitoes at and around airports in the countries of departure and on the aircraft. Studies of airport malaria have been largely observations of individual scenarios, all unique in timing, place of infection and problems, in addition to possibilities of error. Background Malaria geographic distribution 2003 Human malaria is native to 97 countries and is the world's most prevalent vector-borne disease with 212 million new cases in 2015. Any occurrences outside endemic countries are largely imported cases or less commonly malaria with no recent travel history. Airport malaria is defined as malaria acquired at or near an airport through the bite of an infected tropical Anopheles mosquito by a person who has no history of being exposed to the mosquitoes in their natural habitat. Malaria transmission in-flight or on a stop-over is not considered airport malaria.  Causes  Although most imported malaria is due to travel by infected humans, airport malaria is specifically caused by the transmission of malaria parasites to a human through the bite of a malaria infected mosquito that has travelled by aircraft on an international flight from a country where malaria is usually found to a country where malaria is usually not found. It occurs at or around the vicinity of the airport. Very few mosquitoes however enter aircraft and of those that do, less than 5% are likely to carry malaria. Of the four different species of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium; Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, airport malaria is most commonly the falciparum and less commonly the vivax type. These can only be transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which bite mainly between dusk and dawn. Five infection pathways have been described: inside the aircraft, inside the airport, around the airport, far from the airport and from luggage. = Expansion of mosquito habitats = Deforestation, and projects involving housing, agriculture and water can incidentally expand mosquito habitats. Economic necessity, disasters and conflicts, are known to affect the migration of people, which can also contribute to the movement of mosquitoes and hence risk of malaria. Failure to take this into account has previously resulted in failed attempts to control malaria. = Air traffic and global warming = With an increase in air traffic volume, higher climate temperatures and humidity, the summers of temperate climates are potentially favourable for mosquitoes. Should temperatures rise in Europe and the United States as a result of global climate change, conditions may become more ideal for mosquito survival, potentially leading to a rise in isolated outbreaks of airport and imported malaria. Uninfected mosquitoes that arrive by flight may also live for long in enough as to feed on an infected person, which could also result in the transmission of malaria in non-endemic countries. = Airports, air routes and aircraft= Airport distribution in 2008 Airports The highest risk of airport malaria in Europe is from western and central Africa. A number of species have been found in these Western European airports, particularly Anopheles gambiae which breeds in Africa's rainy season during summer, when conditions in Europe are more favourable for its survival. When the cabin and cargo hold doors are opened, ground personnel working on airstrips are at risk. Also, those who manipulate and open containers in warehouses, stores or the post office are exposed to bites of the mosquitoes which have travelled in containers. Air routes The increase in air routes from Africa potentially increase the risk of introducing airport malaria. Aircraft Luggage compartments Airbus Mosquitoes have been found to be attracted to the illuminated cabins rather than to the baggage compartments.  Diagnosis  Mild cases may be missed. Due to the absence of a travel history in a person with fever, malaria is not usually expected, resulting in delays in diagnosis. Before the diagnosis of airport malaria can be made, other methods of transmission need to be excluded including blood transfusion, shared needles, prior exposure in endemic regions, and transmission by local mosquitoes. History taking requires information on where the person lives and works, in addition to the distance from the airport.  Epidemiology  Airport malaria is rare with most cases being reported sporadically and in the summer. It is not as well recognised as malaria in a person with a travel history to a place with endemic malaria. = Europe = Between 1969 and 1999, Europe saw up to 89 people diagnosed with airport malaria. The frequent flights from Sub- saharan Africa resulted in Belgium, France and the Netherlands being at highest risk. In the UK, at least 14 people with airport malaria were reported between 1969 and 1999. In 1983, 12 out of 67 aircraft flying from tropical countries to Gatwick Airport, London, contained mosquitoes. In the same year, falciparum malaria was reported in two people living and from Gatwick Airport. It was deduced that an infected mosquito accompanied aircrew to a pub near Gatwick and infected its landlord. It was also construed that the same stowaway mosquito also transmitted malaria to a woman who rode through the same village on her motor scooter. High minimum temperatures and humidity were thought to have allowed the infected anopheline mosquitoes to enter the country via aircraft and facilitate their survival. Reports of transmission taking place on the aircraft occurred in the UK in 1984 and 1990, the only such reports on aircraft, leading to infection on aircraft being described as a \\"British speciality\\". In 2002, one report came from the vicinity of Heathrow airport. In France, most flights at risk arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, and to a much lesser extent at Marseille, Nice, Lyon, Bordeaux and Toulouse. In 1994, airport malaria was identified in and around Charles de Gaulle Airport in six people, of which four were airport workers, and the others lived away in Villeparisis. It was thought that the mosquitoes traveled in the cars of airport workers who lived next door to the two people. All were caused by P. falciparum. In 1989, two cases of falciparum malaria were identified in Italy in two people who lived in Geneva. Distance from the nearest airport ruled out airport malaria in one woman who developed malaria in Italy. A local mosquito (Anopheles labranchiae) had bitten a girl with malaria from India and passed it on. This species was a common malaria vector in Italy until the country was declared malaria free in 1970. Five cases of airport malaria were reported in Geneva in the hot summer of 1989. In Spain, 1964 marked the elimination of malaria following sanitary and socioeconomic developments. However, over the following 50 years, more than 10 000 cases of malaria were reported, of which 0.8% had no history of recent travel. Airport malaria was reported in two people. In 1984, a 76-year-old woman died from P. falciparum after visiting relatives less than from Madrid airport. Suspected to have pneumonia, the diagnosis was not initially clear. In 2001, a second woman was diagnosed, treated and recovered. = Other countries = In the United States, between 1957 and 2003, there were 156 people reported with malaria who had no history of travel or other risk factors. Some were likely to be caused by airport malaria. A small number of airport malaria reports have come from Florida. Airport malaria was first reported in Australia in 1996.  Prevention  The WHO International Health Regulations give guidance on prevention of airport malaria. Mosquito control programmes also recommend procedures for aircraft coming from endemic areas and for the receiving airports, including the surrounding of area. Routine aircraft disinsection of aircraft has been shown to reduce mosquitoes on aircraft. Insecticide can also be sprayed on the ground. However, these procedures are not totally efficient and they vary from country to country. Most mosquitos on aircraft do not carry malaria. The few that do are relatively inefficient invaders. In addition, further natural protection is offered by constraints of the hosting country's climate. A list of airports at risk has been proposed. International sanitary regulations require the area of airports and the perimeter of around the airport to be made free of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles mosquitos. However, the application of disinsection varies from country to country.  Outlook  Airport malaria is not considered a serious public health problem but has a high fatality rate and poses a local threat. The prognosis is poor with fatality rates ranging from 16.9% to 26% with almost all the reports being of the falciparum type.  History  There were reports from as early as 1925 that diseases including cholera, plague, smallpox, typhus, yellow fever and malaria could make their way across countries within short periods of time on aircraft. Based on the International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation (1933) (Hague), which came into force in 1935 to protect communities against diseases liable to be imported by aircraft, air-traffic health control administrations, dealt with by the Office International d'Hygi√®ne Publique, Paris, were able to impose maximally excepted measures for this purpose, but left their actual application to each country concerned. Information regarding disease surveillance was supplied by \\"The Health Organization of the League of Nations\\" and updates were published and circulated regularly. Individual governments drew up their own regulations accordingly. To prevent the introduction of infectious diseases from abroad into the United Kingdom, the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1938 was issued by the Ministry of Health. Its actions included the \\"disinsection of aircraft in the tropics and subtropics to prevent yellow fever and malaria-infected mosquitoes from being introduced into the country\\". In 1928, the first report of insects on aircraft came from the quarantine inspector of the dirigible Graf Zeppelin on its arrival in the United States. Airport malaria was later first documented in 1969. Until 1970, malaria was endemic in Europe.  Research directions  Epidemiological and entomological surveillance and research on the interconnection between malaria transmission and population movement requires attention, as to is improvement in living facilities to prevent forced movement of people, awareness of the connection between mosquitoes and malaria, in addition to adequate healthcare and the control of urbanization. Airport malaria poses a potential risk to the local spread of malaria. The UK is home to five species of anopheline mosquitoes, of which only Anopheles atroparvus breeds close enough in proximity to humans and in enough numbers to act as an efficient vector for malaria. A serious public health problem would arise if the introduction of infected mosquitoes led to the transmission of malaria by local mosquitoes, particularly if transmission were revived in an area where the disease had previously been endemic and then eradicated.

The party was formally registered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 7 April 2019 and is associated with former senator Rod Culleton who had been elected in the 2016 Australian federal election as a senator for Western Australia, but subsequently found to have been ineligible and was disqualified. Policies and philosophy Policies of the party include the removal of personal income tax, nationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank and abolishment of the Family Court of Australia. The Party also proposes to implement trials by jury only in criminal matters, naming of young criminals who are serial offenders and the restoration of the \\"true\\" Constitution of Australia. This is despite numerous recent Court decisions confirming the validity of the Australian Constitution. Party Leader Culleton has on numerous occasions declared the Australian Constitution is invalid and thus so are Australian Courts. However in 2018 in complete contradiction whilst representing himself in recent Bankruptcy proceedings being heard in the Federal Court of Australia, Culleton commenced his opening address by confirming the authority of the Federal Court of Australia by stating: \\"This Honourable Court has the power delegated to it by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under S 39B(1A) (b) and (c) Judiciary Act 1903 and by S 34AB (c) Acts Interpretation Act 1901...\\" The Party further proposes a policy that criminal offenders would have sale of their property used as a possible deterrent. This policy contradicts the actions of Party candidate for the Senate in Western Australia, Wayne Glew's previous attempts to prevent the seizure and sale of his own residential property due to outstanding rates and levies owed by him to the City of Greater Geraldton. Glew had refused to pay Council rates and levies since as early as 2005. This lead Glew to mount repeated failed applications in the Magistrates' Court and High Court in Western Australia. Glew's residential property was subsequently seized and transferred to the City of Greater Geraldton. History Culleton continued to refer to himself as a \\"senator-in-exile\\" and sought to appeal his disqualification to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, a theoretical appeal path that had been used only once, in 1912, and for all practical purposes was abolished by the Australia Act of 1986. In 2018, Culleton initiated the process to establish a new political party, The Great Australian Party, to stand candidates for the Senate at the 2019 Australian federal election. The AEC registered the party on 7 April 2019. The party fielded two Senate candidates in each of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia but did not gain a seat in parliament. The Party's national first preference vote in the Senate was 0.23% (34,199 votes), ranging from 1.16% (12,698 votes) in South Australia to 0.14% (5,194 votes) in Victoria, while in Culleton's home state of Western Australia it received 0.22% (3,196 votes), less than two hundredths of the votes required for election. Controversy Culleton has been refusing to co-operate on numerous occasions by refusing to hand over documents or attend public examinations. Creditors were advised there was no prospect of recovering any of their money. On 24 April 2019, the AEC referred Culleton's Senate nomination form to the Australian Federal Police \\"to examine if a false declaration has been made under provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995, relating to his status as an undischarged bankrupt and the prima facie disqualification of such persons to be chosen or to sit as a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives under section 44(iii) of the Constitution\\". The AEC stated that, while it did not have power to reject a fully completed nomination form or to make its own assessment of a candidate's eligibility, it had been aware from a High Court judgment that Culleton had been a declared bankrupt and, upon checking the National Personal Insolvency Index, had found that he was currently listed as an undischarged bankrupt. On 2 May 2019, the AEC confirmed that Culleton's Party controversially may be eligible for public funding just for appearing on the ballot paper. This is despite a bankrupt being \\"incapable of being chosen\\" as a member of parliament. The AEC also stated they did not have the power to decide if a candidate is ineligible. The Party's other Senate candidate in Western Australia was Wayne Glew, a former police officer who is a \\"self- proclaimed expert of the constitution\\". Glew has been a claimant, defendant or appellant in at least 16 Court proceedings in which he has argued against the validity of the Australian Constitution. Glew has not been successful in a single proceeding to date.In chronological order the cases not cited elsewhere are    This resulted in Glew being declared a vexatious litigant by the Supreme Court of Western Australia and being prevented from initiating any further Court proceedings in Western Australia. On 23 December 2011 Glew was convicted in the Geraldton Magistrates' Court of one offence of assaulting a public officer and one offence of obstructing an officer in the execution of his duty. Glew provided legal advice to Heather Glendinning, who killed herself and her two daughters in a murder‚Äìsuicide in 2011. He subsequently told The West Australian that she had been murdered, and that \\"I spent 17 years in the police and you can make anything look like anything\\". In 2012, Glew was ordered to pay $2 million in damages to an investor in his fuel vaporiser system. The Supreme Court found that his invention \\"offered no benefit over existing fuel systems\\" and that he had engaged in \\"deceptive and misleading conduct\\". On 8 May 2019 a group of intoxicated Great Australian Party supporters campaigning outside a polling booth in Cockburn, WA verbally abused a 70 year old woman and her husband. One of the group of approximately eight Great Australian Party supporters, wearing a high-visibility vest displaying a Great Australian Party logo, was observed being drunk and aggressive and taunting voters to fight him. Police were required to attend to intervene. In a later statement Culleton denied the supporters were registered with the Party. This contradicts the reported statements of bystanders, voters and members of other parties who had observed Great Australian Party supporters spruiking AEC approved materials and wearing high-visibility vests displaying Great Australian Party logos.

When he arrived at Pittsburgh, he found that the boat builder had just begun building the boat and that it would take six weeks to finish it.

Design William Clark made two drawing of the keelboat in his diary; here from the side. Lewis had designed the keelboat; he supervised its construction, and probably made changes and additions during the building period. The boat was basically a galley, a vessel not like any other found west of the Appalachians, although of a standard type used on inland waters in the east. It was 55 feet long, with an eight feet beam, and with a shallow draft. The mast was 32 feet high and could be lowered. The boat could carry a headsail and a square rigged sail. A ten feet long deck at the bow made a forecastle. A raised aftercastle of the same length contained a cabin. The hold had a capacity of 12 tons. Eleven benches for the oarsmen crossed the deck in front of the aftercastle.Ambrose, Stephen (1996), Undaunted Courage (Simon & Schuster), pp. 105‚Äì107. Construction Clark's drawing of the keelboat from above Lewis was very dissatisfied with how the construction progressed. The boatbuilder was very tardy, drunken, and quarreled with his workers, causing several of them to quit work and leave the yard, further delaying the construction. He promised to bestir himself, but his resolution lasted only for a week. Lewis had to spend most of his time in Pittsburgh at the boat yard, in order to hasten the construction. In his diary, Lewis never named the negligent boatbuilder, and local historians have for a century tried to find out who he was.Lowry, Patricia (2003). \\"Who Built the Big Boat?\\" Post- Gazette, Sunday, August 3. Much indicates that it was Jacob Myers, an older man with experience as boatbuilder and galley owner.Brunot, William K.

The keelboat could be propelled by oars, sails, poles and towlines. When using the setting poles, the crew put the poles in the bottom of the river and pushed off while walking from the bow to the stern. Towlines were used by men, horses, or oxen pulling the boat. Crew According to the standing orders of the expedition, one of the commanding officers should always be in the keelboat as commander. One sergeant was to be at the helm, one amidships, and one at the bow. The helmsman was steersman, supervised the cargo on deck, and was in charge of the compass. The midshipman commanded the armed guard, handled the sails, supervised the oarsmen, and reported river outlets, islands and other remarkable sight amidships. He also distributed the whisky ration and was on duty at night. The bowsman was lookout, reporting all vessels on the river, and all Indian camps. Two private had permanent tasks aboard, Labiche and Cruzatte, who had been enlisted solely for their experience as boatmen. One of them would always man the larboard bow oar, while the other assisted the bowsman.Ambrose, op. cit., pp. 145‚Äì146.

They may also have additional functions of ridding animals of ectoparasites, bacteria, or excess moisture.  Birds  Birds adopt special postures when sunning, these may include spreading out their feathers, flattening their body on soil, showing either their upper parts to the sun or facing the sun. Some authors separate the behaviours into sun-basking and sun- exposure - the former term used when the behaviour is strictly thermoregulatory in function while the latter term may be more appropriate if the behaviour serves functions other than raising body temperature. In some species, the sunbathing posture is adopted in very hot weather and the birds sometimes stay in close contact with hot soil. Birds may fluff up their feathers, expose their preen-gland, lean to one side and so on. The wings may be turned inside out as in the boobies or held in delta-wing positions as in herons and storks or held outspread as by vultures. Swallows were observed to indulge in the activity for very short durations and this appeared to induce hyperthermia leading to them gaping to cool. Observers have suggested that the purpose might not be thermoregulation in these cases. A theory that birds obtained vitamin D by allowing precursors in the preen-gland secretions to be converted by ultraviolet radiation is considered to be unsupported. Large soaring birds such as Gyps vultures may use sun-bathing postures to help in stiffening their feathers as they used such postures only prior to flying and not during the early morning hours. Another theory is that ectoparasites may be killed or forced to move away from inaccessible parts of the body to more accessible areas where they can be removed through preening. This is supported by the observation that sunning is often followed by preening. Feather- degrading bacteria are known to be killed by the action of sunlight.  Reptiles and amphibians  Basking is common to most active diurnal reptiles. Lizards, crocodiles, terrapins, and snakes routinely make use of the morning sun to raise their body temperature. Freshwater turtles and terrapins have been found to bask and raise their body temperature close to the highest temperatures that they can tolerate.

It has been suggested that early mammals. which may have been small and nocturnal, may have basked to rapidly warm their bodies based on observations made on a nocturnal marsupial, Pseudantechinus macdonnellensis.  Insects  Many insects require the morning sun to come out of nocturnal torpor and become active. In the higher latitudes, many insects have black on their wings or body to enhance their heat acquisition. This trend for increased darkness in higher latitudes is especially well marked in the Lepidoptera although the trend may be more general and unrelated to thermoregulation as it is also seen in nocturnal Geometridae.

Liu, Xu, ÊóßÂîê‰π¶, The Old Book of Tang Dynasty, Vol. 52 (945). accessed April 10, 2019 Entering the Imperial Palace In 788, the five sisters and their father Song Tingfen travelled to Shangdang County, where they met Li Baozhen (733-794), a famous general and high-ranking mandarin of the mid-Tang Dynasty. Li was impressed by the learning of the daughters and wrote to the Emperor Dezong (742-805) to praise and recommend the extremely talented Five Sisters. The Emperor, having read the letter from Li Baozhen, immediately asked the five sisters to be presented to the imperial palace to be tested by the Emperor himself. The Emperor asked about poetry, literature, Confucian classics and history, and was also much impressed by the learning of the five girls. As such, the Emperor brought the five girls to the imperial palace. However, he never made them his concubines. Instead, he titled them Interior Scholars and respected their learning, elegance and aspiration. The Emperor was keen on poetry and whenever he discussed poetry with his mandarins, he would also invite the five sisters to join. Liu, Xu, ÊóßÂîê‰π¶, The Old Book of Tang Dynasty, Vol.52 (945). accessed April 10, 2019 The respect and favor that the sisters earned from the Emperor also earned their grandfather, father and brother a position in the imperial state. Becoming a female official The eldest sister Song Ruoshen was in charge of managing records and accounts of the private quarters of the imperial palace. After she died in 820, the Emperor Muzong (795-824) asked Song Ruozhao to take over her sister's position and bestowed on her the title Shanggong (), in charge of managing the general palace service. Liu, Xu, ÊóßÂîê‰π¶, The Old Book of Tang Dynasty, Vol. 16 (945). accessed April 10, 2019 When Muzong was the crown prince, Song Ruozhao had alone instructed him about the Confucian classics, an unusual task for female officials. Liu, Xu, ÊóßÂîê‰π¶, The Old Book of Tang Dynasty, Vol. 52 (945). accessed April 10, 2019 Moreover, recent research reveals that Shanggong in Tang Dynasty could directly influence and participate in political decision making and the appointment of high-ranking officials and could work as ambassadors of the Emperor , which implies the possible political clout of Song Ruozhao.Liu, Qinli, Âîê‰ª£ÂÆ´‰∫∫ÁöÑÊîøÊ≤ªÂèÇ‰∏éÈÄîÂæÑ, Means of Political Participation of Females in the Imperial Court of Tang Dynasty, ÊñáÂè≤Áü•ËØÜ, Chinese Journal of Literature and History, Vol. 7, pp. 23 (2010), pp.18-24. Song Ruozhao was particularly good with her interpersonal skills. Liu, Xu, ÊóßÂîê‰π¶, The Old Book of Tang Dynasty, Vol. 52 (945). accessed April 10, 2019 Having served in the imperial palace for over four decades with six Emperors, Song Ruozhao was called Teacher by emperors Xianzong, Muzong and Jingzong, and was treated and respected as a Teacher by the empresses, concubines, imperial princes and princesses. She was later given the honorable title Lady of Liang.

Hogg also writes poetry and short stories that have been published in various anthologies and journals. An avid cricket enthusiast, he has written articles on the sport. In 2012, he and literary agent Charlie Campbell organized a new incarnation of the Authors Cricket Club for fellow British authors, one hundred years after the original club, which had included Arthur Conan Doyle and J.M. Barrie among its members, had played its last match.  Early life and education  Hogg was born in Leicester, England and received a degree in psychology from the University of East London.  Writing career His first novel, \\"Show Me the Sky\\", was published in 2008 and was nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary prize. It centers on the hunt for a missing rock star who left behind only one clue: a page torn from the journal of a 19th-century Fijian missionary. It was reviewed by Publishers Weekly, which said that while some of the narrative strands developed too slowly, the parts of the book centering on the missionary's return to his homeland of Fiji with a group of Englishmen were a standout: \\"His vivid adventures at sea will remind many of Poe‚Äôs The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.\\" His second novel, \\"The Hummingbird and the Bear\\", was published in 2011 and won a K Blundell Trust award. He published his third novel, \\"Tokyo\\", in 2015. It is the story of a psychologist who, after a failed marriage, goes to Japan to find his long-lost love, while his daughter is being stalked by a disturbed cult survivor. It was named one of the \\"Best Novels of 2015\\" by The Observer, which called it \\"an intelligent, gripping and stylish love story set against a beautifully drawn contemporary Japan.\\" Kirkus Reviews said of it: \\"The father- daughter relationship is touching and real in this atmospheric noir thriller.\\" Hogg also writes poetry and short fiction that has been published in various anthologies and journals. His 2005 short story \\"Zen\\", about a father telling his toddler daughter the story of his time in a Japanese jail, won the New Ventures writing award and a ¬£5000 prize. and his short story \\"Naked\\" was read by actor Nigel Anthony on BBC Radio 4. He has written articles on cricket for the website ESPNcricinfo.  Personal life  After graduating from university, Hogg spent years living abroad in Fiji, the United States, and Japan and he later lived in India, as well. He sailed around the world three times as press officer on a Japanese NGO ship, Peace Boat, which promotes peaceful conflict resolution. He was employed in the early 2000s teaching language skills to refugees in London. In 2012, Hogg and literary agent Charlie Campbell organized a new incarnation of the Authors Cricket Club, which counts among the players on its team, the Authors XI, writers including Sebastian Faulks, Tom Holland, Richard Beard and Anthony McGowan. The original Authors CC, which included members Arthur Conan Doyle and J.M. Barrie, had played its last game exactly one hundred years earlier, in 1912. Hogg serves as vice-captain and is one of the team's regular bowlers. He contributed a chapter titled 'Cricket and Home', in which he recounted growing up obsessed with cricket as a working-class kid in Leicester, to the book that team members collectively wrote about their first season playing together: The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon.

The Lancair 200 was initially called the Lancer 200, but the name was changed due to a naming conflict. It was first shown at AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in July 1985. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit, for amateur construction. The design later evolved into the Lancair 320, Lancair 360 and the Lancair Legacy, all ancestors of the Lancair Barracuda. Design and development Neibauer, a fine arts graduate from Michigan State University, designed the 200 because he found the existing production aircraft in the 1980s uninteresting. \\"That was my primary motivation for starting on the Lancair 200 in the first place, to build what I hoped would be an aesthetically more pleasing design with better performance and handling.\\" The prototype was intended as a \\"one-off\\" aircraft for his own use and not for production. Neibauer bought a Cessna 150 and salvaged the engine, instruments and avionics, selling the airframe. After displaying the Lancair 200 at Oshkosh in 1985, the design generated a high degree of interest and he began selling kits, initially under the company name of Neico. The aircraft features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The prototype was made of urethane and hot wire cut styrofoam, all covered with wet lay-up fiberglass skin. The production aircraft is made from composite materials, including DuPont Nomex honeycomb structure, some graphite parts and epoxy-impregnated fiberglass cloth for covering. Its span wing employs a NASA NLF(1)-0215F natural laminar flow airfoil and mounts flaps. The standard engines used are the Continental O-200 on the Lancair 200 and the Lycoming O-235 powerplant on the Lancair 235. The Lycoming O-290 engine has also been used. The two models are otherwise identical. The manufacturer estimated the kit construction time as 600 person- hours. Operational history By April 2019, there were two examples of the Lancair 200, registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, plus 50 Lancair 235s. In April 2019 there were six Lancair 235s registered with Transport Canada and one Lancair 235 registered with the British Civil Aviation Authority.

Mr. Hopkins was also the director of the Bureau of Supplies, and that was in times when in his words: ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs markets and the transportation facilities of the United States perhaps have never been as greatly demoralized as now.‚Äù In 1917 answering to Mrs. Moore‚Äôs letter, where she orders wool for more than two months, however because of lack of supplies the order couldn‚Äôt been fulfilled completely, Mr. Hopkins announces: ‚ÄúBear in mind that this situation exists, but that we are doing everything possible to increase the efficiency of the service.‚Äù Shortage of Materials for Red Cross Work - Miami Herald - December 21, 1917 - page Page Three At the time of his death at 57 years old, he was perhaps the largest individual owner of valuable Metropolitan Miami real estate, investing great sums in real properties throughout the last few years before his passing.Death Claims Leading Miami Realty Owner- Miami Herald - August 18, 1937 - page 1-2 Roosevelt Hotel (Lindsey Hopkins Technical College) Postcard, Lindsey Hopkins Vocational School The construction of Roosevelt Hotel was started by Fred Rand, who far out on the other end of his Second avenue business strip, at Fourteenth street, founded the Roosevelt Hotel.

However, the Roosevelt Hotel Project was left unfinished in 1926, and its unfinished walls and rude interior furnished a haven for hobos and the homeless of 10 years, while two hurricanes did their unsuccessful best to ruin it.

However his path to victory was not smooth. In the words of a friend, Hopkins had a ‚Äúdivine spark of push, go-aheadness, and an acquisitive spirit that would broach no stopping.‚Äù He believed the Coca-Cola company had barely scratched the surface of the possibilities before it,‚Äù and he was pretty sure Ernest Woodruff was trying to sell it short. He meant to stop him. As Frederick Allen tells in his book named ‚ÄúSecret Formula‚Äù where he tells how Coca-Cola became worldwide known brand, ‚ÄúOn April 9, 1928, Hopkins leaked a story to the Associated Press in New York disclosing his role as the investor who had been buying Coca-Cola stock and pushing up its price. Then he walked into the main branch of Chase National Bank in New York, signed a six-month note and borrowed $1 million in cash so he could buy more. For the next three weeks, he and the Woodruffs fought a desperate battle over the future of the company. Ernest and Robert and their allies at Trust Company launched a new round of short sales, hoping to depress the price of the stock, while Hopkins spent his million dollars buying up their positions and keeping the value high.‚Äù Philanthropy One of the major philanthropies of Lindsey Hopkins Sr. was the donation of his Atlanta mansion and its spacious grounds to the Peachtree church of Atlanta for a parsonage.

His oeuvre consists of short story anthologies, novels, philosophical works and screenplays but he is best remembered for two novels, Daivadhoothan, regarded as the first Malayalam novel written in stream of consciousness narrative style, and Ora Pro Nobis, a historical novel based on the Dutch colonial rule. He was also the author of Kaliyugam, a philosophical work jointly written with his wife, Sabeena Rafi, which fetched him the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Miscellaneous Works in 1972.  Biography  Ponjikkara, Rafi's birthplace Ponjikkara Rafi was born Joseph Raphael on 12 April 1924 in Naduvathezhathu family of Ponjikkara, an islet in Mulavukad panchayat, along the coast of Ernakulam district, in the south Indian state of Kerala, in a family of carpenters as the seventh among the nine children born to Shouryar Joseph and Anna. After early schooling at Ponnarimangalam School, he shifted to St. Albert's High School in the mainland but could not complete his high school studies. Subsequently, he passed a vocational course in blacksmithy from Government Trade School and started his career as a fitter at the work shop of the Cochin Port. His stay at the port was short as he was terminated from service in the wake of his participation in a workers' strike and his next job at the Indian Aluminium Company, Aluva, as a crane operator, also ended the same way. Later, he shifted his focus to journalism and literature and was associated with magazines such as Suprabha, Udayam and Democrat; it was at Democrat, he had the opportunity to work alongside C. J. Thomas, the noted playwright. He also worked with Vaikom Muhammed Basheer as a partner, when the renowned author ran Circle Book Stall, a book shop in Ernakulam. In 1966, he joined the Sahithya Pravarthaka Saharakarana Sangham, a writers' co-operative, where he worked until 1974, in different capacities as those of a production assistant, reader and as the manager of National Book Stall, the retail wing of the society. Rafi married Sabeena, who was five years elder to him, in 1963, following a period of romance, but the couple did not have children. He died on 6 September 1992, at the age of 68; his wife had predeceased him on 22 June 1990.  Legacy and honours  Rafi published eleven short story anthologies, eight novels, two plays and three essay compilations. His literary journey started with his first published story, Antonyude Vagdhanam (Antony's Promise), which was published in Sathyanadam weekly and the first anthology, Bhavi, was published in 1945. His earlye novels portrayed the Cochin Portuguese creole culture and of the eight novels he wrote, Swargadhoothanand Ora Pro Nobisare the more notable ones. Swargadhoothan, a novel in three parts and published in 1958 is known to be the first Malayalam novel written in stream of consciousness narrative style and Ora Pro Nobis is a historical novel detailing the life of Dutch colonial Kochi. In Swargadhoothan, Rafi envisioned the islets around Kochi getting connected to the mainland in 1958 and it became a reality when Goshree bridges were opened in February 2004. He also wrote a detective novel, Padakkuthira Missi and two plays, Mathai Master and Mezhukuthiri. One of his non-fiction books, Marxism, Oru Thirinjunottam, co-written with his wife, is a detailed study of the Marxian theory and its spiritual aspects; the book also has a critique on Mother of Maxim Gorky. Kaliyugam, a Sabeena Rafi co-written work, is a study of human behaviour from early ages, with a philosophical perspective. The book fetched him the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Miscellaneous Works in 1972. Rafi entered the film world by writing the screenplay and dialogues for Koodappirappu, a J. D. Thottan, released in 1956. One of his stories, Minnaminungu, was adapted into a film under the same name by Ramu Kariat in 1957 and Rafi wrote the screenplay for the film. He was reported to have assisted Vayalar Rama Varma to gain entry into films. He held the position of the secretary of the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad from 1966 to 1974 and served as the vice president of the Parishad for a brief period.

The basis of Gosfilmofond was a unique collection of old films, rescued by film historian Sergei Komarov. It was a collection of silent films, which, by the efforts of Komarov, were moved to the State Technical College of Cinematography. Later these films became a part of Gosfilmofond Collection. On October 2, 1935, the Organizational Bureau decided to create a film-negative fund, because of a poor conditions of storage for films and other cinema materials. In 1936 it was proposed to the Directorate-General of the cinema-photo industry to build a central vault for negatives in Moscow. Firstly, it was decided to build the storage on the territory of the Mosfilm film studio. But then it was moved to the village of Belye Stolby near Moscow. The construction began in 1937.

The Kotzebue region is located in northwest Alaska along the coast, situated between Cape Thompson to the north and Cape Espenberg to the south. Further inland from the coast, the region she inhabited is in the drainage areas of the Noatak, Kobuk, and Selawik Rivers. Her life in this region coincided with rapid changes as other peoples voyaged and then settled in alongside indigenous societies. The region is named for Otto von Kotzebue, who explored the area in 1816. The Plover, of the Franklin Expedition, overwintered in Kotzebue Sound in 1849-50. Over the latter half of the 19th century, increased contact helped to spread disease; local people acquired firearms and alcohol; and some inhabitants abandoned their traditional territories by the turn of the century. Missions and schools were established in 1905-1915. During this time, families alternated between school and subsistence seasons. It was not until after the 1930s that Inupiat peoples settled more permanently into villages. This was a time of rapid shifts, and Della Keats and her family lived a traditional subsistence lifestyle while gradually incorporating new materials and entering into trade with a cash economy. She was a member of one of the ten communities in the Kotzebue region, Nuataagmiut.  Early life Della Keats (Puyuq) was born April 15, 1907 along the upper Noatak River, in a place named Usulak, at a time before immigrant teachers arrived to the area. It was a treeless tundra, and her family lived in a sod house with ugruk windows and a door of brown bear hide. She began school at Point Hope at the age of six, learning her ABCs in English by writing with a flat rock on slates, not tablets. School was in session from October to April, starting in the morning 9-12am, breaking for lunch, and continuing 1-3pm each day. Her whole family resided in the village during the school season. Her father (Nunguqtuaq) was a handyman who was in charge of facilities, but he took time off for trapping and was a member of a whaling crew. Her mother was a housekeeper for the teacher. Young Della was one of six siblings, five surviving into adulthood. Her uncle was Mark Mitchell (Misigaq), her brother Marion (Aapaluk) died, her older brother was Gordon (Apayutnak), her oldest sister Isabella (Qaaqsi), her younger brother Clyde (Piniluq), and younger sister Maneta (Siniksaq). Growing up in a time of rapid cultural transformations, Della Keats witnessed the use of traditional materials and tools, and at the same time observed the increasing use of new materials and tools acquired through trade and adapted to hunting, fishing, housing, and travel. She lived in a sod house as well as a log house and spent time in tents during hunting and fishing season. She wore skin clothes and cotton under clothes. Her mother sewed with a machine discarded by the school, and Della continued to sew with it in adult life. Her bedding was caribou skins but also grass mats on wooden beds in the log house. Her father made a stove and pipe out of kerosene cans. The use of seal gut and sinew was being replaced by twine. Twine was used for fishing and ptarmigan nets, but Della knew about willow bark nets from her mother. Her father hunted with a rifle, but he knew and taught her brother to make and to hunt with a bow and arrow. They made kayaks (qajaq) and skin boats (qajagiaq) out of animals and wood. Paddles were made of caribou shoulder and a willow handle. Seal oil lamps were being replaced by kerosene lamps. And as she grew older, she began to use an inboard motor in a boat. Adapted to seasonal cycles, the family ate from the land and waters of the region: caribou, grayling, trout, sheefish, whitefish, ptarmigan, marmot, muskrat, ducks, beluga. Della Keats has an early memory of having a pet eagle. The family ate fresh and dried fish, and they fed some to their dogs, including meat that had been spoiled and then dried. Nothing was wasted. They traded for flour, molasses, cheese, beans, and mustard. Her mother learned to bake bread. After the school season ended in April, the family would travel by dog team to the coast to hunt seal, camping along Rabbit Creek in tents, with other people from the region. By this time of the year, families were running out of dried meat and seal oil. They hunted ptarmigan along the way. Whoever was successful would share meat with others, equitably, though there were no firm rules on how it would be distributed. They also hunted muskrat and ducks in April and May. They traveled to Kotzebue in July/August to trade seal skins for oil and ammunition and returned to the Noatak River in late August/September to fish for salmon with cotton twine seine nets. In late August, they cut wood for sleds and boat frames, which they would sell or trade for supplies. They spent the time before school started in October sewing winter clothes, mukluks and waders. Della Keats reported in her autobiography that she started making mukluks and mittens by age 8 and was making her father's mukluks by age 11. She also helped him make nets. She made ugruk bottoms (soles for footwear) with her own teeth by age 11, and was beginning to sell and trade some items in Kotzebue. One early memory she has is of an incident that involved her family saving a surveyor crew along the Kelly River. The U.S. Geological Survey Field Party in the summer and spring of 1925 had not been able to hunt successfully, so Della Keats' family shared their food and helped the party to survive.  Adult Life and Healing Work  Della Keats' autobiography skips from her early years, 1907-1918, to her adult life, 1930s-1940s. According to the editors of her autobiography, she had married a reindeer herder when she was 16 but was the sole parent and provider of three children in her 20s--Perry, Priscilla, and Sylvester--who ranged in age from 3-9 in 1943. She worked as the Postmaster at Noatak Village to support her children. She also made a living by selling things she sewed and by actively participating in subsistence harvesting with her larger family group. Her parents would travel up and down the Noatak River, and she eventually moved in to help them in 1945. Della Keats exhibited an interest in anatomy, the circulatory system, and midwifery from a young age. One report writes that she learned human anatomy and circulation from a textbook when she was in seventh and eighth grade. The anatomical nomenclature of the Inupiat language suggests that members of the culture shared a similar interest. Father Oleksa's brief portrait claims that she started healing people when she was 16, although her autobiography says that she started practicing medicine in her mid 20s. Residents of the Kotzebue Sound region recognized her as a general medical practitioner, and she served both white and Inupiat patients and delivered lectures and health education across cultures. She was in private practice in the Kotzebue Sound region through the late 1960s, but she began to travel more in the 1970s, with the support of Native corporations, to share her knowledge more widely. What seems to be well known and emphasized is that Della Keats used her hands to heal. The healing hands of the Inupiat people like Della Keats was not unique but characteristic of other Alaska Native groups such as the Aleuts and Alutiiq. Massage and cold and heat helped with diagnosis and treatment of a range of ailments--liver, stomach, constipation, sprains, dislocations, fractures--and could also be used to turn babies in utero or move an umbilical cord Due to a history of disease epidemics, the introduction of refined foods, and a lingering distrust from experimental procedures, it was a slow process to establish mutual respect and trust. Practitioners like Della Keats found a way to integrate traditional Alaska Native medicine (magico-religious) with Western medicine (empirico-rational) in complementary fashion. Her personality and character have been credited for her success in blending Inupiat tribal healing and Western medicine for the benefit and respect of all. When Dr. Elisabeth KublerRoss, an international expert on grief, death and dying, visited Anchorage, Alaska in 1998, she called attention, during a public address at Humana Hospital, to a suicide epidemic among young Alaska Natives, lamenting that it had been kept secret for too long and should be cause for all to scream loudly. She encouraged methods that promote pride and respect for Alaska and that teach the old culture. KublerRoss cited the example of Della Keats, the Eskimo healer from Nome who spent much of her time with young people, as an example of sustaining both cultural pride and traditions.  Legacy  A member of the University of Alaska Nursing Faculty, Tina DeLapp, has written about the contributions of Della Keats in an article titled, \\"American Eskimos: The Yup‚Äôik and Inupiat.\\" = Awards and Honors = * In 1983, Della Keats was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in Health Sciences, by the University of Alaska Anchorage. * In 2009, Della Keats was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame. According to the award biography, as written by Gabriela Riquelme, Keats \\"used three tools to heal her patients: her hands, her head, and her heart. Her hands were her main tools. Her sense of touch was highly developed and just by touching Keats could diagnose troubles and pains. She would prescribe home remedies made from herbs and plants from the tundra, or perform massages or exercises on her patients. She would give advice and suggest certain practical activities for her patients and their families to do to stay healthy. Keats believed the more people were involved with their own bodies, the higher the chances were they could heal themselves and take control of their own health. Keats encouraged her patients to take an interest in healing themselves through a positive and personal approach.\\" * Della Keats has an entry in the National Library of Medicine, which is sponsored by the National Institute of Health. = Maniilaq Health Center = The Maniilaq Health Center, based in Kotzebue, got its start from Della Keats, who practiced as an Inupiaq tribal doctor. The Center has attracted the attention of Western doctors who wish to understand and refer patients for traditional healing practices. While Western doctors undergo formal medical education, tribal doctors learn by apprenticing with traditional healers. = Della Keats Health Sciences Curriculum = Both a summer bridge program and a summer research program are named in honor of Della Keats for her long-standing commitment to the health of Native peoples and all people in Alaska. * Della Keats Health Sciences Summer Program ** Part of the UAA WWAMI School of Medical Education, the summer program is a bridge program that serves high school students from rural areas who are planning to pursue medical and health care careers in college. * Della Keats Summer Research Program ** The summer research program is a continuation from the previous summer.

Biography Younker was born to a Jewish family in Lipno, Poland, one of six sons of Jennie and Isaac Younker. He was raised in Orthodox Judaism and received a traditional Jewish education. As economic opportunities for Jews was limited in Poland, he immigrated to the United States as a teenager. He first traveled to New York City with his brother Samuel where they failed at several business ventures before moving to Keokuk, Iowa where their brother Lipman had settled. At the time Keokuk had the largest Jewish population in Iowa and was well situated as terminal for steamboat traffic thanks to its location at the confluence of the Mississippi River and the Des Moines River. In 1856, Marcus, Lipman (1834 ‚Äì May 22, 1903) and Samuel (November 7, 1837 ‚Äì May 21, 1879) opened a dry goods and clothing store on the town's Main Street while supplementing their income with peddling wagons that sold to rural customers in nearby Lee County and Des Moines County. In 1866, the importance of Keokuk was diminished with the opening of the Des Moines Valley Railroad which linked Keokuk to Des Moines. Forecasting that additional rail lines would further reduce the strategic importance of Keokuk, in 1874, they sent their half-brother, Herman Younker, to Des Moines to open a dry goods and clothing store in the city's Walnut Street business district. In 1879, his brother Samuel died and soon after, they closed the Keokuk store. Lipman moved to New York City where he continued on as a buyer and Marcus took control of the now Younker Brothers Department Store in Des Moines and led its transformation from a dry goods store to a general department store. In 1881, believing that women would prefer to be waited on by women, he hired female salespersons, which was unique at the time. Marcus then sent his half-brother, Herman Younker to New York City to keep abreast of the latest fashion trends and in 1904, the company incorporated which enabled it to raise capital and purchase its local competitors: the Grand Department Store (1912), the Wilkins Department Stores (1923), Harris-Emery (1927), and J. Mandelbaum and Sons (1928). Younkers was known for catering to a wide variety of income levels with a \\"bargain-basement\\" for low income customers seeking value and a tearoom for more discriminating customers. By 1910, they had over 500 employees. Later renamed Younkers, the firm would expand to seven Midwestern states. Personal life Marcus married his first cousin, Anna Berkson, who had originally settled in New Orleans. His brothers married sisters: Lipman married Gertrude Cohen; and Samuel married Ernestina \\"Tina\\" Cohen, both daughters of New York City rabbi, Falk Cohen. As devout Jews, their store was closed on the Jewish Sabbath and Marcus was active in the local B'nai B'rith and was instrumental in establishing the city's first synagogue where he would later serve as president of the B'nai Jeshurun congregation. Marcus Younker died in 1926 at the Commodore Hotel in Des Moines.

The area has since undergone urbanisation as part of the city's continued sprawl outwards. Like many urban areas, Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria, Australia, faces environmental issues, many related to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl and the demand for infrastructure and services. Impact of drought One such issue is the impact of drought on water supply. Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne's water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors. During the Millennium drought, the Bracks Government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, greywater systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water-saving and reuse initiatives. But as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant, and the so-called North- South Pipeline from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria's north to Melbourne. Neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during 2010, and therefore both have been criticised as 'white elephants'. Response to climate change In response to attribution of recent climate change, in 2002 the City of Melbourne set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program. Not all metropolitan municipalities have followed suit, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon-neutral. Melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low-density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city is non-native species, most of European origin, including many invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox.Marks, C.A. & Bloomfield, T.E. (1999) Distribution and density estimates for urban foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Melbourne: implications for rabies control Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the northeast and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils. Air quality, by world standards, is classified as good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area. Dredging in Melbourne An environmental issue that was raised in Melbourne in 2008 was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay‚Äîthe Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. It was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments. Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems, as well as litter. Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day. Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment toward sustainability, was launched in Melbourne.

Her works tend to be contemporary and historical fiction, with some magical elements.  Personal life  Lee is a fourth-generation Chinese-American. Her family on her mother's side originally came to America in the 1800s, but wasn't permitted to stay due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. Her father immigrated to San Francisco in 1953. She grew up in southern California and has two sisters. Lee wrote her first novel when she was nine and says that she always wanted to become a writer. Lee graduated from UCLA and has a law degree from UC Davis School of Law. She practiced law in Silicon Valley for a few years prior to becoming an author. Lee is also the legal director of the non-profit organization We Need Diverse Books and is one of the founders of the movement. Lee is married and has two children, a daughter and a son.  Selected works  Her debut novel, Under a Painted Sky, about a Chinese-American girl and an African-American girl who travel the Oregon Trail during the gold rush was published in 2016. She was inspired to write Under the Painted Sky based on her complex family history in the 1800s and chose a Chinese-American protagonist who doesn't speak Chinese like her. Aside from similarities in the main character's upbringing and her own, she chose not to incorporate details of her family history into the novel. Outrun the Moon, her second novel, set during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, about a Chinese-American teen struggling to escape her family's circle of poverty, was published the same year. She drew on her family history again for the novel and did field research traveling to various locations in the novel, among them Chinatown and the Golden Gate Park.

He made his professional debut in January 1938, reaching the top makuuchi division in January 1943. His highest rank was ≈çzeki, which he held in two spells from June 1947 until October 1948, and again from January 1950 until his retirement in May 1951. He then became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and worked as a coach at Dewanoumi stable until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 in 1983. He died later in the same year. Career He was born in (present day Himeji). He was known for his strong physique since elementary school, and worked alongside adults in salt making. He was spotted by the top division wrestler Kasagiyama Katsuichi who persuaded him to join the prestigious Dewanoumi stable. At the time, Dewanoumi stable was seeking a way to stop the dominance of Futabayama from the rival Tatsunami stable, and Kasagiyama, a talented Waseda University graduate, was tasked with this research. The young Kishimoto was seen as extremely promising. He made his debut in January 1938 at the age of 20, initially fighting under his own surname. He rose quickly through the lower divisions, and reached sekitori status in January 1942 when he was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division. To mark the occasion he changed his shikona to Shionoumi. He made his top makuuchi division debut in January 1943, and in January 1944 earned his first kinboshi, or gold star for a yokozuna upset, when he defeated Futabayama. He progressed into the sanyaku ranks, making komusubi and then sekiwake, and in the only tournament held in 1946 he was runner-up to Haguroyama with an 11‚Äì2 record. After this tournament he was promoted to ≈çzeki. He scored only five wins against five losses in his debut ≈çzeki tournament held in June 1947, and was demoted from the rank after two consecutive losing scores in May and October 1948. However he returned to ≈çzeki after two strong performances in 1949, defeating yokozuna Azumafuji in May and following up with another 10‚Äì5 record at sekiwake in October. He held onto his ≈çzeki rank in 1950, but had a poor tournament in January 1951, being forced to default after four days, missing the next three through injury and then returning to lose another eight straight to finish with a 0-12-3 record. He retired after the following tournament, facing demotion from ≈çzeki once again. His career record was 184 wins against 140 losses, with 16 injury absences. His top division record was 125-115. He had shouldered the burden of being the future of Dewanoumi stable, but had been unable to win a championship or defeat Haguroyama in 13 attempts. (The only other ≈çzeki to face a yokozuna 10 or more times in his career and have no wins was Miyabiyama, who went 0-11 against Takanohana.) Retirement from sumo Shionoumi remained in sumo as a coach at Dewanoumi stable, as an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Dekiyama. He was also a judge of tournament bouts. He reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and left the Sumo Association on 28 February 1983. He worked in a ryokan in Monzennakacho, K≈çt≈ç, but died of a myocardial infarction on 18 July of the same year.

She led the development of an algorithm for imaging black holes, known as Continuous High- resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors (CHIRP), and was a member of the Event Horizon Telescope team that captured the first image of a black hole. As of June 2019, she is an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology.Katie Bouman at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory(April 2019) Focus on the First Event Horizon Telescope Results ‚Äî the series of articles in The Astrophysical Journal Letters which report the EHT results.  Early life and education  Bouman grew up in West Lafayette, Indiana. Her father, Charles Bouman, is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering at Purdue University. According to the Jerusalem Post, Katie Bouman is Jewish. As a high school student, Bouman conducted imaging research at Purdue University. She graduated from West Lafayette Junior-Senior High School in 2007. She first learned about the Event Horizon Telescope in school in 2007. Bouman studied electrical engineering at the University of Michigan and graduated summa cum laude in 2011. She earned her master's degree (2013) and doctoral degree (2017) in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, she was a member of the Haystack Observatory. She was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Her master's thesis, Estimating Material Properties of Fabric through the Observation of Motion, was awarded the Ernst Guillemin Award for best Master's Thesis in electrical engineering. Her Ph.D. dissertation, Extreme imaging via physical model inversion: seeing around corners and imaging black holes, was supervised by William T. Freeman. Prior to receiving her doctoral degree, Bouman delivered a TEDx talk, How to Take a Picture of a Black Hole, which explained algorithms that could be used to capture the first image of a black hole.  Research and career  After earning her doctorate, Bouman joined Harvard University as a postdoctoral fellow on the Event Horizon Telescope Imaging team. The first direct image of a black hole, imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope and published in April 2019 Bouman joined Event Horizon Telescope project in 2013. She led the development of an algorithm for imaging black holes, known as Continuous High- resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors (CHIRP). CHIRP inspired image validation procedures used in acquiring the first image of a black hole in April 2019, and Bouman played a significant role in the project by verifying images, selecting parameters for filtering images taken by the Event Horizon Telescope, and participating in the development of a robust imaging framework that compared the results of different image reconstruction techniques. Her group is analyzing the Event Horizon Telescope's images to learn more about general relativity in a strong gravitational field. Bouman received significant media attention after a photo, showing her reaction to the detection of the black hole shadow in the EHT images, went viral. Some people in the media and on the Internet misleadingly implied that Bouman was a \\"lone genius\\" behind the image. However, Bouman herself repeatedly noted that the result came from the work of a large collaboration, showing the importance of teamwork in science. Bouman also became the target of online harassment, to the extent that her colleague Andrew Chael made a statement on Twitter criticizing \\"awful and sexist attacks on my colleague and friend\\", including attempts to undermine her contributions by crediting him solely with work accomplished by the team. She joined the California Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in June 2019, where she plans to work on new systems for computational imaging using computer vision and machine learning.

In 1934 Burke made her debut in Broadway in They Shall Not Die, and in 1944 she won a Donaldson Award as the third choice for Best Supporting Actress in Edward Chodorov's play, Decision. Burke had performed in the 1952 U.S. State Department-sponsored international production of Porgy and Bess and had taken a role as a nurse in the radio program When a Girl Marries, which had been broadcast for 18 years. She had also performed in the 1944 Broadway production of Anna Lucasta and its second film counterpart in 1958. Burke has been credited as one of the early appearances of the \\"stereotyped humorous black maid\\" in entertainment since her appearance in the radio soap opera Betty and Bob. She died in 1985 at the age of 107, at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan.  Early life and career  Burke was born on February 27, 1878, in La Grange or Atlanta, Georgia, to a minister and a nurse. She attended Claflin University and New Orleans University and worked as a public school teacher in Wilson, North Carolina. Due to a slapping incident by superintendent Charles L. Coon towards another teacher, Burke, along with other colored teachers at the school, protested the incident by resigning from her teaching position and continued teaching at another school. Burke later moved to New York City, where she attended Columbia University in 1929. During a visit to Lew Leslie's first rehearsal of Blackbirds of 1928, a friend of Burke's urged her to sing St. Louis Blues in front of the rehearsal cast, where Leslie had walked in and‚Äîamong hearing her voice‚Äîpersuaded her to join the pre-existing choir for Blackbirds of 1928.

It is found on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean. This species was first described in 1803 by the English naturalist George Montagu who gave it the name Cardium rubrum. It was later transferred to the genus Lasaea, making it Lasaea rubra. Description This small mollusc has a maximum length of about . The shell is oval, thin and fragile, with both valves convex. The umbones are slightly behind the midline, both valves having a single lateral tooth on each side of the hinge with the left valve having in addition, a cardinal tooth. The ligament is internal and passes through a deep groove below the hinge in each valve, and has a broad plate beneath the hind lateral teeth. The valves are finely sculptured with closely spaced concentric lines, and the annual growth rings are clearly visible. Externally, the valves are white with pink or brownish concentric bands, and internally it is white: the adductor scars are large and the pallial line broad but indistinct. Distribution and habitat Lasaea rubra is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean where its range extends from Norway through the North Sea to the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. It is found in the intertidal zone on rocky shores, lodged in crevices, in tufts of lichen or among the holdfasts ad fronds of seaweed, attached by byssus threads. Biology Lasaea rubra is a simultaneous hermaphrodite and the eggs are retained inside the mantle cavity while they develop. The veliger larval stage is omitted from the life cycle and when fully developed, juvenile molluscs are released and crawl away from the parent. Adults are found to be able to move in a day and juveniles twice that distance. The majority of individuals inhabiting the same rock crevice are found to be clones of each other, having been developed parthenogenetically from a common ancestor.

Personal life  Pan was born in Illinois and is the only child of Taiwanese parents who immigrated to the United States. Her father is a professor at The College of New Jersey and her mother is a piano and guzheng teacher. She attempted to write her first novel in second grade and ultimately finished her first novel for a sixth grade assignment at school. By 15, she was querying literary agents to pursue publication. Pan studied International Marketing at NYU Stern, where she graduated a semester early. After graduation, she worked as an editor-in-chief at the Washington Square Review before getting accepted into the NYU's Creative Writing program. In 2010, while in grad school, she developed the idea for what would become her debut novel and kept rewriting and putting it aside in favor of different manuscripts. Together with fellow author Nova Ren Suma, Pan is also the co-founder of Foreshadow: A Serial Anthology, a monthly online anthology for young adult short stories, which was realized via the crowdfunding site Indiegogo in August 2018. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.  The Astonishing Color of After  Pan's debut novel tells the story of 15-year old Leigh, who deals with her mother's recent death by suicide through traveling to Taiwan and meeting her maternal grandparents. Believing that her mother has been reincarnated as a great red bird, she tries to find clues in her family history to uncover what really happened to her mother. The Astonishing Color of After was published by Little, Brown in March 2018 and debuted on the New York Times Bestseller List at #10. Pan wrote the novel as a tribute to her grandmother, inspired by her life in colonial Taiwan. Originally it was planned to be historical fiction, set in 1927, and span over 40 years of a Taiwanese woman's life, but Pan ultimately opted for a contemporary setting.

Mineral Mountain is situated in North Cascades National Park and the summit offers views of Mount Shuksan, Icy Peak, and the Picket Range. Easy Peak is set to the east, and the nearest higher neighbor is Ruth Mountain, to the west. Precipitation runoff from Mineral Mountain finds its way north into the Chilliwack River, and south into the Baker River. Climate Mineral Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Mineral from WNW near Ruth Mountain The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Founding of the Machinists Union  Thomas W. Talbot Monument in Grant Park, Atlanta, Georgia Talbot was working as a Machinist in the Atlantic Coastline Railway shops, at Florence, South Carolina under deplorable conditions and for very small wages when he conceived the idea of organizing the Machinists for the purpose of improving their conditions through cooperation and collective action. After repeated efforts and many meetings held at the homes of various Machinists, a local organization was formed one night at the home of a Machinist named Green. This was in the early 1880s. Shortly after forming this organization Talbot was discharged by his employer for his Union activities. After leaving the Atlantic Coastline Railroad, Talbot moved around for a while until he landed a job at the Southern Railway in Atlanta Georgia. Upon leaving Florence, the lodges he had formed fell apart in the absence of his influence.

During her tenure at Brandeis, she was director of the women's studies program from 1991 to 2001 and launched The Scholars Program, the first graduate program to focus on Jewish women. She was the founding director of the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute in 1997 and founder and director of the Women's Studies Research Center in 2001. Early life Shulamit Tirzah \\"Shula\\" Rothschild was born in 1946 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands to Ilse Hertha (n√©e Strauss) and Max Michael Rothschild. She was named after the Shulamite to whom the biblical Solomon sung the Song of Songs. Rothschild's family were of German-Jewish heritage and as teenagers her parents became involved in the Socialist-Zionist youth movement known as Habonim to learn the agricultural skills which might be needed for life on a kibbutz. During World War II both of Rothschild's parents' families were scattered. Her father's sisters were rescued through the Kindertransport program, which sent them to England, and his parents, fled to Malden, Massachusetts. Her mother's parents were transported from Germany to the Gurs concentration camp near Pau, France. Rothschild's maternal grandfather died from starvation in Gurs before her maternal grandmother was sent to Auschwitz and exterminated. Two maternal aunts managed to escape to Palestine and survived The Holocaust. After Kristallnacht and Max's detention in Buchenwald, Rothschild's parents fled their homeland with the help of Habonim, which secured Max's release. Hoping to pass through Holland and make aliyah to Eretz Yisrael, they were unable to leave the country because of the limits on immigration imposed by the British White Paper of 1939. When the Nazis invaded in 1940, the couple were forced into hiding. Thirteen months after the war ended, Rothschild was born and when she was one year old, her family migrated to the United States to join her paternal grandparents in Massachusetts. They did not remain long, but immigrated to Israel within a year and a half, where Rothschild's sister, Tova Chaya \\"Toby\\" was born. Plans did not go as expected and the family soon returned to Massachusetts. A brother, Yonatan Efraim \\"Jonathan\\", joined the family and Rothschild attended first grade in suburban Boston. In 1951 the family moved to Bergen County, New Jersey, where the remainder of Rothschild's schooling occurred. In addition to her secular education, from a young age Rothschild received Jewish instruction in Teaneck and celebrated her bat mitzva in 1959. In high school, at River Edge, New Jersey, she met Jehuda Reinharz, a German immigrant who had recently arrived in the U.S. speaking only Hebrew and German. As she spoke both, Rothschild helped Jehuda acclimate to the United States. Furthering her education, Rothschild graduated with a BA in sociology from Barnard College in 1967. Later that year, on 26 November 1967 in New York City, she married Reinharz and subsequently the couple had two daughters: Yael Dalia, Naomi Carla. Career Reinharz began her career in 1970 at Simmons School of Social Work. Between 1972 and 1983, she taught psychology, as an assistant professor at the University of Michigan. During this time, she earned her master's degree in sociology and completed a PhD from Brandeis University in 1977. During her studies, she recognized how \\"inadequate\\" the representations of women's lives were in social science and was drawn to examine women history had forgotten. She taught her first course in women's studies at Michigan in 1979. In 1982, she became an assistant professor of sociology at Brandeis; earned a full professorship in 1991, the only woman to hold the rank at the university; and became the women's studies program director 1992. That year she launched an interdisciplinary graduate program, known as The Scholars Program, allowing students to earn a dual master's degree in women's studies and another field, which was the first graduate program to focus on Jewish women. In 1997, Reinharz was chosen as founding director of the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, after she had chaired the National Commission on American Jewish Women for the organization. The Institute was founded to focus on publishing research and organizing conferences and lectures regarding Jewish women's roles in various eras, but did not offer academic courses. The Institute, devoted to the study of Jewish women, was the first of its kind and aimed as a feminist enterprise to bring \\"women into the scholarship\\" of Jewish studies. In 1998, Reinharz and the Institute partnered with the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies to found Nashim, a journal on Jewish gender studies, for which she became co- editor. Between 1997 and 2000, Reinharz, after being denied help from Brandeis administrators, raised over $2.4 million to renovate a derelict building and oversaw its design and construction to house the Women's Studies Research Center. The Center, which opened 19 November 2000 was created to house both the graduate program in Women's Studies and the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, as well as research office space, and a reference library. In 2001, Reinharz stepped down as director of the women's studies program, when she became founding director of the Center, though she continued to publish and edit the research of others, authoring over 60 articles and a dozen books throughout her career. During her academic career, Reinharz strove to develop new methodologies for social sciences. Using holistic and interdisciplinary methods, she analyzed subjects in their context and argued that methods used in the natural sciences were inadequate for studying behavior, bias and the purpose of actions. She retired in 2017 from her post as the Jacob Potofsky Professor of Sociology and as director of the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute and in honor of the occasion Nashim dedicated its 32nd, 33rd, and 34th issues to her.

Principle of function  While photons exist as excitations of a vector potential and so contain an oscillating dipole term, gravitons are a spin-2 field and so have an oscillating quadrupole term. For efficient lasing to occur, there are several conditions that must be met: # There must be particles in an excited state capable of emitting radiation at the desired frequency. In a normal laser, these would be valence electrons in an excited state. For a gaser, the more straightforward analog would be a binary system of massive bodies. # These particles must couple to supplied radiation, in order to provide stimulated emission. This could be possible in a gaser by a stimulated analog of the Penrose process. # The particles must be in an inverted population, where more are in the excited state than the ground state. This typically requires some type of pumping, such as optical pumping. # The lasing medium must be long enough for the radiation to persist and excite more of the same. In optical systems this can typically be created by mirrors, effectively making a larger optical path length. For a gaser, a large-scale, slowly spatially varying gravitational potential could act as a mirror (by the WKB approximation). Alternately, a hypothetical gaser could simply be built with sufficient length to begin with. Alternate design proposals involve free undulators akin to a free-electron laser. Several proposals involve exploiting the momentum transport properties of superconductors, where s-waves and d-waves couple distinctly to gravitational radiation. As of 2019, there are no plans to construct a gravity laser. Use in Science Fiction The idea of gravity lasers has been in part popularized by science fiction works such as Earth Unaware where glasers are used as a plot device to enable planetary-scale manipulation of matter, akin to gravity guns. In other works such as Star Ocean they may be a hypothetical weapon. They are also commonly employed as a proposed mechanism for tractor beams or antigravity.

It is an erect shrub usually with simple leaves and white to pink, four-petalled flowers. Description Boronia pauciflora is an erect, many-branched shrub that grows to high and is only hairy when young. Its branches are more or less square in cross-section and the leaves are arranged in opposite pairs. Mature leaves are simple and have a petiole long, but juvenile leaves are trifoliate and sessile. Mature leaves and the end leaflet of juvenile leaves are elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide and the side leaflets are a similar shape but shorter. The flowers are white to pink and are egg-shaped to triangular, usually arranged singly, sometimes in groups of up to three, in leaf axils on a pedicel long. The four sepals are egg-shaped to triangular, long and wide but almost double in size as the fruit develops. The petals are a similar size to the sepals and scarcely enlarge as the fruit develops. Flowering occurs from May to July. Taxonomy and naming Boronia pauciflora was first formally described in 1918 by William Vincent Fitzgerald from a specimen he collected \\"above the base of Mt. Broome, King Leopold Ranges\\" (modern-day Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges). The description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (pauciflora) is derived from the Latin words paucus meaning \\"few\\" or \\"little\\" and -florus meaning \\"flowered\\". Distribution and habitat This boronia grows in rocky places near the Prince Regent River, Edkins Range and King Leopold Ranges in the Kimberley region. Conservation Boronia pauciflora is classed as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

It is located north of Marblemount and Diobsud Buttes, on the shared boundary of North Cascades National Park and the Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness. Its nearest higher peak is Electric Butte, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Logger Butte drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Logger Butte is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Brodsky is a Professor of Earth Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She studies the fundamental physical properties of earthquakes, as well as the seismology of volcanoes and landslides.  Early life and education  Brodsky earned her bachelor's degree magna cum laude at Harvard University in 1995. Whilst there, she set up Harvard Undergraduate Television. Brodsky moved to California for her PhD, completing her doctorate in 2001 from California Institute of Technology. She worked on rectified diffusion theory, the mechanism that describes how strain waves pump volatile organic compounds into bubbles. Rectified diffusion theory can move dynamic strain from a volcanic tremor or tectonic earthquake to static strain inside a magma chamber. Soon after graduating Brodsky joined the University of California, Santa Cruz. Here she helped several National Science Foundation- MARGINS postdoctoral fellows, including Heather M. Savage and Christie D. Rowe, begin their careers in geophysics.  Research and career  Map of the Salton Sea drainage area in the Salton Sink endorheic basin Brodsky has extensively studied the physics of earthquakes. She has investigated what causes earthquakes to trigger, as well as their hydrogeology and fault zone structure. The impact of earthquakes on subsequent earthquakes ('triggering') is still not well understood. Brodsky demonstrated that seismic waves can general locally seismic waves. She found that dynamic stress waves from one earthquake can initiate further earthquakes. She has challenged the idea that static stress controls earthquake triggering, and found that aftershocks have similar distributions as main shocks. She showed that using the amplitude of previous earthquakes it is possible to predict earthquake triggering at all distances. By studying the Salton Sea geothermal field, Brodsky showed that there was a relationship between human activity and seismic activity. Fault slips can cause nearby rocks to fracture, changing the shape of the surface underneath them and turning the rocks on the floor into powder. She became interested in the permeability of fractured rocks, demonstrating that seismic waves can unclog fractures. Brodsky identified that the build up of pressure can causes changes in groundwater during earthquakes. After earthquakes, Brodsky drills deep within the fault zone to monitor the temperature. She studied the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, finding a series of temperature pulses that occur due to the flow of fluids through a zone of increased permeability. Immediately after an earthquake, the fault zone can be damaged and have higher permeability, but heals within a few months. Generally, earthquakes are triggered when tectonic stress overcomes friction, and Brodsky became interested in what causes this friction in the first place. Brodsky has shown that the coefficient of friction after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami was considerably lower than expected. Alongside earthquakes, Brodsky studies volcanoes, geysers, landslides and rivers. Occasionally, volcanoes are triggered by distant earthquakes. Brodsky predicted that, alongside growth of bubbles and overturn of magma chambers, volcanoes could be triggered by failure of rocks surrounding a magma chamber. Brodsky serves on the board of directors for the Southern California Earthquake Center and the IRIS Consortium.

The book includes * the adventure * statistics for pre- generated characters * player handouts that can be photocopied * a page of text that was erroneously left out of the book before printing. Reception Jon Sutherland reviewed Death in Dunwich for White Dwarf #48, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \\"Death in Dunwich can be interesting, frustrating and terminal and consequently is the better of the two [when compared to Arkham Evil].\\" In the November 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue #91), Ken Rolston thought that Call of Cthulhu lent itself to murder mysteries better than any other role-playing game, but found issue with the organization of this adventure, and noted that no summary or chronology of the adventure is provided for the referee. Rolston also criticized the fact that only bare statistics are given for pre-generated characters, with no background for the players to use. Despite these issues, Rolston called this \\"an excellent adventure and an example of what good role-playing mystery should be. The theme is imaginative and engaging. The narrative is a sequence of well-developed episodes with many clues and false leads, with important informants who must be discovered and interrogated, and with a wealth of evidence ‚Äî police reports, newspaper articles, and NPC testimonials ‚Äî that must be sifted for significance by the players.\\" Rolston praised the macabre elements that \\"are contrasted nicely against the mundane setting of a rural New England town.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"Though the weaknesses in presentation in Death in Dunwich are unfortunate, they are understandable, given the particular problems of designing, organizing, and presenting role-playing mystery adventures. The mystery itself is detailed, challenging, and dramatic. The horror is satisfactorily evil and gruesome in the style, and the setting, background, and characters are effectively detailed.\\" Richard Lee reviewed Death in Dunwich for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"Unfortunately, there are two major failings. Firstly, DiD is very short. For [the price] you expect more than this single-facet plot. Secondly, the atmosphere is wrong. DiD, one feels, is more influenced by low-budget horror films than by Lovecraft. What use is a Cthulhu supplement where the paranormal is the flaw of the story?!

Wisting is the most expensive television drama series produced in Norway. This ten episodes thriller is based on two J√∏rn Lier Horst novels, The Caveman (2012) and The Hunting Dogs (2013). In episodes 1‚Äì5, Wisting heads a murder investigation with FBI collaboration since the suspect is a serial killer hunted in the US. In episodes 6-10, Wisting has to defend himself against accusations of tampering with evidence in a previous murder case.  Plot  A man's body is found, hidden in the snow, under a tree on a Christmas tree farm near Larvik, Norway. This is investigated by William Wisting and his team of detectives. Fingerprints link the death to Robert Godwin, an American serial killer who has been on the run for more than 20 years. He is believed to have fled to Larvik, \\"hiding in plain sight\\", having assumed the identity of a local resident. In response the FBI sends Special Agents Maggie Griffin and John Bantham to assist the Norwegian investigation. But they must keep their presence secret to avoid alerting the killer, who they fear will flee again. Wisting's daughter, Line, is a journalist writing a story about their next-door neighbour, who had died alone in his house. Unwittingly, her investigating opens up connections with the police murder investigation and she becomes a target. Line's liaison with Bantham, allowing her to discover his identity, compromises his cover. Meanwhile, the police discover the killer's principal dumpsite, the body count sharply rises and the hunt moves over the border into Sweden before Wisting and Griffin corner the killer in a dramatic climax. Wisting appears on a national television show to discuss the Robert Godwin case. Instead he is ambushed by Philip Henden, a lawyer representing Vidar Haglund, who was jailed for 17 years in a different murder case. Now released, Haglund has always maintained his innocence.

She was employed as a clerical assistant in 1918, and rose by 1927 to become head of the accounting and copying department in the House of Lords, a position she retained until her retirement in 1944. Biography Hannah Frances Mary Court, known as May Court, was born in Streatham, London on 3 December 1880. Her father, Thomas Ambrey Court, was by the time of her birth working as an accountant at the House of Lords. May Court took work as a teacher in 1901, at a boarding school in Wandsworth, later moving to an embroidery job in Chelsea. Her twin brother, Robert Ambrey Court, followed his father and was employed before World War I in the Lords accounting and copying department; but he was killed in 1917 in Northern France. May Court entered employment at the house of Lords on 1 April 1918 as a lady clerical assistant; not as a direct replacement for her brother, but rather as an employee connected by family at a time of shortage of male candidates. May Court and another employee, Mabel Evelyn Waterman, were the first two women to be taken on in administrative roles; all prior women appointments had been involved in catering and cleaning duties. Court was promoted to an accounting role in 1919, where she became responsible for the administration of salaries and pensions, the payment of invoices, and the keeping and presentation to the House of accounts. In 1927, she was promoted to the position of head of the accounting and copying department, responsible for a staff of three, until 1936, all women. During the second World War she took on additional responsibilities as a reserve fire spotter in Chelsea. She was awarded an OBE in 1942 and retired on 1 July 1944. She died, unmarried and without issue, on 19 April 1945 in Kensington of uterine cancer and heart failure.
