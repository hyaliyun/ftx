Hugh was seated at Foulis Castle in Ross-shire, Scotland. Although Hugh is traditionally the 9th Baron and 12th overall chief of the clan, he is only the 2nd Munro chief that can be proved by contemporary evidence.Munro, R. W. (1978). The Munro Tree 1734. Published in Edinburgh. pp. 3 - on opposite unnumbered page - paragraph L. . Lands and Charters Hugh Munro was the eldest son of Robert de Munro, 8th Baron of Foulis (d.1369). Upon his father's death Hugh succeeded as chief of the clan and he was granted from his cousin, Uilleam III, Earl of Ross, charters for the lands of Katewell and the Tower of Badgarvie in the parish of Kiltearn. The following year in 1370 Hugh was granted more lands from the same Earl including Inverlael in Loch Broom, Kilmachalmack in Strath-Oykel, Carbisdale in Strathcarron, lands in the parish of Kincardine, Sutherland and was also reserved the salmon fishing in the Kyle of Oykel for himself and his heirs.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1898). History of the Munros of Fowlis. pp. 13 - 17. In 1379 Euphemia I, Countess of Ross confirmed the lands of Contullich and the Tower of Ardoch (Contullich Castle) to her cousin Hugh Munro of Foulis and in 1394 she granted Hugh two charters, one in respect of the \\"Tower of Strathschech\\" and \\"Wesstir Fowlys\\".Fraser, C.

Harlaw and the Lord of the Isles In 1411 Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis joined Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles the chief of Clan Donald in contest with Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar for the Earldom of Ross. This resulted in the Battle of Harlaw. The Munros fought in the Lord of the Isles 'host' against an army of Scottish Lowlanders led by the Duke of Albany who was temporarily prevented from gaining power in Ross-shire.Monroe, James Phinney. (1900). A Sketch of the Clan Munro and William Munroe, Deported from Scotland, settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. pp. 14. The result of the battle has been a matter of argument amongst many historians. Some have said that Donald and the Highlanders had victory as the Duke of Albany did not return to the Highlands for four years until 1415. Others say that Donald failed to inflict a decisive victory because he withdrew back to the western highlands. The battle seems to have been indecisive for both sides. In 1415 the Earldom of Ross was resigned to the Duke of Albany who in turn awarded it to his son the John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan. However it would pass to the Lord of the Isles within a generation. Family Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis married Isabelle Keith daughter of William Keith, 1st Earl Marischal, also known as the Great Marishchal of Scotland. They had 4 children: #George Munro, 10th Baron of Foulis. Hugh's heir and successor as chief of the Clan Munro. #John Munro, 1st of Milntown. Progenitor of the Munro of Milntown branch of the clan. #Janet Munro. Married Malcolm Og MacKintosh, a cadet of the MacKintoshes of Dunachton, Clan Mackintosh. #Elizabeth Munro. Married Neil MacKay, 8th chief of the Clan MacKay. Hugh Munro died in 1425 and was buried at Chanonry. In the years following Hugh's death, during the chieftenship of his eldest son George Munro, King James I of Scotland returned from captivity in England and took strong measures to restore order in the Highlands. He came to Inverness in 1427 and seized Mary, Countess of Ross and her son Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles as well as many other prominent highlanders who were punished in various ways. Among these no Munros are named. However, there is a ‚Äúletter of remission\\", signed under the Great Seal dated 24 August 1428. In the letter twenty eight named individuals are freed for crimes they had committed in the past and the first five names on the list are all Munros.

His first appearance in the sources occurs under the year 1233, for which year the Chronicle of Melrose reported that \\"Sir Gilbert, the abbot of Glenluce, resigned his office, in the chapter of Melrose; and there he made his profession\\".Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 489. It is not clear why Gilbert really did resign the position of Abbot of Glenluce, head of Glenluce Abbey in Galloway, in order to become a mere brother at Melrose Abbey; nor is it clear for how long Gilbert had been abbot, though his latest known predecessor is attested last on 27 May 1222.Watt & Shead, Head of Religious Houses, p. 86. After going to there, Gilbert became the Master of the Novices at Melrose.Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 495. The Melrose Chronicle tells us that \\"Sir Gilbert, master of the novices at Melrose, and formerly abbot of Glenluce, was elected bishop by the whole people and the clergy on Galloway, excepting the prior and the convent of Whithorn\\". This occurred on the first Sunday of Lent, i.e. on Sunday 25 February 1235.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128. The Melrose Chronicle however, supportive of Gilbert and his election, failed to note the significance of those who did not elect him, as the \\"prior and convent\\" of Whithorn believed that they enjoyed the right of election, and it is not clear who in Galloway actually did support Gilbert's election except the Archdeacon of Galloway, Michael.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 183, 184; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128 The Prior of Whithorn and the canons of Whithorn Priory chose to elect, on 11 March, their own candidate, Odo Ydonc; the latter was himself a fellow Premonstratensian and canon of Whithorn, and was formerly Abbot of Dercongal.Dowden, Bishops, p. 356; Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 183; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128. The \\"election\\" of Gilbert was supported by King Alexander II of Scotland, who gave his assent to the election on 23 April.Dowden, Bishops, p. 356; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128. Richard Oram and other historians argue that Gilbert was actually forwarded by King Alexander, part of a general effort to impose \\"Scottish\\" [i.e. crown] control on Galloway in the aftermath of the annexation of the province following the death of Alan, Lord of Galloway, and amidst the Galwegian revolt of 1235 led by Gille Ruadh.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, pp. 141-6, 182-3. There proceeded various appeals to both the Archbishop of York and the Pope himself; despite the protests of the canons and their argument about the \\"illegality\\" of Gilbert's election, Gilbert secured consecration by Archbishop Walter de Gray at York on 2 September.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 184; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128. An investigation by Pope Gregory IX had already been started, on 9 June, in which the Pope had issued a mandate to the Bishop of Rathlure, the Bishop of Raphoe, and the Archdeacon of Raphoe, authorising them to investigate the legality of Odo's election, and if they found it to have accorded with canon law, to consecrate him as Bishop of Galloway and compel Gilbert to restore everything he had taken; the results of this investigation are unknown, and Gilbert retained his bishopric.Dowden, Bishops, pp. 356-7. Gilbert's twelve-year episcopate left a few notices of his activity. He confirmed to Dryburgh Abbey the gift of the church of Sorbie granted by his predecessor Walter, amalgamating the two churches of Sobrie Minor and Sorbie Maior, and granting to that abbey the church of Borgue with provision for a vicar set aside.Dowden, Bishops, p. 357; Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 186. He was also active in England, particular in the Bishopric of Durham during vacancies in that bishopric, when Gilbert could perform episcopal functions there like granting indulgences and dedicating altars.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 186. He died in 1253, his obituary being noted by both the Melrose Chronicle and the Lanercost Chronicle.Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 574; Dowden, Bishops, p. 357; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 128.

In manufacturing, welds are used to join two or more metal surfaces. Because these connections may encounter loads and fatigue during product lifetime, there is a chance they may fail if not created to proper specification. Weld testing and analysis Methods of weld testing and analysis are used to assure the quality and correctness of the weld after it is completed. This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds. These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods. A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and guided bend tests.http://www.esabna.com/us/en/education/knowledge/weldinginspection/Destructive- Testing-of-Welds.cfm Destructive Testing of Welds by ESAB Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back bend testing, tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and free bend testing.http://www.angelfire.com/my/welding/test.html Non-destructive methods include fluorescent penetrate tests, magnaflux tests, eddy current (electromagnetic) tests, hydrostatic testing, tests using magnetic particles, X-rays and gamma ray based methods and acoustic emission techniques. Other methods include ferrite and hardness testing. =Imaging-based methods= X-ray X-ray-based weld inspection may be manual, performed by an inspector on X-ray-based images or video, or automated using machine vision. Industrial radiography explained https://www.epa.gov/radtown/industrial- radiography Visible light imaging Inspection may be manual, conducted by an inspector using imaging equipment, or automated using machine vision. Since the similarity of materials between weld and workpiece, and between good and defective areas, provides little inherent contrast, the latter usually requires methods other than simple imaging. One (destructive) method involves the microscopic analysis of a cross section of the weld.http://www.clemex.com/pdf/reports/WeldingAnalysis692.pdf Welding Analysis ‚Äì Image Analysis Report #692, Clemex Technologies Inc. =Ultrasonic- and acoustic-based methods= Ultrasonic testing uses the principle that a gap in the weld changes the propagation of ultrasonic sound through the metal.

Weld monitoring Weld monitoring methods are used to assure the quality and correctness of the weld during the process of welding. The term is generally applied to automated monitoring for weld-quality purposes and secondarily for process-control purposes such as vision-based robot guidance. Visual weld monitoring is also performed during the welding process. On vehicular applications, weld monitoring has the goal of enabling improvements in the quality, durability, and safety of vehicles ‚Äì with cost savings in the avoidance of recalls to fix the large proportion of systemic quality problems that arise from suboptimal welding. Quality monitoring in general of automatic welding can save production downtime, and can reduce the need for product reworking and recall. Industrial monitoring systems encourage high production rates and reduce scrap costs. \\"Reliable monitoring methods are essential for maintaining a high level of quality control in laser welding. In industrial processes, monitoring systems allow for quick decisions on the quality of the weld, allowing for high productions rates and reducing overall cost due to scrap.\\" =Inline coherent imaging= Inline coherent imaging (ICI) is a recently developed interferometric technique based on optical coherence tomographyhttps://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-39-21-6217 Automatic laser welding and milling with in situ inline coherent imaging by P. J. L. Webster, L. G. Wright, Y. Ji, C. M. Galbraith, A. W. Kinross, C. Van Vlack, and J. M. Fraser that is used for quality assurance of keyhole laser beam welding, a welding method that is gaining popularity in a variety of industries. ICI works by aiming a low-powered broadband light source through the same optical path as the primary welding laser. The beam enters the keyhole of the weld and is reflected back into the head optics by the bottom of the keyhole. An interference pattern is produced by combining the reflected light with a separate beam that has traveled through a path of a known distance. This interference pattern is then analyzed to obtain a precise measurement of the depth of the keyhole. Because these measurements are acquired in real-time, ICI can also be used to control the laser penetration depth by using the depth measurement in a feedback loop that modulates the laser's output power. =Transient thermal analysis method= Transient thermal analysis is used for range of weld optimization tasks. http://www.ansys.net/ansys/papers/ARTICLE1.pdf Transient Thermal Analysis of Spot Welding Electrodes by K.S.

Acceptable welding requires exact conditions; variations in conditions can render a weld unacceptable. SIP allows the identification of welding faults in real time, measures the stability of welding processes, and enables the optimization of welding processes.  Development  The idea of using electrical data analyzed by algorithms to assess the quality of the welds produced in robotic manufacturing emerged in 1995 from research by Associate Professor Stephen Simpson at the University of Sydney on the complex physical phenomena that occur in welding arcs. Simpson realized that a way of determining the quality of a weld could be developed without a definitive understanding of those phenomena.Simpson SW and Gillespie P (1998) \\"In-process monitoring of welding processes‚Äîa commercial success\\", Australasian Welding Journal, 43, 16‚Äì17Simpson SW, Weld quality measurement, WIPO PCT WO9845078 (1998); US 6288364 (2001); Australia 741965 (2002); Europe (14 countries) 1007263 (2003); Canada 2285561 (2004); South Korea 0503778 (2005) Simpson SW, Welding assessment, WIPO PCT WO0143910 (2001); Australia 763689, US 6660965 (2003); Canada 2393773 (2005); PAs: Japan 2001-545030 (2001); China 00817251.X, S.

After image processing operations, statistical analyses of the signatures provide quantitative assessment of the welding process, revealing its stability and reproducibility, and providing fault detection and process diagnostics. A similar approach, using voltage-current histograms and a simplified statistical measure of distance between signature images has been evaluated for tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding by researchers from Osaka University.Matsubara T, Terasaki H, Otsuka H, and Komizo Y (2010) \\"Developments of real-time monitoring method of welding\\" (paper RAJU-VE1), Proceedings of the Visual-JW2010 Industrial application SIP provides the basis for the WeldPrint system, which consists of a front-end interface and software based on the SIP engine and relies on electrical signals alone.

The first school, owned by her father Willy Trout and administered by Constantine's lover Kenneth, is one of the rare places where Eva feels at home but it also has a traumatic effect on her insofar as Eva's roommate Elsinore attempts to commit suicide by drowning herself in the lake. It is in the second school that Eva meets Iseult Smith from whom she receives the attention she has craved all her life. As Eva approaches her 25th birthday after which she will be able to access the fortune her father left behind, both the Arbles and her legal guardian Constantine Ormeau question her capacity to take care of herself and her wealth. To escape the confining guardianship of both Iseult and Constantine, Eva rents a house in Kent. In a conversation with Iseult at Cathay, Eva tells her that she is to give birth to her baby and flees to America where she would purchase a child to make up for her lie. By Eva's departure time, Iseult already suspects a sexual relationship between her husband Eric and Eva and she cannot help thinking that the father of Eva's child is Eric. This suspicion leads to the dissolution of the Arbles' household. Part II-Eight Years Later The second part of the novel is infused with Eva's reconsiderations of her past in her quest of becoming who she is. After her return from the USA with her child Jeremy, a boy both \\"deaf and dumb,\\" Eva falls in love with one of the children she used to hang out with at the Dancey's, Henry Dancey, who is now a student at Cambridge University. Although Henry does not feel the same way about Eva in the first place, on their mock hymeneal departure at Victoria station, Henry declares his sincere love for Eva. This unexpected declaration, which makes Eva shed tears of joy, is immediately spoilt by Jeremy who accidentally shoots Eva killing her instantaneously at Victoria Station. Characters =Major characters= Eva Trout-is the main character of the novel. She is a 24-year-old, socially awkward woman looking forward to her 25th birthday after which she will be entitled to access the fortune her father bequeathed. Although her guardians have not much confidence in her ability to take care of herself, she is a very independent person making her decisions without paying much attention to what people expect of her. At the end of the first section, Eva travels to the USA and spends eight years there. When she comes back, she is the mother of Jeremy whom she apparently purchased from a baby-snatching racket. Willy Trout- Eva's father. He is an absent character that haunts the novel from the beginning to the end. Despite his poor parenting influence, he bequeaths his daughter a fortune that helps Eva be the independent woman she is. Iseult Smith-is a former teacher of Eva's who is an idealist teacher at the peak of her career in an English boarding school. The close relationship between Eva and her gradually fades away as Eva starts to live with Iseult and her husband as a paying guest at Larkins, a house located in the middle of fruit trees. She is a very successful teacher pedagogically, but as an intellectual and a wanna-be author of her own novel and an amateur translator, she is rather \\"an artist manqu√©\\", \\"a fa√ßade of erudition.\\"Smith, 237 Eric Arble- Iseult's husband. As one of the few heterosexual couples of the novel, the Arbles don't seem to be enjoying a happy marriage. For Iseult, the main reason for this unhappy marriage is Eva Trout whom they have to take care of or think about all the time. Constantine Ormeau- the legal guardian of Eva who lives in London. He is one of the homosexual characters in the novel and the lover of Eva's father, Willy Trout. The Danceys- is a family living in the neighbourhood of Larkins. As the warm and friendly atmosphere of the house fascinates Eva, she spends most of her time with the four children of the Dancey's household. Henry Dancey- one of the children of the Dancey family. Even as a child, Henry stands out among his siblings with his \\"composed\\" and \\"sardonic\\" attitude.ET, 7 When Eva comes back from the USA, she falls in love with Henry, who is then a student in Cambridge University. Elsinore-Eva's roommate in the castle by the lake. Upon her unexpected attempt of suicide, her mother takes Elsinore away. Eva can never have done with this separation. In fact, when she accidentally runs into Elsinoere in Chicago, she seems to have a very vivid memory of their school days. However, she is rather cold and unfriendly towards Elsinore when she tells Eva beseechingly: \\"Take me with you, Trout.\\"ET,153 =Minor characters= Mr. Denge-a real estate agent who leases out a house in Kent to Eva. Tony Clavering-Haight-an Anglican priest and Constantine's lover. Through his long conversation with Eva, the readers get to know how Eva feels about her past after having spent eight years in the USA. Applethwaite-a sculptress. It is upon her failure to watch Jeremy carefully that Jeremy gets kidnapped. Kenneth-a homosexual man who has an affair with Constantine. In fact, Willy Trout buys the castle and wants Kenneth to be in administration with the aim of keeping Constantine away from him. Gerard Bonnard-a French doctor to whom Eva takes Jeremy with the aim of improving his son's communication skills. Portman C. Holman-a philosophy professor who flies to the USA on the same plane as Eva. The letter he sends to Eva never reaches its destination. Themes =Surface/depth= There are two important moments in the novel that we come across the tension between surfaces and depths. Indeed, the novel opens with such a tension: upon the sight of the castle by the lake, Henry Dancey asks: \\"Is that castle bona fide?\\"ET,6 The grandiose appearance of the castle makes Henry feel like there is something unrealistic and inauthentic about the spectacular fa√ßade of the castle. In the second moment of Eva's privileging superficiality, she is commenting on the artworks exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery. Eva rejects the view that depths make people's life more real than that of the portraits. > [T]hey were all \\"pictures.\\" Images. \\"Nothing but a deck of cards\\"?‚Äìnot > quite, but nearly enough to defeat Eva. ‚Ä¶They were on show only. Lordily > suffering themselves to be portrayed, they'd presented a cool core of > resistance even to the most penetrating artist. ‚Ä¶ Nothing was to be learned > from them (if you excepted learning that nothing was to be learned). In so > far as they had an effect on the would-be student, it was a malign one: > every soul Eva knew became no longer anything but a portrait. There was no > \\"real life\\"; no life was more real than this. This she had long suspected. > She now was certain.ET,216 Eva's renunciation of depths, however, does not prevent her from developing unique relationships with other characters. Given that Bowen never makes a facial description of Eva, the novel showcases Eva's continuous attempts to have a face of her own in her \\"superficial\\" and non-identitarian way. =Communication= Verbal communication Communication (verbal and non-verbal) lies at the heart of this novel. Lis Christenson claims that the novel is about the \\"limits and possibilities of communication.\\"Christenson,75 The novel's main character, Eva, style of conversation is described as being \\"outlandish, cement-like\\" that was \\"set\\" by the time she was sixteen years old and her English teacher, Iseult, met her. Rev. Dancey is another character who has trouble communicating due to his constant sneezing and hay fever which renders his speech uncomfortable for him and those who hear him as: > his anxiety was his voice, which had taken into varying in volume as > uncontrollably as though a poltergeist were fiddling with the controls, > sometimes coming out of the sudden boom or roar, sometimes fading till off > the air.ET,23 Eric Arble and Iseult have problems communication as their conversations are either interrupted by the arrival of Eva or by each other's overwhelmingly emotional reaction to what the other had said. In one instance of misunderstanding, Eric exclaimed to Iseult \\"that's what comes out of attempting to talk. Can anybody wonder why I keep my mouth shut?\\"ET,28 When Constantine, Eva's guardian, requests that Mr. and Mrs. Arble join him in London to discuss the matter of Eva's desire to move out of the Arble's household, instances of verbal mis-communication occur between Iseult and Constantine. The first instance was when Iseult asked about Eva's mother: > \\"What was her mother like?\\" > \\"Cissie? She was delightful.\\" > \\"Oh?\\" > \\"Yes, indeed‚Äîdear Cissie. Such enchanting girlish ways, so charming so > often. So deliciously\\"‚Äîhis eye skated lifelessly over his guest‚Äî\\"dressed, > always. One was devoted to her.\\" > \\"She does not sound very like Eva.\\" > \\"Not superficially.‚ÄîYes, in her day Cissie played quite a part.\\" > \\"Oh‚Ä¶ Mrs. Arble?\\" > \\"Her death.\\"ET,34 The second instance of mis-communication was when they were ordering food: > \\"[Y]ou would not say 'no' to oysters?\\" > \\"No.\\" > \\"No?\\" asked he, assuming a tragic air. > \\"I mean, no; I would not say 'no.'\\"ET,34 The novel also showcases instances of the failure of spoken language whereby communication fails and meaning falls through the cracks of language and the instability of the voice to carry out meaning. Bowen expresses a sense of ambivalence towards the \\"garlands of affection\\" that the characters bestow upon one another, as language can easily be used to guise, misguide and confuse individuals or hold clandestine meanings. Eva, whose linguistic skills are lacking due to being raised by non-native speakers of English, asks about the meaning of the words that she does not understand and this manner, she unmasks the artificiality lurking behind language. Non-verbal communication Jeremy, Eva's adopted deaf son's ability to communicate with his mother is described as 'extra-sensory.' However, when communication breaks down, Jeremy's angelic behaviour is disrupted by a type of \\"possession\\". Jeremy is able to communicate through lip-reading as well as reading faces and expressions of those around him. In the USA, Eva and Jeremy would spend hours watching silent movies, and this interest helps them develop their own silent language. =Sexuality= Sexuality is one of the most crucial aspects of the novel inasmuch as both heterosexual and homosexual desire is exercised on different levels and sometimes towards the same people. First of all, Eva Trout, as a young girl, does not look so feminine physically. In the castle, a student asks her if she is a hermaphrodite.ET,48 Later, in the English boarding school, Eva's relationship with Elsinore goes beyond an intimate friendship. As Elsinore has to spend all her time in the room as part of her recovery treatment, the bond between them gets even stronger because of the close proximity they find themselves in. > What made Eva visualise this as a marriage chamber? As its climate > intensified, all grew tender. To repose a hand on the blanket covering > Elsinore was to know in the palm of the hand a primitive tremor‚Äîimagining > the beating of that other heart, she had passionately solicitous sense of > this other presence. Nothing forbad love. This deathly yet living stillness, > together, of two beings, this unapartness, came to be the requital of all > longing.ET,54 Despite Eva's fragmentary memory, when she comes across Elsinore in Chicago many years later, Eva's memories of her affection for Elsinore is still very lucid: > The town room in the castle, the piteous breathing. The blinded window, the > banished lake. The dayless and nightless watches, the tent of cobwebs. The > hand on the blanket, the beseeching answering beating heart. The dark: the > unseen distance, the known nearness. Love: the here and the now and the > nothing-but. The step on the stairs. Don't take her away, DON'T take her > away. She is all I am. We are all there is.ET,142 Eva's extreme attachment to Iseult in the school also has sexual undertones but this affection later evolves into a plotted revenge when Eva, in a conversation with Iseult, does all she can to mislead Iseult into thinking that she and Iseult's husband had a sexual affair. > \\"You have no notion how Eric misses you. For instance‚Äîcouldn't you possibly > come to us for Christmas? Like you once used to do; I think very happily. > And even Christmas seems very far ahead, far too ahead for Eric. Why, if you > do come then, it will have been seven‚Äîno, eight, nine?‚Äîmonths since he's > seen you. A long time.\\" > \\"Nine,\\" said Eva, looking up at the evergreen. > \\"Then at least, Christmas?\\" > \\"Christmas is in December?\\" > \\"It is usually.‚ÄîWhy? Is there anything else you think of doing?\\" > \\"In December I shall be having a little child.\\"ET,128 When Eva comes back from the USA, she is a mother and she devotes most of her time to Jeremy's treatment. Meanwhile, she falls in love with Henry Dancey whom she has always had an admiration for since Henry's childhood. There is also a series of homosexual relationships that determine the course of the novel. Willy Trout's love for Constantine as well as Constantine's interest in Kenneth in the first section and the priest Tony Clavering-Haight in the second, helps Bowen juxtapose and compare heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Although the negative effect of Eva's father's selfish love for Constantine on Eva makes several critics suspicious of homophobic proclivities on Bowen's part, the heterosexual relationships in the novel are as negatively portrayed.Coates, 65 =Education= As a socially awkward girl, Eva needs special attention in her adolescence. But her father's decision as to which school she should go reflects his own concerns rather than hers. After buying a big castle by the lake, he asks his lover Constantine's friend Kenneth to be the administrator. The main aim of this offer, however, is to separate Constantine from Kenneth whom Willy regards as a threat for their relationship. In this school, what interests Eva the most is to watch the dawn in her curtainless room that she shares with Elsinore. Eva's love for Elsinore is profound but they get separated and don't see each other for a long time after Elsonore's mother comes over and takes Elsinore away from the castle. In fact, the school itself closes shortly after Elsinor's departure due to a series of unfortunate incidents including theft, poisoning and arson.ET,54 After two years, Eva tells her father that she wants to enroll in an English boarding school. In this boarding school, Eva meets Iseult Smith whom she would admire enormously. > Supremacy set apart this wonderful teacher. She could have thought > anything.Her dark suit might have been the habit of an Order. ‚Ä¶ The > intellectual beauty of her sentences was informed by a glow; words she spoke > sounded new-minted, unheard before.ET,56 Her admiration for Iseult Smith gradually fades away as she feels abandoned and betrayed. Iseult ends up doing more harm to Eva than she initially intends to. In fact, Eva never forgives Iseult for her betrayal. Rather than affirming the institution of education in and of itself, Bowen problematises the concept of help as such insofar as most of the attempts to help others in the novel go wrong, or they don't provide the helpers with the psychic comfort they sought in the first place. =Parenting= Parenting is another central theme in the novel insofar as we are introduced to a number of individuals who fail to take responsibility for their charges. Eva's father, Willy Trout, fails in his duty as a father when he ignores his daughter's education as well as her emotional needs and carries her around the world like baggage. Eva's mother also fails as a parent when she leaves her husband and daughter behind upon discovering the truth about Willy's homosexuality and his relationship with Constantine. Elsinore's mother who sends her daughter off to the co-educational boarding school to separate her from her the Japanese butler's boy only shows up days after Elsinore attempts to commit suicide by walking into the lake. Her inquiry into her daughter Elsinore's health upon first arriving to take her back home, \\"How's my darling?\\" is to haunt Eva for the rest of her life. Incidentally, Elsinore is the first person whom Eva provides with care and affection. With a motherly gesture, Eva insists on staying with Elsinore during her days of illness. Constantine, the prototype of the evil stepfather, ignores Eva completely until she is to inherit Willy's wealth. His character as well as manner of speech is rather insidious. It is suggested that Willy was mistrustful of Constantine and suspected that he and Kenneth might have had an affair, a matter that could have led to Willy Trout's depression and ultimately his suicide. He is thus neither a good parent to Eva nor a faithful partner. In spite of his distant relationship with Eva, Constantine regards himself as an authority figure and questions her about her plans about Jeremy's future in Jeremy's presence by asking her: > \\"What are you going to do about that boy?...His future, his schooling. His > disability.‚ÄîHe's your heir, I suppose?\\"ET,189 Constantine is also critical of Eva's over-protectiveness of Jeremy as he accuses her of being negligent in treating Jeremy's deafness and dealing with it. > \\"[I]t would do the child no harm to see something of the East End: its > realities. You keep him in cellophane. You make a plaything of him; at best, > a playmate. He may well go on hugging his disability, it's a form of > immunity. He does well with it‚Äîyou make life too charming for him: an Eden. > High time he was cast forth from it; as things are, that could only be done > across your dead body‚Ä¶what's to come of him when you're gone?\\"ET, 192 In fact, Eva's parenting skills with Jeremy surpass the care and parenting her own parents gave her inasmuch as she devotes her time either playing, entertaining, or educating him. Another parent-like figure is Iseult, who teaches Eva English language and poetry when she was in the English boarding school for girls and takes over the charge of improving Eva's speech and linguistic abilities, yet gives up after a while. The care and interest that Iseult shows for her pupil makes Eva fall in love with her as: > \\"[t]ill Iseult came, no human being had ever turned upon Eva their full > attention‚Äîan attention which could seem to be love. Eva know nothing of love > but that it existed‚Äîthat, she should know, having looked on at it. Her > existence had gone by under a shadow: the shadow of Willy Trout's total > attachment to Constantine.\\"ET,10 The fallout between Eva and Iseult results from Eva's great disappointment at her former teacher's abandonment of her as she explains to the priest, father Tony Clavering-Haight: > \\"She desisted from teaching me. She abandoned my mind. She betrayed my > hopes, having led them on. She pretended love, to make me show myself to > her‚Äîthen, thinking she saw all, turned away. She--\\" > \\"‚ÄîWait a minute; what were your hopes?\\" > \\"To learn,\\" said Eva. A long-ago tremble shook her. \\" To be to become‚ÄîI had > never been,\\" she added \\"I was beginning to be.\\" > He remarked, with enthusiasm, \\"A gifted teacher.\\" > \\"Yes. Then she sent me back.\\" > \\"Sent you away?\\" > \\"No; sent me back again‚Äîto be nothing.\\"ET, 203 So it stands to reason that Mr. and Mrs. Arble's interest in having Eva stay at their house was because they didn't have a child as well as they needed her money and this tension results in their sterility and not being able to make her happy. However, there is a positive representation of parenting in the novel and that is within the Danceys' household. In spite of having major character flaws in the eyes of Eva and being depicted as caricature, the Danceys are among the happiest among the novel's characters. Motifs =Existentialism= Focusing on the questions of responsibility, forgiveness, and freedom, the novel resonates with the questions of existentialist philosophy of the second half of the twentieth century. Eva's renunciation of appearances, the intricate web of relations between people who affect one another's life drastically, the play of chanciness and necessity constitute the main existentialist motifs of the novel. The question of authenticity is also relevant inasmuch as both Iseult and Eva seem to suffer from \\"bad faith.\\"Sartre, 96‚Äì112 Eva's last words before she gets shot dead by her son, \\"What is concatenation?,\\"ET,301 also points at the accumulation of events and their determining effect on one's life. This question adds to many of the other moments, especially in the second part of the novel, in which Eva shows the signs of addressing the constraints of the situations that she finds herself in rather than dismissing them right away. Iseult's bad faith, on the other hand, consists in blaming Eva for all her miseries, disappointments and failures. Contrary to Eva, she considers the givens of the situation to be unchallengeable boundaries. In this regard, the question of an authentic life lies at the heart of the novel. =Intertextuality= In the novel, there are various references to literary works. Elsinore, Eva's roommate at her first school, the fairy-like little near-albino, whose \\"washed-out beauty gave her an air of age,\\" is named after the castle in Hamlet and she is referred to by the boy who saved her life as 'Ophelia' illegit.\\"ET,54 She is 'Juliet' who cries and sobs throughout the night for being separated from the Japanese Butler's son. Eric Arble is described as a 'Macbeth type', 'blackmoor' who cannot proceed without Mrs. Arble. There are also some references to the Book of Genesis, the most obvious being the title of the first chapter, \\"Genesis.\\" Eva's name might also be associated with Eve. When Constantine says to Eva that she's making an \\"Eden\\" out of life for Jeremy and that it is time to \\"cast him out,\\" the biblical theme of falling is invoked. There is also a curious reference to \\"Hedda Gabler\\" in a conversation between Iseult and Eva. Explaining the reason why Iseult took the gun in exchange for the typewriter she left to Eric, Iseult states that it might be a matter of a \\"Hedda Gabler complex.\\" In this play written by Henrik Ibsen, Hedda hands in a gun to another character to assist him in committing suicide.

The Khudimari river flows right through the village. The people of Khudimari speak Goalpariya, which is a dialect of Assamese. Khudimari has a primary school called the Khudimari M.V. School. The people belong both to Hinduism and Islam and they have lived harmoniously since ages. Until about a decade ago, the people depended a great deal on agriculture. Rice is the principal crop to be grown both for consumption and sale. Now, the people, especially the younger generation is looking for newer avenues of livelihood in nearby town and cities. Education holds a significant place in the culture of the village, with many of the residents being teachers at the local school and also in the High School at nearby Gauripur town. The education scenario was particularly encouraging in the 1960s. However, the level has fallen since. Only very recently (2006‚Äì07) education in the village received a shot in the arm with a government grant to the M.V. School. Sports and cultural activities, too, hold a special place in the village. The nerve center of all such activity is the local club, named the Udayan Sangha (translated into English: Sunrise Club) and established in the early 1960s.

Underfall Yard was commonly referred to as \\"The Underfalls\\" and takes its name from the underfall sluices. The original construction was completed in 1809 under the direction of William Jessop and substantially improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the 1830s. Restored in the 1990s, Underfall Yard has been designated as a scheduled monument and from the 1970s onward many of the buildings at Underfall Yard have earned Grade II Listed Building status. The harbour and its equipment are still actively maintained, and house a cooperative of maritime companies. History In the early nineteenth century the engineer, William Jessop was engaged by the Bristol Dock Company to create a Floating Harbour to eliminate the problem of ships being grounded at low tide. Jessop built a lock to retain the water in the harbour; this was completed in 1809, and allowed ships to remain floating at all times, unaffected by the state of the tide on the river. Part of the project included building a dam at the Underfall Yard with a weir, known as the Overfall, to allow surplus river water to flow into the New Cut, an excavation which by- passed the Floating Harbour and joined the River Avon near Temple Meads. The docks' maintenance facility was established on the land exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. By the 1830s the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting and Isambard Kingdom Brunel devised the underfall sluices based on William Jessop's original plans and recommended the use of dredgers as a solution . The Bristol Docks Company never achieved commercial success and was taken over by Bristol City Council in 1848. In 1880 the Council bought the Slipway and yard to enlarge the docks' maintenance facilities. The 'Underfall' system was re-built in the 1880s, with longer sluices, and the yard above was enlarged. Brunel's method of silt disposal is still in operation today, but the silt is carried in mud barges or pumped to the sluices through a quayside pipe system from the more efficient modern 'Cutter-Suction' dredgers. During the 20th century the western parts of the yard were leased to P & A Campbell Ltd, operators of the White Funnel Line of paddle steamers as a maintenance base. The yards have been little altered recently except for the replacement of the three-storey 'A' block over the sluice paddle room resulting from bomb damage in World War II. Underfall Yard has been refurbished under the management of the Underfall Yard Trust (previously Underfall Restoration Trust) thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund, AiM Biffa Award, and donations from various organisations and trusts. Based at the yard at the moment are maritime academies, a scout sailing section, a blacksmith, rigging company, Omni, and three boat building businesses. In 2015 a major restoration project was announced. The work included the development of a cafe and visitor centre. ¬£2.8 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund will provide much of the funding, though an additional ¬£1 million was to be sourced elsewhere. An oral history project is currently being conducted and schools education programmes have been introduced as part of the restoration and redevelopment. Underfall sluices The sluices Jessop's original designs for the harbour included a dam with an 'overfall', with the level of the water determined by the height of the dam's crest. As a result of the accumulation of mud and silt in the harbour, ships entering the narrow harbour were frequently being grounded. In 1832 Brunel was called upon to provide the solution to this problem and designed the sluice system, still in use today, to remove excesses of silt and mud. In place of the Overfall he constructed three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice, between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel, known as a drag boat, to scrape the silt away from the quay walls. Sluices 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while sluice 3 ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep sluice is opened at low tide, a powerful undertow is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. Since the original introduction of the sluices, they have been changed and renewed several times but today's sluice system was installed in the 1880s. In March 1988, the sluice control was computerised and automated. Buildings Most of the buildings and engineering installations at the yard were constructed between 1880 and 1890 under the direction of John Ward Girdlestone. Many of them have been designated by English Heritage as listed buildings. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It replaced the original pumping house which is now The Pump House visitor centre. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two steam engine powered pumps. These were replaced in 1907 by the current electrically powered machines from Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley (the currently installed electric motors were manufactured by JH Holmes & Co, Hebburn-upon-Tyne and date from 1938-9). It powered the docks hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks.External Hydraulic accumulatorThe tower houses a raised weight hydraulic accumulator which stores the hydraulic energy ensuring a smooth delivery of pressure and meaning that the pumps do not need to be running the whole time in order to satisfy peak demand. The external accumulator was added in 1954. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750 lbf/in¬≤ (5.2 MPa). =Dock maintenance workshops= The Patent Slip, built in the 1890s The dock maintenance workshops survive from the 1880s but were extended in the early 20th century. The brick building is topped with a tiled double-pile hipped roof with corbelled eaves. It has sliding doors at each end, giving access to the boiler and engine houses, blacksmith's and engineer's shops. Much of the original machinery survives, including steam-powered plant from the mid-1880s, these include a Whitworth planing machine, a Whitworth slotting machine, punching-and-shearing machines, a long-bed lathe and a steam hammer. There is also wall-mounted line-shafting and a Tangye horizontal engine and Cornish boiler. =Pattern maker's shop= The former pattern-maker's shop and stores date from the same period and are grade II listed, Many of the original wooden patterns still exist with some being used for educational purposes, some being put on display, and others have been kept for operational purposes. The shop is currently occupied by RB Boatbuilding Ltd, a small business dedicated to the re-creation of classic, late 19th century, wooden working boats, including the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter. The Slipway Co-operative Ltd manages the slipping of boats. They build, repair and restore a variety of wooden craft including the Bristol Jolly Boat. =Slipway= The original slipway was built by John Ward Girdlestone in 1890 which had replaced a predecessor built in the 1850s by boat builders Ross and Sage. It used a system in which the ship is floated onto the cradle and secured. The cradle is then drawn out of the water with a steam-driven winch. The device was a low-cost alternative to dry docks for maintenance and repair work. This became known as the Patent slipway or 'Heave-up Slip' and was patented in 1819 by shipbuilder Thomas Morton of Leith in Scotland. The 1890 replacement was originally driven by an hydraulic engine powered by the dock's hydraulic system. In 1924, an electric motor was installed which still operates today. The Bristol slipway is relatively small with a cradle of and a runway of and can lift vessels up to 250 tons (250 tonnes). The three electronic pumping engines It fell into disuse by 1974. By the 1990s this was rotting and was rebuilt by members of the Slipway Co- operative and Underfall Trust in 1998‚Äì99. The restoration required the complete renewal of the underwater runway with steel piling to replace the previous timber, iron and masonry supports. The above-water track was re-laid, reusing the original cast iron centre rails with their integral ratchets. The cradle was completely rebuilt on the original pattern. The functioning of the slipway was essential for the long-term preservation of the restored Underfall Yard as a historic industrial monument, as it provided the Underfall Restoration Trust with funds to maintain the slipway and buildings, and the tenants of those buildings with boats to earn a living. =The Pump Room= The power house at Underfall Yard was built in 1887 to supply hydraulic power to a network around the floating harbour. It was originally powered by steam (the large chimney remains from this system). The room which is now the visitor centre housed three boilers which powered steam hydraulic pumps. There are three electric pumps in the room adjacent to the visitor centre which are regularly run to demonstrate how they worked. These three pumps are 1907 replacements for the originals. =The Big Shed= Originally used as a place in which large items such as lock gates were built, the Big Shed now houses and is used by a selection of maritime businesses. It is not open to the public. Workshops and Businesses =Blacksmith= Fire Iron Art is the blacksmith at Underfall Yard. Bespoke, hand forged ironwork is made by Joanna Williams in the original forge using traditional blacksmithing techniques. Fire Iron Art undertakes maritime commissions and conservation work. RB Boatbuilding LTD sign =Boat Builders= Underfall Yard has three boat building businesses in residence. RB Boatbuilding are dedicated to the recreation, restoration, and repair of classic, late 19th century working wooden boats. They also take on repair and restoration work. Shipshape Boatbuilding & Woodwork build and restore boats or create custom woodwork to commission. Skin on frame kayaks and canoes are also made and build-your-own skin on frame kayak workshops are run by Shipshape. Star Yachts are a relatively new company started after working at Underfall Yard repairing and restoring wooden boats. Win Cnoops is part Star Yachts and remains responsible for all of the slipway workings and the day-to-day management of Underfall Yard. =Maritime Engineering= Motive Marine are an insured and experienced company specialising in marine engineering, inboard and outboard, engine, drive, propulsion, and electrics, installations, servicing, maintenance, and repair. They have one base in Bristol in Underfall Yard and can also be found in Southampton. =Riggers= Traditional Rigging is a company consisting of some of the UK's most experienced riggers. They're specialists in working boats, classic yachts, and traditional rigs. The business moved to Underfall Yard in the early 1990s and the founder, Dennis Platten, also worked as Harbour Master until recently. =Training= Bristol Maritime Academy offers maritime-based courses ranging from first aid to powerboat handling. They are a Royal Yachting Association recognised training centre. They are the only RYA coastal training centre based in Bristol Harbour.

Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database; Early career Trained by Classic-winning trainer John Gosden, Mineshaft began his career racing on turf in Great Britain. Unraced at two, he won a mile maiden at Newmarket on his second start as a three-year-old. He failed to win another race in Great Britain but placed third in the Group Three Prix Daphnis in France. His record in Britain was 3-1-1 in seven starts, with annual earnings of $73,716. American career Following his seven runs in Great Britain, Mineshaft was transferred to the United States as a three-year-old and moved to the barn of Neil J. Howard. In his North American debut, he won an allowance race by 3 lengths at a mile and 70 yards at Fair Grounds Race Course in 1:38.97. He finished 2002 with another allowance score at a mile at Churchill Downs in 1:36.2. With his late success, Mineshaft remained in the U.S. at age four. He started the year at Fair Grounds Race Course in the winter and won the $75,000 Diplomat Way Handicap at eight and a half furlongs in 1:43.8. Mineshaft followed that up with a runner- up finish in the $125,000 Grade III Whirlaway Handicap, losing to Balto Star. He then won the $500,000 Grade II New Orleans Handicap at nine furlongs in 1:48.9, by 3 lengths before shipping to Kentucky to win the $100,000 Grade III Ben Ali Stakes at Keeneland by nine lengths in a time of 1:48.52.Thoroughbred Times Stallion Directory; Then Mineshaft ran in the $600,000 Grade I Pimlico Special Handicap at \\"Old Hilltop\\" in Baltimore, Maryland.

When the gate opened, Balto Star was sent to the front and led the field through the first half mile, setting fractions of 23.1 and 46.7 over the sloppy track. The 7-2 second choice, Western Pride, stalked him in second and inherited the lead when Balto Star dropped out of contention, going 3/4 miles in 1:11. Turning for home, Mineshaft, who had stalked the pace saving ground early, was eased out three wide on the far turn and passed Western Pride after a mile in 1:36 to win going away by 3 lengths in a final time of 1:56.16. It was a head back to 42‚Äì1 longshot Judge's Case in third. Among his victories later that year, Mineshaft won three straight Grade I races at Belmont Park in New York. He started by winning the $500,000 Grade I Suburban Handicap by 2 lengths, beating Volponi, Dollar Bill, and Evening Attire. His next victory came in the $500,000 Woodward Stakes by 4 lengths over Hold That Tiger and Puzzlement. Then he won the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup, again beating Evening Attire, this time by 4 lengths, and ensuring his United States Horse of the Year honors.

Status Navassa Island was visited in 1966 and 1967 and no animals were present. An entomologist visited the island again in 1986 and saw no signs of any iguanas, although he was not specifically looking for them. An extensive search again in 1999 failed to find any iguanas. Military occupation of the island prior to the 1960s may have been responsible for its demise, or years of mining guano for fertilizer; the introduction of feral dogs, goats, and rats may have also been to blame. Dr Robert Powell's research while at the Department of Natural Sciences, Avila College, Kansas City, Missouri, suggests that the iguanas disappeared before the introduction of feral species, as a result of habitat change or hunting by man. Noted herpetoculturist David Blair maintains that some of these animals may remain in captivity somewhere in the world, but admits they would be very aged specimens.

Club career =Helsingborgs= Born in Rydeb√§ck, Sweden, Nilsson played for his hometown club, Rydeb√§cks IF, before joining Helsingborgs in 2003 at thirteen. After progressing through the ranks at Helsingborgs, Nilsson was called up to the first team and was involved in the first team pre-season matches. It wasn't until on 1 May 2007 when Nilsson was given a first team chance by then Manager Stuart Baxter, where he made his first start and played 70 minutes despite losing 1‚Äì0 against Elfsborg. With two appearance in the 2007 season, Nilsson signed a contract with the club in September 2007. The 2008 season saw Nilsson struggling to make a breakthrough in the first team, with the likes of Joel Ekstrand, Andreas Granqvist and Samir Beloufa established himself in the central defense position. Following the departure of Granqvist and the arrival of Hannu Patronen, Nilsson then made his first appearance of the season on 7 July 2008, where he made his first start in a year, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against G√∂teborg. From July to October, Nilsson had a handful of first team appearances and formed a central defense partnership with youngsters, Ekstrand.

In 2009 season, Nilsson established himself in the first team, along with Ekstrand, in the defense and made a good start in the opening game of the season when he helped the club win against G√∂teborg 1‚Äì0, as well as, clean sheet. This was followed up by two wins against GAIS and Hammarby. His performance resulted him and Ekstrand signing a contract extension, keeping him until 2012. Nilsson was an ever starting player in the first team this season until he was absent on two occasions in July. Despite this, Nilsson returned to the first team and continued to be a first team regular until he suffered an injury that kept him out for the rest of the season. Nevertheless, Nilson finished the season, making twenty-eight appearances in all competitions.

WMGW operates at the assigned frequency of 1490 kHz with a full-time power of 1,000 watts. WMGW is also the flagship station of the Allegheny News-Talk Sports Network, also owned by its licensee, Forever Broadcasting, LLC. History WMGW first went on the air back in 1947, as the very first radio station in all of Crawford County, founded by Meadville physician Dr. Harry C. Winslow. Dr. Winslow chose his daughter's initials (Mary Grace Winslow) for the station's call letters. Like many small-town radio stations of its time, WMGW broadcast for many years a format of local, world and national news, local and Pittsburgh sports, and adult contemporary music. WMGW was also complemented with an FM station bearing the same call letters for many years. World and national news was provided by ABC and the AP audio network. In the early 1970s, the stations were purchased by the Regional Broadcasters Group headquartered in Kingston, New York. The FM station's call letters were changed to WZPR as a tribute to Meadville's Talon Corporation which, nearly a century earlier, had become America's first manufacturer of \\"hookless fasteners\\" or zippers. While WMGW's format remained the same, WZPR changed to Beautiful Music, and in 1978 changed to its current format: country. WMGW was purchased by Great Circle Broadcasting in 1983, a division of the now-defunct Music Broadcasting Group. Approximately 5 years prior the purchase, the studios and offices of both stations had moved from their second floor location on Park Avenue to the Downtown Mall on Water Street in Meadville, allowing shoppers to see a glimpse of the stations at work. The station remains in this location today. =Sale to Forever Broadcasting= In 1999, Music Broadcasting began negotiations to sell WMGW and its FM sister, by this time called WZPR, to Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Forever Broadcasting, which had been looking to gain a foothold in Northwest Pennsylvania. Forever Broadcasting acquired both stations the following year for an undisclosed price. WMGW Today WMGW switched to a format of all news, talk, and sports, and through a cooperative effort with three other acquired stations, formed the Allegheny News Talk Sports Network. The network consists of a \\"trimulcast\\" outside of morning drive, with all four stations sharing the same programming, which includes Pirates baseball, and the NFL on Westwood One (prior to December 2009, WOYL in Oil City had also been a part of this network, in effect making it a quadcast; WOYL permanently ceased operations in July 2010). However, in morning drive, the trimulcast is broken down into a simulcast, with WMGW and WTIV airing a morning show independent of WFRA, which airs its own separate live morning show program with programming matter exclusive to its immediate local market. The full-time operations of the network and its respective stations originate out of the Downtown Mall location, but WFRA maintains a separate office and studio in WFRA's city of license in Franklin, Pennsylvania. Keith Allen (Amolsch) Austin hosted the morning show for WMGW and WTIV until his death on June 8, 2014, following a brief illness. He was 59.

An 1885 advertisement for the New York branch of the English tailoring house of Redfern. Gilda Darthy in a dinner dress and coat by Redfern, Les Modes, February 1908 Redfern & Sons (later Redfern Ltd), was a British tailoring firm founded by John Redfern (1820-1895) in Cowes on the Isle of Wight that developed into a leading European couture house (active: 1855-1932; 1936-1940). By the early 1890s the business had branches in London, Edinburgh, Paris and New York. The Paris extension was operated as a couture establishment while its other branches functioned primarily as tailors and importers. History John Redfern (11 November 1820 - 22 November 1895) started out as a tailor in Cowes in 1855, following in the sartorial footsteps of his father, also John Redfern, who first opened a Cowes specialty clothing shop in 1811.\\"1890 Doll\\" in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, New York; Harper's Bazaar, October 1916, p. 37 With the support of sons Ernest Redfern and Charles Poynter Redfern (1853-1929), John Redfern opened tailoring houses in London and Paris in 1881, followed by two shops in New York in 1884-85, one for tailoring, the other for furs. The Redferns are credited with making tailored clothing chic for women. Previously resigned to utilitarian wear, finely tailored dresses and suits, as introduced by Redfern, quickly became a craze among sporting aristocrats on holiday at Cowes, spreading soon to Paris. Harper's Bazaar, October 1916, p. 37. In the 1870s the Redfern yachting suit or dress was swiftly becoming the most recognizably English mode of fashionable apparel. In this way, the Redfern label was essentially the first high-end sportswear brand. By the early 1890s, due largely to the patronage of British and European royalty, Redfern's Paris house had developed into a full scale couture business. Ernest directed the London and New York branches, while Charles, and later, John Poynter Redfern, ran the Paris salon. From 1892, when Redfern's sons took control of the business, the house became known as Redfern Ltd. The firm's American outlet, however, did not prove a success and was eventually partly sustained by a commercial sideline for ready-made corsets. Newark Daily Advocate, April 13, 1885; Women's Wear Daily, April 8, 1915; Harper's Bazaar, May 1916, p. 96. The house in New York also did not function as a couture establishment but as an importer of other Parisian fashion brands which were sold alongside its own products. Vogue, October 1, 1915, p. 131. Like the Paris salon, the New York branch was originally advertised as a ladies' tailoring concern. Vogue, November 9, 1893, p. 511. The first English-based couturier to open full-scale American branches in the U.S. and to enjoy a lengthy success there was Lucile in the 1910s and '20s.Bigham, Randy Bryan, Lucile - Her Life by Design (2012), pp. 19, 273; Vogue, April 15, 1910, p. 27. It was in 1871 that the house of Redfern first expanded its tailoring business to include the design and sale of silk dresses and mourning clothes. But it was tailored garments for women who rode, played tennis and went yachting that remained the Redfern specialty. Although intended for specific sporting pursuits, these tailored dresses and suits were increasingly adopted as everyday wear by influential Redfern clients.Redfern suit, circa 1911 in the collections database of the Victoria & Albert Museum, London For example, in 1879 the house created a simple jersey traveling dress for Lillie Langtry, the noted beauty and actress popularly known as the \\"Jersey Lily,\\" a name deriving from her birthplace in Jersey. The dress was widely copied and remained a favorite in the Redfern line for many years. In 1888, Redfern was formally named Dressmaker By Royal Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen and H.R.H. The Princess of Wales. Redfern Ltd. was credited with helping popularize the high-waisted, so-called Grecian style of 1908. In the early 1910s, the house's designs were often illustrated in Gazette du Bon Ton along with six other leading Paris couturiers ‚Äì Cheruit, Doeuillet, Doucet, Paquin, Poiret, and Worth. In 1916 Redfern created the first officially designated women's uniform for the Red Cross. The Paris headquarters of Redfern closed in 1932, briefly reopened in 1936, and closed again in 1940.

Martino brought his consumer advocacy to television, first at several stations in the Eastern United States. In Denver, he spent 18 years at CBS station KCNC-TV.

If he believes a business is failing to respond to his investigation, he sometimes broadcasts the business's phone number and encourages listeners to contact the business. He is also known for letting consumers know when they are in the wrong and aids them in rectifying the situation and avoiding it in the future. On April 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of a libel suit brought against Martino by an Oregon watercraft dealer. A customer of the dealer had called Martino's show to describe the problems she had with a personal watercraft that she bought from the dealer, and in the course of the on-the-air conversation, Martino said \\"they're just lying to you.\\" The dealer sued Martino for libel and interference with business relations.

Seventeen Years was screened at several international film festivals where it garnered numerous accolades, including the Director's Award at the 56th Venice Film Festival. The film is co-produced by Keetman Limited (China) and Fabrica (Italy), as presented by Keetman and the Xi'an Film Studio. It premiered concurrently with Zhang Yuan's documentary feature, Crazy English in the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival. Seventeen Years is seen, at least by some critics, as Zhang Yuan's move away from his \\"Bad Boy\\" image, an image that was cultivated after run-ins with Chinese authorities with his previous films, Beijing Bastards, and the homosexual-themed East Palace, West Palace. In contrast, Seventeen Years (and Crazy English) was produced under the aegis of the Chinese bureaucracy, though some editing of the film was required before it could be released.Tasker, Yvonne (2002). \\"Zhang Yuan\\" in Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers.

Two divorced singles (Liang Song and Le Yeping), marry, each bringing a daughter into their new home. Xiaolan (Li Jun), short haired is fiercely independent and wishes to work in a factory after she graduates from high school. Her stepsister, Xiaoqin (Liu Lin), is more intellectual, and wishes to enter a university. After a dispute over a mere 5 yuan that Xiaoqin accuses Xiaolan of stealing, Xiaolan hits her stepsister over the head. To the surprise of everyone, Xiaoqin succumbs to the injury and dies and Xiaolan is led to jail. The film then cuts seventeen years into the future. Xiaolan has been selected as one of the lucky inmates allowed a furlough during the New Year holiday. At the same time, a young prison guard, Chen Jie (Li Bingbing) is calling her mother to say that she will soon be returning home for the holiday. While waiting for the inmates to be picked up by their families, Chen Jie notices that soon only Xiaolan remains. In an act of charity, Chen Jie offers to help Xiaolan return home. Upon arriving at her old apartment, however, both women discover that the home has long since been torn down, and Xiaolan's parents moved to another part of the city. Chen Jie, however, is now determined that Xiaolan will spend the holiday with her family and the two set out in search of parents who may not want to see their only daughter... Production The idea for Seventeen Years is said to have emerged after Zhang Yuan watched a television program of a criminal's reunion with his family after many years in prison. Realizing that every prisoner likely had an intricate story, Zhang began to research for a possible film by interviewing several inmates. From this starting point, Seventeen Years eventually shifted its focus from a film about an inmate within the prison walls, to one about a former inmate attempting to reconnect with her family.Berry, Michael (2002). \\"Zhang Yuan\\" in Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press, p. 154. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-11-04 A screenplay was written by Zhang with the collaboration of the established writers Yu Hua and Zhu Wen and Zhang's wife, Ning Dai. Yu and Zhu never worked directly with each other, as Zhang asked each to submit a separate draft, which he later edited and consolidated to fit with his concept of the film. Filmed primarily in Tianjin, China, Seventeen Years's post- production took place entirely in Italy with editing by Zhang and Jacobo Quadri (who would also work with Zhang on his film Little Red Flowers). As Zhang's \\"return to the fold,\\" Seventeen Years did not suffer from the usual governmental intrusion. However, Zhang was asked to explain certain scenes and implement some minor changes, which he did with little protest. Even then, the review process lasted an entire year before the film was allowed to be shown in theaters. After spending much of his career as the archetypal \\"underground Chinese filmmaker,\\" Zhang approached Seventeen Years as the film that would finally be screened in China.Berry, p. 153. Zhang felt that Seventeen Years would have a good chance of achieving this goal, in part because the film already needed government approval to film within the prison. Indeed, it was reportedly the first Chinese film allowed to shoot within an active Chinese prison. Reception Seventeen Years (and to a lesser extent Crazy English) marked a first for Zhang Yuan as the first film directed by Zhang that could be seen by domestic Chinese audiences in theaters.Berry, p. 144, 153. =Awards and nominations= *56th Venice Film Festival, Italy, 1999 **Special Director's Award‚Äî Zhang Yuan *Gijon Film Festival, Spain, 1999 **Best Director ‚Äî Zhang Yuan *Singapore Film Festival, 2000 **Best Director ‚Äî Zhang Yuan **Best Actress (tied) ‚Äî Liu Lin & Li Bingbing *Fajr Film Festival, Iran 2001 **Crystal Simorgh for Best Screenplay DVD release Seventeen Years was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States on April 5, 2005 by Kino International.

He made his debut in November 1947, and in the following season made the right back position his own, staying in the team for the next ten seasons. Dunn was a key player for both manager Frank Buckley and his successor, Raich Carter; the defensive line of Dunn, Grenville Hair, Eric Kerfoot and Jack Charlton was a key component in Leeds' promotion to Division One in 1955‚Äì56. The Leeds team of the time was built around John Charles, who rated Dunn highly, describing him as \\"one of the best full-backs I ever played with... at tackling and covering he was unbelievable. Very fit, strong and hard.\\" Dunn was widely considered one of the finest players in his position never to have played for his country. When Carter was replaced as manager by Bill Lambton in 1959, his methods were so unpopular that he caused a players' rebellion in which Kerfoot and Dunn were to the fore. Both players left Leeds, with Dunn going to Darlington and then Scarborough. In the twilight of his career he suffered a knee injury which eventually forced his retirement. Between 1947 and 1959 he made 443 appearances for Leeds, and scored one goal. In a poll of the 100 greatest ever Leeds United players, Dunn was voted in at number 73.

Prop C created a one tenth of one cent sales tax devoted to the creation of an interconnected system of greenways, parks and trails. The Great Rivers Greenway District does not have oversight over existing parks and recreation areas, but rather works to develop linear connections to connect to existing or planned parks. Governance A twelve-member Board of Directors representing the three areas governs the distribution of funds for developing the River Ring, the system of interconnected greenways, parks and trails. An Executive Director and staff carry out the development of the River Ring, working with local, county and state agencies as well as private and non- profit agencies throughout the St. Louis region. Plans In 2003, the Great Rivers Greenway District developed \\"Building the River Ring: A Citizen- Driven Regional Plan\\" to establish a long-term vision for the St. Louis region. Working with citizens, local governments, private companies, non-profit organizations and advocacy groups, the Plan identified a system of 40+ greenways comprising over 600 miles of greenways and trails throughout the three counties. Named the River Ring, the concept is designed to raise awareness of the natural beauty found in the region's many rivers and streams and to reconnect residents to the primary natural feature resulting in the City's founding, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. It is the name applied to a linked system of smaller greenway projects encircling St. Louis City, St. Louis County, and St. Charles County. Each of these green belts will follow the natural paths of rivers and streams in the area. The total project will eventually comprise more than 600 miles of trails and include more than 45 different greenways connecting existing parks, trails and greenways in the City of St. Louis, St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri with those developed by the Metro East Parks District of St. Clair and Madison Counties in Illinois.

They are primarily known for their a cappella singing and close harmony. History The King's Heralds began in 1927 by four college students; brothers Lewis, Waldo and Wesley Crane and Ray Turner (1908-2008) in Keene, Texas who began singing gospel music, under the name Lone Star Four. They soon appeared with Pastor R. L. Benton on his radio program on KFPL from Waco, Texas. In 1936, they were invited by H.M.S. Richards to join the Voice of Prophecy in California, and were renamed the King's Heralds after a radio naming contest. This association continued until 1982, when they became a self-supporting ministry. The King's Heralds are also known by the name The Heralds, in Portuguese as the Arautos do Rei and in Spanish as Los Heraldos del Rey. Purported to be the oldest continuous gospel quartet in America, they have been singing for over 80 years.About the King's Heralds. Retrieved 2009-04-17. Throughout the years they have performed in over 50 countries and continue to tour extensively. They were the first gospel music group from the West to tour The People‚Äôs Republic of China since 1949, singing for the \\"First Invitational Symposium on the Christian Church in China\\" sponsored by the US/China Education Foundation. Long associated with the Seventh-day Adventist Voice of Prophecy radio broadcast, the Heralds are now promoted as trans-denominational and are regular guests on Praise The Lord on TBN and It Is Written.

Lockyear, II on 2 August 1964) is an American musician. Born in Madison, Wisconsin, he is best known as co-founder of, and lead vocalist for, the industrial metal band The Electric Hellfire Club. During his youth, Thorn participated in several punk and post-punk bands (including the short-lived WestWorld), before founding the power-electronics duo Slave State with Boris Dragos in 1987. Slave State played a handful of shows throughout the midwest along with staging a performance entitled \\"The Theory and Practice of Hell\\" in Antwerp, Belgium. While Slave State only released their music in cassette format, their influence was nonetheless far- reaching as they are cited by Godflesh founder Justin Broadrick as the inspiration for the title of his album bearing the group's name. Re-locating to Chicago later that year, Thorn was approached and offered a position as live keyboardist for industrial dance pioneers My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, which he accepted, under the pseudonym \\"Buck Ryder\\". Following Dragos' suicide in early 1989, Thorn signed on as a permanent member of the group. During his tenure with the band, Thorn (under his Buck Ryder guise) toured extensively with the band, and appeared in the music video for the song \\"Kooler Than Jesus\\". Thorn also claims to have contributed to both the \\"Confessions of a Knife\\" and \\"Sexplosion!\\" albums. Thorn chose to leave the group for undisclosed reasons prior to that album's release in 1991, instead relocating to Kenosha, WI where he founded The Electric Hellfire Club with Shane Lassen (Rev. Dr. Luv) and guitarist Ronny Valeo of Screamer. During a 1996 tour with Boyd Rice, Rice introduced Thorn to Church of Satan founder, Anton LaVey. During their meeting, he was ordained a priest in the church by LaVey. Thorn later wrote a eulogy of LaVey following the latter's death in 1997, which appeared in the Church of Satan's house organ The Black Flame.

It is the first full length Christian thrash metal album as it was released in 1988. Though controversial, Human Sacrifice and the following album, Once Dead were huge successes in the world of Christian music, making Vengeance Rising one of the few bands in the genre to cross over into the secular music scene. Dave Caughney of Cross Rhythms magazine wrote in 1990 that this \\"legendary classic debut [...] breathed much needed freshness into the somewhat stale white metal (Christian metal) scene\\". HM Magazine editor Doug Van Pelt called Human Sacrifice \\"the most radical Christian album ever released\\". In 2010, HM ranked Human Sacrifice the best Christian metal album of all time on its Top 100 list because it \\"tilted the Christian metal world on its ear\\". The lyrics of Human Sacrifice retell several major points of Christ's ministry: His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and Second Coming. The band compares the form to that of an opera, with a dramatic beginning, middle, and ending. Recording history Human Sacrifice was recorded in 1988, and released on Intense Records the same year with 1,000 copies. Soon a Dutch band called Vengeance demanded the group to change its name. After renaming itself as \\"Vengeance Rising\\", the band re- released Human Sacrifice with the word \\"rising\\" under the logo on cover picture. Causing further issues for the band, some Christians, noting the unusual vocal and musical style, labeled the release as demonic. These issues, along with the cover image which featured the pierced hand of Bob Beeman (founder of Sanctuary International) caused the album to be pulled from the shelves of some Christian bookstores. Musically, Human Sacrifice focuses on brutal thrash metal in vein of Dark Angel, old Death and Slayer. Roger Martinez's vocals are more of the death metal type growling approach than typical thrash shouting. One Christian youth magazine stated that the style made \\"Stryper sound like Sandi Patti.\\" Vengeance Rising was influenced by 1970s hard rock and heavy metal groups. This shows in the blues rock influences on several tracks. There are three short songs on Human Sacrifice: \\"Receive Him\\" (6 s.), \\"Salvation\\" (17 s.) and \\"He is God\\" (53 s.) Lyrically, Human Sacrifice was noticed for having violent themes on songs like \\"Burn\\", and fire and brimstone themes that \\"would make even the most conservative theologian proud\\" on \\"Fill This Place With Blood\\". Human Sacrifice is said to be one of the more extreme Christian metal albums that was available in the 1980s, and it has become somewhat a legend in the Christian circles. In the Summer 2006 issue of Revolver magazine's The Revolver Record Collection section, guest writer Doug Van Pelt provided a list of ten recommended Christian metal albums in which Human Sacrifice was mentioned, stating that \\"In daring to be sonically scary, Human Sacrifice bumped up the credibility of Christian metal several notches.\\" In 2010, HM magazine ranked Human Sacrifice No. 10 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that \\"nothing has really come out before or since this album hit the scene. Awesome riffs played at breakneck speed, but just gnarly, groove-heavy riffs on their own. Tunes like \\"White Throne\\" and the title track are without question high- water marks of the Christian metal scene. Has only one blemish (probably the worst audio engineering glitch of all time) ‚Äì a bad vocal edit, which comes in at 2:02 during the song \\"Burn\\". On August 2010 issue of Heaven's Metal fanzine, the album ranked No. 1 on the Top 100 Christian metal albums of all time list because it \\"is just amazing. It tilted the Christian metal world on its ear. Imagine Slayer with Jesus-first lyrics. The band was so tight and rooted in blues, but played at 100 mph. The vocalist is now an avowed 'Satanic atheist,' so there is a lot of drama post the breakup of the band. The song 'White Throne' will just knock you off your seat. Great building song with dramatic payoff in each chorus.\\" Intense Millennium Records reissued both Human Sacrifice and Once Dead albums with new artwork on November 9, 2010.

Hungary became a member of the Warsaw Pact in 1955; since the end of World War II, Russian troops were stationed in the country, intervening at the time of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Starting in March 1990, the Soviet Army began leaving Hungary, with the last troops being withdrawn on June 19, 1991. World War II By 1943-1944, the tide of World War II had turned. The Red Army regained the pre-war Soviet territory, and advanced westward from its borders to defeat Germany and its allies, including Hungary. Officially, Soviet military operations in Hungary ended on 4 April 1945, when the last German troops were expelled, although Soviet troops (and political advisers) remained within the country.  Forced labor of Hungarians in the Soviet Union  During the period of Soviet occupation of Hungary in World War II (1944‚Äì45) under a system known in Hungary as malenki robot (Russian for \\"little work\\") it is estimated that up to 600,000 Hungarians (of which up to 200,000 were civilians) were captured by the occupying Soviets and deported to labour camps in the Soviet Union - of those deported, up to 200,000 perished.Tam√°s Stark, * ‚ÄûMalenki Robot‚Äù Magyar k√©nyszermunk√°sok a Szovjetuni√≥ban (1944‚Äì1955) * ‚ÄúMalenki Robot‚Äù ‚Äì Hungarian Forced Labourers in the Soviet Union (1944‚Äì1955) The first deported Hungarians started to return to Hungary in June 1946, with the last returning in the years 1953-1955, after Stalin's death. The Soviet policy of deportations for forced labor extended to other occupied nations, however no other Soviet occupied nation was hit as hard as Hungary - for comparison, it is estimated that 155,000 to 218,000 Germans were deported from mainland Germany.Pavel Polian-Against Their Will: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR Central European University Press 2003 Page 265Dokumentation der Vertreibung der Deutschen aus Ost-Mitteleuropa I. Die Vertreibung der deutschen Bev√∂lkerung aus den Gebieten √∂stlich der Oder-Neisse, Band 1 (1953) ‚ÄìPages 83 and 87 Post-war Soviet policies The Soviets made sure that a post-war government dominated by Communists was installed in the country before transferring authority from the occupation force to the Hungarians. In elections held in November 1945, the Independent Smallholders' Party won 57 percent of the vote. The Hungarian Communist Party, under the leadership of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi and Ern≈ë Ger≈ë, received support from only 17 percent of the population. The Soviet commander in Hungary, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, refused to allow the Smallholders Party to form a government. Instead, Voroshilov established a coalition government with the Communists holding some of the key posts. Later, M√°ty√°s R√°kosi boasted that he had dealt with his partners in the government one by one, \\"cutting them off like slices of salami.\\" The Hungarian monarchy was formally abolished on February 1, 1946, and replaced by the Republic of Hungary. The gradual takeover by the Communists was completed on August 18, 1949, when Hungary became the People's Republic of Hungary. The presence of Soviet troops in Hungary was formalized by the 1949 mutual assistance treaty, which granted the Soviet Union rights to a continued military presence, assuring ultimate political control. The Soviet forces in Hungary were part of the so-called Central Group of Forces headquartered in Baden, near Vienna. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a spontaneous nationwide revolt against the Communist government of Hungary and its Soviet-imposed policies. After announcing their willingness to negotiate the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On November 4, 1956, a large joint military force of the Warsaw Pact, led by Moscow, entered Budapest to crush the armed resistance. The Soviet intervention, codenamed \\"Operation Whirlwind\\", was launched by Marshal Ivan Konev.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) The five Soviet divisions stationed in Hungary before October 23 in the first intervention (\\"Operation Wave\\") were augmented to a total strength of 17 divisions. The 8th Mechanized Army under command of Lieutenant General Hamazasp Babadzhanian and the 38th Army under command of Lieutenant General Hadzhi-Umar Mamsurov from the nearby Carpathian Military District were deployed to Hungary for the operation. This second intervention came after three days of deception. The Russians negotiated with the Hungarians (the so- called mixed commission headed by P√°l Mal√©ter) about the withdrawal of Soviet troops on the island of T√∂k√∂l, but at the same time flew J√°nos K√°d√°r and Ferenc M√ºnnich secretly to the Soviet Union on November 1 to establish a new pro-Soviet Hungarian government.Johanna Granville, The First Domino: International Decision Making During the Hungarian Crisis of 1956\\", Texas A & M University Press, 2004. (page 95). At 3:00 a.m. on November 4, Soviet tanks penetrated Budapest along the Pest side of the Danube in two thrusts‚Äîone from the south, and one from the north‚Äîthus splitting the city in half. Armored units crossed into Buda, and at 4:25 a.m. fired the first shots at the army barracks on Buda√∂rsi road. Soon after, Soviet artillery and tank fire was heard in all districts of Budapest. Operation Whirlwind combined air strikes, artillery, and the coordinated tank-infantry action of 17 divisions. By 8:00 am organised defence of the city evaporated after the radio station was seized, and many defenders fell back to fortified positions. Hungarian civilians bore the brunt of the fighting, and it was often impossible for Soviet troops to differentiate military from civilian targets. For this reason, Soviet tanks often crept along main roads firing indiscriminately into buildings. Hungarian resistance was strongest in the industrial areas of Budapest, which were heavily targeted by Soviet artillery and air strikes. Soviet army officers, largely unable to speak Hungarian, began indiscriminately arresting anyone showing resistance, including sixty-eight minors, among them nine young girls, pro-Soviet Hungarian officers, and German employees of the Red Cross. According to KGB chief Ivan Serov's report on November 11, as many as 3,773 insurgents were arrested, and by November 13, the number grew to 4,056. Several hundreds were illegally deported by train to Uzhgorod (Ungv√°r) in Soviet Ukraine and transported to several prisons in Stryi, Drohobych, Chernivtsi, and Stanislav (Ivano-Frankivsk). After international protests by the United Nations, they were transported back to Hungary in December.Johanna Granville, the Line of Fire: New Archival Evidence on the Soviet Intervention in Hungary, 1956\\", Carl Beck Paper, no. 1307 (1999), page 25. Within Hungary, the last pocket of resistance called for ceasefire on 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 722 Soviet troops had been killed and thousands more were wounded.Mark Kramer, ‚ÄúThe Soviet Union and the 1956 Crises in Hungary and Poland: Reassessments and New Findings‚Äù, Journal of Contemporary History, Vol.33, No.2, April 1998, p.210.P√©ter Gosztonyi, \\"Az 1956-os forradalom sz√°mokban\\", N√©pszabads√°g (Budapest), 3 November 1990. After the Hungarian Revolution The crushing of the Hungarian Revolution strengthened Soviet control over the Eastern Bloc. The Soviets had Imre Nagy replaced as Prime Minister of Hungary with J√°nos K√°d√°r, the leader of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. Nagy, with a few others, was given sanctuary in the Yugoslav Embassy. In spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by J√°nos K√°d√°r, on 22 November 1956, Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy, and taken to Snagov, Romania. Subsequently, the Soviets returned him to Hungary, where he was secretly charged with organizing to overthrow the Hungarian people's democratic state and with treason. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958.Richard Solash, \\"Hungary: U.S. President To Honor 1956 Uprising\\" , Radio Free Europe, June 20, 2006 According to Fedor Burlatsky, a Kremlin insider, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed, \\"as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries.\\"David Pryce-Jones, \\"What the Hungarians wrought: the meaning of October 1956\\", National Review, October 23, 2006 End of Soviet military presence In the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, the Soviet troopsthe Southern Group of Forcesstarted leaving Hungary. By July 1990, some 15,000 Soviet soldiers and their dependents had left, taking about 60,000 of the 560,000 tons of equipment they had stored there. There were 5,750 buildings left on the 60 army camps and 10 air bases maintained by the Soviet Army in Hungary. The Soviets reportedly asked for 50 billion forints (some 800 million US dollars at the time), as compensation for the \\"Soviet investment\\" in Hungary; the then-commander of Soviet troops in Hungary, Col. Gen. Matvei Burlakov (succeeded by Lt. Gen. Shilov), said that the troop withdrawals may be held up if the Hungarians refused to pay. The remaining 40,000 Soviet troops left Hungary, starting in March 1990, with the last leaving on June 19, 1991.

Featuring Bobby Vinton, a best-selling popular music singer since the early 1960s, the series mixed comedy skits with musical interludes. Appearing on the series as a regular was comedian Billy Van. The series often satirized Vinton's Polish heritage, and its theme song was an \\"umpah band\\" rendition of his 1974 song \\"My Melody of Love\\" (Vinton also ended each episode by performing the song himself). The series was created by Chris Bearde and packaged by Chuck Barris. The shows always commenced with a large woman named Monique dancing the guest out to the stage. The series was syndicated to local stations in the United States, although the program's entry in the user-edited Internet Movie Database suggests it may also have been broadcast by CBS during 1975 (CBS did broadcast his one-hour special, Bobby Vinton's Rock N' Rollers, during 1978).

The ship was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of . Hertha served abroad in the German East Asia Squadron for the first six years of her career; she served briefly as the Squadron flagship in 1900. She contributed a landing party to the force that captured the Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. After returning to Germany in 1905, she was modernized and used as a training ship in 1908, following the completion of the refit. She conducted a series of training cruises, and several notable officers served aboard the ship as cadets, including Karl D√∂nitz and Ernst Lindemann. At the outbreak of World War I, Hertha was mobilized into V Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Victoria Louise class In the early 1890s, elements in the German naval command structure grappled with what type of cruiser ought to be built to fulfill the various needs of the fleet. The Reichsmarineamt (RMA‚ÄîImperial Navy Office) preferred to build a combination of large cruisers of around along the lines of and significantly smaller vessels of about to support them, while the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command) argued that a uniform force of cruisers was preferable. In the event, the RMA carried the day and three 6,000-ton cruisers were authorized in 1895. They resembled the larger s, designed at the same time, albeit at reduced scale. Hertha was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. As designed, she displaced , and at full load, her displacement rose to .

Hertha also carried eight 15 cm SK L/40 guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates. These guns had a range of . She also carried ten 8.8 cm SK L/35 naval guns. The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns. She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline. The ship was protected with Krupp armor; their deck was on the horizontal with sloped sides that were thick. Her main and secondary battery turrets had 10 cm thick sides and the secondary casemates had the same level of protection. The conning tower had 15 cm thick sides.

She was launched on 14 April 1897, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 23 July 1898. Hertha served as a colonial cruiser after she was completed, starting in 1899. After arriving on the East Asia station, she temporarily served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Felix von Bendemann, the commander of the East Asia Squadron, which included the cruisers , , , and Kaiserin Augusta. After the new armored cruiser reached the Asia station, she relieved Hertha as the Squadron flagship. As part of the East Asia Squadron during the Boxer Rebellion, the ship made a noteworthy contribution in the Battle of the Taku Forts. In June 1900, Hertha, along with Hansa, Gefion, and Irene landed detachments of Seebataillone (marines) to seize the Taku Forts. The marines joined detachments sent from warships of several other countries. A total of around 450 German troops were contributed to the multi-national force, which totaled around 2,200 officers and men. During the attack on the forts, Herthas commanding officer was shot and killed. In September, Hertha carried Alfred von Waldersee to Shanghai, arriving on the 21st, where he took command of the international forces suppressing the rebellion. Hertha was detached from the East Asia Squadron and returned to Germany in 1905. In 1906, she went to dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit, during which she was re- boilered. Hertha originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1908, at which point Hertha became a cadet training ship; several prominent naval officers trained aboard the ship during this period. In September‚ÄìOctober 1909, Hertha, , , and traveled to the United States to represent Germany during the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration. Hertha at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909 In 1910, Karl D√∂nitz, the future commander of the Kriegsmarine during World War II, served as a cadet on Hertha for a year. The ship cruised in the western Mediterranean in the autumn of 1912, along with her sister . The old cruiser was also in the region. The future commander of the battleship Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann, served aboard the ship as a cadet in 1913. The ship conducted a training cruise in the Baltic and North Seas in late May to early July, stopping in a number of foreign ports, including Stockholm, Visby, and Bergen. The ship then embarked on a seven month training cruise into the Atlantic Ocean; during the voyage, Hertha called on numerous ports, including Vera Cruz, Mexico, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Kingston, Jamaica, and Halifax, Canada. The cruise lasted from mid-August 1913 to mid-March 1914. Hertha had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into V Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship for the seaplane base in Flensburg. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Audorf-Rendsburg. and was scrapped the following year.

Life and work  Little is known of his early life. He was born in Torricella, and studied law at the University of Turin, where he may have earned his Doctorate. He soon turned to painting, however, but had difficulty obtaining clients so, sometime in the 1720s, went to Venice and became a student of Jacopo Amigoni. The works of Titian and Paolo Veronese were especially influential. He first gained attention at this time with portraits of the Sardinian Royal Family. Later, he returned to Switzerland, working in Solothurn and Bern. His connection with Germany began when he married in St. Blasien. In 1733, he went to Kassel at the invitation of Landgrave William VIII, for whom he created several large portraits. His wife died in 1735 and, the following year, he moved to Hannover then, in 1737, on to Potsdam and Berlin, where he painted for the Prussian Royal Family. He also worked in Wolfenb√ºttel and Braunschweig from 1738 to 1739. That year, he settled in London. His portraits were so well thought of that King George II called him \\"Cavaliere\\", which is why he later referred to himself as \\"Ritter\\" (Knight). He left England a few years later and returned to Italy. While there, in the 1750s, he was employed by a branch of the Spanish Royal Family. He continued to travel throughout Italy, using Milan as his home base, until his death there, aged 76.

Frijda, The Emotions. Cambridge(UK): Cambridge University Press, 1986. p. 207 The term also characterizes and categorizes specific emotions. For example, emotions popularly referred to as \\"negative\\", such as anger and fear, have negative valence. Joy has positive valence. Positively valenced emotions are evoked by positively valenced events, objects, or situations. The term is also used to describe the hedonic tone of feelings, affect, certain behaviors (for example, approach and avoidance), goal attainment or nonattainment, and conformity with or violation of norms. Ambivalence can be viewed as conflict between positive and negative valence-carriers. Theorists taking a valence-based approach to studying affect, judgment, and choice posit that emotions with the same valence (e.g., anger and fear or pride and surprise) produce a similar influence on judgments and choices. Suffering is negative valence and the opposite of this is pleasure or happiness. Suffering can mean all unpleasant emotions. History of usage The term entered English in psychology with the translation from German (\\"Valenz\\") in 1935 of works of Kurt Lewin. Criterion for emotion Valence is one criterion used in some definitions of emotion. The possible absence of valence is cited as a reason to exclude surprise from the list of emotions, though some would include it. Measurement Valence could be assigned a number and treated as if it were measured, but the validity of a measurement based on a subjective report is questionable. Measurement based on observations of facial expressions, using the Facial Action Coding System and microexpressions (see Paul Ekman) or muscle activity detected through facial electromyography, or on modern functional brain imaging may overcome this objection. Emotional valence is represented in right posterior superior temporal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex.

It was completed in December 1995 and opened in 1996 and was designed by the architect Stephen Hodder. The building won the RIBA Award and Stirling Prize in 1996 and the Civic Trust Award in 1997. Site and brief The site is situated on the edge of the city of Manchester and lies within the campus of the University of Salford. The brief for the building came from the predecessor of the University of Salford towards the end of 1994 and demanded a building which was a \\"fusion of design and technology\\" to house the Spatial, Graphic and Industrial Design Department of the university. Hodder had 11 weeks to finish the design stage and begin development on site in order to ensure the EU grant was eligible. Architecture The building consists of two separate glazed structures set as a frame to an informal galleried atrium. The service towers and studio and seminar accommodation are housed within a four-storey orthogonal block on the \\"City side\\" of the development. The tutorial accommodation and technology suites are situated in a free-form three-storey block newly defined courtyard. The connection between the two blocks is a raised street within which all horizontal circulation is contained in galleries. In this way street life becomes an aspect of the life of the building; common areas, adjoining offices and studios engage with the street the animate the building and imbue it with a sense of purpose. Working details of escape stair is enclosed in glass block screen. Other materials include stainless steel cladding and concrete. Accommodation includes seminar rooms, video-editing suites, lecture halls.http://www.heestates.ac.uk/goodprac/capital/value/univchal/projects/hodder.asp The end result is a building which looks strikingly modern, but which has significant usability problems. Because the design features visible movement of people, the environment is noisy and the full-height glass walls to offices and study spaces offers little in the way of privacy, A large number of rooms have no direct external windows, relying instead on borrowed light from the central atrium. The subsequent lack of ventilation and reliance on fluorescent lighting for the whole of the day is not conducive to good health. Outside of rooms, all spaces are designed for transit and thus there are no informal 'social' areas for people to gather and talk. On a more mundane level, there are no kitchen areas and the only taps delivering drinking water are situated in the toilets. None of the toilets have external windows, and thus are usually less than pleasant spaces to visit. Central heating is under-specified which, when coupled with the already mentioned windows and ventilation issues, leaves the building cold in Winter and unbearably hot in Summer. Engineering The construction of the building was completed relatively speedily in comparison to other similar buildings in Britain and to a built to a tight financial budget in order that it could take advantage of EU grant funding.

Biography  = Early life = Ali Khan, son of Mohammad Gasem Khan Vali, son of Dust-Ali Khan Mo'ayyerolmamalek, was born in Tehran on 1262 Hijri. After returning from the post of consulate general of Tbilisi, Mohammad Gasem went to Saint Petersburg with grand ambassador Abbas Goli Khan Nuri as an embassy advisor to congratulate the coronation of Alexander III, Tsar of Russia and after returning, he was appointed first as minister resident and then minister plenipotentiary in Saint Petersburg. During youth, Ali Khan was living in Russia with his father and started studying French language, history, geography and geometry there and learned the new art of photography along with it. After returning, Mohammad Gasem was appointed as the governor of Gilan and performed valuable services there, including checking law enforcement of the cities, building the Iraq road and checking the stations along the roads. Mohammad Gasem became known as Vali for frequent governances until it became their surnames. = Reign of Maragheh = In 1285 Hijri, Gasem Khan Vali was dismissed from ruling Gilan and Ali Khan Vali was appointed as special servant of the royal court and achieved the chance to go to Atabat-e Aliat (Karbala) along with Naser al-Din Shah the next year. In 1288 when Gasem Khan Vali was appointed by Zell-e Soltan to serve in the government of Fars, Ali Khan did not accompany Gasem and stayed in Tehran. After Gasem's death (1289), Saheb Divan was removed from governor of Azerbaijan in 1296 and Ali Khan was assigned to Azerbaijan along with a group with the crown prince and was appointed as governor of Maragheh. Ali Khan began photography en route to Maragheh and added pictures of the city hall and authorities of Maragheh to the first pages of his album. During Ali Khan's reign in Maragheh, the city was cleansed from thieves and security was established. At the beginning of Ali Khan's reign, some powerful figures hired some scoundrels in disguise of servants and sent them to the houses of the people for theft, and the victims did not dare to complain and sue their lost properties due to fearing the recruiters of the thieves. Ali Khan tried to fight those actions since the start of his reign and in order to do that, he personally lurked in alleys with some of his agents during cold nights of winter until he eradicated theft and arrested and imprisoned the thieves. Only months had passed since his takeover in Maragheh before the crisis of Sheikh Ubeydullah Nahri occurred. After ending the crisis and twenty months of reign in Maragheh, Ali Khan went to Tabriz and formally resigned from governor of Maragheh there and stayed in Tabriz for a while. During the time, Hasan Ali Khan Garroosy intended to suppress the scoundrels of the borderlands and in order to prevent an evil event in his absence in the lands of Azerbaijan, he formed a parliament titled Public Majlis of Azerbaijan from authorities and governors of the lands and assigned Ali Khan to supervise the mentioned parliament. = Reign of Urmia and Khoy = In Shawwal the same year Hijri, due to the illness of Sani'ol-Doleh, the governor of Urmia, Ali Khan was appointed for the post and remained as governor of Urmia until the end of Jumada al-awwal 1300. Then, on the order of the crown prince's agents, Salar Lashkar was removed from governor of Khoy and Ali Khan Vali was appointed as governor of Khoy and Salmas. In there, he had several architectural actions like paving streets, renovating the city hall, and reconstructing the Grand Bazaar of the city recorded in his government legacy. In there, he sent visualized reports of his jurisdiction to the Shah and achieved a handwriting of the Shah due to those efforts. In 1302, he appointed Jamshid Khan Makuyi as lieutenant governor of Khoy and went to Urmia himself. Then he went to Tehran and brought Gasem, his 15-year-old son, with him back to Khoy for training and established a special school in the government mansion for his education. But after a short while, he was removed from governor of Khoy due to some provocations and Amidoddoleh replaced him as governor. In Jumada al-Thani 1303, Ali Khan departed for Tabriz and stayed in that city for six and a half months went to Sain Qaleh in order to discipline Soleyman Khan's children in Dhu al-Hijjah the same year and produced some photos of Takht-e SoleymƒÅn in that region. In Rabi' al-awwal the same year, the royalty reappointed him as governor of Urmia due to some disturbances in Urmian region and Ali Khan soon suppressed the riot in the new post. In those disturbances, Hasu, who had taken Fort Jarmi with his troops, was suppressed by Ali Khan and as a result, peace was once again established in Urmia. Due to that good work and his merit, Ali Khan officially achieved the title Jinab by an executive order. In the trip, he picked Ali Agha the Photographer as his pupil and determined to train him and added new photos to his album by the latter's help. Vali remained as governor of Urmia for two years and eight months. = Reign of Ardabil = In Naser al-Din Shah's return from his third trip to Europe, Ali Khan welcomed him and was appointed as governor of Ardabil by the Shah. in 1308 Hijri, Vali got in a slight controversy with some market men including tanners about his order to transfer workplace to outside the city. Those controversies caused the reputation that Ali Khan had in public view to be scratched. At the end of 1315, after the exacerbation of Heydari-Ne'mati controversies in Ardabil and public riot against Nezamossaltaneh, the governor, the government decided to appoint Ali Khan ValI as governor of Ardabil once again. He did a full-scale effort in resolving disputes. With no accomplishment, he arrested Mirza Ali Akbar, one of Ne'mati headmasters, and exiled him to Maragheh. When Ali Akbar returned to Ardabil after one year, he provoked Khosro Khan Yurtchi against the governor for revenge. After gathering troops, Khosro Khan surrounded Ali Khan in Dasheskan garden and sent him to Tabriz with some people after arresting him. The crown prince considered that insult to the governor unacceptable and summoned Khosro Khan to Tabriz. But he disobeyed the order and was finally spared with a ten thousand-toman suit. In the same year, Ali Khan became affected with a dangerous disease and left Ardabil for Tehran for treatment. = Death = After three years of illness, Ali Khan died in Tehran on 1318 Hijri.  Personal life  Ali Khan had much interest in exercise. Dust-Ali Mo'ayyeri has described his interest this way:  Ali Khan Palace  On the upstream of the village Ja'far Abad, Shemiran, Ali Khan founded a summer mansion and a large garden. During summer, he invited the ministers and important figures of his time to the garden and arranged large feasts. A while later, Ali Khan's son, Gassem Khan had another mansion built beside the mountain, which formed one side of the walls of the mansion. The garden and the mansions were titled Ali Khan Palace and were attached to the foundations of Sa'dabad Complex in Pahlavi era.

It consists of an excessive build-up of the endolymph fluid, which fills the hearing and balance structures of the inner ear. Endolymph fluid, which is partly regulated by the endolymph sac, flows through the inner ear and is critical to the function of all sensory cells in the inner ear. In addition to water, endolymph fluid contains salts such as sodium, potassium, chloride and other electrolytes. If the inner ear is damaged by disease or injury, the volume and composition of the endolymph fluid can change, causing the symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops. Symptoms The symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops include the feeling of pressure or fullness in the ears, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and balance problems. Individuals who have M√©ni√®re's disease have a degree of endolymphatic hydrops that is strong enough to trigger the symptoms of this disease, but individuals with endolymphatic hydrops do not always progress to M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease. Causes Endolymphatic hydrops may occur as a result of trauma such as a blow to the head, infection, degeneration of the inner ear, allergies, dehydration and loss of electrolytes or in extremely rare circumstances a benign tumor such as an endolymphatic sac tumor. In many cases, it is not clear what causes the disorder. M√©ni√®re‚Äôs attacks occur when there is an increase in endolymphatic volume in the inner ear, causing a temporary leak in the membrane separating the perilymph (potassium poor fluid) and the endolymph (potassium rich fluid). The mix of these two fluids surrounding the vestibular sensory cells can lead to a temporary electrical blockade and loss of sensory function. The sudden change in the rate of the vestibular nerve firing results in a disturbance of signal processing in the corresponding brain regions, and thus to acute sensations of imbalance, otherwise known as vertigo.

Accessed June 8, 2017. Career Ervin Thomas Beck was born on July 19, 1878, in Toledo, Ohio. He made his first professional baseball appearance at the age of 16, when he signed with the Adrian Reformers of the Michigan State League. From 1896 into the 1899 minor league baseball seasons, he played for the Toledo Mud Hens of the Interstate League, hitting 11 home runs and a .298 batting average in 1898. During his time with the Mud Hens, he was considered to be one of the top players at his position in the Interstate League. In August 1897, the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League (NL), offered Toledo $1,500 for the rights for Beck as well as their first baseman, Bade Meyers. In August 1899, Beck was sold by the Mud Hens to the Brooklyn Superbas of the National League, and made his major league debut on September 19. Superbas manager Ted Sullivan initially offered Toledo $200 for Beck's rights, but eventually agreed to $1000. In total, Beck played in eight games for the Superbas, six as a second baseman and two as a shortstop, and collected just four hits in 24 at bats for a .167 batting average. For the 1900 season, he returned to the Mud Hens and played a full season, achieving career-high totals in every major hitting category, highlighted by his .360 batting average and 71 doubles. Following the season, his rights were retained by Cincinnati of the NL but he instead chose to play for the Cleveland Blues of the newly-major American League. On April 25, 1901, Beck hit the first major league home run in American League history.https://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1901/B04250CHA1901.htm On November 27, 1901, it was reported that Beck had signed with the Cincinnati Reds of the NL before the 1902 season; a one-year contract for $3,000 to play second base. After his strong performance in 1901, the move was made to strengthen the Reds offense among their infielders. In 1904, Beck played for the Portland Browns of the Pacific Coast League. In 208 games for the Browns, he collected 217 hits and had a .273 batting average. After the season, he was rumored to be a part of a trade with the Los Angeles Angels, but it never materialized.

It was bred in 1947 when the Soviet Union's national economy ministry decided that every country in the Union must have its own dog breed. In September 2019, the FCI officially recognized the breed.Eesti Hagijas. Federation Cynologique Internationale. History The Estonian Hound is a relatively young breed that is already highly valued in Estonia, its country of origin. This breed resulted from the crossbreeding of several foreign dog breeds with local hunting dogs. The Estonian Hound's development was announced by an ultimatum issued by the Soviet Union‚Äôs Ministry of Agriculture and Economy in 1947, which ordered every Soviet Republic to establish a local breed of hunting dogs to replace the large breeds of hunting dogs bred at that moment. These large dogs were blamed for the rapid decline of Estonia's wildlife population; it was established that only dogs with a maximum height of 17 inches were allowed to hunt. The result was a very agile and hard driven breed that has enjoyed tremendous popularity since then: the modern Estonian Hound. After Estonia regained its independence, the Estonian Hound was proclaimed the country's national dog. Description The Estonian Hound is a dog of medium size and a strong muscular body, bone structure and muscles that are well developed. It has no folds in its skin and drop ears. The coat is short and rough and should be shiny. The undercoat is weakly developed. This breed's eyes are dark brown colored. The Estonian Hound usually has black patches and a dark pigmented skin. The size of the patches is unlimited. Blackish-brown color, red patches and a saddle like patches on the back are also allowed, but the tip of the tail has to be white. The Estonian Hound's height is and it weighs . =Temperament= The Estonian Hound is happy and pleasant dog with a balanced, calm and active temperament and a high intelligence. It is friendly and should never be aggressive, so it needs to be socialized and exposed to new situations and environments in order to prevent it from being a bit timid. It is good with other dogs and usually also with cats if used to them as a puppy. They love human attention and can get upset when left alone. Proper human to canine communication is really important to its training. They are affectionate and easy to teach; this is important since they have to learn that they cannot hunt hoofed animals as it is forbidden in Estonia where only hare and foxes are allowed to be hunted. The Estonian Hound has a pleasant voice that doesn't annoy when it hunts.

He has an extensive rugby union career, having played club rugby in New Zealand, England and France. He has top flight experience with Bristol, Leeds Carnegie and London Welsh and has been capped 13 times by Samoa including being called up to the Samoa World Cup 2007 team as a replacement for Filipo Levi who fractured his eye socket in a warm up match against Sale. Alfie is currently a player-coach at National League 2 South side Chinnor.  Early career  Born in Samoa, Alfie Comes from the Villages of Faga, Saina & Salelavalu, Alfie moved to New Zealand as a boy and grew up in Auckland where he attended De La Salle College, a boys secondary school notable for producing rugby union players. From school he joined Otahuha, a feeder team for the Auckland Blues, playing in the Gallaher Shield at level 4 of the New Zealand domestic game. While at Otahuhu he got his first taste of silverware when he helped the club to win the Gallaher Cup held at Eden Park in July 2000 - defeating Ponsonby 24 - 13. The next year his team made it back to the final, once again facing Ponsonby, but were unable to retain their trophy as they lost 13 - 31. in 2001 Alfie moved to England to join Rotherham for the 2001-02 season playing in the second division of English club rugby. He made an instant impression at the Yorkshire club, finishing in the top 10 of the divisions top try scorers with 13 tries, and he was also selected by Manu Samoa for their 2001-02 international tour. Rotherham also won the league title that year but were denied promotion to the Zurich Premiership as they were deemed to have failed the minimum standards criteria for entry. Despite this disappointment of missing out on promotion due to a technicality, Rotherham bounced back and won the 2002‚Äì03 National Division One for the second year running, finally gaining promotion to the Premiership, with Alfie contributing 5 tries in the league. Unfortunately for Alfie he would not gain Premiership experience with Rotherham and instead stayed in National Division One for the 2003-04 season, signing for ambitious Lancashire side Orrell - then owned by Dave Whelan. At Orrell he had a similar impact to his first season at Rotherham, scoring 10 tries in the division and helping the club to finish as runners up to a very strong Worcester side who went undefeated all season. Failure to gain promotion to the Premiership proved to be disastrous as Dave Whelan decided to stop investing in the club, which coupled with coach Ross Reynolds leaving as a result, prompted a mass exodus of players from the club including Alfie. For the 2004-05 season Alfie remained in National Division One but moved all the way across the country to sign for Plymouth Albion who had finished in 3rd position behind Orrell the previous year. He continued to play good rugby in the division, staying at the Devon club for two seasons, and helping them to 3rd and 5th-placed finishes in the league, scoring 15 tries in the process.  Premiership & French club career  In 2006 Alfie was picked up by Premiership side Bristol who he had experience of playing against during his first season at Albion. He made 16 league appearances during the 2006-07 season as Bristol managed to stay in the division in 11th place ahead of Leeds Tykes, who were relegated instead. Initially, signed on a two-year contract, his performances on his debut season led to the club offering him a new, three-year deal. After being made part of the Manu Samoa team for their 2006-07 international tour, he also made the squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, making made three appearances (two from the bench) at the competition held in France, which was a disappointing one for Samoa as they failed to progress from the group stage, finishing 4th in their group behind rivals Tonga. The 2007-08 season was a great one for Bristol as they came 4th in the league and qualified for the playoffs - a great turnaround for a club who had finished one spot off relegation the previous year - losing to eventual winners Leicester Tigers 14 - 26 in the semi finals. Alfie made 13 appearances for the club and was called up to represent Samoa at the 2007 Pacific Nations Cup making 1 appearance for a Samoa side which finished 3rd. The 2008-09 season was Alfie's last at Bristol. Despite making the most appearances in a league season in the three years spent at the club, he would finish as part of a relegated team who only won 2 games out of 22 and would drop to the newly labelled RFU Championship. Following Bristol's relegation Alfie moved back north to Yorkshire where his family was based in May 2009, this time to join newly promoted Leeds Carnegie for the 2009-10 season. His first season at Leeds was a success as he helped his team stay up in a very competitive league but the second saw Leeds finish bottom of the league table, being dead level with relegation rivals Newcastle Falcons but having a weaker for and against points difference. There was a slim chance Leeds could stay up due to the controversial minimum standards entry (which had denied Alfie's former team Rotherham all those years ago) but with the victory of Worcester Warriors in the Championship Playoffs, Leeds were down and Alfie decided to leave England after 9 seasons to join French side La Rochelle playing in the second division of French rugby. Although he was dropping a division to play rugby for La Rochelle in the 2011‚Äì12 Rugby Pro D2 season, the French second division was far stronger than the English equivalent in terms of both finances and supporter attendances, and La Rochelle were an ambitious club who had only just been relegated from the Top 14. In a very competitive division, La Rochelle finished 5th in the regular season, just qualifying for the end of season playoffs (the league champions went up straight away leaving 2nd - 5th in the playoffs). An away tie beckoned against 2nd placed Pau who edged a tight game 16 - 14 to leave La Rochelle to contemplate another season in Pro D2.  Recent career  Having failed to help La Rochelle go up at the first attempt, Alfie returned to England to sign for Premiership new boys London Welsh who had qualified for the league in the first time in the club's history. Alfie's did not have a good season for Welsh who were relegated from the 2012-13 Premiership despite being fairly competitive (they actually had as may wins as 11th placed Worcester Warriors but had more defeats and did badly in acquiring bonus points) and he was not a first team regular only starting 4 league games. Alfie left at the end of the season to re-join his first English club, Rotherham Titans, who were playing in the 2013‚Äì14 RFU Championship stating that he was delighted to return to the club \\"where he had the happiest time of his career\\". He had a run of games in the Titans squad and helped them to 4th place in the league and qualifying for the promotion playoffs. He played in the two semi final matches against former club Bristol but was unable to prevent his team from losing both games, ending any dreams of taking the Championship title. During the summer of 2014 Alfie decided to leave Rotherham to pursue his coaching career, signing as a player- coach for ambitious Chinnor, plying their trade in National League 2 South. As expected of a man with international and top flight experience, Alfie had an excellent debut season at the Oxfordshire, helping the club to a sixth-placed finish in the league and being ranked in the top 10 try scorers with 16 tries.

He was a successful as an artist and teacher. He took an overdose and died aged 57.  Early life  Burman was born in Bedford in June 1943. He gained a 2/1 in fine art at Coventry College of Art and continued his studies for a while at the Royal College of Art. Tutors at Coventry included Michael Sandle and Ivor Abrahams both Royal Academicians On his year course was Mike Baldwin the conceptualist artist, Fred Orton the Art Historian, Sue Gollifer the print miniaturist and digital artist, Phillip Wetton who went on to teach at Browns University in the United States.  Employment  Despite his success as an artist, he continued to teach part-time at Mid-Warwickshire College in Leamington between 1974 and 1994.  Artistic method  Burman painted with oil, acrylic, ink and wax crayon mixed with egg yolk and vinegar on thick paper to produce an extraordinary leathery surface. Shortly before his death, Burman began to work in a new medium, creating a series of Papier-m√¢ch√© figures / puppets - a return in three dimensions to earlier themes ('Leather Face', 'Uncle Tic Tac' and 'Tommy Rawhead').  Artistic themes  \\"If one had erroneously formed an impression of sadism or brutality, an encounter with the artist changed one's mind. His nature was as far as one could get from that of the monsters he portrayed. He was the most gentle, the most non-judgemental, the most modest man, affectionate to his friends, caring of them, supportive, and he was also among the most committed of artists.\\" Reprinted as an essay in catalogue for retrospective exhibition at The Royal Pump Rooms, Leamington Spa, 2004 = Sexuality and feminism = His early paintings are described by the critic Peter Webb as: \\"meticulous and controversial images which addressed his ideas on women's sexuality; provocative schoolgirls on black leather sofas; malevolent nudes clutching Victorian dolls; and threatening femme fatales grasping severed male heads\\". According to Webb, this led on one occasion to a physical attack from feminist critics on a BBC2 television program. Reprinted as an essay in catalogue for retrospective exhibition at The Royal Pump Rooms, Leamington Spa, 2004 = Murder = In the 1980s, he created a number of images inspired by both real-life and fictional serial-killers, including Jack the Ripper, Ed Gein and Hannibal Lecter.

An admirer of CBS broadcast journalist Charles Kuralt, Phillips chose the same field. He began working at local CBS affiliate KDFW-TV as a dispatcher his first year in college, started learning to use a TV camera, and within three months was reassigned as a photographer. He got his break in March 1970 when he was sent to shoot a film about a possible drowning, and no reporter was available to interview the youths involved, who had survived; after preparing the equipment, Phillips stepped in front of the camera to report the story while the camera ran itself, a procedure commonly known in broadcasting as \\"a one man band\\" that became his regular mode of operations.Bob Phillips. \\"Texas Country Reporter\\" (memories of the show and his early career), RFD TV Online, no date. Retrieved September 9, 2007. Phillips also travelled extensively with The Dallas Cowboys NFL team during the 1970s, shooting on the sidelines at the team's games. Initially focusing on political and sports coverage, the novice reporter pursued his goal of filming feature stories for inclusion on local broadcasts. Instead, the management decided to package his features in a separate half-hour weekend program, and 4 Country Reporter debuted in 1972. In 1986, he left Channel 4, renamed the show Texas Country Reporter, and began producing and syndicating it through his own company, Phillips Productions; the show aired in all 22 broadcast markets in Texas, including rival station WFAA, which renamed the show 8 Country Reporter, and eventually was added to stations in neighboring Louisiana. During this time, Dairy Queen was one of the show's sponsors, which allowed Phillips to be the chain's spokesperson in its ads when promoting food items at its Texas-based restaurants. When RFD-TV launched in December 2000, Texas Country Reporter was one of its featured programs. RFD introduced the program to audiences around the nation. Phillips has been closely involved in the development of the channel since he was approached about adding his show to its lineup. Today, Phillips' show is available in more than 60-million homes nationwide via RFD-TV and Phillips' Texas broadcast network. As an extension of his many years in broadcast journalism, Phillips has authored several books -- mostly on Texas travel and cuisine, and serves periodically as a host at Escondida, the Texas Country Reporter Hacienda and Spa, in Central Texas' Hill Country region. He has been a professor of communications at Amberton University for more than 25 years. In 2007, Phillips married KFDM-TV anchor Kelli Lee (now Phillips), who joined him as co-host of Texas Country Reporter in September 2015.

When the hostess tries to throw him out a third time, he shows her that he has money to pay for a meal. Before going to the serving line, he pauses to flirt with the pretty young lady, who promptly throws a drink in his face. He then goes up to the serving line where the chef gives him a taste of everything he has to offer that day. Stan stuffs his face, but shakes his head and tells the chef that he doesn't want any of it. He only wants a cup of coffee.

Early life Born in Chicago, Batts was one of seven children. His father died when Lloyd was 12. His mother was deaf mute, and the state of Illinois decided the brothers and sisters should live with relatives who could better care for them, so Lloyd and two siblings moved to live with an aunt and uncle in a south suburb of Chicago, Illinois. Batts became a star forward for Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois. As a young player in Chicago, he was known as a \\"hang-gliding, super-flying sort of player\\" who was a \\"legend of local playgrounds.\\" He averaged 29 points per game as a junior and 35 as a senior. He was a two-time all-state selection and named the Chicago Sun-Times Player of the Year as a senior. He graduated in 1970 as the Wildcats' all-time leading scorer with more than 1,600 points. In 2012, Batts was inducted into the Illinois High School Basketball Hall of Fame. He has a younger brother, Boyd Batts, who was also a high school basketball star who later played professionally for 15 years in Europe and South America. College career Batts was heavily recruited out of high school and considered attending the University of Cincinnati, Purdue University and Long Beach State. He chose Cincinnati, in large part because former Thornton Township star Jim Ard had just finished a great career there and because it was the alma mater of all-time basketball great Oscar Robertson. As a sophomore in 1971‚Äì72, Batts led the Bearcats in scoring with 18.7 points per game as the team, coached by Tay Baker, posted a 17-9 record. As a junior under new coach Gale Catlett, the Bearcats were again 17-9 and Batts again led the team in scoring with 20.1 points per game and was named third-team All- American by Basketball Weekly. As a senior in 1973‚Äì74, team captain Batts led the Bearcats in scoring for the third season with 21.3 points per game while also leading in assists per game and free throw percentage for the 19-8 team which lost in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT).

Known for much of its length as Midlothian Road, the state highway runs from Shaft Road in Midlothian north to Park Avenue in Frostburg in northwestern Allegany County. MD 736 connects Interstate 68 (I-68) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) with Frostburg State University. The former county highway was relocated when its interchange with I-68 was completed in the mid-1970s. The highway was designated MD 736 in 1998. MD 736 was extended south from I-68 to Shaft Road in 2013. Route description View north from the south end of MD 736 at Shaft Road in Midlothian MD 736 begins at Shaft Road in the village of Midlothian, heading northeast as two-lane undivided Midlothian Road. Past this intersection, Old Legislative Road continues southwest as a county highway toward Midland. The route continues to a diamond interchange with I-68 and US 40 (National Freeway). Two-lane undivided MD 736 heads northeast into the city of Frostburg, becoming Braddock Road at Braddock Street, the old alignment of Midlothian Road. MD 736 passes the Appalachian Laboratory of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science before reaching University Drive, where the campus of Frostburg State University begins to line the southbound direction of the state highway. MD 736 crosses Sand Spring Run before reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with Park Avenue and Bowery Street. Bowery Street is one-way southbound toward the intersection while Park Avenue headed northwest is one-way westbound away from the intersection. History Midlothian Road is a long-time link between Frostburg and Midlothian. In the early 1970s, the county highway was relocated around the highway's interchange with I-68, which was completed around 1974. MD 736 was assigned to Midlothian Road and Braddock Road in 1998. MD 736 was extended south from I-68 to Shaft Road in 2013 when it was determined that section of Midlothian Road was the responsibility of the Maryland State Highway Administration.

Humanist career  Prior to working for the BBC, Vernon was the Press and Public Relations Officer for the British Humanist Association, an organisation with promotes humanism, human rights, and secularism in Britain. In 1965 became the force behind the organisation's drive to seek out a new logo, and launched public competition. The winning entry, the so-called Happy Human, came to stand as an international symbol for Humanism and was adopted by humanist organisations around the world. Vernon's other duties at the BHA included oversight of its various publications. His campaigning work was significant; he is credited with helping secure the decriminalisation of abortion in Britain. The \\"Fat Man\\" series After several years working as a presenter and interviewer for BBC Radio 4, Vernon's first travelogue series was Fat Man On A Bicycle. As the title implied, Vernon was obese and the first episode followed the health tests he had to undergo before setting off on his journey, which took him from Muswell Hill to the Mediterranean coast of southern France. He would repeat this journey fifteen years later for the TV series, Fat Man in France. Fat Man at Work and his first television series, Fat Man in the Kitchen, deviated from the travelogue style of the other series. The former featured Vernon talking to people working in factories, while the latter was a cookery programme filmed in his own kitchen in Muswell Hill in which each edition was devoted to cuisine of a different country.

The observatory is located in Lembang, West Java, approximately north of Bandung. It is situated on a hilly six hectares of land and is above mean sea level plateau. The IAU observatory code for Bosscha is 299. History During the first meeting of the Nederlandsch-Indische Sterrekundige Vereeniging (Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society) in the 1920s, it was agreed that an observatory was needed to study astronomy in the Dutch East Indies. Of all locations in the Indonesia archipelago, a tea plantation in Malabar, a few kilometers north of Bandung in West Java was selected. It is on the hilly north side of the city with a non-obstructed view of the sky and with close access to the city that was planned to become the new capital of the Dutch colony, replacing Batavia (present-day Jakarta). The observatory is named after the tea plantation owner Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha, son of the physicist Johannes Bosscha and a major force in the development of science and technology in the Dutch East Indies, who granted six hectares of his property for the new observatory.Peter Hastings, The Road to Lembang: A Retrospect, 1938-1966, p. 34. Griffith University, Division of Asian and International Studies, Centre for the Study of Australia-Asia Relations, 1990. Construction of the observatory began in 1923 and was completed in 1928. Since then a continuous observation of the sky was made. The first international publication from Bosscha was published in 1922. Observations from Bosscha were halted during World War II and after the war a major reconstruction was necessary. On 17 October 1951, the Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society handed over operation of the observatory to the government of Indonesia. In 1959 the observatory's operation was given to the Institut Teknologi Bandung and has been an integral part of the research and formal education of astronomy in Indonesia. Facilities Five large telescopes were installed in Bosscha: # The Zeiss double refractor #:This telescope is mainly used to observe visual binary stars, conduct photometric studies on eclipsing binaries, image lunar craters, observe planets (Mars, Saturn and Jupiter) and to observe comet details and other heavy bodies. The telescope has two objective lenses with a diameter of each and a focal length of . # The Schmidt telescope (nicknamed: Bima Sakti telescope) #: This telescope is used to study galactic structure, stellar spectra, asteroid studies, supernovae, and to photograph heavy bodies. The main lens diameter is , the correcting bi-concave and convex lens is with a focal length of . It is also equipped with a spectral prism with a prime angle of 6.10 degrees for stellar spectra, a wedge sensitometer and a film recorder. # The Bamberg refractor #: This telescope is used to determine stellar magnitude, stellar distance, and photometric studies of eclipsing stars, solar imaging, and others. It is equipped with a photoelectric photometer, has a lens diameter with meter of focal length. # The Cassegrain GOTO #: This was a gift from the Japanese government. This computer controlled telescope can automatically view objects from a database and this was the first digital telescope at Bosscha. The telescope is also equipped with a photometer and spectrometer-spectrograph. # The Unitron refractor #: This telescope is used for observing hilal, lunar eclipse, solar eclipse and sunspot photography, and also other objects.

Freya served in the German fleet for the initial years of her career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a modernization in 1905-1907, Freya was used as a school ship for cadets. At the outbreak of World War I, Freya was mobilized into V Scouting Group, but served in front- line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921. Design Line-drawing of the Victoria Louise class In the early 1890s, elements in the German naval command structure grappled with what type of cruiser ought to be built to fulfill the various needs of the fleet.

Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Niclausse boilers. Her engines were rated for , and provided a top speed of . The ship had a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 31 officers and 446 enlisted men. The ship was armed with two 21 cm SK L/40 guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58 rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of . Vineta also carried eight 15 cm SK L/40 guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates. These guns had a range of . She also carried ten 8.8 cm SK L/35 naval guns. The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns. She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline. In 1916, all of the ships of the class were disarmed, with the exception of Freya, which was re-equipped with a single 15 cm gun, four 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns, and fourteen 8.8 cm guns of both the L/30 and L/35 versions, for use as a gunnery training ship. The ship was protected with Krupp armor; their deck was on the horizontal with sloped sides that were thick. Her main and secondary battery turrets had 10 cm thick sides and the secondary casemates had the same level of protection. The conning tower had 15 cm thick sides. Service history Illustration of Freya Freya was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1895. She was launched on 27 April 1897, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 20 October 1898. After her commissioning, Freya served with the German fleet. On 1 September 1902, Freya joined the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet. The Division consisted of the armored cruiser , the flagship, , and the light cruisers , , and . The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August-September 1902. In 1905, Freya went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization. During the refit she was re-boilered; she had been built originally with three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished in 1907, after which Freya was used as a training ship for naval cadets. In 1907, G√ºnther L√ºtjens served aboard the ship as a cadet; L√ºtjens went on to command the task force composed of and in World War II. In August 1908, Freya represented Germany at celebrations in Halifax, Canada, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Canadian Parliament. While entering the port at around midnight on 9 August, she inadvertently rammed a schooner in heavy fog. Nine sailors were killed in the accident. Freya had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into V Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and returned to service as a training ship based in Flensburg. She served in this capacity through to the end of the war. In 1915, Bernhard Rogge, who would go on to command the raider Atlantis during World War II, served aboard the ship as a cadet. The old aviso became Freyas tender starting in July 1915. She was stricken on 25 January 1920 and used briefly as a barracks ship for police in Hamburg. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in Harburg in 1921.

He was actively involved in the post World War II struggle for land reform and against the Mafia in Sicily. He labelled the large estate (the latifondo) Sicily's central problem. Political activist Li Causi was born in Termini Imerese, a town in the province of Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily. The son of a shoemaker, he graduated with an economics degree from the University of Venice in northern Italy. As a student he joined the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano, PSI).Lane, Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, p. 571 Forced to leave Venice by the Fascists after Mussolini‚Äôs March on Rome in October 1922, he went to Rome and then Milan, where he helped organise the Third Internationalist‚Äô faction of the PSI. In the summer of 1924 he adhered to the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano, PCI). He was part of the editorial staff of the Communist newspaper l'Unit√† and the magazine Pagine rosse. Biografie Assamblea costituente After the failed assassination attempt on the fascist prime minister Benito Mussolini in September 1926, the PCI was outlawed and the publication of l'Unit√† suppressed. A clandestine edition resumed on the first day of 1927 in which Li Causi was actively involved. L‚ÄôUnit√†, storia di un quotidiano antifascista Resisting fascism Li Causi became the PCI interregional secretary in Piedmont and Liguria, where he succeeded in producing clandestine copies of L‚ÄôUnit√† and in helping organise rice workers‚Äô strikes in Piedmont. He fled to Paris in mid-1927, but was arrested on May 10, 1928 in Pisa, during one of his clandestine return trips. Li Causi was sentenced to 20 years and nine months in prison. In 1937, as the result of a political amnesty, he was released from prison and banished to the penal colony on the island of Ponza. When Mussolini was forced to resign on July 25, 1943, Li Causi stayed in the penal colony on the island of Ventotene, 40 kilometres to the east of Ponza. After his release, he went north to join the resistance against the German occupation and remaining Italian fascists. Li Causi, l‚Äôuomo che denunci√≤ al mondo Portella, Liberazione, May 1, 2007 He was the PCI representative on the National Liberation Committee for Upper Italy in Milan, active in producing L‚ÄôUnit√† clandestinely and in organising the resistance. Li Causi became a member of the national directorate of the PCI that was reinstated on August 29, 1943, in Rome. I Centenari CGIL Back to Sicily The PCI directorate sent Li Causi to Sicily reinforce the party with an experienced leader. He arrived in Palermo on August 10, 1944. Il ¬´battesimo del fuoco¬ª di Li Causi, La Sicilia, June 24, 2007 Although the PCI ‚Äì traditionally weak in Sicily ‚Äì included a separatist faction, Li Causi led the Communists to a strong anti-separatist stance, and by late 1944, Communists and separatists were doing battle in the streets. in The Italian American Review, Volume 7, Number 1 (Spring/Summer 1999) Li Causi‚Äôs arrival in Sicily marked a change in Communist fortunes on the island. He worked to curb dissension, prevent violence, and block Sicilian separatism, while supporting autonomy. Li Causi believed that Sicilians would benefit from autonomy. Separatism, which represented a \\"vague sentimental attitude\\" that the island‚Äôs reactionaries supported, would only cause harm. Li Causi became the main rival of separatist leader Finocchiaro Aprile and the most consistent enemy of separatism.Finkelstein, Separatism, the Allies and the Mafia, p. 74 The Villalba attack Calogero Vizzini, Mafia boss of Villalba On September 16, 1944, Li Causi and the local socialist leader Michele Pantaleone, as leaders of the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, went to speak to the landless labourers at an election rally in Villalba, challenging the Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina ‚Äì a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor ‚Äì angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.Finkelstein, Separatism, the Allies and the Mafia, p. 95-97 The rally began in late afternoon. Vizzini had agreed to permit the meeting and assured them there would be no trouble as long as local issues, land problems, the large estates, or the Mafia were not addressed. Both speakers who preceded Li Causi, among whom Pantaleone, followed Vizzini‚Äôs commands. Li Causi did not. He denounced the unjust exploitation by the Mafia, and when Li Causi started to talk about how the peasants were being deceived by 'a powerful leaseholder' ‚Äì a thinly disguised reference to Vizzini ‚Äì the Mafia boss hurled: It‚Äôs a lie. Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone., preface of Carlo Levi in Michele Pantaleone, Mafia e politica 1943-1962, Turin: Einaudi, 1962)Servadio, Mafioso, p. 99Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 245-48 Always the Communist ready to educate the proletariat, Li Causi hurled at one of the peasant attackers: \\"Why are you shooting, who are you shooting at? Can‚Äôt you see that you're shooting at yourself?\\"Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 190 (Don Cal√≤ and his bodyguard were accused of attempted manslaughter. The trial dragged on until 1958, but by 1946 the evidence had already disappeared. Vizzini was never convicted because by the time of the verdict he was already dead. Election surprise The Villalba attack inaugurated a long series of Mafia attacks in Sicily on political activists, trade union leaders and ordinary peasants resisting Mafia rule and claiming land titles. In the following years many left-wing leaders were killed or otherwise attacked. On April 20‚Äì21, 1947, the Blocco del popolo ‚Äì a coalition of the communist PCI and socialist PSI ‚Äì won a surprise victory in the elections for the Constituent Assembly of the autonomous region of Sicily. The Blocco obtained 29 percent of the vote, while the (Christian Democracy) got 20.5% and the Common Man-Monarchist bloc came third with 14%. Li Causi furnished an explanation for the success of the left-wing block: Portella della Ginestra massacre Mural of the Portella della Ginestra massacre Twelve days after the left-wing election victory, the May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra was attacked, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty. The attack was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano, intending to capture Li Causi. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the Portella di Ginestra massacre and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders. The massacre created a national scandal., Time, May 12, 1947 The Communist-controlled Italian General Confederation of Labour called a general strike in protest against the massacre. The Minister of the Interior, the Christian Democrat Mario Scelba, reported to Parliament the next day that so far as the police could determine, the Portella della Ginestra shooting was non-political. Scelba claimed that bandits notoriously infested the valley in which it occurred. Li Causi disagreed and charged that the Mafia had perpetrated the attack, in cahoots with the large landowners, monarchists and the rightist Common Man's Front. The debate ended in a fist fight between the left and the right. Nearly 200 deputies took part in the brawl. Denouncing the massacre Girolamo Li Causi addressing a commemorative meeting in Portella della Ginestra Li Causi and Scelba would be the main opponents in the aftermath of the massacre and the successive killing of the alleged perpetrator, the bandit Salvatore Giuliano, and the trial against Gaspare Pisciotta and other remaining members of Giuliano‚Äôs gang. While Scelba dismissed any political motive, Li Causi stressed the political nature of the massacre ‚Äì and tried to uncover the truth. Li Causi claimed that the police inspector Ettore Messana ‚Äì supposed to coordinate the prosecution of the bandits ‚Äì had been in league with Giuliano and denounced Scelba for allowing Messana to remain in office. Later documents would prove the accusation.Servadio, Mafioso, p. 128-29 Li Causi suspected a campaign against the left and linked it with the crisis in the national government (under Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi), which would lead to the expulsion of the communists and socialist from government, as well as to prevent the left from entering the regional government. On May 30, 1947, Giuseppe Alessi, became the first president of the Sicilian region with the support of the centre right and the same day De Gasperi announced his new centrist government, who had been in the national union governments since 1945. Santino, La strage di Portella, la democrazia bloccata e il doppio stato Challenging Giuliano Minister of the Interior Mario Scelba in 1947 Speaking at Portella della Ginestra on the second anniversary of the massacre, Li Causi publicly called on Giuliano to name names. He received a written reply from the bandit leader: \\"It is only men with no shame who gives out names. Not a man who tends to take justice into his own hands; who aims to keep his reputation in society high, and who values this aim more than his own life.\\" Li Causi responded by reminding Giuliano that he would almost certainly be betrayed: \\"Don‚Äôt you understand that Scelba will have you killed.\\" Giuliano again replied, hinting at the powerful secrets that he possessed: \\"I know that Scelba wants to have me killed; he wants to have me killed because I keep a nightmare hanging over him.

In Parliament Palmiro Togliatti and Girolamo Li Causi in 1960 Li Causi was a member of the Italian Constituent Assembly in 1946 and a Senator from 1948‚Äì53 and 1968‚Äì74, as well as national deputy in 1953-68 and vice-president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1958-63. While in Parliament he was largely responsible for setting up a parliamentary commission of enquiry into the Mafia, and was vice-president of the Antimafia Commission from 1963-1972. In an interview in the 1970s he said about the changes in the Mafia: Although a prominent Communist leader, his career was thwarted by Palmiro Togliatti, the leader of the PCI. Togliatti underestimated the problem of the Mafia, or rather, ignored it. He also did not want to antagonize the Christian Democrats, looking for a historic compromise. Togliatti preferred to avoid that Sicily became a source of irreparable confrontation between the Communists and Christian Democrats, whose Sicilian notables were sometimes contiguous to the Mafia, and some of whom also had responsibilities on a national scale. Togliatti did not hesitate to replace Li Causi as regional secretary of the Party in the late 1950s, at a time in which Mafia rule increased not only in rural areas but also in cities, starting from Palermo. Valeva la pena di conoscerli. Girolamo Li Causi, Notizie radicali, January 12, 2010 Li Causi remained an important parliamentary leader at the national level. He died in Rome on April 14, 1977. A year before he died he typically fought his last legal battle. He denounced the responsibility of Giovanni Gioia ‚Äì at the time the regional secretary of the Christian Democrats in Sicily ‚Äì in the murder of Pasquale Almerico, the young secretary of the DC in Camporeale who had opposed the entrance of Mafia boss Vanni Sacco in the DC. He also accused another Christian Democrat politician, Vito Ciancimino, of being the center of a web of business and Mafia in Palermo administered by the DC. He was sued for libel by both. He showed up in court. He spoke at length and was acquitted in both cases.

The road is all two-lanes and it passes through farmland, residential and commercial properties. SR 106 was first designated as a state road in the 1980s. The highway replaced US 6 designation of the highway which dated back to the 1930s. Route description SR 106 heads east from its western terminus at US 6 west of Bremen. The highway passes through rural farmland as a two-lane highway. At Miami Trail the roadway turns southeast, before turning northeast at Plymouth Goshen Trail. East of Plymouth Goshen Trail, SR 106 becomes concurrent with Plymouth Street. The highway enters Bremen at Industrial Drive, passing through commercial properties. Between Hope Boulevard and Birkey Street, Plymouth Street curves due east and enters downtown Bremen. In downtown Bremen the street has a traffic light at the western end of the SR 331 concurrency. The concurrency heads east leaving downtown Bremen and passing through residential properties, on the east side of Bremen. SR 106 leaves SR 331 heading north, concurrent with Douglas Road. The road enters commercial properties and passes under the CSX Railroad tracks. After the railroad tracks the highway curves northeast towards US 6\\\\. The highway leaves Bremen and enters rural farmland, before its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 6. No part of SR 106 is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other State Roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 2,190 vehicles and 230 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between the western terminus at US 6 and Plymouth Goshen Trail. The peak traffic volumes were 8,670 vehicles and 590 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 106 that is between Liberty Drive and Bowen Avenue (SR 331 north).  History  In 1932, US 6 was under construction through the town of Bremen, on what later became SR 106. By 1989, US 6 was moved onto a bypass of Bremen passing around the north and west side of town.

He was also the co-founder and proprietor of South Bear School (1970-) by which he imparted to students (many of whom have since become accomplished potters) a tradition of functional studio pottery that originated as early as the Middle Ages, and of which an impassioned revival occurred in 1919 at the Bauhaus in Weimar. Background Schwarz was born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a city with historical links to Regionalist painter Grant Wood. The son of a welder, his initial interests were in athletics, but as an undergraduate student at Iowa State Teachers College (now called the University of Northern Iowa), he developed an interest in ceramics, painting and other visual arts, and abruptly changed his major. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960, and a Master of Arts in 1961. In 1960, he married Geraldine Fromm, a writer and literature teacher, with whom he raised six children. In their years together, he and his wife have traveled extensively throughout the world and have often collaborated on books and other projects. While serving in the U.S. Navy in the early 1960s, he used his shore leaves to visit the studios of world famous potters, notably Shoji Hamada in Japan, and Bauhaus-trained Master Potter Marguerite Wildenhain at Pond Farm near Guerneville, California. He studied with Wildenhain at Pond Farm in 1964, then returned there for two additional summers, serving the third year as her teaching associate. In 1968, he also studied with ceramic artist William Daley at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. South Bear School In 1970, while at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa (where he taught from 1964 to 1986), Schwarz co-founded South Bear School, an innovative summer arts school (pottery, painting, poetry, et al.) in a former hospital house in Highlandville, Iowa (population 30), adjacent to a trout stream called South Bear Creek. In 1976, South Bear School was relocated to a wooded rural property outside of Decorah in a vacant 65-room nursing home. Marguerite Wildenhain was a frequent visitor both there and at Luther College. In her later years, she advised new students to study first at South Bear before working with her in California. Ceramic Art Since the 1960s, Schwarz has been primarily known as an innovative ceramic artist, whose output is prolific. His work is represented in numerous private collections, and in the holdings of museums and universities throughout the world, including, among many others, the Museum of Art and Culture (Wuhan, Hubei, China), University of Nottingham (Nottingham, England), Collection of King Olaf (Oslo, Norway), Pottery Museum (Mikawachi, Japan), Burg Giebichenstein (Halle, Germany) and the White House Collection (Washington, D.C.). In recent years, after a back injury, Schwarz has had to restrict his activities in the creation of wheel-thrown pottery. The large pots that he now creates are the collaborative effort of himself and his son, Gunnar Schwarz, in which the latter does the wheel-throwing, while Dean Schwarz designs the pots‚Äô surfaces and applies the glazes. In 2007, their work was featured in a large retrospective exhibition of Schwarz pottery (along with representative works by Marguerite Wildehain), titled Dean and Gunnar Schwarz: Pottery Form and Inherent Expression, at the Gallery of Art at the University of Northern Iowa (Schwarz‚Äôs alma mater). Research interests In 1971, Schwarz was awarded a Fulbright-Hays Research Fellowship to study and teach ceramics in South Korea. At various other times, he has studied traditional pottery in Japan, researched Pre-Columbian pots in Panama, and worked as a restorer with an archaeological dig in Israel. In one of his trips, he met with the aging German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, who had been Wildenhain‚Äôs form master at the Bauhaus, and, in another, he and Geraldine Schwarz interviewed British potter Bernard Leach. These experiences, not unlike his earlier quest to visit the studios of famous potters, reflect his continuing interest in historical sleuthing, especially as it relates, non- exclusively, to the tradition of ceramic art. Related to those inclinations, he and/or Geraldine Schwarz (often in collaboration with others) have written, compiled and sometimes published books having to do with historic issues, both local and international. Among these, for example, are Conversations with the Recent Past (Luther College Press, 1975), a collection of oral history interviews with rural residents in the vicinity of Decorah, Iowa; and Paddled Tails from Tattled Tales: An Autobiography of a Family (South Bear Press, 2001), consisting of archival photographs and oral history interviews of their own family members. South Bear Press In the late 1970s, the Schwarz family launched a small book company called South Bear Press, the first consequence of which was the publication of the third and final book authored by Marguerite Wildenhain, titled ‚Ä¶That We Look and See: An Admirer Looks at the Indians, edited by John Nellermoe and Dean Schwarz (South Bear Press, 1979). In 2004, nearly twenty years after Wildenhain‚Äôs death, they produced a second volume pertaining to her life, titled Marguerite A Diary to Franz Wildenhain, edited by Dean Schwarz, consisting of her diary-like letters (never posted) to her husband, Bauhaus potter Franz Wildenhain, during their wartime separation in 1940, when his whereabouts were unknown. More recently, in 2007, after more than a decade of research in Europe, UK and the US, Dean and Geraldine Schwarz compiled and edited a large format, 770-page anthology on the history and legacy of the German pottery tradition, titled Marguerite Wildenhain and the Bauhaus: An Eyewitness Anthology (South Bear Press). In this volume are essays, memoirs, diaries, letters, interviews and other written documents by or about such Bauhaus- or crafts-related persons as Josef Albers, Ruth Asawa, Theodor Bogler, Lyonel Feininger, Walter Gropius, Trude Guermonprez, Shoji Hamada, Bernard Leach, Otto Lindig, Gerhard Marcks, Daniel Rhodes, Peter Voulkos and Frans Wildenhain. In 2009, coincident with the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus, Dean and Geraldine Schwarz published an essay in book form titled Centering Bauhaus Clay: A Potter's Perspective (South Bear Press).

The western portion of SR 110 is just under long and connects SR 10 with U.S. Route 231 (US 231) in Jasper County. The eastern portion runs along the border between Fulton County and Marshall County; it is approximately long and connects SR 17 at the west end with SR 25 at the east end. Neither segment passes through any towns or cities and passes through mostly rural agriculture land. The SR 110 designation was first used in the early 1940s along the modern route of SR 110 in Jasper County. The eastern segment was added by the mid-1940s, running between SR 17 and US 31. The eastern terminus became SR 25 by the mid-1950s and the entire roadway was paved by the mid-1960s. Route description =Western segment= The western segment of SR 110 begins at an intersection with SR 10 and SR 110 head east passing through agriculture land. The road has an intersection with a county road before an intersection with US 231. The SR 110 designation ends at US 231 but the roadway continues east as a county road. The highest traffic count for the western segment of SR 110 in 2015 was at its western end, where 4,299 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.

SR 110 heads east along the Fulton-Marshall county line having an intersection with the southern end of SR 117. The road continues east passing through farmland, before an intersection with US 31. The road crosses a railroad track, while the landscape along the road become more woodland. SR 110 crosses over the Tippecanoe River before bending southeast off of the county line and into Fulton County. In Fulton County SR 110 ends at an intersection with SR 25, just west of an intersection between SR 25 and SR 331.

Ameerpet is also a Mandal in Hyderabad District. The locality shares its borders with Sardar Patel Road and the National Highway 65. Though consisting of vacant plots till a few years back, the area is now bustling with some commercial and residential establishments. Popular areas located close to Ameerpet include Panjagutta, Banjara Hills, Begumpet, Sanath Nagar, and Somajiguda. Until the early 90s, the area mostly consisted of vacant plots, Jagirdar lands, Nawabs Houses, Estates and roadside restaurants to serve the traffic along NH9 to Bombay. Commercial activity first shifted here from the center of the city in the 1990s with the expansion of the northern suburbs of Hyderabad due to ongoing construction activity in the area and its surrounding areas. Today it is a bustling locality with several commercial establishments along with high pedestrian and vehicular traffic. History The land was gifted by then Nizam of Hyderabad to one of his Jagirdars named Amir Ali in the early 1900s. He built a small palace as his summer home and used the area as a summer resort since it was densely vegetated and had a pleasant climate and also water bodies.Ameerpet: Busiest and commercially diverse This palace now houses the \\"Nature Cure Hospital\\". The third observatory of India called the \\"Nizamia Observatory\\" was set up here in Ameerpet by the Nizams. In 1908, Nawab Zafar Jung studied astronomy in England and he returned to Hyderabad along with two telescopes and an expert, whom he promised a net salary of Osmania Sikka Rupees 1500 per month. He offered the telescopes to the Nizam, who ordered the installation of the telescopes at Ameerpet, where they remained for the next 50 years. The whole work of the ‚ÄòCarte due Cite‚Äô Hyderabad Section was completed under the direction of T.P. Huascaran, who had published the remaining volumes of the astrographic catalog and this brought the work to a successful conclusion. In 1923, the equatorial telescope by G. Rubb was erected and a Milne-Shaw seismograph was installed for the study of earthquakes and a second machine was added in 1929. A special underground chamber was constructed to house these delicate instruments. In 1928, at the request of the International Astronomical Union, the section of the sky originally allotted to the observatory at Potsdam (Germany) was undertaken by the Nizamia Observatory. The work of measurement and reduction was completed and three volumes were published by the International Astronomical Union. This observatory still stands here as a testimony to the development of Ameerpet. The rest of the land of Ameerpet, after the merger of Hyderabad into Indian Union, was later on passed on to his heirs who sold it in bits and pieces to other Jagirdars, nawabs, and others settlers. Most of these settlers were immigrants from neighboring state Andhra Pradesh and also other states of India namely Rajasthan, UP, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu. The substantial part of the land is still with Nawabs and Jagirdars. The value of land from the early 60s up to late 80s commanded higher prices than posher areas like Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills because of its proximity to Highway and Industrial areas. Commerce Ameerpet is known for its commerce and business of all kinds, but mainly as an education hub.Ameerpet houses hundreds of IT institutes and over one lakh students It has several retail stores and many educational institutions like PAGE, TIME, etc. which help students to get admission into institutes for pursuing higher studies. = Software training hub = Ameerpet is also a well-known destination for software training in India. Students from different parts of the country come to Ameerpet to join software training courses.Ameerpet-Blooming IT Institutes They avail of quality software training at relatively low prices.

Not only from India but even from various other parts of the world also students come to take coaching in software training. A well-known Center for development of advance computing(C-DAC Hyderabad) is located in this area.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Malpas. Its benefice is combined with that of St Alban, Tattenhall. History There has been a church on this site from the 12th century. In a restoration in 1854 by James Harrison all the masonry was removed except for the west tower which had been built in 1512. During the restoration a Norman doorway on the north side of the church was lost, but the hammerbeam roof dated 1661 was retained. A chancel and vestry were added in 1891. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in ashlar red sandstone with a Welsh slate roof. Its plan consists of west tower, a three-bay nave, a one-bay chancel, a vestry, and a south porch. The tower has three stages and corner buttresses. An inscription on its south wall records its building in 1512. It has a west door above which is a three-light window with empty niches on each side. The belfry windows have three lights, the top of the tower is embattled, it has gargoyles, and the string course includes carved heads. =Interior= The nave has a hammerbeam roof with \\"excellent scrolled carved corbels\\". On the north side of the church is a stained glass window by William Wailes. The 17th-century font is octagonal in red sandstone and the parish chest is dated 1677. There is a ring of six bells, the oldest three dating from around 1512, from 1615 and from 1682. A bell from 1709 was cast by Rudhall of Gloucester and the remaining two bells were cast in 1906 by John Taylor and Company. The parish registers begin in 1570 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1710.

Route description Interstate 90 enters South Dakota in Lawrence County as a four-lane divided highway. It enters concurrently with U.S. Route 14, and passes through the town of Spearfish, where it shares another concurrency with U.S. Route 85 from exit 10 to exit 17. From there it passes several miles north and east of the tourist town of Deadwood before entering Meade County, going just to the west of Sturgis. Another concurrency is with South Dakota Highway 34 from exit 23 at Whitewood to exit 30, the west exit of Sturgis, where there starts a concurrency with SD 79. The freeway generally passes along the north and east edges of the Black Hills. The route then enters Pennington County, where it passes through the northern edge of Rapid City, gateway to the Black Hills and the nearest passing to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, as well as other scenic attractions including Custer State Park and the Needles Highway. Rapid City is also where the interstate has its westernmost auxiliary route, Interstate 190, which links the interstate to the western edge of the downtown area. SD 79's concurrency ends at exit 61 on the east side of the city. From Rapid City, the route heads east, passing between Box Elder to the south and Ellsworth Air Force Base to the north before heading towards Wall on to Jackson County. Exits 110 and 131 for Badlands National Park to the south (SD 240) are within either way of the county line. The concurrency for US-14 ends at exit 112 just east of Wall; here US-14 runs due east and will connect to the city of Philip and the capital city of Pierre. The Lake Francis Case portion of the Missouri River viewed from a rest stop just south of Chamberlain; the pre-interstate Chamberlain Bridge is in the center. From there, the route passes mostly east‚Äìwest through Jackson and Jones counties. There are short concurrencies with SD 73 (from the west entering Kadoka) and SD 63 in Jackson County. Interstate 90 crosses the Central Time/Mountain Time Zone boundary on the west edge of Jones County. Then at Murdo, a concurrency begins with U.S. Route 83 at exit 192 and continues to exit 212. It is in Lyman County, at exit 212 in Vivian, that the highway provides its closest link to the capital of Pierre, along US-83, some north. The road crosses the Missouri River at Lake Francis Case, between the towns of Oacoma and Chamberlain, also crossing into Brule County. I-90 Business Loop runs from exit 260 at Oacoma to downtown Chamberlain across the Missouri River on the nearby Chamberlain Bridge, and returns to I-90 at exit 265. Beginning there is a short concurrency with SD 50 heading to Pukwana, and also in Brule County is another short concurrency with SD 45 starting at Kimball. I-90 then continues through Aurora County (connecting to White Lake and Plankinton), Davison County (where Mt. Vernon, Mitchell and the Corn Palace are located), Hanson County (Alexandria), and McCook County (Salem). Then comes the state's most populous county, Minnehaha. After passing the communities of Humboldt and Hartford, the interstate intersects the only other major interstate in the state, Interstate 29, at Sioux Falls, the largest city. Just east of Interstate 29 is where Interstate 90 meets the northern terminus of Interstate 229. East of Brandon and northeast of Valley Springs, it then ends its trip through South Dakota of before entering Minnesota and Rock County, just west of the towns of Beaver Creek and Manley. Since April 2015 the speed limit is , except it is between I-229 and Marion Road in Sioux Falls; or through Rapid City. The speed limit remains between Rapid City and the Wyoming state line. =Codified law= The South Dakota section of I-90 is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws ¬ß 31-4-184. History I-90 was constructed in the 1970s. The four-lane interstate replaced old highway 16 as the main road connecting Rapid City and Sioux Falls. Much of Old 16 remains intact, however I-90 has absorbed sections and likewise has reshaped the economies of many southern South Dakota towns. On May 24, 2012, the South Dakota Transportation Commission declared the entire length of I-90 as part of the National Purple Heart Trail, naming it the Purple Heart Memorial Highway. =Removal of exit 66= In the city of Box Elder, exit 66, which crossed South Dakota Highway 435, was closed on October 1, 2003, after a 10-month delay. The exit was closed and removed as a result of the department of transportation's efforts to move traffic away from a potential crash site at the end of the Ellsworth AFB runway. The partial cloverleaf interchange of exit 66 was also demolished shortly thereafter. Exit 67, which was constructed not too long before the closure of exit 66, is now used as the main entrance and exit feeder to the base, and it is less likely to be impacted by a potential crash. Local citizens and officials feared the lack of entrances which access the Ellsworth Air Force Base would cause traffic issues, and moving businesses from near the old exit would cause some to close and affect tax revenue. Land near exit 66 began to be purchased in 2004, including the former McDonald's property.

Owing to its small size, a runt in a litter faces obvious disadvantage, including difficulties in competing with its siblings for survival and possible rejection by its mother. Therefore, in the wild, a runt is less likely to survive infancy. Even among domestic animals, runts often face rejection. They may be placed under the direct care of an experienced animal breeder, although the animal's size and weakness coupled with the lack of natural parental care make this difficult. Some tamed animals are the result of reared runts. Despite popular belief, not all litters have runts. All animals in a litter will naturally vary slightly in size and weight, but the smallest should not be considered a \\"runt\\" if it is healthy and close in weight to its littermates. It may be perfectly capable of competing with its siblings for nutrition and other resources. A runt is specifically an animal who suffered in utero from deprivation of nutrients by comparison to its siblings, or from a genetic defect, and thus is born underdeveloped or less fit than expected.

The narratives of many Clifford stories work on the advantages and disadvantages of his colossal size. * Goliath II, in the Disney film of the same name, was a runt elephant. Hardly bigger than a mouse, he was an embarrassment to his father, Goliath I, who was a giant, and resented by the other elephants of the pack who had to avoid stepping on him. He redeemed himself when he proved to be unafraid of a mouse. *Ruth, the hero Pernese dragonnet from Anne McCaffrey's novel The White Dragon, is a runt whose egg is smaller and has a harder shell than all others in the clutch. He would have died save for the intervention of young Jaxom. * Jock was the runt of a litter of Staffordshire Bull Terriers who was saved from drowning by Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, who later wrote about his life with the dog in Jock of the Bushveld. * Cadpig, a female Dalmatian puppy in Dodie Smith's children's novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians, is the runt of her litter.

And in the live-action Disney film, Cadpig is still a female aptly named \\"Two-Tone\\". The animated television series, however, does include Cadpig, though she is a separate character from Lucky. * Babe, the eponymous piglet hero of Dick King- Smith's book (and the popular film based on the novel), is a runt. In fact, he was chosen for the competition at which Farmer Hoggett won him essentially because he was a runt - his runt status therefore saving his life and shaping his destiny. * Scourge from the Warriors book series was a runt. * The title character from the novel Runt, as the name implies, is the smallest of his wolf litter. *The dire wolf Ghost in HBO's adaptation of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series was the runt of his litter of six pups, as well as an albino.

Gylling was appointed the director (Vice Director ‚Äî S. A. Makaryev). KRI was set up to comprise 6 structural units for: #forestry and forest industry #natural productive forces #agriculture #socio-economic #history and revolution #ethnography and linguistics The units were later on reinforced and enlarged, Kivach Strict Nature Reserve, Petrozavodsk and Louhi mire research stations were added to KRI structure. In the very first year of KRI operation, 19 expeditions and field trips were organized. Owing to systematic sampling and collecting work highly valuable field materials were detected and preserved, and the baseline for scientific research was enriched. The first KRI scientific session took place in April 1932, with over 40 presentations delivered there. One of the biggest problems for the Institute was the shortage of human resources with relevant qualifications and experience. A wide practice was to invite scholars from Leningrad and Moscow. KRI presidium was set up, made up of 93 members, including some most prominent scientists of the USSR ‚Äî N. Ya. Marr, I. I. Meshchaninov, A. E. Fersman, N. M. Druzhinin, M. K. Azadovsky, D. V. Bubrikh, A. Ya. Bryusov, V. I. Ravdonikas, and others. =Karelian Research Institute of Culture (KRIC)= On 11.01.1937 the resolution was adopted transforming KRI into the Karelian Research Institute of Culture (KRIC), where only the humanities were retained. Further redundancies and closing of structural units followed. Units of the natural sciences, technical and economic profiles were transferred to corresponding governmental authorities, and the rest were either partially or totally disposed of. In this period the institute studied the history of Karelia, its culture, languages and folk poetry (Russian and Karelian folklore). In 1937‚Äî1938 political repressions affected the institute's staff even more, and dismissals continued. The institute's vice director S. A. Makaryev, leading specialists E. A. Haapalainen, N. V. Khrisanfov, N. N. Vinogradov, director of the library E. P. Oshevenskaya were arrested and executed on false accusations of setting up an espionage and rebel nationalist organization at the institute. When the Karelian-Finnish Republic was founded in 1940 it was announced that KRIC needs to be transformed into the regional branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences (AS), but World War II impeded the realization of this intention. During the war, the institute's archives were moved deeper into the country, and KRIC itself was evacuated to Syktyvkar (Komi ASSR), where the institute's activities were temporarily halted in 1942 and resumed in 1943. In the summer of 1944, after the liberation of Petrozavodsk, KRIC was moved back. In 1945 the idea of reform re-surfaced, and the first step was the transformation of KRIC into the Institute of History, Linguistics and Literature (HLL Institute) made up of three sections (departments): of history, linguistics, literature & folk art. HLL Institute was comprised in the Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS. =Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS= On 31.01.1946 the resolution was adopted on the establishment of the Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS. It was made up of the following units (sections): Geology, Hydrology and Water Economy, Soil Science and Botany, Zoology, Industry & Economics, Laboratory of Forest Chemistry, HLL Institute; Kivach Strict Nature Reserve; scientific library and photo laboratory. A. A. Polkanov (1946‚Äî1947) was appointed the director, but had to resign in 1947 because of poor health, ceding the position to I. I. Gorsky (1947‚Äî1952). In 1948 the Industry and Economics Section was split into Economics Section and Laboratory of Non-metalliferous Minerals, and the Forest Laboratory was organized to be transformed into the Forest Section in the following year. Later on, the laboratories of parasitology and animal farming, and the White Sea Biological Research Station were set up. =Karelian-Finnish (Karelian) Branch of the USSR AS= On 6.10.1949 the Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS was reorganized into the Karelian-Finnish Branch of the USSR AS. In 1952 I. I. Syki√§inen (1952‚Äî1957) became its president. The organization carried out research on useful minerals, water and energy resources, economic issues, forestry and forest industry; developed methods for wise use of logging wastes, fish resources of inland waters and the White Sea; continued studies of the history, literature and folk art of Karelia. In 1949‚Äî1951 most of the activities within the Integrated Expedition for the Study of the Productive Forces and Development Potential of Western Karelian Districts were implemented. In 1951 two new departments appeared: for economics and for mire science (including experimental facilities). In 1953 the Institute of Biology, and Departments of Hydrology and Energy were established. As of 1953, the structure of the Karelian-Finnish Branch of the USSR AS was the following: Geology Section; Hydrology and Water Economy Section; Forest Section; Economics Section; Kivach Strict Nature Reserve; Publishing Section; Scientific Library; Archives; Cartography Office; Photo Laboratory, HLL Institute and the Institute of Biology . =Karelian Branch of the USSR AS= In 1956, as the republic changed status from union to autonomous the Karelian- Finnish Branch of the USSR AS was renamed as the Karelian Branch of the USSR AS. The next president after I. I. Syki√§inen was V. S. Slodkevich (1957‚Äî1960), then the position was shortly held by V. P. Dadykin (1960‚Äî1962), who was succeeded by V. I. Yermakov (1962‚Äî1964, 1967). Museum of Precambrian Geology in the Institute of Geology, 2018. Archaeological finds from the mounds of the Oyat River. Museum of Precambrian Geology, 2015. In 1957 there appeared the Forest Research Institute and the White Sea Biological Research Station under the Institute of Biology, and in 1961 the Institute of Geology with Museum of Precambrian Geology. On 21.11.1963 the USSR AS Presidium passed the ordinance ‚ÄúOn the actions in connection with the termination of the operation of the Bashkir, Karelian and Kazan branches of the USSR AS‚Äù. Pursuant to this ordinance the Karelian Branch of the USSR AS stopped operating on 01.01.1964. The only unit retained with the Academy of Sciences was the HLL Institute with the scientific library, archives and cartography office now subordinated to it. The Institute of Biology became an entity with own budget directly subordinated to the Petrozavodsk State University. The Forest Research Institute is renamed as the Karelian Forest Institute and transferred to the authority of the State Committee on Forest, Pulp-and-paper, Woodworking Industry and Forestry subordinated to the USSR Gosplan, and the Institute of Geology becomes subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Geology. On 18.02.1967 the USSR Council of Ministers adopted the Resolution ‚ÄúOn reinstitution of the Karelian Branch of the USSR AS‚Äù. The Karelian Branch of the USSR AS was reassembled to comprise the Institutes of Geology, Forest Research, Biology, HLL, Departments of Hydrology and Water Economy, Economics. Having resumed its activities the Karelian Branch of the USSR AS was developing successfully relying on previous experience. The first president after the reinstitution was N. I. Pjavchenko (1968‚Äî1976). Leadership after N. I. Pjavchenko was ceded to scientists working at the Karelian Branch: first V. A. Sokolov (1976‚Äî1986) and then I. M. Nesterenko (1987‚Äî1991). =Karelian Research Centre RAS= In 1990 the Karelian Branch of the USSR AS was transformed into the Karelian Research Centre of the USSR AS, and in 1991 it was renamed as the Karelian Research Centre RAS. A. F. Titov became the new president (1991 onwards). In 1991 the Northern Water Problems Institute was established through transformation from the Water Problems Department. The institutes began transition to legal and financial independence. Institutes of Geology, Northern Water Problems, Forest Research, Department of Mathematics and Data Analysis became legal entities in 1993, Institute of Biology in 1997, and Institutes of HLL and Economics in 1998. New departments were established: Editing and Publishing, Financial and Economic, Maintenance and Procurements, Repair and Construction, Programming Group. In 1996 the Department of Economics was transformed into the Institute of Economics. In 1999 the Department of Mathematics and Data Analysis was reorganized into the Institute of Applied Mathematical Research. The process of transforming KarRC RAS departments into institutes and legal entities was thus completed. Staff reduction and aging, social insecurity of scientists were progressing, the prestige of science in Russia was declining. Russian science was underfinanced. Fund-raising had to be activated to win grants, contracts, etc. KarRC RAS enlarged the number of its interdisciplinary programmes and projects, widened partnerships with various organizations and institutions in Karelia, Russia and other countries. It managed to improve the working environment for some auxiliary units and services. The main outcome of the last decade of the 20th century is probably the fact that despite all the hardships academic science had gone through KarRC RAS has managed to preserve the bulk of its human and scientific resources, gradually adapted to the new circumstances without compromising much of the amount and quality of its scientific products, and generated a solid background for future development. Funding still remained the main challenge, being mostly received from the federal budget but in amounts clearly insufficient for normal operation. Search for additional sources has become constant. KarRC RAS governance =General Assembly= The supreme governing body of KarRC RAS is the General Assembly, chaired by KarRC RAS President. The main functions and tasks of the General Assembly are to: *consider and adopt KarRC RAS Charter, additions and amendments to the Charter *plan for the KarRC RAS development concept *hear and endorse the annual report on KarRC RAS activities *elect KarRC RAS President, Vice-Presidents, Chief Secretary for Science, members of KarRC RAS Presidium, and submit the nominations to RAS Presidium to be endorsed. =Presidium= KarRC RAS Presidium is in charge of the current activities; its members are: the President, Vice-Presidents, Chief Secretary for Science, and KarRC RAS leading scientists (elected by the KarRC RAS General Assembly).

The Library was founded in 1946 to serve scientists working at the Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS. Its first director was S. P. Guima (1946‚Äî1953). In the following 19 years the library was headed by V. N. Yakovleva (1953‚Äî1972). In the 1970s, when the Library for Natural Sciences (LNS) was being established, KarRC RAS Scientific Library was also included in the RAS LNS centralized library system. For many years (1972‚Äî1992) the Scientific Library was headed by O. G. Satsuk. The main priority for the library was to supply KarRC RAS scientists with as much as possible relevant information from abroad. International book exchange was arranged through the USSR AS Library. In the 1970s the library got the chance to be included in the Interlibrary Loan (ILL) system to order literature from other libraries. A regular activity was the exhibitions of new arrivals to ease and expedite access to the books. Literature exhibitions have accompanied all large scientific conferences, symposia and seminars. Since 1954, the catalogue of publications by KarRC RAS staff has been maintained. In 1995 computerization of the library began, and the electronic catalogue was established based on computer technology. The electronic catalogue includes information on books and other types of documents in Russian and other languages in stock at KarRC RAS Scientific Library. Bibliographic entries are formatted according to RUSMARC. The electronic catalogue comprises the following databases:Electronic catalogue * Catalogue of articles (since 2003) ‚Äî bibliographic entries for articles from collected volumes, journals and newspapers acquired by the library since 2003 (partially also earlier) * Publications by KarRC RAS staff (since 1987) ‚Äî bibliographic entries for publications by KarRC RAS staff available at the Scientific Library * Summaries of PhD theses ‚Äî summaries of PhD and DSc theses received by the Scientific Library; * Local lore catalogue (since 1987) * Journal articles since 2003 (ordered through EDD) - bibliographic entries for journal articles since 2003 missing from KarRC RAS Scientific Library stock * Journals (since 1996) ‚Äì bibliographic entries and availability information on Russian-language journals since 1996 With the Internet on stage, bringing the possibility to use RAS LNS e-resources, libraries of the LNS network gained access to full- text journal versions of foreign publishers ‚Äî Elsevier, Springer, Kluwer, Blackwel, Academic Press, etc. KarRC RAS Scientific Library jumped at this opportunity and logged on to eLIBRARY.ru. KarRC RAS employees gained access to electronic versions of publications. The ‚ÄúElectronic document delivery‚Äù programme offers the library's subscribers the chance to get copies of papers from the stock of other libraries of Karelia and Russia. To preserve and enable access to publications by KarRC RAS staff the ‚ÄòKarRC RAS Repository‚Äô was launched in 2015. The Repository is based on EPrints freeware and is available online.KarRC RAS Repository =Scientific Archives= The constitution of the archives began in 1931 at KRI and continued after its re- organization into KRIC. The archives were made up of general workflow documents and scientific materials on all the institute's research areas. Scientific materials generated by expeditions carried out in Karelia since 1927 by Moscow and Leningrad universities were also submitted to the archives. In one of its resolutions, USSR AS Presidium suggested drawing up the scientific archives as a support unit with permanent staff starting 1952. A substantial part of the records in the Archives are scientific documents portraying the key lines of scientific development in Karelia and the activities of KarRC RAS institutions. The Archives contain a collection of folklore records of the Russian and Finnic nations (Karelian, Finnish, Sami), which are part of Karelia's heritage, as well as collections of 15th-19th cc. hand-written documents portraying the socio-economic relations and daily life of peasants and Pomors, the history of monasteries. The Scientific Archives now continue building up and systematizing their storage, and capacitate utilization of the documents in the activities of KarRC RAS institutes and units. Digital library of 15th-19th cc. hand-written documents Digital libraries with most diverse contents (scientific publications, legislative and regulatory acts, reference materials, archival documents, etc.) have been mushrooming globally. In 2013 a project for the preservation and study of the historical and cultural heritage of the peoples inhabiting the Russian North was launched at the KarRC RAS Scientific Archives. Its primary goal is to secure the preservation of the originals of 15th-19th cc. hand-written documents, and at the same time to enable wide (online) access to them for researchers, digitalize the documents, create the electronic resource for users, and introduce into scientific discourse the set of documents on the history of the stated period, which have not been previously used by historians and remained largely unknown to the general public. The project activities included preparation of scientific descriptions and scanning of hand-written archival documents, including translation of titles from the Old Slavonic to the contemporary Russian language, brief description of the documents, generation of the electronic archive for digital storage of the scanned documents and their retrieval. The repository of the KarRC RAS Scientific Archives was established using the EPrints system. This system permits creating and maintaining repositories with a required structure and set of metadata for storing collections of electronic documents, and provides a ready-make toolkit for filling in the repository and controlling access to its contents. The user interface in the original version of the software is in English, but the set of language options can be expanded, so an add-on to EPrints enabling the Russian language was developed. The digital library of 15th-19th cc. hand-written documents is available online.Digital library of 15th-19th cc. hand-written documents // KarRC RAS Electronic copies of documents can be accessed by registered users; registration is free of charge. =Editorial and Publishing Department= Editorial and Publishing Department of KarRC RAS. Head of department Alexander Seleznev, 2008 The publishing section was established in 1948 to invigorate the organization's publishing activities. S. S. Shleymovich was the first to head it. In 1968, as the amount of publications by the USSR AS Karelian Branch grew substantially, the publishing section was transformed into the Editorial and Publishing Department (EPD). In 1971 the EPD became authorized to publish the journal of proceedings of the Karelian Branch. In 1973 the instant printing shop was set up to publish collected volumes and monographic books without having to engage external book publishers. The number of limited circulation editions (express publication of research results, pre-prints of conference papers and abstracts, etc.) increased remarkably. In 1992 the Editorial and Publishing Department and the instant printing shop were merged into one unit to promote the efficiency of their operation. The time period from manuscript submission to final product became much shorter, the entire publishing process was optimized. A new phase in EPD development started in the 1990s with the onset of the computer era. Technical facilities of the editorial group were updated. Layout and design were computerized. Through renovation of the publishing process the quality of the printed products was notably improved, their volumes enlarged and the preparation and production cycle shortened. The EPD now implements the entire book publishing cycle. The principal concern for the EPD is to produce its editions so that they meet all modern standards. =Patent Department= The department was established in 1976 to enable utilization of the available scientific potential in dealing with practical tasks in Karelia. The high level of practical (applied) developments required that they were legally protected. The first head of the department was G. B. Lavrenenko. The Patent Department coordinates the patent- and license-related activities of KarRC RAS institutes, provides legal, information and advisory/training support to scientific research activities. The Patent Department provides patenting information of relevance for scientific research and developments, takes part in patent search related to KarRC RAS research areas, including retrieval, selection, systematization of patent documentation, evaluation of the technical level of the research object, analysis of the results of patent search. The database of inventions that have been applied in industry, agriculture, forestry and in basic research has been created. The Patent Department works together with scientific units to promote and market the inventions, for instance by preparing them for display at exhibitions and fairs.

Yangjae Stream revived the naturalness of the river by applying the natural method with the goal of restoring Yangjaecheon ecosystem. Yangjaecheon Ecological Park has restored the riverside slope to create a resting and walking space. Concrete revetments were removed and new revetments were constructed using megaliths, trees, grasses and natural materials. These vegetation revetments are safe for floods, and they control the water temperature by creating shade in the riverside. Yanghaecheon provide fish and algae habitats to help maintain the food chain of aquatic ecosystems. It also precipitates and absorbs water and pollutants, easing eutrophication of the material. Tales Related to Yangjaecheon Yangjaecheon has a tale related to Guryongsan. Guryongsan has nine valleys, nine peaks, and nine wells. The name of ‚ÄòGuryong‚Äô is based on nine dragons. The highest peak of nine peaks of Guryong Mountain is called Guksoobong, which means ‚Äòa mountain peak that protects the country.‚Äô There is a story related to Guryongsan. According to the tale, the mountain originally had ten valleys, each dragon in one valley. They had to ascend to the sky, but one was late to ascend and was seen by a person, and couldn‚Äôt ascend. By the means of good conduct for people, he had to be a stream for people to drink and farm. The stream made people wealthier and happier, which was why this stream was later named ‚ÄòYangjaecheon.‚Äô 'Yangjae' is a word written in Chinese characters, which is translated as 'a group of talented people.' Yangjaecheon‚Äôs Development The Yangjaecheon was originally the first tributary of the Han River, which was originally flowed directly in the Han River. However, it was an artificially created river and watershed flow in Tancheon which made because of the development of Han River and its vicinity. In the 1970s, the land consolidation project in the Gaepo- dong area polluted Yangjaecheon by the intensification. After that, the pollution became much worse with the rapid increase of the population. In order to improve the ecological environment of Yangjaecheon, natural river system was applied for the first time in urban river. From 1995 to 2000, it was restored to water quality of more than 2 grade by removing concrete from both shore for and constructing vegetation shore, water purification facility, bicycle road and eco experience center. It was restored as a natural ecological river where people can live together. As a result of these efforts, it was selected by the Ministry of Environment in 2005 as an excellent ecological restoration river.  Geographical Location of Yangjaecheon  Yangjaecheon starts from Gwanaksan(mountain) in Gwacheon. It flows through Gwacheon street and joins with Makgyecheon. In Seocho District, it joins with Yeouicheon. Makgyecheon and Yeouicheon is a small stream that starts from Cheonggyesan. Finally, it flows through Gangnam District and runs into Tancheon. The total length of Yangjaecheon is 15.6 km. Gwacheon manages 8.4 km, Seocho District manages 3.7 km, and Gangnam District manages 3.5 km. The average width of Yangjaecheon is 6~13 m.

The Bhima River, which originates in Bhimashankar of the Western Ghats, and forms the Bhima Valley with its tributary rivers and streams, has twenty-two dams built on it of which the Ujjani Dam is the terminal dam on the river and is the largest in the valley that intercepts a catchment area of (which includes a free catchment of ). The construction of the dam project including the canal system on both banks was started in 1969 at an initial estimated cost of Rs 400 million and when completed in June 1980 the cost incurred was of the order of Rs 3295.85 million. The reservoir created by the high earth cum concrete gravity dam on the Bhima River has a gross storage capacity of . The annual utilization is . The project provides multipurpose benefits of irrigation, hydroelectric power, drinking and industrial water supply and fisheries development. The irrigation supplies benefit of agricultural land, particularly in the Solapur district. Water supplied from the reservoir to irrigate agricultural areas primarily aims to reduce incidence of famines and scarcity during drought conditions. The reservoir operation also lessens threat due floods to cities such as Pandharpur (an important religious pilgrimage centre for the Hindus). As a result of irrigation facilities, some of the important crops grown under irrigated conditions are sugarcane, wheat, millet and cotton. Geography Road over the Bhima Dam The Bhima River on which the Ujjani Dam has been built rises from Bhimashankar hills in the Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri hill range. The river flows for a length of till it meets the Krishna River (one of the two major river systems in Maharashtra, the other being the Godavari River) near Raichur in Raichur district in Karnataka .Bhima River Basin has many tributaries of which the major ones are the Kundali River, Kumandala River, Ghod river, Bhama River, Indrayani River, Mula River, Mutha River, Pavna River, Bori, Sina, Man, Bhogwati and Nira. The total drainage area of of Bhima River basin, an inter state river basin, covers both Maharashtra (75%) and Karnataka (25%) states, out of which drains into the Ujjani Reservoir created by the Ujjani Dam. The Upper Bhima River basin is subdivided into three zones namely northern, middle and southern, the main stem of the river is in the middle zone where the Bhima Dam is built, while the southern zone is dominated by five reservoirs. The basin above the dam has intense rural, agricultural, urban and industrial activities. The river basin, which has a slope from west to east has extreme physiographic and agro- climatic variations. The drainage basin has rich and fertile agricultural land, and several water resources development projects have been built on its river system. Government of Maharashtra has classified the stretches of the Upper Bhima River for the purpose of various uses as, A-I for drinking water without conventional treatment but after disinfection, A-II Drinking water after conventional treatment followed by disinfection, A-III for fish and wildlife propagation and A-IV for agriculture, industrial cooling and process. The dam and the reservoir are approachable from Pune city, which is away. The dam is about upstream of the bridge across the Bhima River on the Pune- Sholapur Road. =Climate= The reservoir as seen from a NASA satellite The basin experiences tropical monsoon climatic conditions. The rainfall is dictated by the southwest monsoon, which varies from (from South to North) near the North‚ÄìSouth trending mountain range of the basin but drastically drops to within a distance of towards the east. The average annual precipitation of the basin above the dam in the Upper Bhima River Basin (UBB) has been assessed as out of which (87%) occurs during the four monsoon months (mid June to mid September). Thereafter, the basin falls under the rain shadow area towards east with rainfall incidence ranging between and is thus under drought conditions quite frequently. Hydrology Based on rainfall data and other characteristics of the basin, the average annual yield of the Upper Bhima River basin has been assessed as . Since the Bhima River which is a major tributary of the Krishna River is an interstate river, the flows are shared by the Upper riparian state of Maharashtra with the lower riparian Karnataka state. The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, in its award in the year 1976 permitted Maharashtra to use only from the Upper Bhima River Basin. The Bhima or Ujjani dam has planned annual utilization of (including evaporation losses). Features Gate Controlled Spillway of Bhima or Ujjani Dam The Ujjani Dam commissioned in June 1980 is an earth cum concrete masonry dam, which has created a multipurpose reservoir. The total length of the dam is , which comprises a central portion which is the spillway dam of length, of concrete gravity section of (maximum height above the deepest foundation level). The spillway is flanked by Non Overflow (NOF) concrete gravity dams of length. Earth dam sections flank the NOF dams on the left and right banks. The volume content of the dams is . The gross storage capacity created is at the Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of . The spillway, structure has an Ogee shaped downstream slope designed to dispose a design flood discharge of (the maximum probable flood discharge of and a breaching section is provided between the NOF block and the earth dam section, controlled by 41 radial gates of x size erected over the crest of the dam. In addition, four river sluices (gate controlled) are also provided in the body of the spillway pier numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 with outlet level at , with each sluice designed for a discharge capacity of for silt flushing. The energy dissipation arrangements on the downstream slope of the spillway is in the form of high level and low level slotted roller bucket type. Measuring instruments have been installed in the body of the dam to record and analyse various parameters related to the behaviour of the dam over the years as part of the dam safety programme The dam is founded on massive basaltic rock formations. =Reservoir= Panoramic view of Ujjani or Bhima Dam and the reservoir The reservoir created by the dam has a water spread area of at the High Flood Level (HFL) and at Full Reservoir Level causing submergence of land and houses in 82 villages. The reservoir stretches upstream of the dam to a length of around 50 km, and the maximum width of the reservoir is . The rim of the reservoir periphery measures . As a result of reservoir submergence, realignment of railway line (of the Daund Solapur section) to a length of , realignment of National Highway No. 9 between Pune and Solapur sector over a length of , and the State Highway between Tembhurni and Karmala to the extent of was involved. Two years after commissioning of the project, the reservoir water quality was tested to establish its suitability for various uses. The physical and chemical analysis indicated that the pH values, free carbon dioxide, total hardness, alkalinity, nitrates, nitrites, chlorides, sulphates, calcium and magnesium were within prescribed limits. Heavy metals, copper and lead were not present. However, during the rainy season, the iron content though high, was found to be within permissible limits. Potassium and ammonia were within prescribed safe limits of acceptance for use of stored water for drinking, industrial use and for fish propagation. However, since its creation in 1980, it is now recorded that substantial quantity of the untreated sewage is discharged into the streams which flow into the Ujjani Reservoir, particularly in the river stretch close to the Pune city. The reservoir created by the Ujjani dam is also one of the largest backwaters in India, Since its creation in 1980, the reservoir backwaters attract, every year, a large number of migratory birds (from North India and other countries); about 100‚Äì150 species of flamingos and cormorants are reported. The migratory bird species in the Ujjani reservoir have been studied by the Science and Technology Park (STP), a Pune-based institution. Some of the key species which are found around backwaters are: greater flamingos, pheasant-tailed jacana, painted stork, moorhen, small pratincole, river terns, aquatic insects, pied kingfisher and stilts. Benefits The Ujjani Dam and its large reservoir provide multi-purpose benefits of irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, drinking and industrial water supply, and fisheries. =Irrigation= Left bank irrigation canal from the Ujjani Dam Irrigation from the storage created in the reservoir are provided via two irrigation canal systems originating from the dam ‚Äì The Left Bank Main Canal (LBMC) and The Right Bank Main canal (RBMC) ‚Äì the LBMC is long, designed to carry a discharge of and provides irrigation to a command of while the RBMC, which is long, designed to carry provides irrigation benefits to an area of through its network of canal system. Bhima to Sina interlink (Jod Kalava) with 21 km long tunnel from Ujjani reservoir is constructed to supply water for vast lands in catchment area of Sina tributary. The storage created by the Ujjani Dam has resulted in the irrigation of , particularly in Solapur district, resulting in doubling the yield of sorghum (jowar) and tripling the yield of groundnut. Farmers management organizations set up in the command area of the project are an important component of equitable distribution of irrigation under the rotational irrigation water management practice followed in the command. The irrigation component of the Ujjani Dam project was co- financed by IFAD and the World Bank with specific objective to enhance the social and economic conditions of the Scheduled castes and Scheduled tribe people in the command. Hydropower The 12 MW pumped storage powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank A pumped storage type powerhouse has been built at the toe of the dam with an installed capacity of 12 MW (one unit of vertical Francis-reversible pump turbine) on the left bank of the dam, downstream from the axis of the dam. It operates under 20 percent load factor under a range of maximum head of and minimum head of . The hydropower component involved construction of a high weir, below the Ujjani Dam to control the lower pond for operation during the pumping mode. A penstock pipe of diameter ( thick) and length embedded in the dam diverts the flow of from a gate controlled trash racks (15 panels) covered intake into the powerhouse. The lower pond in the pumped storage scheme of operation was built initially itself, soon after commissioning of the dam. The power plant is reported to be providing benefits since then. However, the power generation estimated initially at 105 GWh was expected to reduce to 21 GWh, as water was utilized for irrigation through the RBC and LBC canal systems. During the drought year 2015, the inflows into the reservoir were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 36 tmcft dead storage water available in the reservoir could not be used for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible hydro turbine unit, all the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby left canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the nearby left canal. The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the left canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the left canal's MDDL Other benefits The high density of phytoplankton (of many species) in the Ujjani Reservoir is conducive to proliferation of fish species. Production of fish resources from the reservoir has been estimated at 712 tonnes per year, and 19 percent of the catch consists species of major carps. Fish yield is reported to be 2450 kg/km2 of the water spread area of the reservoir. Bird watching With the water reservoir of Ujani Dam, Bhigwan is a small town developed on the Pune-Solapur Highway around 105 km from Pune which is on the backwaters of Ujani dam. Bhigwan is famous for birdwatching especially flamingos and wild life photography.BhigwanBhigwan low on flamingos this year It is also known as mini Bharatpur.Bhigwan is a new flock-spot for birding near Mumbai Many kinds of Ducks, Herons, Egrets, Raptors and Waders along with flocks of hundreds of flamingos can be seen. Variety of birds at Bhigwan gives of sighting of almost all the prime bird species there and also creates great photographic opportunities for wildlife photographers. At times, 1,000-1,200 flamingos are seen.Bhigwan The low rains and low water level has now reduced the number of flamingos over some years. It is a favorite spot for migratory birds, with more than 230 species found here. One can see flamingos, painted storks, bar- headed geese, demoiselle cranes, etc. These birds can be seen in the winter season between December and March. The bird generally migrates via marine routes and adult females depart from the breeding grounds .Birders at Bhigwan get a rare treat Water Quality Ujjani dam has a very bad quality of water. Ujjani dam contains hazardous pollutants from Pune and many other small cities located on the banks of bhima river or its tributaries. According to recent surveys the water from ujjani dam is not potable and should not be used for agriculture also. Dissolved oxygen is also below standard of 8 ppm. Resident of Indapur taluka in pune district have been suffering from various ailments for the last four or five years the reason was unearthed during recent survey and testing of water at ujjani dam which residents dependent on the survey found high level of nitrates, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the water which makes it unfit for consumption . Former bombay high Court judge B G Kolse Patil who has also taken up this issue said ,\\"people in solapur filter the water three times ,but the illness do not stop. There are 700 chemical companies realising polluted water directly into rivers there is no system in place to keep a check on these .\\" See also * List of dams and reservoirs in Maharashtra * List of dams and reservoirs in India * Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal References Dams completed in 1980 Energy infrastructure completed in 1980 Dams in Pune district Hydroelectric power stations in Maharashtra Pumped- storage hydroelectric power stations in India Dams on the Krishna River Masonry dams ","title":"Ujjani Dam"},{"id":"13185512","text":"Czarnca is a village in the administrative district of Gmina W≈Çoszczowa, within W≈Çoszczowa County, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland.

RDECOM was tasked with \\"creating, integrating, and delivering technology-enabled solutions\\" to the U.S. Army. Headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, RDECOM employed more than 13,000 scientists, engineers, researchers, and support personnel working at six major RDE centers and at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, providing nearly all of the Army's basic and applied research and development services, including in collaboration with other branches of the armed forces and through a network of more than a thousand academic, industrial, and international partners. Speed of delivery and integration with the weapon systems are now needed for CCDC operations. CCDC now includes the Data and Analysis Center (formerly AMSAA), and must now align with the top six priorities of Futures Command: #Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) #Next Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCV) #Future Vertical Lift (FVL) #Army Network #Air & Missile Defense #Soldier Lethality as well as Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). Role and organization CCDC formerly described its role as \\"the Army's enabling command in the development and delivery of capabilities that empower, unburden and protect the Warfighter.\\" It conducts and sponsors scientific research in areas important to the Army, develops scientific discoveries into new technologies, engineers technologies into new equipment and capabilities, and works with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command to help requirements writers define the future needs of the Army. CCDC is headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Before 1 November 2019, Major- General Cedric T. Wins was the commanding general, assisted by Brigadier- General Vincent F. Malone as deputy commanding general and Command Sergeant- Major Jon R. Stanley as command sergeant major.

Kern saw the need to streamline how the Army developed technology. At the time, the Army's laboratories and research centers reported through multiple channels, among other problems. Kern argued that the Army had to \\"figure out how to get technology in the hands of the Warfighters quicker\\" and that it was \\"the impression of everyone out there that the laboratories take too long, they do science for science's sake, engineering for engineering's sake\\". Kern proposed to unite the laboratories and research centers under a single command, and the idea was initiated to senior commanders and civilians. The new command was approved, and was provisionally stood up in October 2002, based at Aberdeen Proving Ground where it replaced and integrated the headquarters element of the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM). In June 2003, RDECOM assumed operational control of the RDE centers. An organizational ceremony took place in October 2003 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where SBCCOM officially stood down and the 389th Army Band and the Army Material Command's Acquisition Center were assigned to RDECOM. RDECOM became a major subordinate command of the Army Material Command in March 2004, with over 17,000 military, civilian, and contractor personnel at the time. In 2006, the 389th Army Band was designated AMC Band and moved to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. In 2008, the AMC Acquisition Center became part of the new Army Contracting Command, itself a major subordinate of the AMC. From February 2012 to September 2014, RDECOM was led by a civilian commander, Dale Ormond, before returning to military command. = Transfer to Army Futures Command = Army Futures Command shoulder sleeve insignia (left) and distinctive unit insignia (right) As of 2018, CCDC reports to Army Futures Command, which will reach full operational capability by August 2019.

The workspace serves as a place where, for a fee, writers can work on their project and have access to reference materials and fellow writers. The group came up with the idea because the rules of the Allen Room required them to leave for a brief period each year (to allow others a chance to use the limited space). This created a demand for an alternative with no such restrictions. The location of The Writers Room has moved several times since its launch in order to accommodate new members. The workspace originally started with 22 members, each donating $100 towards the rental of the initial room, but has since expanded to more than 300 members as of 1999.

It contains the Bavarian state collection of ancient Egyptian art and displays exhibits from both the predynastic and dynastic periods. The associated small Middle East section displays objects from the areas of Assyrian and Babylonian culture. For decades, the Egyptian museum was located in the Munich Residenz, but it was moved to the Kunstareal in June 2013. Building A new, subterranean museum, opposite the Alte Pinakothek and reaching underneath the new structure for the University of Television and Film Munich was conceived by the architect Peter B√∂hm. The project was inspired by an ancient Egyptian burial chamber. Its entrance area is marked with a portal wall reminiscent of the pylon gateways to Egyptian temples. It offers some 1800 m¬≤ of exhibition space, with an additional 400 m¬≤ for special exhibitions. It is open since June 2013. The light-filled entrance hall leads to three large halls, and subsequently into smaller, darker and lower catacombs with several theme rooms such as \\"The Pharaoh\\", \\"Religion\\", \\"Realm of the Dead\\", \\"Beyond belief,\\" \\"Egypt in Rome\\" or \\"After the Pharaohs\\". An atrium brings natural light into some parts of the exhibition. History The Bavarian state's collection was already founded in the 16th century by Duke Albrecht V and extended especially by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria and King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Also private donators and the Academy of Sciences contributed to the collection. The museum is dedicated to the periods of the early, middle and late kingdoms, but also to the Hellenistic, Roman and Coptic era of Egypt. Collection The obelisk of Titus Sextius Africanus once before the Residenz was moved into the museum. The museum displays ancient Egyptian artefacts, such as statues, sculptures, cult articles, papyri, stone tablets with hieroglyphics, glasswares, jewellery, amulets but also mummies, textiles and household goods. About 2000 of more than 8000 objects are displayed permanently. There are also temporary exhibitions. Among the most distinguished exhibits are the famous duplex statue portraying the pharaoh Nyuserre Ini as a youth and as an elder man, the false door of the grave chamber of Menes, the statues of the pharaohs Amenemhat III, Ramses II, Thutmose III and Akhenaten, the sphinx of Sesostris III and of Amenhotep II, the sarcophagus lid of queen Sitdjehuti and the kneeling figure of Senenmut. One of the most famous exhibits is the glass cup with the inscription of Thutmose III, the oldest glass vessel in the world (1450 BC). The upper part of a priest statue dates from the Persian period (ca. 500 BC). The Hellenistic-Roman period is represented by master pieces such as the bust of a Seleucid ruler and the grand Egyptian statue of Antinous. The obelisk of Titus Sextius Africanus in the atrium is 5.80 meters high, the central part dates from the 50 AD, the rest was added later and restored several times. Very precious is the treasure of jewellery of the Nubian Queen Amanishakheto. The museum owns also the Assyrian Orthostates reliefs from the palace of king Ashur-nasir-pal II and a lion tile from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon which were once displayed in the Glyptothek. Since 1912 the museum has held the mummy of a child aged between 4 and 6 years old found by Flinders Petrie near the Hawara Pyramid. The mummy includes a Fayum mummy portrait which CT scans suggest are a reasonably accurate representation of the child in question.

It combines a short guided tour with handicraft work that the children can take home. Since 2007 similar programs are also offered during the other school holidays. During the summer holidays and special project days (International Museum Day, Long Night of the Museums), children can complete a Treasure Hunt, answering questions about objects throughout the museum, and receive a prize for correct answers. Outside of the holidays, the museum offers an \\"Archaeological Backpack\\" based on a similar principle and that can be taken out at the front desk. Both the Treasure Hunt and the Archaeological Backpack are usually also available in English. The Museum also offers guided tours for schools on the following subjects: * Ancient Egyptian Culture * The Gods of Ancient Egypt * Funerary Beliefs * The Secret of the Hieroglyphs * Everyday and Family Life * The King and the State * Animals and their importance to the Egyptians. The guided tours cost ‚Ç¨33 and are available in English and French as well. Since the beginning of the 2008-2009 school year, schools can book a project hour in addition to guided tours.  Exhibitions  The exhibition \\"ISISBLUT UND STEINBOCKHORN - Amulett und Talisman in Alt√§gypten und im Alpenraum\\", an exhibition showing amulets and talismans from Ancient Egypt and the Alps, was on view from 22 July 2010 to 9 January 2011.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros. Career =Draft= The Oakland Athletics originally drafted him in the 32nd round (968th overall) and in the 23rd round (692nd overall) in the 2002 and 2003 Major League Baseball drafts, respectively. He did not sign with them either times. He signed with the Houston Astros when they drafted him in the 20th round (604th overall) in the 2004 draft. =Houston Astros= In 2004 after being signed, Towles played at the rookie level for the Greeneville Astros. He played in just 39 games and batted .243 with no home runs. In 2005 and in 2006, he played for the Single-A Lexington Legends. He batted .345 with 5 home runs in 45 games in 2005 and in 2006, batted .312 with 12 home runs in 81 games. He was a South Atlantic League Mid- Season All-Star in 2006 and was a Baseball America Low A All-Star. Towles worked his way up the minor leagues in 2007. He began the year with the Single-A Salem Avalanche, then the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks, and by the end of the minor league season, was with the Triple-A Round Rock Express. He played a total of 100 games in the minor leagues and batted .287 with 11 home runs. He also was a selection for the All-Star Futures Game at AT&T; Park in San Francisco. Towles had his contract purchased by the major league club on September 4, 2007. He made his major league debut on September 5, 2007, against the Milwaukee Brewers. He faced relief pitcher Matt Wise as a pinch hitter and flied out to left fielder Mel Stocker. On September 20, 2007, Towles got 8 RBI in a game beating the club record of 7 RBI. In the same game, the Astros got a combined 23 hits in their 18-1 win against the St. Louis Cardinals. Towles also hit his first career home run that day. The pitcher who gave up that home run was actually infielder Aaron Miles. Towles was expected to be the starting catcher starting in 2008 with the club signing Brad Ausmus to a one-year contract to serve as a back-up catcher and mentor to the young Towles on October 30, 2007. On June 5, 2008, Towles was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock for having some hitting troubles. Towles hit .145 over 42 games for the Astros. He had 17 hits in 117 at-bats, knocking four homers and driving in 14. Towles was not surprised about this move though and took it very well. Towles thought of it as a time to get some confidence back. Cooper said it wasn't his catching or game calling, it was his offense. Ausmus became the primary catcher. He competed with Humberto Quintero and Lou Palmisano for the starting or back-up job in spring training in 2009, but instead began the season in Round Rock when the team had signed Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez on March 16. After Quintero was designated to the 15 Day Disabled List, Towles was called up to the Astros to serve as back-up catcher for Rodriguez. Towles hit .191 (9-for-47) with one homer and eight RBIs in 17 games with the Astros. He was the Opening Day starter the following year and wound up starting 13 of the team's first 26 games, splitting time with Quintero. On May 5, 2010, he was optioned to Double-A Corpus Christi. =Minnesota Twins= On December 15, 2011, Towles signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. He also received an invitation to spring training. He spent the entire 2012 season in the minor leagues, playing in 52 games with the Rochester Red Wings, the Twins Triple-A affiliate. Towles batted .214 in 168 plate appearances. =St. Louis Cardinals= On December 19, 2012, Towles agreed to a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. The deal included an invitation as a non-roster player to spring training with the club. He played in 19 games for the Memphis Redbirds, hitting .237 before he was released on May 24. =Los Angeles Dodgers= He subsequently signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 29, 2013. He reported to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes but only played in 4 games for them before he was shut down with an injury. =Bridgeport Bluefish= Towles signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish for the 2014 season. =Texas Rangers= Towles signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers on August 25, 2014. He became a free agent after the 2014 season.

His work employed algorithmic processes and gestural controllers to explore the boundary where humans encounter their machines. He was involved in the creation of various custom software tools called Automatic Notation Generators (ANGs) developed to aid in the creation of algorithmic instrumental compositions. His writing on live generated music notation has been presented at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression conference, and in August 2007, he spoke on the topic of ANGs at the International Computer Music Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. For the 2006 Look and Listen Festival in New York City, Wulfson presented his 'SensorBall,' a small electronic device, slightly larger than a baseball, with pressure-sensitive controls, all wired to a laptop computer and the results channeled through loudspeakers.

The building, designed by Heller Manus Architects, is located adjacent to the Transbay Transit Center and 199 Fremont Street developments. 181 Fremont is owned and operated by Jay Paul Company. Jay Paul Company is the sole owner and developer of the project. The entire office portion of the building has been leased to Facebook to house its San Francisco office and Instagram division. Design The slender mixed-use tower, developed initially by SKS Investments, rises to the roof with 55 floors of offices and residential condominiums. A parapet/mechanical screen reaches to , and a spire brings the total height to . The tower will contain of office space on the lower 35 floors (from 3 to 38), and 67 condominiums on the upper 16 floors (from 41 to 57). The 39th floor will contain residential amenities and a two-story open air terrace. Mechanical spaces would be on floors 2 and 40. The building will have a direct connection to the rooftop park atop the adjacent Salesforce Transit Center from the 7th floor. Upon completion, the tower was the tallest mixed-use building in San Francisco, surpassing the nearby Millennium Tower, and the 2nd-tallest in the Western United States. It was also the third tallest building in the city after the Transamerica Pyramid and the Salesforce Tower. 181 Fremont joins several other buildings designed to catalyze the San Francisco Transbay development area. History In 2007, SKS originally proposed 181 Fremont Street as a 66 floor, tall mixed-use skyscraper, with 140 residential units and of office space. However, the developers reduced the height of the project to comply with the parcel's height limit, as detailed in the Transbay Center District Plan approved in 2012. Still, this height limit is twice as high as the previous restriction. The tower's design was approved in December 2012, and the development site was subsequently put on the market by SKS Investments. On March 29, 2013, Jay Paul Company announced that it acquired the development from SKS Investments and planned \\"to immediately commence construction\\" with completion expected in the second quarter of 2015. According to Bloomberg, the building will cost US$375 million to construct, including land acquisition costs. Demolition of the existing structures began in August 2013, with tower construction expected to begin in November. Official groundbreaking ceremonies took place on November 12, 2013, and the luxury residences were officially named Park 181. The name was later changed to simply 181 Fremont Residences. Jay Paul Company announced that the building would cost US$500 million to construct and is scheduled to open in early 2017. On September 20, 2017, it was reported that Facebook would lease the entire office portion of the building to form a new San Francisco office.

Located in the heart of the city, it is of special interest since it houses the executive offices of the governor of the state of Chihuahua and, until 2004, the state legislature met here. The building is a landmark in the city as it contains a shrine commemorating the execution of Miguel Hidalgo, considered the Father of the Country, who died at the hands of a Spanish firing squad on July 30, 1811. The Altar de la Patria, or Altar of the Fatherland is located at the exact spot where Miguel Hidalgo died. History Panel of mural showing the death of Hidalgo, next to the altar The Altar of the Fatherland; The spot where Miguel Hidalgo was executed by the Spanish. Originally, a Jesuit College stood on the site. In 1767 the Society of Jesus was expelled from New Spain, and the building remained abandoned until it was converted into a military hospital in 1790, and was acquired by the Federal Government in 1859 after the Laws of Reform had been passed by the liberal regime of President Benito Ju√°rez. The old building was razed in 1878 after being turned over to the State Government, and the new Government Palace was begun in 1881 under the administration of Governor Luis Terrazas and placed under the supervision of Engineer-Architect Pedro Ignacio Irigoyen, with the assistance of Enrique Esper√≥n and Carlos Moreno. A new street was opened and the old site of the Jesuit College was divided into two squares by Calle Libertad. The Government Palace occupies the lot south of Libertad, while on the northern side of the street stood the Chihuahua Federal Branch Mint, built after the demolition of the former college, demolished in turn in 1908, and is now the site of the Museo Casa Chihuahua, once the Federal Palace of Chihuahua, which was itself inaugurated in 1910. It took almost ten years to complete the work, and on September 11, 1891, the building was ready for occupancy, being officially inaugurated on June 1, 1892, by Governor Lauro Carrillo. The palace had originally two stories and was built in neoclassic style from limestone. Its cost was put at $388,130.19 (pesos). On Saturday, June 21, 1941, the palace suffered extensive damage by fire which gutted the structure; however, it was totally restored and a third floor was added, and the building was re-inaugurated in 1947. The project of reconstruction was done under the charge of Engineers Enrique Miller, Manuel O'Reilly and Carlos Ochoa. In 1959, then-Governor Teofilo Borunda ordered the decoration of some of the first-floor inside walls with a series of murals illustrating the history and the economy of the state. Muralist Aar√≥n Pi√±a Mora was chosen to do the work and the first panel to be painted was the one illustrating the death of Miguel Hidalgo. When President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos visited the city in 1962 he recommended that the work continue. The entire first floor and part of the second floor are now covered with murals painted by one of Mexico's renowned muralists. Architecture The palace is designed and decorated in the neoclassic style, with the first floor of the Doric order, the second of the Ionic and the third a hybrid style. The Patio Central was decorated with a sculpture which represents the four races of humanity; however it eventually was moved to El Parque Espa√±a, one of the parks in the city centre.

He is the son of Bob Hughes and Kim Hughes, the brother of Tom Hughes, Frannie Hughes, Sabrina Hughes and Andy Dixon. He is also the grandson of Chris Hughes and the town's matriarch Nancy Hughes. Growing up in the town's most respected family, Chris at times felt unwanted pressure to become a certain type of man and follow in the footsteps of his father in the medical profession. He eventually became a doctor at Oakdale Memorial Hospital and also traveled the world with the Global Health Association, medically assisting those less than fortunate. Chris' relationships include Katie Peretti, Molly Conlan, Abigail Williams, Emily Stewart, Sofie Duran, and Alison Stewart before finally settling down with his first love Katie at the conclusion of the series in 2010. At the end of the series, Chris battled a rare disease he was diagnosed with while overseas that resulted in heart failure. He eventually received a heart transplant from donor Reid Oliver in one of the show's final major storylines. Reception The character of Chris Hughes came under some fire during Cosgrove's run because of his character being saved from a heart ailment while his rival Dr. Reid Oliver (Eric Sheffer Stevens) was sacrificed and killed off in the final week of the show. Chris returned to town in 2010 after being diagnosed with a failing heart and Reid was the only person who knew of his condition and who could cure him. Reid became a close friend and with the assistance of Katie, Chris came to terms with the end of his life. However, while in pursuit of a donor heart Reid was killed when his car was struck by a train. With columnist Michael Fairman, Stevens praised his co-star Cosgrove over his professionalism and their character's growing from rivals to friends. > \\"I love playing with Daniel Cosgrove. He is a great, great, guy. Reid will > help Chris along the way, and that is part of story.\\" ‚ÄîEric Sheffer Stevens, > Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps The controversy arose because Reid, a gay character, was killed and his relationship with Luke Snyder sacrificed, while Chris and Katie, a heterosexual couple, were permitted to have a happy ending, with the characters marrying. While Stevens himself dismissed the decision of the writers to intentionally kill off a gay character, both characters' fan bases were at odds.

Nathaniel Ames II is sometimes ‚Äúthe elder‚Äù and his son, ‚Äúthe younger‚Äù. (July 22, 1708 ‚Äì July 11, 1764), a colonial American physician, published a popular series of annual almanacs. The series of almanacs were written by Benjamin Banneker a free black man and astrologer who also made America‚Äôs first clock. He was the son of Nathaniel Ames first (1677‚Äì1736) and the father of Nathaniel third. The family was descended from William Ames of Bruton, Somerset, England, whose son William emigrated to Massachusetts and settled at Braintree as early as 1640. Biography =Early life= Captain Nathaniel Ames, father of this entry's subject, lived at Bridgewater and there married Susannah Howard on December 2, 1702.New England Historical and Genealogical Register, XXI, p. 226. Six children were born to them,Others were Susannah (b. 1711), Seth (1713-1738), Sarah (b. 1716), Ann, and Mary. of whom Nathaniel second was the eldest son.Ames, Fisher. A Bit of Ames Genealogy, 1898, p. 3. His father is said to have been learned in astronomy and mathematics, as well as practicing medicine. Nothing is known of his son's education, but he became a physician, probably without other medical training than instruction from his father, apprenticeship to some country doctor, and reading medical volumes. =Ames' almanac= In 1725, Ames published the first annual number of his almanac, which was to remain a popular New England almanac for a half-century. At this time, he was still living at home in Bridgewater, and although the almanac bears on the title-page \\"by Nathaniel Ames, Jr.,\\" it may well be that the boy, then only seventeen years old, received some help from his mathematical parent.DAB. He is said to have moved to Dedham in 1732Briggs, S. The Essays, Humor, and Poems of Nathaniel Ames, 1891, p. 23. and his name is entered from that place on the list of subscribers to Prince's Chronology, to which most of the subscriptions were made in 1728.New England Historical and Genealogical Register, VI, p. 189. =Ames v. Gay= Ames' offending sign, as redrawn in 1888. On September 14, 1735, Ames married Mary, daughter of Capt. Joshua Fisher of Dedham,A tavern keeper from as early as 1658, Captain Fisher died in 1730. by whom, on October 24, 1737, he had a son, Fisher Ames, who died less than a year later, on September 17, 1738, surviving his mother, however, who had died on November 11, 1737. Ames‚Äô wife had owned a tavern, and the situation gave rise to Ames v. Gay, one of the famous lawsuits of New England. Ames (a compulsively litigious man) claimed inheritance to her estate according to the Province law through their son Fisher against his mother-in- law Hannah, who claimed the rights to it under the Common law, a struggle continued by her family after she died in December 1744. In August 1749 Ames won the case, and thus established an exception to the rule of inheritance in Massachusetts. However, two of the eleven Superior Court of Judicature justices were against him, leading the normally amiable Ames to an especially vituperative stance against lawyers for the rest of his career.Compared with other almanac makers of the day, for an anti-lawyer attitude was standard. He took down his tavern sign and replaced it with a cartoon of the judges, all easily identifiable. Each was shown studying the Province laws, except the two dissenters, who had their backs turned to the law books. Chief Justice Paul Dudley, one of the dissenters, sent the sheriff to arrest Ames and confiscate the libelous portrait. Ames was warned and quickly substituted Matt. 16:4: ‚ÄúA wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it.‚ÄùStowell, p. 75. =Second wife= On October 30, 1740, he married his second wife Deborah, daughter of Jeremiah Fisher, by whom he had six children, the eldest being Nathaniel third (1741‚Äì1822), and the third son being Fisher Ames.The others were John (1760-1844, immigrated to Plymouth New York), Seth (d. 1778), Deborah, and William. In that year, 1740, he was also one of the subscribers to the celebrated Land Bank.New England Historical and Genealogical Register, L, p. 191. In addition to his duties as local doctor, as publisher of the almanacs, and as amateur astronomer, Ames for many years ran the well-known \\"Sun\\" tavern, which brought him an economically and politically strategic position; as taverns often doubled as courthouses, Ames was also a common lawyer, a business that aroused the anger of trained legal practitioners. The contemporary entry in John Whiting's Diary reads \\"Jan. 25, 1750, Dr. Ames began to keep tavern‚Äù, although Briggs and Kittredge provide different dates for the commencement of this venture.Briggs, p. 23.Kittredge, George Lyman. The Old Farmer and His Almanac, 1904, p. 264. He continued to live at Dedham until his death of fever in 1764. After Ames died, his widow continued to keep the tavern until she married Richard Woodward, when it became the Woodward Tavern,Briggs, p. 29. under which name it was known as the site where the Suffolk Resolves were drawn up in 1774. It was demolished in 1817 and is now the site of the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds. Legacy His chief importance is as founder and editor of his almanacs, the publishing of which his son, Nathaniel third (a Harvard graduate and physician), continued for ten years after his father's death. The father issued the first number in 1725, three years before James Franklin started his in Rhode Island and eight years before Benjamin Franklin inaugurated Poor Richard's Almanack. Ames must have been a household word throughout New England, for it is said that the circulation of his almanac, with its sharp-tongued commentary on Massachusetts politics, religion, and social life ran to 60,000 copies.Briggs, p. 20. Moses Coit Tyler considered it as superior to Franklin's, which it resembled in many ways. Besides the astronomical observations, Ames published short articles, extracts from the English poets, such as Milton and Pope, and used the same pithy and witty maxims as made the reputation of Franklin, such as: \\"All men are created equal, but differ greatly in the sequel.\\" He had taste for good literature and considerable wit, though some of it seems a trifle forced today, and the quality rather improved when the almanac was continued by his somewhat abler son, who nevertheless was not the genial gentleman his father was, genuinely liking only farmers and despising printers.Stowell, p. 76. Ames, however, undoubtedly did much to bring, if only in brief allusions and extracts, some knowledge of the better English authors to innumerable New England farmhouses.DAB. Ames gave rise to an entire industry, and he had many imitators. Among those who followed in his footsteps was Dudley Leavitt of Meredith, New Hampshire, a teacher, newspaper publisher and polymath who published his first Leavitt's Farmers Almanack in 1797. In 1775, during the Siege of Boston, Jabez Fitch, a young officer in the Colonial Army, visited Ames' tomb in the Old Village Cemetery in Dedham. Finding the tomb open, he entered, opened the casket, and examined the decomposing body. See also * Ames family Notes References *\\"Nathaniel Ames\\", Dictionary of American Biography.

The center offers tours, classes and special events, as well as sails on the center's fleet of wooden boats. The center is staffed by master craftsmen, history experts, longtime sailors and volunteers committed to preserving and sharing the Center's maritime heritage. The Spaulding Marine Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and tax-exempt California public benefit corporation. Mission The mission of the Spaulding Marine Center is to restore and return to active use significant, historic wooden sailing vessels; preserve and enhance our working boatyard; create a place where people can gather to use, enjoy, and learn about wooden boats; and educate others about wooden boat building skills, traditions and values. History spar loft at the Spaulding Boatworks (1995) The Spaulding Marine Center was originally built as the Spaulding Boatworks on the Sausalito waterfront in 1951 by Myron Spaulding, concert violinist, renowned sailor, and yacht designer and builder. In 2002 Myron Spaulding‚Äôs widow Gladys left the Spaulding Boatworks in charitable trust, with instructions for the trustees to form a non-profit, charitable organization and living museum. The Spaulding Boatworks is the oldest marina and boatyard on the historic Sausalito waterfront and one of the last remaining wooden boatyards in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has remained largely unchanged and in continuous use since its inception. Programs The interior work area of the Spaulding Marine Center The Spaulding Marine Center offers a range of programs for both the general public and the serious student interested in traditional wooden boat crafts, seagoing skills and educational and fun maritime experiences. =Education= The Spaulding Marine Center's education programs are designed to inform the general public about the historic context, legacy and craft of wooden boat building and use on San Francisco Bay. Since 2007, the Spaulding Marine Center also is home to the Arques School of Traditional Boatbuilding, which offers apprenticeship programs in wooden boat building and traditional maritime skills. Public education The Spaulding Marine Center is located on the Sausalito waterfront, and in the future will offer a range of public programs that allow public access to the historic boatyard and the waterfront, including classes, workshops, events and forums on subjects ranging from traditional boatbuilding skills to the preservation of the Sausalito waterfront. Youth education The Spaulding Center supports programs in woodworking, boatbuilding, boat restoration, and sailing for youths interested in learning about and enjoying the maritime environment in Sausalito. In the summer of 2007, the Center offered a woodworking program for Marin City young people. In 2008, the Center worked in partnership with local organizations to introduce students aged 12 to 18 to wooden boatbuilding and sailing. Students were taught traditional woodworking skills, then used those skills to build a Norwegian Sailing Pram. Finally, the students learned to sail on San Francisco Bay in the boat they built. Students blogged about their experiences building the boat and learning to sail at Boatbuilders' and Sailors' Blog. The Arques School of Traditional Boatbuilding  Arques students working on a Black Cat 15 foot lapstrake daysailor designed by the school The Arques School of Traditional BoatbuildingArques School of Traditional Boatbuilding website opened in June 1996 within the Arques Trust property in the Marinship District of Sausalito. It was founded by Bob Darr, who is currently the Program Director and Head Instructor. With a core apprenticeship program of just six students, it is a small school dedicated to developing craftsmen skilled in the art of building boats in the traditional plank on frame methods. The school owes its existence to an endowment provided by Donlon Arques who laid the groundwork for the school prior to his death in 1993. The Arques School education programs at Spaulding Marine Center serve two primary goals: 1) train a new generation of shipwrights who are skilled in traditional methods and crafts, and are enthusiastic ambassadors for the values of hand-crafted wooden boats, and 2) introduce the general public to the experience of traditional sailing by maintaining a fleet of classic wooden boats that can be used in on-the-water public programs. =Classic boat restoration= The Spaulding Marine Center will continue to restore and preserve important San Francisco Bay wooden boats and communicate the skills and ideals that went into their design, building, and use. The gaff-rigged sloop Freda, the oldest active sailing yacht on the west coast, is the inaugural Spaulding Center restoration project. Freda Freda being restored at Spaulding Marine Center (2007) Freda under sail in 1880s Freda was built in 1885 in Belvedere, California by saloon keeper Harry Cookson. Freda has been celebrated for her simple elegance, and called both the Common Man‚Äôs Yacht and the Matriarch of San Francisco Bay. She was owned by one of the early commodores of the Corinthian Yacht Club in Tiburon, California. Painstakingly restored in the 1950s by Harold Sommer, captain of the last wooden tugboat on San Francisco Bay, Freda became a fixture in the local Master Mariner fleet regattas, but has since suffered from years of deterioration. Originally built with rock elm frames, Douglas fir decks, black elm and fir hanging knees, fir planks, and lignum vitae deadeyes, Freda embodies the creativity and self-reliance of San Francisco Bay wooden boat builders. Freda, Matriarch of the Bay, is a Web site devoted to the history and restoration of Freda. Foundry patterns In May 2007, Lin and Larry Pardey loaned the foundry casting patterns for their Lyle Hess-designed 30 foot cutter Taleisin to the safe keeping and management of the SWBC. The patterns will be used for education programs at the Center by the Arques School and loaned to others who wish to have parts cast. =Boat collection= The Spaulding Marine Center will maintain a fleet of restored or newly built wooden sailboats and rowboats that will be available to students at the Center and to the public. The 34-foot gaff rigged sailboat, Polaris, a carvel-built (fir planks butted edge to edge on oak ribs) pumpkinseed sloop, which was built on San Francisco Bay in 1906, is currently available for skippered sails at the Center. Once Freda is restored, it also will be available for sails on San Francisco Bay, as will select boats built by the Arques School of Traditional Boatbuilding.

He had already written a piano concerto in A minor with string accompaniment (1822), two concertos with two pianos (1823‚Äì4), and his first Piano Concerto. The concerto is about 25 minutes in length, and is scored for solo piano, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings. History Unusually for Mendelssohn, who often produced his compositions quickly, the Second Piano Concerto took him a great deal of effort.For this and what follows, including additional references, see Its genesis dates to the period shortly after his marriage and is first mentioned in a letter to his friend while on honeymoon: \\"aber ein Konzert machte ich mir so gern f√ºr England, und kann immer noch nicht dazu kommen. Ich m√∂chte wissen, warum mir das so schwer wird.\\" [but I would like to write a concert for England, and I can't manage it. I want to know why this is so difficult for me.\\"] Mendelssohn's difficulties probably stemmed from a desire to excel in the new work, written expressly for the Birmingham Music Festival, and thereby impress English audiences. The arduousness of the task is attested to by the fact that more autograph sources for the concerto exist than for any other composition he wrote for piano and orchestra.Marian Wilson, \\"Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 40: A Study of the Autograph Sources,\\" M.Mus thesis, Florida State University, 1989) Work on the piece lasted from April through to early September 1837, although his progress was significant enough that he felt confident enough to mention the work to his publisher, Breitkopf & H√§rtel in early August, having shortly before completed an autograph copy of both the piano part and orchestral score. However, it was not until six weeks after the Birmingham premiere and a second performance at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, in early November, that Mendelssohn began actively to negotiate publication. He continued to work on the score through that month, delivering a final score to his publishers on December 12.Felix Mendelssohn, Briefe an Deutsche Verleger, eds. Rudolf Elvers and H. Herzfeld (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1968), p. 67 The publisher sent Mendelssohn the proofs of the score on 11 May 1838, which the composer promised to return a copied version of shortly thereafter. The work was published later that summer, although Mendelssohn was unhappy with the result, complaining, among other matters, that the title page was in French rather than German.Felix Mendelssohn, Briefe an Deutsche Verleger, pp. 75‚Äì76. Critical reception Despite the effort it took Mendelssohn to write the concerto, it has been seen as a somewhat slight contribution to the repertoire. The composer Robert Schumann, writing in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, offered a frank assessment of the piece, observing: > This concerto, to be sure, will offer virtuosos little in which to show off > their monstrous dexterity. Mendelssohn gives them almost nothing to do that > they have not already done a hundred times before. We have often heard them > complain about it. And not unjustly! ... One will ask how it compares with > his First Concerto. It's the same, and yet not the same; the same because it > comes from the same practised master hand, different because it comes ten > years later. Sebastian Bach is discernible in the harmonization. The rest, > melody, form and instrumentation are all Mendelssohn. Let us enjoy the > fleeting, cheerful gift! It resembles one of those works thrown off by the > older masters while recuperating from one of their great exertions. Our > younger master will certainly not forget how the older ones would suddenly > emerge with something magnificent ‚Äì Mozart's Concerto in D minor, > Beethoven's in G! Despite being overshadowed by other Romantic piano concertos (including Schumann's own 1845 Concerto) and the relative simplicity of the piano part, it is nonetheless frequently performed and recorded.

Other sources of income include dairy products from the farm animals. Farmers typically sell the milk from their farm animals to local dairies. Milk collected at the village collection centers owned by private dairies is then sent off for larger scale collection and distribution by the dairy owners. Sugarcane factory in nearby village Takali also provides for employment needs of some of the villagers in Soundane.  Farming  Traditional crops include Jawar, Maize, Wheat. Since recent years, Sugarcane has been a popular farm product amongst the native farmers. Other crops include Groundnut, Tomato farming as well as horticulture. Fruit cultivation includes Pomegranate, Lemon as well as banana. Daily wages for farm workers can range from anywhere between Rs. 150 (2.40 USD) to Rs. 250 (4 USD) depending on the nature and requirement of the farming activity.  Farm water resources  Sources of water for farming needs Farmers rely on rain water as well as water from canal on Ujani dam for farming needs. Traditionally, farmers own wells that supply water to the farm land. At times, these wells are also supplied water via water pumps on nearby canal. Farmers are slowly adapting advanced irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation etc. suitable for dryland farming. Soundane has been subject of severe drought in the recent years (years 2002, 2003). During this period, farmers had to move their livestock to shared feeding facilities provided by the Government and the sugarcane factories due to food and water scarcity.  Means of Communication  Soundane's own Letter Box Few years ago, only way to communicate with the outside world was via mails. Letters were handed over to those who travelled frequently to the Taluka place (Mohol) so that they could drop the letters at the post office. Letters were then dispatched to the desired destinations. As the time progressed however, other means of communication such as telephone also became available to the villagers. Near by village Tambole is the nearest official post office (Pin code 413213) for villagers in Soundane. Soundane itself also has a small letter box where letters can be dropped. Letters are collected periodically by the postman and taken to the main Post office from where they are then dispatched to the desired destinations. Today though, mobile communication (like in any other part of the Indian sub-continent) has quickly yet quietly formed the accepted and reliable mode of communication with the outside world. Something that probably explains the state of the only letter box available in the village.  Educational Facilities  School for Kids in the village Soundane has its own school for primary education. Medium of instruction in the school is Marathi. School offers education up to the 7th standard for the students. As seen in the image, school building a single storied house like structure constructed out of stone wall and iron sheet roof. School is located right in the heart of village and is made of two separate premises. Both premises look quite similar and are located near to each other, one of the premises being older than the other one. There is no facility however for college education in the village. Village students have to reach out to other bigger towns such as Mohol to get a college education.  Villages in Vicinity  Villages bordering Soundane include the following: 1\\\\. Tambole, 2.

The Acadian culture consisted primarily of farming; remains of marshland dykes, that cover the entire coast of the community, indicate their advanced farming systems. Once an old Acadian settlement, Masstown was the site of the first Acadian church in Nova Scotia, and a cairn is erected at the nearby United Church to commemorate this former landmark.

The state highway runs from Interstate 195 (I-195) in Arbutus north to MD 144 in Catonsville. MD 166 consists of two sections: a short freeway section that serves as a northern continuation of I-195 and provides access to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and a segment of Rolling Road, a major north-south highway in western Baltimore County. Rolling Road dates to the colonial era as a highway used to transport tobacco from plantations to river ports. North Rolling Road, which connects Catonsville with Woodlawn and Milford Mill, has always been a county highway. South Rolling Road was constructed as a state highway by the early 1920s between what were to become U.S. Route 1 and US 40. Parts of South Rolling Road were transferred to county maintenance after they were severed by the construction of I-95 and a freeway relocation of the southern end of MD 166 in the early 1970s. Route description MD 166 begins as a continuation of the four-lane Metropolitan Boulevard freeway at the northern terminus of I-195 just north of the Interstate's interchange with I-95. The highway passes under Selford Road and has a partial interchange with UMBC Boulevard that allows access to the UMBC campus to and from the south. MD 166 curves northwest over the ramp from southbound UMBC Boulevard and the freeway's carriageways split around a park and ride facility as the freeway terminates at South Rolling Road. MD 166 continues north along two-lane undivided South Rolling Road. The highway meets the western end of MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue) and passes between Rolling Road Golf Course on the east and the Catonsville Campus of the Community College of Baltimore County to the west. MD 166 temporarily expands to four lanes between Valley Road and Bloomsbury Avenue, between which the highway passes Catonsville High School. The highway narrows and passes along the edge of the Central Catonsville and Summit Park Historic District before veering north at Hilton Avenue and reaching its northern terminus at MD 144 (Frederick Road) west of downtown Catonsville. View north along MD 166 (Rolling Road) in Catonsville There are two disjoint sections of South Rolling Road that are not part of MD 166. The highway begins in the village of St. Denis on a curve at East Street and South Street. South Street leads west and then south to US 1 and East Street provides access to the St. Denis station on MARC's Camden Line. South Rolling Road crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision just west of the train station. The highway makes a right-angle turn east at Railroad Avenue and another right-angle turn north at Cedar Avenue and Arlington Avenue; the latter street provides access to the train station from the north. South Rolling Road meets the western end of Francis Avenue before reaching a dead end adjacent to the I-195-I-95 interchange. South Rolling Road begins again on the north side of the interchange next to the UMBC Training Centers and Tech Incubators. The highway makes a turn at Selford Road just west of that road's crossing of MD 166 and meets the state highway at a pair of carriageways on either side of the park and ride facility. View north along MD 166 (Metropolitan Boulevard) from the Selford Road overpass in Catonsville North Rolling Road begins at MD 144 (Frederick Road) several blocks west of MD 166 on the west side of Catonsville. The two-lane road heads north through a residential area where it intersects Edmondson Avenue. North Rolling Road expands to a four-lane divided highway at Old Frederick Road and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) within a commercial area. The highway becomes an undivided, two-lane road with wide lanes and passes through residential areas in the western part of Woodlawn. North Rolling Road expands to four lanes again at Crosby Road and gains a divider as it passes under I-70. The highway enters a commercial area featuring Security Square Mall and an intersection with Security Boulevard, which heads east as MD 122. North Rolling Road continues as a four-lane undivided highway with occasional center turn lane as it passes between business parks to the east and residential subdivisions to the west. The highway reduces to two lanes north of Windsor Boulevard in the Windsor Mill area. North Rolling Road has an oblique intersection with Windsor Mill Road in the village of Hebbville and intersects Milford Mill Road before meeting MD 26 (Liberty Road) at the hamlet of Rockdale east of Randallstown. The highway reaches its northern terminus at Old Court Road between Randallstown and Pikesville. MD 166 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. North Rolling Road is also a principal arterial from MD 144 in Catonsville to MD 26 at Rockdale. History Several rolling roads were established in Maryland in the early 18th century for the transportation of tobacco in casks, or hogsheads, from plantations to river ports. These casks were pulled along the road by slaves and later oxen before this method of freight transportation was made obsolete by the introduction of sturdy wagons. The rolling road in western Baltimore County connecting Rockdale with Elkridge, which was likely built in 1714 by William Summers, is the only such road in Maryland whose name survived to modern times. South Rolling Road was improved as a macadam road from Washington Boulevard (later US 1) to Frederick Road (later US 40 and now MD 144) by 1921. In St. Denis, the highway that was to become MD 166 followed modern Arlington Avenue and East Street south across a grade crossing of the B&O; Railroad to its southern terminus at Washington Boulevard. MD 166 was moved to modern South Rolling Road when the highway's bridge over the railroad was built in 1931. By 1933, North Rolling Road was upgraded to an improved county highway. North Rolling Road would be expanded to a divided highway in Woodlawn around 1981. Unlike South Rolling Road, North Rolling Road has never been a part of the state highway system. The next major changes to MD 166 came in the early 1970s with the construction of I-95 and Metropolitan Boulevard, the latter of which went under construction in 1969. When I-95 was completed through Arbutus in 1971, South Rolling Road was split. Metropolitan Boulevard opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford Road overpass in August 1974. South Rolling Road was truncated in St. Denis by the construction of the US 1 ramps. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46--disjoint from the section between MD 295 and Baltimore/Washington International Airport--from when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. MD 166 was extended to US 1 and replaced that segment of MD 46 by 1981. MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus when I-195 was completed in June 1990.

Design and development The Hawk was designed in 1933 by F.G. Miles. Unusual for the time, the Hawk was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with wings designed to be folded. It had an open cockpit for two in tandem. The prototype powered by a 95 hp ADC Cirrus IIIA engine was built by Philips and Powis Limited (now known as Miles Aircraft) at Woodley Aerodrome and first flew on 29 March 1933.Jackson 1988, p. 43. The aircraft sold well for the time, the price of only 395 pounds and the benefits of a monoplane (it did not need to be rigged). A number of one off variants were built, including a cabin monoplane (M.2A), a long-range single-seater (M.2B) and three-seat versions for joy riding (M.2D). In 1934, due to the appearance of the inverted de Havilland Gipsy Major engine, an improved version was introduced, the Miles Hawk Major. This was accompanied by a special racing version, in which the front seat was removed to allow fitting a longer and more powerful six- cylinder de Havilland Gipsy Six, the Miles Hawk Speed Six.

Plot summary When Conrad Stipe, creator of the popular science fiction TV series Beyond Earth, is gunned down outside a Beyond Earth convention, Monk and Natalie are called in, and Monk soon finds that there is more going on behind the scenes than is visible to the naked eye, and also learns that his brother Ambrose is a big expert on the show. Plot synopsis Early one morning, Natalie Teeger shows up for work only to find her boss, Adrian Monk, in a state of nervous collapse because of a near-invisible coffee stain on his carpet. Monk begs to stay with Natalie for a few days while he is having his carpet replaced. Natalie is trying to think of a tactful way to refuse, when they get a call about a corpse. Monk and Natalie head down to the headquarters of Burgerville, a national fast-food chain. After taking a bit of trouble to get Monk through the building's revolving door, Captain Stottlemeyer introduces them to an old friend, an ex-cop named Archie Applebaum, who now works as a security guard, and who found the body. It is revealed that Archie and Stottlemeyer were close friends at the police academy. They are taken up to the fifth floor. Stottlemeyer explains that the victim is Brandon Lorber, Burgerville's CEO. Lorber was found in his office, shot three times √† la the Mozambique Drill ‚Äì e.g. twice in the chest and once in the head, plus a through-and-through bullet hole in his right hand. When Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer arrive in Lorber's office, Lieutenant Disher tells them that the M.O. indicates a professional killer. As Archie said he never heard anything, the killer probably used a silencer. Stottlemeyer notes that the killer, despite being seen on security cameras, obscured his face so that they couldn't get a good look at him. Monk says that despite all the evidence to the contrary, Brandon Lorber was not murdered: he died of a heart attack. He points out that Lorber's shirt is wrinkled, from when Lorber grabbed at his chest. He probably flailed around and tried to get to his ticker pills, but he never made it (in the process of flailing around, he also knocked a box of cigars off his desk and onto the floor). Monk reveals that Lorber had been dead for several minutes when he was shot - there isn't enough blood from the bullet holes, and there would have been more blood present if his heart was still functioning when he was shot. Since it's not technically a homicide, Stottlemeyer halts the investigation and, at Monk's suggestion, he appoints Disher as the head of a \\"Special Desecration Unit\\" to take over the case. Natalie prepares to receive Monk as a houseguest, but he flees the house when he finds he's sharing it with Julie's pet hamster. Instead, he goes to stay with his brother Ambrose. The next morning, Monk and Natalie arrive at a crime scene outside the San Francisco Airporter Motor Inn. The victim is Conrad Stipe, the creator of the cult science fiction TV series Beyond Earth (a parody of the real-life Star Trek), shot and killed climbing out of a taxi while arriving at a Beyond Earth convention. Four surveillance cameras around the parking lot have caught the shooter, dressed as Mr. Snork, one of the protagonists of the show. They watch the tape, in which Stipe climbs out of the cab that has delivered him to the airport, at which point the killer emerges from a hiding spot behind a dumpster, shoots him once in the chest, and runs into the neighboring convention center. Stottlemeyer says he needs Monk's eye for detail to spot the \\"needle in a stack of needles.\\" While they are examining the scene, Stottlemeyer also informs Monk that the medical examiner has found that Lorber had been dead for ten minutes when he was shot. Investigating the convention, Adrian is appalled at the fans' loony devotion to a bad TV show, and even more appalled to learn that Ambrose is a devoted \\"Earther\\". Nonetheless, he learns that there are a large number of suspects, and finds that the producers are planning to revamp Beyond Earth, making it possible that Stipe was killed by a fan who was angry at him for \\"selling out\\" to Hollywood and allowing a less- than-faithful adaptation of the show to be made. Monk and Natalie learn that Stipe had just arrived from the Belmont Hotel in Union Square when he was killed. When they head there, they find Stottlemeyer and Disher investigating the murder of a man in another hotel room. Monk quickly figures that the man was a diamond dealer and was killed in another room, and exposes the maid who discovered the body as the killer's accomplice. While waiting for Stottlemeyer and Disher (as they arrest the exposed killer), Monk and Natalie interview Kingston Mills, the new executive producer of Beyond Earth, and the new show's star, Judson Beck. It seems possible that Mills killed Stipe to avoid paying him his cut from the show's profits, but Mills denies having any involvement with the murder, and admits that he and Stipe never actually talked to each other about anything. Stottlemeyer and Disher meet them in the hotel lobby, and Randy takes off to check out some leads involving the desecration of Brandon Lorber. He brings up some new details he's discovered and some likely suspects, though Monk wonders why any of them would desecrate a corpse with the precision of an assassin. Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer meanwhile question Arianna Stipe, Conrad Stipe's ex-wife, and Howard Egger, Arianna's divorce lawyer. Arianna mentions that she is suing her ex-husband's estate for half of the profits from the new show, and also reveals that she was in flight when Conrad was killed. While they are there, Monk also exposes Arianna and Egger as lovers. Adrian and Natalie receive a copy of the surveillance tape depicting the shooting, and take it back to Ambrose's house. Examining the surveillance video, Ambrose notes that the killer's costume is inaccurate in several key details: the Mr. Snork ears the killer is wearing are a pair of ears from the pilot, yet he is also wearing a second season nasal appendage (which can be told apart from a pilot appendage because the pilot version was much harrier). Adrian scornfully dismisses these as insignificant. Natalie is appalled, since Adrian normally solves cases based on things which other detectives dismiss. Adrian is paying attention to other interesting details: *If the killer was a disgruntled fan, why does he show almost no emotion as he pulls the trigger? *Why does the shooter show such a professional aim, like he's a sharpshooter? *Why did the killer choreograph things so that he would be captured killing Stipe by not one, but four cameras, like he wanted everyone to see exactly who he was? *Why does the killer not even blink, like an inexperienced shooter would? Ambrose quickly figures that the shooter's uniform is brand-new and was purchased less than 48 hours before Stipe was shot. Adrian and Natalie meet Stottlemeyer and Disher at the Filbert Steps to tell them about their lead. When they arrive, Stottlemeyer and Disher are examining the murder of Phil Bisson, a cab driver who was shot and killed during a robbery gone very wrong. Disher notes that the medical examiner figures Bisson was killed at around 1:00 AM the night before. It is believed that Bisson was flagged down by a gunman, who forced him out of his cab at gunpoint, led him over to a deserted lot out of sight from the street, shot him in the head, took his money, and fled. But Monk is convinced the scene was staged: for one thing, Bisson never told his dispatcher that he was picking someone up, plus the cab appears to have made a U-turn to face the street. Monk then blows up and pops a plastic bag, emitting a loud gunshot-like bang, and wonders, why did none of the residents nearby hear a gunshot during the night? It indicates that the killer used a silencer, which is not something that would be carried around by the types of people most likely to carry out these kinds of robberies. As Natalie tells Stottlemeyer and Disher everything they have learned on the Stipe case thanks to Ambrose, Monk looks inside the cab, and when he next looks out, he declares to all that the cabbie was killed by the same man who desecrated Brandon Lorber. When Stottlemeyer asks him who is responsible, Monk then declares that both crimes were the work of the man who killed Stipe. To prove his point, Monk produces a piece of gum in the backseat of the cab. He notes that it appears two days old, proving that Conrad Stipe was in this cab recently - the piece of chewing gum in Bisson's cab is identical to a piece of gum that Monk noticed in the cab Stipe took from his hotel to the convention on the morning he was killed. To prove that Lorber's death is connected to them, Monk produces a candy wrapper and reveals that it came from a bowl of coffee candies in Lorber's office. Recalling that Randy and Stottlemeyer helped themselves to coffee candies from this bowl, Monk figures the shooter must have taken one for himself. While the taxicab is towed to be analyzed by the crime lab, Monk and Natalie examine a shredded document found on Lorber's desk. Monk notes that the document was planted ‚Äì the document had a regular paper clip, but Lorber had a unique color-coded system of organizing his files. It also is badly streaked, meaning it was a document shredded and then somehow put back together. They talk to the forensics accountant, who tells them about some of Burgerville's financial irregularities and reveals that the company is on the verge of collapse (the accountant likens it to a repeat of the Enron scandal). Returning upstairs, Monk says he's solved the case. =Here's what happened= Someone close to Lorber hired a hit man to kill him, but when the hit man arrived, Lorber had been dead for at least 10 minutes. The hit man shot Lorber's body to make it look like he'd done his job, so he could collect the rest of his fee. Afterwards, the hit man caught a taxi to the airport, a taxi driven by Phil Bisson. After Bisson dropped the assassin off, he picked up Conrad Stipe, and took Stipe from the airport back to his hotel. The hit man must have dropped something incriminating in the cab, and had to kill both Stipe and the cabbie because they would have figured out what the object meant. Natalie realizes that it would explain why someone would shoot Stipe and make sure to be seen on not one but four security cameras - he wanted to be sure the police would look the wrong way. It also explains why Stipe's killer looked so relaxed when he aimed. And it also explains the costume's inaccuracies that Ambrose noted when observing the tape - the hit man didn't know anything about the little details of the show. Stottlemeyer is skeptical, but Monk continues to search for the person who wanted Lorber dead. Monk and Natalie head down to Burgerville's building to question Andrew Cahill, the company's CFO and acting CEO. He admits that he has been cooperating with a Justice Department investigation into Burgerville's financial practices, and has been granted immunity from prosecution while testifying about the financial misdeeds Lorber committed. When asked if Lorber had any enemies, Cahill tells them to check out Lorber's wife Veronica. On their way down, Monk tests a shredder in Lorber's office, and determines that the shredded document found on Lorber's desk came from Cahill's shredder, indicating that Cahill is lying and also is part of the embezzlement scheme. When Monk and Natalie talk to Veronica Lorber, their interview goes awry since Monk is too distracted by the animal trophy heads on one of the walls in their house. Nonetheless, Veronica contradicts Cahill, and says that Lorber was not involved with the financial scandal and Cahill was responsible. Monk uses this and a few other things that he's noticed to figure that Andrew Cahill and Veronica are secret lovers, something that causes Natalie to note the number of similarities between Veronica Lorber and Arianna Stipe. Stottlemeyer later reprimands Monk for the offending things he told Veronica, though Monk defends himself, stating that Veronica's and Cahill's complaints about him don't matter, given that the former commits adultery and the latter is an embezzler. The next morning, Monk's theory about Lorber and Stipe getting shot by the same person is thrown into question. Monk and Natalie head back to the San Francisco Airporter, where they are once again at a crime scene outside the convention center and Disher is once again talking to a frantic witness. This time, however, the victim is Kingston Mills. Stottlemeyer and Disher try to coax Judson Beck into getting out of his car, but Beck refuses, forcing Randy to drag him from the scene. It appears that Mills arrived at the convention in his chauffeured car, and as soon as he got out, a gunman dressed as Mr. Snork shot him in the shoulder. Mills tried to run, but the shooter shot him in the leg and blew him off his feet, then stepped up to the victim and shot him in the back, fatally. Monk has only two theories: A) the hit man is trying to lead them astray or B) this is a copycat killing committed by someone taking advantage of the publicity caused by Stipe's murder, although Stottlemeyer insists that both shootings are connected, as this shooter wore a Beyond Earth costume identical to the first shooter's one. Monk however, notices a crucial clue: Mills was shot three times, and only the last bullet was fatal, but Conrad Stipe was shot only once (in the heart). Also, whereas in the Stipe shooting, the killer made sure to be seen, the Mills shooting had the killer sometimes get obscured by other objects. Adrian and Natalie head home to show Ambrose the tape from shooting #2. Watching the tape, Ambrose adds that the second gunman's Mr. Snork uniform is accurate in every detail, and also, this shooter carried his handgun like a Beyond Earth weapon, and not like an ordinary handgun. Adrian congratulates Ambrose, and mentions that he's revealed the killer to be a man named Ernest Pinchuk, the leader of the \\"Galactic Uprising,\\" a fan group protesting the new Beyond Earth show. Ambrose also notes that Ernest is speaking a fictional Beyond Earth constructed language called Dratch, and provides them an English translation of what the shooter says on the tape. With some help from the Berkeley Police Department, Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher arrest Ernest. They notice that Ernest is so devoted to Beyond Earth that he's even converted his own living room into a control room modeled off one of the sets from the show. As Ernest Pinchuk is interrogated, Monk continues to insist that the second killing was a copycat killing, and Ernest didn't kill Conrad Stipe. When Stottlemeyer insists that the M.O.'s are identical, Adrian has an epiphany: he, Ambrose, and Ernest are all the same ‚Äì they live by a set of rules which, incomprehensible though they may be to others, make perfect sense to them and which they will not break. In other words, Ernest wouldn't be caught dead wearing an inaccurate Beyond Earth uniform. Natalie is touched, both by Adrian giving credit to his brother's observations, and showing a new empathy with the other Earthers. But Stottlemeyer is not convinced, and tells Monk that he's misread the clues. Monk, however, insists that they need to get the hit man hired to kill Lorber, and wants to find the item responsible for the deaths of Conrad Stipe and the cab driver. He and Natalie return to Burgerville's headquarters and inform Archie Applebaum that Lorber had a heart attack before he was shot, and pass the information to both Cahill and Lorber's widow. Monk and Natalie proceed to stake out the building. When Cahill is leaving the building, Natalie prepares to follow him, but Monk tells her that it wasn't Cahill, but Archie, who hired the hit man. Monk reasons that Archie must have discovered that Lorber had pillaged the company's pension plan and he wanted to exact revenge. He notes that all of the evidence points to an inside man - the fact that hit man used a security card to gain access to the building, and Archie has access to the security system. The hit man also knew where every security camera was, as Archie told him ahead of time. A few hours later, Archie calls the hit man for a meeting, angrily demanding the other half of his money back. Monk and Natalie race into the building, but they are too late: they see the hit man shoot Archie with the efficiency he shot Stipe with. He also shows his face to the camera, showing his intention to steal the videotapes. Monk tells Natalie to run while he stays behind to stall the hit man, telling her she has a daughter that needs her, and Monk has no one. But Natalie says _she_ needs Monk, and runs outside, gets in her car, and crashes it into the building just as Archie (who was wearing a bulletproof vest) saves them both by killing the hit man. Stottlemeyer and Disher arrive and talk to Archie, learning his reasons for hiring the hit man: he had never given up being a cop, and late at night, he often searched his employees' offices and desks. He discovered the report and realized that Lorber had pillaged the pension fund, and knowing that Lorber was not likely going to get hard time, had to do something about it. Meanwhile, Monk tells them all that he got the hit man to tell him what it was he dropped in the cab: on his way to the airport, the hit man dropped his BlackBerry. This was bad for him because his phone had emails between him and Archie, plus photos of Lorber and a diagram of the building. When he realized that he'd left his cell phone behind in the cab, the hit man panicked and called it from a payphone at the airport, and Conrad Stipe answered, explaining how the hit man knew that Stipe had picked up his PDA. Stipe had to be killed because the hit man couldn't risk that either he or the cabbie would scroll through the hit man's messages, or possibly turn the phone in to the police. After he killed Stipe, the hit man arranged to have the cabbie deliver the phone to him. He shot Bisson after he got his phone back. As they head home that night, Monk tells Natalie that he's touched by her devotion. Allusions to real-life events, places, or people *Whether unintentional or not, the Burgerville corporation shown in the novel is not to be confused with the fast food chain of the same name in the Vancouver, Washington metro area. *The Belmont Hotel where Monk and Natalie talk to Kingston Mills does not exist. The hotel itself is a recurring location throughout the novel series. As described in Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii, it has two towers ‚Äì one built in the 1920s and the other built in the 1970s. Based on its description, the hotel appears to be a stand-in for the Westin St. Francis on Powell Street in Union Square, with an alternate name to avoid trademark issues. The actual hotel's exterior was used in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to a Fashion Show\\", where it was supposed to be the place where Julian Hodge's fashion show is performed. =To McDonald's= *When discussing possible motives with Monk, Natalie and Stottlemeyer, Randy mentions how a consumers group revealed that Burgerville secretly added beef extract to add flavor to their fries, outraging vegans who'd been eating these fries for years. In 2000, McDonald's had come under fire from consumers after it was revealed that their fries that supposedly had no meat products in them had been flavored with beef extract. *In the same conversation, Randy also brings up an incident at another Burgerville in Pleasanton, California, where a guy spilled a cup of coffee at a drive-thru and burned his crotch, and unsuccessfully tried to sue the company. This appears to be a take on Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, aka the \\"Hot Coffee Case\\", in which a woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico spilled her cup of coffee while in her car and suffered extensive third-degree burns to her crotch. Unlike the fictitious example in the book, the plaintiff in the real case actually won (she had sued only because McDonald's did not contribute much to her medical bills). =To Enron= *When Monk and Natalie are talking to the forensics accountant, the forensics accountant describes the Burgerville financial scandal as being a repeat of the Enron scandal from 2000 to 2005, as she explains that the company is on the verge of complete collapse due to an assortment of shady business practices, like the CEO convincing the company to buy out seven restaurants of a franchise run by his own brother-in-law, overcharging franchisees for supplies and misappropriating money contributed to a marketing fund, as well as pillaged money from the pension fund, among others. =To Star Trek= Much of the information on Beyond Earth gleaned from the book appears to render it as a parody of Star Trek: *According to one of the special events listed in the Beyond Earth fan convention guide, the statement: \\"When will Trekkies and Trekkers finally give Earthies and Earthers the respect we deserve?\\" suggests that in the established story of the novel, a certain degree of rivalry exists between Star Trek and Beyond Earth fans. *The fictional Beyond Earth character Mr. Snork provides the disguise the hitman uses when he shoots Conrad Stipe, and is also the disguise used by Ernie Pinchuk when he shoots Kingston Mills two days later. He appears to be an oblique parody of Star Trek character Mr. Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy in the original series and then by Zachary Quinto in the 2009 reboot. *The name of Mr. Snork's species and fictional language, \\"Dratch,\\" is taken from Monk series writer and producer Daniel Dratch, as a series in-joke, but the language's creation and use by Pinchuk is a reference to the Klingon constructed language. *Conrad Stipe's ex-wife Arianna is said to be suing her dead husband's estate for a share of his profits from the new Beyond Earth series, even though it is being produced after they divorced. Similarly, Eileen Roddenberry, the first wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, sued her ex-husband's estate after his death, claiming rights to a share of his profits from the making of the original Star Trek series, and the subsequent spin-off series and films. *Although this book was released approximately two years before J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of Star Trek, it is possible for many Star Trek fans today who read this book to see a striking parallel in Conrad Stipe and Kingston Mills' visionary conflict of Beyond Earth, and its subsequent effect on fans, with the many creative differences between Gene Roddenberry and J.J. Abrams' own visions of Star Trek; pitting the Original Motion Picture Collection (Star Trek I-VI) against J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot. *Stottlemeyer says \\"Beam me up, Scotty,\\" when he notices the gun in Ernie Pinchuk's house, the interior of which has been authentically replicated to look like the interior of the U.S.S. Discovery, from the Beyond Earth series. The Discovery is supposed to be an equivalent to the U.S.S. Enterprise. Continuity nod Several references are made to the events of this story in later novels. In Mr. Monk Gets Even, it is noted that computer magnate Cleve Dobbs lives a few doors down from the Lorbers' house. It is also noted that Dobbs's first murder victim, Bruce Grossman, was a CEO-for-hire who took over and briefly ran Burgerville in the wake of the Brandon Lorber investigation.

A cathedral since 1669, it is dedicated to Saint Front (French: Cath√©drale Saint-Front de P√©rigueux). The cathedral's predecessor, still in operation as a church, is dedicated to Saint Stephen (French: Cath√©drale Saint-√âtienne-de-la-Cit√© de P√©rigueux). A church was first built on the site in the 4th and 5th centuries. In 976 the Bishop Frotaire had the Abbey of Saint-Front constructed on the site of the church. The abbey was consecrated in 1047. Its vaulted choir housed the tomb of Saint Front, which was sculpted in 1077 by Guimaunond, a monk of the abbey of Chaise-Dieu. This tomb was decorated with numerous precious stones and sculptures, notably an angel with a halo made of pieces of glass and is now kept in the P√©rigord Museum. The cathedral owes its name to Saint Front, the first bishop of P√©rigueux. The cathedral, in either building, was and is the seat of the Bishop of P√©rigueux and Sarlat, as the diocese has been known since 1854. Saint-Front Cathedral before the restoration by Paul Abadie. Photo taken by M√©d√©ric Mieusement before 1893. The buildings are located in the centre of P√©rigueux and Saint Front Cathedral has been classed as a French Historical Monument (monument historique) since 1840. The Saint Front Cathedral was rebuilt by architect Paul Abadie from 1852 to 1895. Only the bell tower and the crypts, both from the 12th century, were left from the previous structures. The cathedral is part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France since 1998. Architecture Domes and Turrets added on the Saint Front Cathedral by Paul Abadie in the mid-19th Century. The Saint Front Cathedral was designed on the model of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. The layout of the cathedral is in the form of a Greek cross. Its five domes with turrets show a direct architectural relationship with oriental religious buildings, which served as inspiration for the architects of Saint-Front Cathedral. The domes of Saint-Front Cathedral were once different in size, but were redesigned by architect Paul Abadie to have one size, and to be symmetrical. The pillars carrying the load of the superstructure are 6 meters wide. The domes are inaccessible to the public.

One subcategory of Okimono is the Jizai Okimono, an articulated figure often made out of bronze or iron. Okimono were normally not larger than a few centimetres. They depicted all sorts of animals, mythological beasts, humans, gods, fruit, vegetables and objects, sometimes combined with each other, in all sorts of positions. Sometimes a scene was portrayed as well, either a daily scene or from a story. Anything that could be carved or made into a small object can be used in an Okimono.

Two years later, the two-story JCPenney space was converted to Seoul Plaza, a \\"mall within a mall\\" consisting of several Korean shops and restaurants, as well as a Grand Mart supermarket. The Grand Mart closed in May 2008. Modell's closed in mid-2008. In 2005, home goods retailer Anna's Linens opened its first Maryland store at Security Square. One year later, Hecht's was converted to Macy's. In 2018, Seoul Plaza was renamed to Grand Village Plaza. On August 6, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing in October 2019 as part of a plan to close 26 stores nationwide which left Burlington and Macy's as the only anchors left. =Renovations= Privately held realty company Capital Investment Associates purchased Security Square Mall and hired Hicks & Rotner Retail, Inc. to manage leasing. The next year, as part of its plan to revitalize, and make an upscale shift in the mall, the new management team signed eight new retailers including Hecht's (a relocation from its closed store in Edmondson Village). It also redesigned other parts of the mall including the food court (in the former space of the GC cinemas that had moved to a new standalone building on the south parking lot), restrooms, and landscaping. In 1999, the mall increased security measures throughout, including the relocation of the security offices to center court. Transportation Security Square Mall is very close to Baltimore Beltway's Exit 17. While this exit cannot be accessed by motorists on I-70, there is an exit to Security Boulevard from the end of I-70 about from the mall. The parking lot of the mall is a hub for several Maryland Transit Administration bus routes. Some routes operate to other nearby locations between 1 AM and 6 AM when the mall's bus stop is closed.

Besides its Picatinny headquarters, the Armaments Center has three other research facilities, including Ben√©t Laboratories.ARDEC: Locations The Armaments Center works to develop more advanced weapons using technologies such as microwaves, lasers and nanotechnology. The Armaments Center was established in February 2019, when it was aligned with the Army Futures Command along with its senior organization, the Combat Capabilities Development Command. Before February 2019, the Armaments Center was the U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC). The Armaments Center is the R&D; center for armaments used by the U.S. Army, Special Operations Command, and other U.S. military organizations. It is one of the specialized research, development, and engineering centers within the U.S. Army Futures Command. Armaments Center's purpose is to provide battlefield supremacy for U.S. troops through ‚Äúovermatch capabilities.‚Äù Over the past 10 years, Armaments Center has developed and released more than 20 products that have provided U.S. troops with ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best‚Äù capabilities, compared with products from foreign military and other U.S. defense organizations.NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology The Armaments Center is the lead research, development and engineering of systems solutions to arm those who defend the nation against all current and future threats, both at home and abroad. Armaments Center is broken into a number of directorates such as \\"Weapons Systems and Technology Directorate\\" and \\"Munitions Systems and Technology Directorate\\".ARDEC: Organization History The Armaments Center traces its history to the creation of the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Center (ARRADCOM) in 1977. Their mission was to create new and improve old weapons and munitions. Among their early work was modelling of the M1 Abrams tank. In 1983, ARRADCOM's original mission was handed to the U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command (AMCCOM) at Rock Island Arsenal. However, the original weapons and munitions R&D; mission remained at Picatinny after being renamed the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Center (ARDC). In 1986, a further reorganization of all of the Army's R&D; centers caused ARDC to become ARDEC. This name was retained when the group was transferred again to the Tank-automotive and Armament Command (TACOM) in 1994, and again to the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) in 2003. Among the many systems the Armaments Center worked on over its history is the Patriot missile, the fire control systems and the ammunition for the M2 Bradley, the M1 Abrams, and the M712 Copperhead anti-tank artillery missile. More recently, ARDEC has worked on bunker defeat munitions, the XM107 sniper rifle, the M919 round for the M242 Bushmaster, the M830 HEAT munition, the M211 and M212 countermeasure flares, the M4 carbine, and many other systems. Efforts to diversify the Armaments Center revenue stream have led to a growth in non-Army revenue from about $60 million in FY 2001 to $140 million in FY07. Overall revenue has increased from approximately $600 million in FY 2001 to around $1.2 billion in FY 2007. Designated as the benchmark for the Army in technology transfer, ARDEC has had since FY 2005 approximately 75 percent of its technology projects transition from research into customer funded development. The Armaments Center has received awards and recognition based on customer satisfaction and perceived value including Value Engineering Accomplishments of Merit. Over the past five years, The Armaments Center has won 13 of the Army‚Äôs ‚Äú10 Greatest Inventions of the Year‚Äù awards. In 2003, the various Army RD&E; centers were put under the Research, Development and Engineering Command located in Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. More Recently in 2019, the United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center became a center under the new Army Future's Command and became known as the Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center. .

For multi- line phone systems in general, see private branch exchange or key telephone system. A Multi-Line Extension, or MLX telephone, is a no-longer-manufactured series of digital telephone used with several PBX systems sold throughout the 1980s and 1990s by AT&T.; This series is notable for the sheer quantity of devices operating in the field, and for its after-market continuing long after the manufacturers stopped making them. Their popularity has also contributed to the existence of a sizeable refurbishment market. These phones are typically used with the AT&T; Merlin PBX system, originally known as the American Bell Merlin, also sold under the Lucent/Avaya names. The systems they work with include the Merlin Legend and Merlin Magix. A similar style of phones, with the model MLS, was designed to work on the AT&T; Partner systems, but could also be used on the Merlins with optional expansion modules. Although there are several versions of MLX telephones, all of them resemble typical business telephones, with anywhere from 30 to 80 buttons on their keypads. Their most common usage is in offices. Communication protocol MLX telephones use an unpublished digital communications protocol based on ISDN S interface. They connect to their host system using an 8-position 8-conductor connector, however only the middle 4 positions are actually used. The processing for an MLX telephone is done principally by its host - the keypad and display is essentially the equivalent of a dumb terminal contained inside the set. There are provisions for two independent two-way voice channels and the data channel (similar to ISDN BRI) going to a single telephone set. Because each channel is two-way, the two voice channels are rarely used simultaneously, except for example, when a voice \\"paging\\" announcement comes over the speakerphone while somebody is using the line, or if an additional \\"multi-function-module\\" accessory is attached to the phone that permits the second voice channel to be used as a normal analog telephone line, such as for a modem or fax machine. Variations Several models of MLX telephones are in widespread operation today, the principal difference being the number of programmable \\"feature\\" buttons on the phone. A \\"feature\\" button is an unlabeled button that doesn't come assigned to any specific purpose, but which is meant to be labeled with a paper label and can be programmed either by the phone user or system administrator to perform various functions (such as speed dial, call forwarding, a private line, etc.) The number in the model indicates how many feature buttons there are (for example, the MLX-10D has 10 feature buttons). There are models with 5, 10, 16, 20, and 28 buttons. The model with 20 buttons is an important exception. That model of phone is designed to be an \\"operator\\" phone. It has a much larger display screen, and also can connect to optional \\"direct station selector\\", which is a secondary console with 50 or more buttons that allows quick call transfers to any of numerous extensions. This model of telephone with its relatively large screen (approximately 24 columns by 7 rows, compared to 2 rows in the other models) can also be used in lieu of a computer for performing the system programming of the host system.

The decoration is awarded to German military personnel of all grades but is only allowed to be worn by enlisted members. The German armed forces regulations point out that \\"the Sch√ºtzenschnur is a decoration for weapons proficiency for enlisted soldiers.\\" Officers can receive the award, although it is not currently authorized to be worn on their uniforms. Foreign military members also may be awarded the badge. The German military regulation on officers still applies, permitting only enlisted members to wear the badge. History Corporal from a Prussian infantry regiment wearing a Sch√ºtzenschnur in 1894 The history of the Sch√ºtzenschnur dates back to the Eighty Years' War where Spanish troops were ordered to hang any Dutch person who carried a musket. Therefore Spanish musketeers began to carry ropes which were often carried over one shoulder. Awarding a cord as a decoration began in the early 18th century in Prussia under Frederick William I of Prussia. With the reorganization of the Prussian Army under Gerhard von Scharnhorst the Sch√ºtzenschnur became an official military award. The Reichswehr and later the Wehrmacht adapted the Sch√ºtzenschnur as an award for proficiency in marksmanship. The award existed in 12 different levels with different versions for infantry and armored troops. In 1957 the Bundesgrenzschutz introduced the Sch√ºtzenschnur. A similar decoration existed within the East German National People's Army and the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic.  Requirements for qualification  To earn the award one must successfully shoot weapons from all three classes: # Pistol (current service pistol is the P8) # Rifle (there are several rifles in service, the standard rifle is the G36) # Heavy weapon (for example machine gun (MG3) or antitank launcher (Panzerfaust 3) The awarded grade is determined by the lowest weapon qualification.(e.g. if you qualify all gold and one bronze, you are awarded the bronze.)  Classes/grades  Class 1 (Bronze) Class 2 (Silver) Class 3 (Gold) * German Armed Forces Badge for Weapons Proficiency in Bronze (Sch√ºtzenschnur in Bronze) is awarded for shooting with the rifle and the pistol and the machine pistol with at least two scores in at least bronze (medical service at least one score in at least bronze). The admissible categories of weapon depends on the branch of the service member. The category of heavy weapons (most commonly the machine gun) is not mandatory to earn the bronze badge. The rifle, pistol and machine pistol are the only weapons that require minimally score of bronze. * German Armed Forces Badge for Weapons Proficiency in Silver (Sch√ºtzenschnur in Silber) is awarded for shooting by a service member with his designated \\"light\\" weapon (pistol, rifle or machine pistol) and one of the \\"heavy\\" weapons (machine gun or Panzerfaust) with all scores at least in silver. * German Armed Forces Badge for Weapons Proficiency in Gold (Sch√ºtzenschnur in Gold) is awarded for shooting by a service member with his designated \\"light\\" weapon (pistol, rifle or machine pistol) and one of the \\"heavy\\" weapons (machine gun or Panzerfaust) with all scores at least in gold. The number of exercises depends on the chosen (or ordered) weapon and the grade of the badge. A member of the medical branch, for example, can reach the bronze badge by two exercises with the pistol. A paratrooper needs for the gold badge one exercise with the G36 rifle (or three with the G3 rifle) AND two with the MG3 machine gun (or two with the Panzerfaust).

The IOC shortlisted four of the seven applicant cities‚ÄîChicago, United States; Tokyo, Japan; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Madrid, Spain; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic‚Äîon June 4, 2008 during a meeting in Athens, Greece. This was followed by an intensive bidding process which finished with the election of Rio de Janeiro at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009. Along with Tokyo, Madrid earned the top scores during the Applicant phase, after a detailed study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between May 4 and May 9, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Madrid to assess the conditions of the city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Rio de Janeiro won the final round by a margin of 34 votes over Madrid in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC. The Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC) confirmed Madrid as its candidate city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 30, 2007. This is the city's second consecutive bid and its third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1972 and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Geographic issues were highlighted as a major problem for Madrid due to recent Olympic Games in Europe as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. If successful, it would be the second Olympics hosted in Spain, after the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona. TOC  Candidature process  After failing to achieve victory in the election process of the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the city council of Madrid decided to nominate it a candidate to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on July 3, 2006. The nomination was encouraged by statements of the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Jacques Rogge, that European cities would still have a chance to host the 2016 Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched the bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. On May 30, 2007, the candidature was formalized by the Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC) with claims to be \\"radically new\\" and more prepared than the city's last attempt to host the Olympics. The IOC announced that seven cities‚ÄîBaku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo‚Äîwere submitted by their respective NOCs to bid for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Madrid bid committee attended the 2016 Applicant Cities' Seminar in Lausanne, Switzerland, on October 18, 2007, where it learnt more about the bidding process. The Application Files, which contain the answers and guarantees requested by the IOC's 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure and Questionnaire, were returned by all seven applicant cities to the IOC on January 14, 2008. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group and the IOC Executive Board, at the latter meeting to decide which cities would be accepted as candidate cities. On June 4, 2008, the IOC announced that Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, and Madrid were selected to the next bidding phase, during a meeting in Athens, Greece. This decision was based on a report by a special IOC Working Group of experts, after a thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the files submitted by the applicant cities. Each city's potential for staging successful Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2016 was assessed by the Working Group according to eleven criteria: government support, legal issues and public opinion; general infrastructure; sport venues; Olympic village; environment conditions and impact; accommodation; transport concept; safety and security; experience from past sport events; finance; and overall project and legacy. From August 5 - 26, 2008, the bidding committees from the four candidate cities participated in the Olympic Games Observer Program, during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. Madrid officials also followed the completion of the 2008 Summer Paralympics. The IOC announced that it had received the Candidature Files of all four candidate cities on February 12, 2009. The Madrid 2016 Candidate File has three volumes covering 600 pages divided into 17 topics, with 671 guarantees and 80 images. According to the Madrid bid committee, the dossier was produced by more than 150 people, who invested more than 16,000 hours of work.

Madrid has a strong sports culture, hosting three football (soccer) teams and two basketball teams; the most successful being Real Madrid C.F. which plays in Estadio Santiago Bernab√©u. Madrid hosted the 1982 FIFA World Cup final. The cycling classic Vuelta a Espa√±a final stages are held in Madrid as Paris serves for the Tour de France. Madrid's bid enjoyed extremely high levels of support from its citizens. A recent poll put Madrid's support levels at 92.6%, and 25,000 volunteers had signed up to demonstrate their support for the city's candidacy. Madrid 2016 also had over 60 corporate sponsors. A contest was run to submit a logo for the games. A number were chosen from which the public could vote, finalizing the final three. The official logo was revealed in late September 2007, which was elected by a group of experts. The logo is named \\"Corle\\" and represents a hand in the colors of the Olympics, welcoming foreigners to the games. The silhouette of an 'M', representing Madrid, is also hidden in the hand. It was designed by an Argentine, Joaquin Malle. The initial design was merely an outline of the hand; the final version bursts with color rings within the hand. Madrid previously bid for the 2012 Olympics. Changes were made to the 2012 bid, while the city expected to build on its high reputation from its previous bids. In the 2012 bid, experts considered Madrid's bid very strong, and it actually placed first in the third round (before being eliminated in the fourth round). The 2012 bid was overall second in technical evaluation, with a rating of 8.3. Madrid was ranked first in seven categories: Government support, legal issues and public opinion; General infrastructure; Environment; Sports venues; Olympic Village; Transport concept; and Overall project and legacy. When Madrid was promoted to the 2016 \\"Candidate City\\" phase in June 2008, it ranked second in the evaluation of the technical bid, with a score of 8.1 (on a 10-point scale). The city was ranked a close fourth on two predicting indice scales, primarily because of geographical factors. Coghen has emphasized in interviews that \\"cities, not continents\\" are chosen to host. Madrid repeatedly described itself as the \\"safe bid\\".  Candidature project  The competition venues for the Games would have been sited in two main clusters. The Eastern zone would have been the location of the Olympic Stadium, Aquatic Centre, the Olympic Village, the Real Madrid Arena at Ciudad Real Madrid (which would have held basketball events), and the IFEMA Fairgrounds (eight sports plus the Press Center).Madrid 2016 Extends Competition Venues Area The River Zone aside the Manzanares River would have hosted the venues for rowing, beach volleyball, archery, cycling, tennis, modern pentathlon, triathlon, equestrian and rhythmic gymnastics. After the games, the river bank would have become a public park celebrating sport, culture and music. The city completed a swimming and tennis venues (Caja M√°gica - The Magic Box) and looking to expand and modernize existing sporting facilities. Bernabeu, and Estadio La Peineta are likely venues should Madrid win the games. A new center for sport with the aim of improving facilities for disabled athletes will also be created as part of the push for the Paralympic Games.Spanish Olympic Committee approves Madrid's bid for 2016 Summer Games Precedence The Madrid bid had strong advantages that were publicly commented upon following the selection of Rio de Janeiro on 2 October 2009. The two previous geographic locations of the London 2012 Summer Olympics and the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics put the Madrid bid at a disadvantage. This would have staged three consecutive Olympic games in Europe, historically unprecedended.Madrid bid for 2016 Olympics gets approval See also *Madrid bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics *Madrid bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics  References   External links   ;Official documents  2016 Summer Olympics bids Sport in Madrid 2016 ","title":"Madrid bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"13186780","title":"List of countries by natural gas proven reserves"},{"id":"13186787","text":"A number of different formulae, more than hundred, have been proposed as means of calculating price indexes. While price index formulae all use price and possibly quantity data, they aggregate these in different ways. A price index aggregates various combinations of base period prices (p_0), later period prices (p_t), base period quantities (q_0), and later period quantities (q_t). Price index numbers are usually defined either in terms of (actual or hypothetical) expenditures (expenditure = price * quantity) or as different weighted averages of price relatives (p_t/p_0). These tell the relative change of the price in question. Two of the most commonly used price index formulae were defined by German economists and statisticians √âtienne Laspeyres and Hermann Paasche, both around 1875 when investigating price changes in Germany. Laspeyres Developed in 1871 by √âtienne Laspeyres, the formula: : P_{L}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{t}\\\\cdot q_{0}\\\\right)}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{0}\\\\cdot q_{0}\\\\right)} compares the total cost of the same basket of final goods q_0 at the old and new prices. Paasche Developed in 1874 by Hermann Paasche, the formula: :P_{P}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{t}\\\\cdot q_{t}\\\\right)}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{0}\\\\cdot q_{t}\\\\right)} compares the total cost of a new basket of goods q_t at the old and new prices. Geometric means The geometric means index: :P_{GM}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{p_{i,0}\\\\cdot q_{i,0}}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{0}\\\\cdot q_{0}\\\\right)} incorporates quantity information through the share of expenditure in the base period. Unweighted indices Unweighted, or \\"elementary\\", price indices only compare prices of a single type of good between two periods. They do not make any use of quantities or expenditure weights. They are called \\"elementary\\" because they are often used at the lower levels of aggregation for more comprehensive price indices.PPI manual, 598. In such a case, they are not indices but merely an intermediate stage in the calculation of an index. At these lower levels, it is argued that weighting is not necessary since only one type of good is being aggregated. However this implicitly assumes that only one type of the good is available (e.g. only one brand and one package size of frozen peas) and that it has not changed in quality etc between time periods. =Carli= Developed in 1764 by Gian Rinaldo Carli, an Italian economist, this formula is the arithmetic mean of the price relative between a period t and a base period 0. :P_{C}=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot\\\\sum\\\\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}} On 17 August 2012 the BBC Radio 4 program More or Lesshttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rzwrl, starting at 17:58 minutes noted that the Carli index, used in part in the British retail price index, has a built-in bias towards recording inflation even when over successive periods there is no increase in prices overall. =Dutot= In 1738 French economist Nicolas Dutot proposed using an index calculated by dividing the average price in period t by the average price in period 0. :P_{D}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot\\\\sum p_{t}}{\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot\\\\sum p_{0}}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum p_{t}}{\\\\sum p_{0}} =Jevons= In 1863, English economist William Stanley Jevons proposed taking the geometric average of the price relative of period t and base period 0.PPI manual, 602. When used as an elementary aggregate, the Jevons index is considered a constant elasticity of substitution index since it allows for product substitution between time periods.PPI manual, 596. :P_{J}=\\\\left(\\\\prod\\\\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}}\\\\right)^{1/n} This is the formula that was used for the old Financial Times stock market index (the predecessor of the FTSE 100 Index). It was inadequate for that purpose. In particular, if the price of any of the constituents were to fall to zero, the whole index would fall to zero. That is an extreme case; in general the formula will understate the total cost of a basket of goods (or of any subset of that basket) unless their prices all change at the same rate. Also, as the index is unweighted, large price changes in selected constituents can transmit to the index to an extent not representing their importance in the average portfolio. =Harmonic mean of price relatives= The harmonic average counterpart to the Carli index.PPI manual, 600. The index was proposed by Jevons in 1865 and by Coggeshall in 1887.Export and Import manual, Chapter 20 p. 8 :P_{HR}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot\\\\sum\\\\frac{p_{0}}{p_{t}}} =Carruthers, Sellwood, Ward, Dal√©n index= Is the geometric mean of the Carli and the harmonic price indexes.PPI manual, 597. In 1922 Fisher wrote that this and the Jevons were the two best unweighted indexes based on Fisher's test approach to index number theory.Export and Import manual, Chapter 20, p. 8 :P_{CSWD}=\\\\sqrt{P_{C}\\\\cdot P_{HR}} =Ratio of harmonic means= The ratio of harmonic means or \\"Harmonic means\\" price index is the harmonic average counterpart to the Dutot index. :P_{RH}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\frac{n}{p_{0}}}{\\\\sum\\\\frac{n}{p_{t}}} Bilateral formulae = Marshall-Edgeworth = The Marshall-Edgeworth index, credited to Marshall (1887) and Edgeworth (1925),PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378. is a weighted relative of current period to base period sets of prices. This index uses the arithmetic average of the current and based period quantities for weighting. It is considered a pseudo-superlative formula and is symmetric.PPI manual, 620. The use of the Marshall-Edgeworth index can be problematic in cases such as a comparison of the price level of a large country to a small one. In such instances, the set of quantities of the large country will overwhelm those of the small one.PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378 :P_{ME}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\left[p_{t}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\\\\right)\\\\right]}{\\\\sum\\\\left[p_{0}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}(q_{0}+q_{t})\\\\right]}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\left[p_{t}\\\\cdot\\\\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\\\\right)\\\\right]}{\\\\sum\\\\left[p_{0}\\\\cdot\\\\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\\\\right)\\\\right]} = Superlative indices = Superlative indices treat prices and quantities equally across periods. They are symmetrical and provide close approximations of cost of living indices and other theoretical indices used to provide guidelines for constructing price indices. All superlative indices produce similar results and are generally the favored formulas for calculating price indices.ILO CPI manual, Chapter 1, p. 2. A superlative index is defined technically as \\"an index that is exact for a flexible functional form that can provide a second-order approximation to other twice-differentiable functions around the same point.\\"Export and Import manual, Chapter 18, p. 23.  Fisher  The change in a Fisher index from one period to the next is the geometric mean of the changes in Laspeyres's and Paasche's indexes between those periods, and these are chained together to make comparisons over many periods: :P_{F}=\\\\sqrt{P_{L}\\\\cdot P_{P}} This is also called Fisher's \\"ideal\\" price index.  T√∂rnqvist  The T√∂rnqvist or T√∂rnqvist-Theil index is the geometric average of the n price relatives of the current to base period prices (for n goods) weighted by the arithmetic average of the value shares for the two periods.PPI manual, p. 610\\"Tornqvist Index and other Log-change Index Numbers\\" , Statistics New Zealand Glossary of Common Terms. :P_{T}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\frac{p_{i,0}\\\\cdot q_{i,0}}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{0}\\\\cdot q_{0}\\\\right)}+\\\\frac{p_{i,t}\\\\cdot q_{i,t}}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{t}\\\\cdot q_{t}\\\\right)}\\\\right]}  Walsh  The Walsh price index is the weighted sum of the current period prices divided by the weighted sum of the base period prices with the geometric average of both period quantities serving as the weighting mechanism: :P_{W}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{t}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{q_{0}\\\\cdot q_{t}}\\\\right)}{\\\\sum\\\\left(p_{0}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{q_{0}\\\\cdot q_{t}}\\\\right)} Notes References * Export and Import Price Index Manual * PPI Manual Price indices Price indices Price indices ","title":"List of price index formulas"},{"id":"13186801","text":"Irving \\"Irv\\" Bemoras (November 18, 1930 ‚Äì November 1, 2007) was an American basketball player.Trevor Jensen. \\"Irving Bemoras: 1930‚Äì2007\\".

Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the exophilin subfamily of Rab effector proteins. The protein forms a ternary complex with the small Ras-related GTPase Rab27A in its GTP-bound form and the motor protein myosin Va. A similar protein complex in mouse functions to tether pigment-producing organelles called melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton in melanocytes, and is required for visible pigmentation in the hair and skin. In melanocytic cells MLPH gene expression may be regulated by MITF.  Clinical significance  A mutation in this gene results in Griscelli syndrome type 3, which is characterized by a silver-gray hair color and abnormal pigment distribution in the hair shaft.

In East Germany, he held the rank of Armeegeneral in the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee) and was Minister of Defense of the GDR, a member of the Politb√ºro of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), and a deputy of the GDR's Volkskammer (parliament). Convicted for his role in the deaths of defectors along the Berlin wall, he was sentenced to seven-and-a- half years in prison after German reunification, and served his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison. He was released from prison in 1998 after serving only two years. Biography =Early life= Generalleutnant Ke√üler with Walter Ulbricht in 1966 Kessler was born into a communist family in Lauban, Lower Silesia and was raised in Chemnitz. He joined the Red Young Pioneers, the youth organization of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), at age 6 and the Young Spartacus League at 10. He later apprenticed as a motor mechanic. =Military career= Drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1940, he deserted and defected to the Soviet Red Army three weeks after the German invasion of the USSR and fought for the Soviet Union until the end of the war. Upon his desertion, he was sentenced to death in absentia by a Military tribunal and his mother was arrested and imprisoned in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. He wouldn't see her again until June 1945, shortly after the end of the war, in a reunion that he considered to be \\"one of the most eventful and beautiful days\\" of his life. Upon returning to Germany in 1945, Kessler joined the KPD in the Soviet occupation zone, which merged with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the Soviet zone in 1946 to form the SED. Also in 1946, Kessler became a member of the SED Central Committee. He was appointed Chief of the Air Forces and Air Defense (Luftstreitkr√§fte/Luftverteidigung) of the NVA in 1956, and as deputy minister of defense in 1957. He became Chief of the NVA Main Staff (Hauptstab ‚Äì General Staff) in 1967, with the rank of Generaloberst (Colonel General). Simultaneously, he also became a member of the Military Council of the United High Command of the Warsaw Pact. Kessler was promoted from Chief of the Main Political Administration (Chef der Politischen Hauptverwaltung) of the NVA to Defense Minister (with the rank of Armeegeneral) on 3 December 1985 after his predecessor, Armeegeneral Heinz Hoffmann, died of a heart attack.Flow, V.B.. \\"A New Defense Minister for the GDR.\\" December 23, 1985.http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-2-197.shtml (accessed September 8, 2007). =Conviction and imprisonment= In 1991, after the Unification of Germany, Kessler was arrested after police received information that Kessler would attempt to flee the country disguised as a Soviet officer. German police blockaded the Sperenberg Airfield to prevent Kessler's escape, but later arrested him in Berlin after changing the lock on his home and informing him that he could retrieve his keys at a local police station. He was tried in a German court for incitement to commit intentional homicide, for his role in the deaths of people who tried to flee the GDR between 1971 and 1989. On 16 September 1993, Kessler was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison. Kessler filed an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that his actions were in accordance with GDR law and meant to preserve the existence of the GDR. However, his appeal was denied largely on the basis that the GDR's policies violated international human rights.Registry of the European Court of Human Rights.

From April 2002 to June 2019 he had served as chief lobbyist and principal political strategist for the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and as the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action (NRA- ILA).NRA-ILA News Release; 1 January 2005; He oversaw eight divisions within the NRA-ILA, including Federal Affairs; State & Local Government Affairs; Public Affairs; Grassroots; Finance; Research; Conservation; Wildlife & Natural Resources; and Office of Legislative Counsel. Cox was also chairman of NRA‚Äôs Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF),NRA-ILA Political Victory Fund; the association's political action committee. Strategic differences and management struggles within NRA leadership led to Christopher Cox leaving the organization in June 2019. On June 20, 2019, the New York Times reported that Chris Cox \\"had been placed on administrative leave\\",New York Times reported and he subsequently resigned on June 26, 2019.Katie Zezima and Beth Reinhard. NRA‚Äôs top lobbyist resigns amid chaos at the gun rights organization. Washington Post, 26 June 2019.  Early life and education  Cox attended The Baylor School for grades 10‚Äì12, and is a graduate of Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in History. Before his career at the NRA, Cox served as a congressional aide on legislative issues relating to hunting sports and gun ownership for U.S. Rep. John S. Tanner [D-TN8, 1989‚Äì2010].  NRA career Cox joined NRA in 1995. Before becoming chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, Cox held other senior positions within the NRA-ILA. He was promoted to deputy director of the ILA Federal Affairs Division shortly before being named Executive Director of the NRA-ILA in 2002.Chris Cox, Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Speakers, 2020. = Assault Weapons Ban = In 2004, Cox lobbied on behalf of the NRA-ILA to end the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. Due to a sunset provision, the ban was set to expire after 10 years. Cox utilized a grassroots campaign, which included editorial pieces and news media appearances.Editorial; San Francisco Chronicle; 2004; http://sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/07/EDGIV5EQ6B1.DTL Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) attached a rider to Congress's Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Had the amendment passed, the AWB would have been extended an additional ten years. Though President George W. Bush had agreed to sign the ban into law if the amendment passed, Cox and the NRA-ILA lobbyists were successful, and the bill was voted down 8‚Äì90. The ban expired on September 13, 2004. = 2004 elections = According to his NRA-ILA biography, Cox was successful in lobbying for NRA-supported candidates in the 2004 elections. 95% of the NRA-PVF endorsed federal candidates and 86% of the endorsed state candidates were elected. Cox was at the forefront of a media campaign to re-elect incumbent President Bush,NRA endorsement of President Bush; 2004; by utilizing the organization's grassroots technique.NRA-ILA :: Grassroots Activism = Lawsuit protection = In 2003 the NRA supported a bill in Congress to protect manufacturers from certain types of lawsuits, the \\"Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act\\" (S.659/S.1806). The bill was also supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, but opposed by many gun-control groups. The Senate amended the bill to extend the assault weapons ban and close the so-called gun-show loophole, whereupon the NRA withdrew its support and the bill was defeated in March 2004. A new \\"Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act\\" (S.397) passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2005. The bill carried two amendments: requiring the purchase of a trigger lock with any handgun purchase; and authorizing the Department of Justice to study the penetration characteristics of ammunition and make a determination if the ammunition fits the category of \\"armor piercing\\". = Sandy Hook Shooting = After the Dec. 14, 2012 massacre of school children in Newtown, Connecticut, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, Cox was reported to have recommended the NRA take a lower-key approach amid a wave of national outrage. Instead, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre decided to go on the offensive and actively lobby for security guards in schools.Carol D. Leonnig, Beth Reinhard and Tom Hamburger. Newtown massacre divided NRA leaders, foreshadowing split to come. Washington Post, July 3, 2019. = Resignation = Cox was placed on administrative leave June 20, 2019 and resigned from his NRA position June 26, 2019 after NRA officials accused of him participating in an extortion scheme to oust LaPierre from the organization. Cox had denied the allegations.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Malpas. History The church was built in 1627 as a combined chapel and school by Thomas Moulson, a former native of the village. He had moved to London and become a master grocer. He was Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1628 and Lord Mayor of London in 1634. Shortly before his death in 1638, he set up a trust to maintain the church and the school. In 1812 its use as a school ended. As the state of the church had become neglected, a considerable restoration was carried out between 1878 and 1890, the first Duke of Westminster contributing ¬£200 of the total cost of ¬£600. This restoration, with the addition of a vestry, is attributed to John Douglas. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built of ashlar red sandstone with a red tile roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave and chancel in one range, a vestry and a south porch. At the west end is a bell turret with one bell and a clock on the south and west faces. The windows are square-headed and transomed. The porch has Jacobean stone ornaments and a 1774 panel containing the coat of arms of the Moulson family and an inscription relating to the founding by Thomas. =Interior= The hammerbeam roof of 1774 survived the restoration, but all the old fittings and furniture were disposed of, except for the octagonal font. The parish registers begin in 1631. The reredos was designed by John Douglas. External features In the churchyard, south-east of the church, are two war graves of soldiers of World War I.

Design and development The Hawk Major was a variant of the Miles M.2 Hawk, developed by F.G. Miles to take advantage of the new inverted de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. Other changes included metal (instead of wood) engine mounts and streamlined undercarriage. The prototype M.2F Hawk Major) was first flown in 1934 and went on to second place in the 1934 King's Cup Race at an average speed of 147.78 mph. A racing version was developed as the one-off single-seat M.2E Gipsy Six Hawk with a 200 hp de Havilland Gipsy Six engine. The production Hawk Major had the 130 hp de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. The aircraft sold well to private owners, including two that were fitted with smoke generators to allow them to be used as skywriters. An improved version (the M.2H) with a trailing edge flap replaced the M.2F on the production line. A number of special one- off racing versions were also built. In October 1934, Squadron Leader Malcolm Charles McGregor flew a Hawk Major from RAF Mildenhall to Melbourne, Australia in 7 days, 15 hours while competing in the MacRobertson Air Race. In 1936 Miles Hawk Speed Six, G-ADOD was entered into the Schlesinger Race from Portsmouth to Johannesburg and flown by A. E. Clouston who nearly made it all the way to Johannesburg but had to make a crash landing due to engine trouble 150 miles south of Salisbury.

The Letter to Chesterfield (February 1755) was Samuel Johnson's response to what some believed to be Lord Chesterfield's opportunistic endorsement of his A Dictionary of the English Language. Although Chesterfield was patron of the Proposal for the Dictionary, he made no moves to further the progress of the Dictionary until seven years after his original investment into the project. Suddenly, Chesterfield wrote two \\"puff\\" pieces to promote the Dictionary, which prompted Johnson to write a letter accusing Chesterfield of only providing help when it was least needed. Some claim that the letter caused a minor furore in the contemporary literary world when Johnson made it public and it has been the subject of critical comment ever since; it has been described as literature's \\"declaration of independence\\". However, Chesterfield's reaction to the letter was quite different, and he praised Johnson's intellect and ability to write after reading it for the first time. Johnson could not believe that Chesterfield would ever react favourably towards the letter, and it was not until years later that Chesterfield and Johnson would finally reconcile. Background Johnson began work on his Dictionary in 1746 and although the consortium of booksellers that commissioned the work provided him with ¬£1,575 as expenses, Johnson also sought subscriptions from literary patrons among the aristocracy. One of those to receive a request for patronage was Lord Chesterfield, a noted patron of the arts. Johnson visited Chesterfield but, according to Johnson's account, he was kept waiting for a long time and was treated dismissively by Chesterfield when they eventually met. Chesterfield sent Johnson ¬£10 but offered no greater support to Johnson through the seven further years it took him to compile the Dictionary. A degree of genteel mutual antipathy thereafter existed between the two men, Chesterfield regarding Johnson as a \\"respectable Hottentot, who throws his meat anywhere but down his throat\\" and as \\"uncouth in manners\\". Johnson, in turn, was disparaging of both Chesterfield's nobility and his intellect: \\"This man, I thought, had been a Lord among wits; but I find he is only a wit among Lords.\\" The Letter After seven years from first meeting Johnson to go over the work, Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in The World that recommended the Dictionary.Lane p. 118 He complained that the English language was lacking structure and argued: :\\"We must have recourse to the old Roman expedient in times of confusion, and chose a dictator. Upon this principle, I give my vote for Mr Johnson to fill that great and arduous post.\\"Lane p. 121 However, Johnson did not appreciate the tone of the essay, and he felt that Chesterfield did not complete his job as the work's patron. In a letter, Johnson explained his feelings about the matter: :\\"Seven years, my lord, have now past since I waited in your outward rooms or was repulsed from your door, during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a patron before. . . . Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it.\\"Johnson Letters No. 56 Chesterfield was not offended by the letter, but instead impressed by the language.Bate p. 257 After receiving it, he displayed it on a table for visitors to read, and, according to Robert Dodsley, said \\"This man has great powers\\" and then he \\"pointed out the severest passages, and observed how well they were expressed.\\" Adams told Johnson what was said, and Johnson responded, \\"That is not Lord Chesterfield; he is the proudest man this day\\", to which Adams responded, \\"No, there is one person at least as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two.\\" Johnson, finishing, said, \\"But mine, was defensive pride.\\" Years later, the two reconciled, and a letter from Chesterfield \\"melted the Heart of the Writer of that epistolary Philippic.\\"Sledd and Kolb pp. 102‚Äì103 Critical commentary The Letter to Chesterfield has continued to be commented on by some of the most noted critics and authors since its publication to the present day. In 1853, Thomas Carlyle, an early biographical essay on Johnson proclaimed its significance: In the twentieth century, Alvin Kernan wrote that the Letter to Chesterfield However, to think that the letter was written out of anger or a response to neglect would be wrong.Sledd and Kolb p. 107 Instead, they claim that Johnson was forced into a fake status \\"of a man who was soon to declare, in a Preface perhaps already written, that his great work had been written, without the 'patronage of the great.\\"Sledd and Kolb p. 108 In essence, an outsider would think that Chesterfield was patronising the work continually.Sledd and Kolb pp. 107‚Äì109 Notes References  Sledd, James H. and Kolb, Gwin J.

The concept is used in aesthetics, international business and marketing, and computer science. Psychic distance is made up of the Greek word \\"psychikos\\" (œàœÖœáŒπŒ∫œåœÇ), an adjective referring to an individual's mind and soul,Simpson and Weiner 1989 and \\"distance\\", which implies differences between two subjects or objects. Some therefore argue that the concept exists in the mind's eye of the individual and it is their subjective perception that uniquely determines \\"psychic distance\\".Sousa and Bradley 2005 As a result, it is often viewed as a humanistic reflection of individual acuity and not a collective, organisational or societal perspective. However, in the international business context, psychic distance is frequently measured in terms of national averagesHaakanson & Ambos, Journal of International Management, 2010 or in terms of the national-level differences that influence those perceptions.Dow & Karunaratna, Journal of International Business Studies, 2006 In his book, King refers to his preference to use the term \\"aesthetic distance\\" rather than psychic distance, as he feels the latter term has misleading connotations in current usage.[1] Jerry P. King, The Art of Mathematics, New York: Plenum, 1992, p.196 Aesthetics In 1912 Cambridge's Edward Bullough wrote of it in a long paper entitled, Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle which appeared in the British Journal of Psychology.Edward Bullough, Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle, British Journal of Psychology: 5 (1912), p87-118. In this he set down in a reasonably complete manner the concept as it applied to the arts. Evidently, he successfully influenced thinkers 50 years later. Donald Sherburne, for example, says, \\"Edward Bullough's psychical distance has become \\"a classic doctrine of aesthetic thinking.\\"Donald Sherburne, A Whiteheadean Aesthetic, New York: Yale, 1961, p.108 And James L. Jarrett writes of Bullough's ideas, \\"Perhaps no more influential idea has been introduced into modern aesthetics than that of psychical distance.\\"James L. Jarrett, The Quest for Beauty, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1957, p.111 The psychical distance construct has been used as an intercultural theme by the arts in the study of creative detachment between East and West.Odin 2001 Despite such cameo appearances in other fields, the concept has been essentially \\"operationalised\\" by business with the marketing function acting as the chief curator. International business and marketing In international business (IB) and marketing settings, psychic distance is based on perceived differences between a home country and a \\"foreign\\" country regardless of physical time and space factors which differ across diverse cultures.Usunier and Lee Marketing across Cultures, Essex, UK: Pearson Education, 2005 It is a subjective type of distance (\\"perceived differences\\") unlike the distances forming the CAGE framework, for instance.Ghemawat (2001) This makes psychic distance very difficult to measure, and oftentimes fallacious proxies are used to estimate it (e.g., Kogut & Singh (1988) index using Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions). More accurate approaches rely on asking decision-makers their perceptions towards different host countries (e.g., Hakanson & Ambos, 2010), or using its antecedents to estimate it (psychic distance stimuli: Dow & Karunaratna, 2006). The business origins of the \\"psychic distance\\" idiom can be traced back to research conducted by Beckerman (1956) and Linnemann (1966). As a fully formed concept Vahlne and Wiedersheim-Paul (1973) as cited by Nordstrom and Vahlne (1992) described psychic distance as \\"factors preventing or disturbing the flow of information between potential or actual suppliers and customers.\\" These factors are associated with country-based diversities and dissimilarities and can be grouped into four clear areas: #Linguistic differences and translation difficulty. #Cultural factors ‚Äì societal norms, level of individualism or collectivism, values and customs. #Economic situation ‚Äì existing trading links, infrastructure, local conditions, competition and investor confidence. #Political and legal system ‚Äì government stability and risk of instability, import tariffs, legal protection and taxation levels. Although the concept was fully formed by the early 1970s, it was the study of Nordic multinationals by Johanson and Vahlne (1977) which followed on from two earlier studies in 1975 and 1976, that is generally accepted as the concept's real genesis.Sousa and Bradley 2005b The studies concluded that a firm's international activities relate directly to psychic distance and that further international expansion progresses into markets with successively greater psychic distance. In summary, companies tend to initially export to countries that they understand; then build on their acquired experience to explore opportunities further afield. In other words, firms enter new markets where they are able to identify opportunities with low market uncertainty then enter markets at successively greater psychic distance.Johanson and Vahlne, 1990 As a consequence, contemporary literature on the internationalisation process cites psychic distance as a key variable and determinant for expansion into foreign markets.  Other IB approaches to measuring psychic distance  The psychic distance has also on occasion been measured through formative indicators such as strong commercial relations, close political relations, historic ties, geographic ties, social ties, country information stock, level of development. These indicators are deeply analyzed for the international market selection. The measurement of these indicators is best accomplished through an index construction. However, the formative indicators are very context dependent. If they were applied to different industries, countries and entry modes, the indicators would have shifted dramatically. Computer science More recently, Gairola and ChongDhruv Gairola and Siang Yew Chong, \\"An Economics-Inspired Noise Model in Spatial Games with Reputation\\", Advances in Intelligent Modelling and Simulation: Artificial Intelligence-based Models and Techniques in Scalable Computing, Studies in Computational Intelligence, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, vol. 422, pp. 271-293 (2012) incorporated psychic distance to simulate more realistic noise models in spatial games, leading to interesting results, including a manifestation of the psychic distance paradox.

It is found on or around the reefs of the central Indo-Pacific region from Indonesia and the Philippines north to the Ryukyu Islands.FishBase (2008) In the wild adults can grow to 15 cm with no discernible differences between males and females. The body is pearly white and the scales have black edges, giving the sides a more cross-hatched pattern instead of the clear chevrons in related species. The hind parts are orangey-yellow, the base of the caudal fin is white. The head is darker than the body and bears the characteristic pattern of its lineage, consisting of vertical black eyestripes and a black white-rimmed crown spot. Ecology in the wild and the aquarium Pearlscale butterflyfish are a diurnal species and usually found at depths below 15 m (49 ft). They are found in clear coastal to outer reef slopes and drop-offs, often around Acropora staghorn corals. These fish have a peaceful temperament and in the wild are found either alone, in pairs, or in small groups, however they are territorial towards similar-looking species and may harass them. Due to its attractive colors, the Pearlscale Butterflyfish is a well-known aquarium fish. A 50-gallon aquarium is the minimum size recommended for them, with a water temperature of between about 74 and 80¬∞ F. Although they can be aggressive at times, they are delicate and peaceful tankmates are required for this fish to thrive in an aquarium. They may be compatible with other butterflyfishes that have a different color pattern, but there is no guarantee that their relationship will always be peaceful. When adding more than one to a tank they have to be added simultaneously, and lots of \\"live rock\\" with shelters available for them to hide helps to reduce stress. In the wild they feed on algae, soft coral polyps and small benthic invertebrates, so therefore along with other coral-eating Chaetodon species they can wreak havoc on living corals in the aquarium. They should be fed a variety of foods that can include mysid shrimp, brine shrimp, krill, spirulina and foods containing algae. Systematics C. xanthurus is one of the \\"crowned\\" butterflyfishes. These form a group of largely allopatric species sharing the overall color pattern of dark forward-pointing chevrons on silvery hues, (usually) a black-and-white crown spot and yellow to red hindparts to a stunning degree; they differ in the exact combination of hues and some small pattern details. Other members of this lineage are the Atoll (C. mertensii), Eritrean (C. paucifasciatus) and Seychelles butterflyfishes (C. madagaskariensis), which are closer related among each other that any is to C. xanthurus. The \\"crowned\\" Chaetodon are a clearly recognizable clade, but their further relationships are otherwise less clear. They were often placed in the subgenus Exornator, or considered a distinct subgenus Rhombochaetodon. According to various DNA sequence studies, some older and more singular lineages. These include species such as the Asian Butterflyfish (C. argentatus), the Blue-striped Butterflyfish (C. fremblii) and Burgess' Butterflyfish (C. burgessi). C. burgessi is in fact so peculiar that it was placed in a monotypic subgenus Roaops. But recognition of this would probably result in several other small or monotypic subgenera becoming justified, and the older Rhombochaetodon would be the more conveniently apply to the entire radiation.Fessler & Westneat (2007), Hsu et al. (2007) But the expanded group is of unclear relationships to species like the Speckled Butterflyfish (C. citrinellus) and the Four-spotted Butterflyfish (C. quadrimaculatus). These might be members of the subgenus Exornator - the lineages around the Spot-banded Butterflyfish (C. punctatofasciatus) - and C. citrinellus certainly looks somewhat similar to these. Yet phylogenetically, their position towards Rhombochaetodon is unresolved, and ultimately it might be better to merge both Rhombochaetodon and Roaops in Exornator. If the genus Chaetodon is split up, Exornator might become a subgenus of Lepidochaetodon or a separate genus.

In 2000, the band toured both the East and West Coasts extensively without major label support, all financed by the band. Included on this tour were fellow East Coast musicians Jepetto. The band had also performed with major label acts such as Green Day, Snapcase, Suicide Machines, Papa Roach, Sev, Good Charlotte, 6Gig, Liquid Gang, and Nothingface. Drummer Stephen Baucom and guitarist Jasan Stepp met while paratroopers in the military. They discussed forming a band, taking the name Margret Heater from a character in a story written years before. They soon recruited lead singer Duke Aipa to be their frontman. Although not a member of the earliest incarnation of Margret Heater, Greg Plummer had played in a high school band called \\"Uncle Lumpy\\" with Stepp. Uncle Lumpy released one recording, an album called Chicken A La King. Plummer was at Franklin Pierce College playing in a band called \\"Down Funk Boulevard\\" when he was asked to join Margret Heater. A few years later the band swapped singers of another Baltimore band \\"20 on the Hype\\" to get Brandon Fogle as their new frontman. Eventually, Stephen and the rest of the band parted ways. Drummer Alex Crowley, formerly of Downpour, joined to keep their legacy intact. While with the band, Alex and the others appeared on the cover of Unsung Hero for their last in print publication. Later in the year, during a show at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club, Alex fell off the drum riser and broke his right arm. Coincidentally, Mike Sipple, formerly the drummer of Jimmie's Chicken Shack, was his roommate and stepped in and later replaced Alex full- time. In the summer of 2002, the band traveled to Maine again as cast members for Edwards' movie Kiwahkwe: Curse of the Lobster. Greg, Brandon, and Jasan all play characters of the same name from a band of the same name and all suffer horrific deaths at the claws of a giant lobster. Margret Heater also is featured on the movie's soundtrack.

Character biography Frances \\"Frannie\\" Hughes was born to Bob and Jennifer Hughes. Though the character was born in 1973, she was later retroactively born in 1965 to be age 20 in 1985. Frannie's mother, however, died when Frannie was a toddler and she was raised by her father and grandparents. Even though she grew up motherless, Frannie was surrounded by family, which included her Aunt Kim, and grew up happy and well adjusted. Since Frannie was so well adjusted, her family was shocked when she flunked out of Yale after one year. When Frannie returned to Oakdale, her old boyfriend, Kevin Gibson, followed her, hoping to repair their relationship. The relationship was rocky with Kevin because of paternity issues with his ex- girlfriend, Marie, and they broke up. Next, Frannie dated club owner Doug Cummings; they became engaged by Christmas 1985. He turned out to be a psychotic who also worshiped her Aunt Kim (and Frannie's new step-mother with her marriage to Bob) and he longed to make a family out of three. He had even built a hidden shrine to Kim. In the aftermath, Doug was killed as he was about to rape an unconscious Frannie; her former boyfriend Kevin helped come to the rescue and died in the fight. Eventually, it was revealed both Doug and Kevin were killed by Doug's love-starved assistant Marsha Talbot and Frannie was cleared, but not before Marsha kidnapped Frannie and was rescued by her next boyfriend Casey Peretti. Despite Casey being hailed as a hero, Frannie realized she wasn't in love with Casey and thought it unkind to him to string him along and they broke up. Soon after, Frannie studied psychology at Oxford. While in England, Frannie saw a woman who closely resembled her. After some sleuthing, she learned the woman, Sabrina, was her own half-sister and cousin! Sabrina was the product of an affair between Frannie's father and aunt and a sibling rivalry developed between them. Frannie had become engaged to Seth Snyder, but when Sabrina tricked Seth into sleeping with her (because of their similar looks), Frannie was unable to reconcile the relationship and they broke up. Eventually, Frannie forgave Sabrina and they became fairly close. Back in Oakdale and now a psychologist, Frannie dated Dr. Larry McDermott before eventually marrying businessman Darryl Crawford. When Darryl became the prime suspect in the murder of Carolyn Crawford, his first wife, the evidence mounted against him and Frannie became terribly frightened of her new husband. When Darryl was proven innocent, Frannie couldn't forgive herself for doubting him and gave him a divorce. Frannie then left Oakdale to help refugees in Montega. Several years later, Frannie and her sister decided to go to Haiti to aid in the relief efforts following that country's devastating earthquake. Before going, Frannie stopped by Oakdale to celebrate her parents' wedding anniversary.http://www.soapcentral.com/atwt/whoswho/frances.php SoapCentral.com/atwt References As the World Turns characters Television characters introduced in 1973 Fictional psychologists Female characters in television ","title":"Frannie Hughes"},{"id":"13187212","text":"Veerplas lake from the east with the birds'shore in foreground and telecom tower in background Veerplas () is an artificial lake directly east of the Dutch city of Haarlem.

He was the son of Jos√© de C√≥rdoba y Rojas and elder brother of Fernando Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdova. An outspoken adversary of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, he organized a rebellion against the liberal government in July 1822, and was forced to flee to France after its failure. He returned one year later in the footsteps of the French army under Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me and participated in the restoration of the Absolute monarchy of King Ferdinand VII of Spain. As a reward, he was named Spanish ambassador in Paris, Lisbon and Berlin. After the King's death, he returned to Spain to support his daughter Isabel against her uncle Carlos in the First Carlist War. On December 12, 1834 he led a Division under Rodil and beat Zumalac√°rregui in the Battle of Mendaza. Three days later he suffered a defeat in the First Battle of Arquijas and was dismissed. On June 24, 1835, he was recalled and became commander of the North. He confirmed his reputation three weeks later by winning an important victory against general Vicente Gonz√°lez Moreno in the Battle of Mendigorr√≠a, earning him the title of Marquis of Mendigorria. In August 1836, the progressives rebelled against the moderate government and Regent Maria Cristina was forced to re- introduce the Spanish Constitution of 1812. General C√≥rdova, together with senior government officials, then went into exile, and was replaced by Baldomero Espartero as head of the Army of the North. He attempted a failed uprising in Seville in 1838, and fled to Portugal where he died 2 years later.

It is located on New York State Route 67 in Walloomsac, New York, a historic route between Bennington, Vermont and the Hudson River. Here, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts militia under General John Stark rebuffed a British attempt led by Colonel Friedrich Baum to capture American stores. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. and A portion of the battlefield is preserved in the Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site. Description Map of Bennington battlefield The main portion of the Bennington Battlefield is located about west of the New York-Vermont border, on the north side of the Walloomsac River. The river valley is flanked by a series of hills with steeply ridged sides. The state historic site encompasses the top of one of these hills as well as some of its surrounding terrain; it is at this site that some of the most concentrated fighting took place. The modern Route 67 no longer exactly follows the alignment of the road in 1777, but a bridge crossing on a nearby secondary street is believed to be located near a key crossing site at the time. Most of the hillside terrain is now wooded, while portions of the river floodplain are in agricultural use (as they were in 1777), and the hilltop of the state historic site has been cleared. A 19th- century railroad right-of-way, also following the river, is a significant intrusion on the battlefield landscape. Prior to the Battle of Bennington, British troops (mainly Hessians) under the command of Colonel Baum occupied this particular hilltop, with additional detachments guarding the bridge, the ridge on the south side of the river, and a stream crossing north of the river and east of the hill. The American troops led by General Stark were able to reconnoiter these positions and sneak up on them, executing a surprise attack. Baum's forces were eventually routed, and he was slain. Hessian reinforcements arrived near the end of the first phase of the battle, and were eventually also put to chase, with the battlefield extending as far as a mile further down the river valley. The battle was a serious blow to the campaign of British General John Burgoyne depriving him of a needed supplies and a significant portion of his army as he made his push toward Albany, New York. and set the stage for his subsequent surrender at Saratoga.

He spoke of an inclusive and impartial government, religious freedom, rule of law and equality for all. In his actual speech of 11 August 1947 Muhammad Ali Jinnah said \\"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the State\\". In the same speech he said \\"We are starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle: that we are all citizens, and equal citizens, of one State.\\" Mr. Jinnah's presidential address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan ‚Äì 11 August 1947Syed Qasim Mehmood \\"Message of Quaid-e-Azam\\" He opened by saying the Assembly had two tasks: Writing a provisional constitution and governing the country meantime. He continued with a list of urgent problems: # Law and order, so life, property and religious beliefs are protected for all. # Bribery # Black-marketing # Nepotism Next he discussed at length the partition, saying many were dissatisfied with the details but a united India would never have worked. He urged forgiveness of bygone quarrels among Pakistanis, so all can be \\". . . first, second and last a citizen of this State with equal rights . . .\\". Pointing out that England in past centuries had settled its fierce sectarian persecutions, he proposed that \\"in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State.\\" He concluded by quoting a friendly, official message from the United States.  21st century  2007 being the 60th anniversary of Jinnah's speech prompted the Pakistani religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Sikhs to hold a large rally to celebrate Jinnah's legacy at the Minar-e-Pakistan calling for the implementation of Jinnah's vision in letter and spirit.Pakistani minorities to stage mass rally for equal rights L K Advani, Indian politician, visited Pakistan in June 2005. He created a scandal in India, by referring to Jinnah as a great leader and described his speech to the Constituent Assembly as a truly secular charter, worthy of emulation. At Jinnah's Mausoleum, he wrote: There are many people who leave an irreversible stamp on history. But there are few who actually create history. Qaed-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah was one such rare individual. In his early years, leading luminary of freedom struggle Sarojini Naidu described Jinnah as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. His address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 11 August 1947 is really a classic and a forceful espousal of a secular state in which every citizen would be free to follow his own religion. The State shall make no distinction between the citizens on the grounds of faith. My respectful homage to this great man. Advani came under intense criticism from his own party, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which has long blamed Jinnah for being solely responsible for India's partition along communal lines. Ultimately, Advani was forced to quit as party chief, despite vindication from the media.

The school was affiliated with the Episcopal Church (United States). School history The school opened in 1926 under the leadership of Rev. G. Gardner Monks, the school's first headmaster. In 1946 the Rev. Robert L. Curry, D.D. became the second and longest serving headmaster, leaving in 1969. Over the years Lenox's enrollment ranged from 150 to 250 boys with about 32 teachers or masters. The school was modeled on the English public school system and instead of grades to designate classes, the term 'forms' was used. Third Form referred to the freshman year through the Sixth Form for the senior year. The school used a system of 'prefects' who were members of the Sixth Form and were elected by the senior class or appointed by the headmaster. There were two Senior Prefects. It was primarily a residential boarding school, with some day students commuting from the surrounding region of the central Berkshire Hills. The church influence was felt through a number of Episcopal clergy faculty members, required sacred studies classes and a daily chapel service at Trinity Episcopal Church. In addition to strong academic standards, the school was notable for its sports teams. The motto of the school was Non Ministrari-Sed Ministrare; \\"not to be ministered unto but to minister\\" or more commonly translated as \\"not to be served but to serve\\".The Lenox School Campus Today; logo. Retrieved 2010-11-10. Eventually, financial problems led to the school's closure. A 1972 merger with the Bordentown Military Institute was an uncomfortable alliance between two disparate school cultures. By the following school year, the combined entity was closed, as the Vietnam War had reduced the popularity of a military education. The fate of the school was not unique among private secondary schools in the central Berkshires. By the mid-1970s neighboring Foxhollow School, Windsor Mountain School, Cranwell Preparatory School (Jesuit) and Stockbridge School had all closed. Like Lenox School, these were small boarding schools serving students from throughout the northeast and sometimes beyond, occupying campuses that were once grand estates, often referred to as 'Berkshire Cottages' by their seasonal Gilded Age occupants. The core of the school's campus is now the site of Shakespeare & Company. In spite of nearly five decades passing since the closure of Lenox School for Boys, student loyalty is reflected in an active alumni organization that produces a quarterly newsletter and convenes an annual Fall reunion in Lenox.

Rincon Island is a small 2.3-acre artificial island located off Mussel Shoals (also called \\"Little Rincon\\") in Ventura County, California on public land leased from the California State Lands Commission (CSLC). The island is situated approximately offshore in of water. The island was constructed in 1958 for the specific purpose of well drilling and oil and gas production.ARCO 1991 Filing with State Lands Commission It is near the seaside communities of Mussel Shoals and La Conchita. The island is connected to the mainland by the Richfield Pier. The Rincon basin properties cover approximately , including a island connected to land by a causeway containing the gas and oil pipelines and facilitating vehicular access. Greka Energy, the petroleum company currently operating at the site, has faced numerous safety and permit violations. Area history Rincon Island; view from above, looking southeast Rincon means \\"corner\\" in Spanish. The area was said to be a battleground of the Chumash and the site of an 1838 battle between Alvarado and Pio Pico, described in poem by Bayard Taylor, \\"The Fight of the Paso del Mar.\\" The Chumash Indians were once the largest cultural group in California. They were native inhabitants of what is today Ventura County, which was formed by splitting Santa Barbara County in 1873. In 1913, the Rincon Sea Level Road opened between Santa Barbara and Ventura. Portions of the road through this area were causeways constructed on wood planks and pilings, as the area was only passable before at low tide. The first oil production in the Rincon Beach area took place in 1928. This portion of the coast has good surf spots, including Rincon Point, just north at the county line. Usable land Approximately one acre of usable space on Rincon Island lies within the depressed interior of the island which is surrounded by a perimeter berm, approximately high on the ocean/weather side and slightly lower on the land side. This berm is planted with scattered palm trees. The island's total area at ground surface is about , rising from a base of on the sea floor. Oil production facilities are partially hidden from view within the island's interior acre, and also partially shielded by the palm trees. A one-lane causeway, long, connects the Island to shore at Punta Gorda. Environment The local physical environment consists of the Pacific Ocean, local coastal mountains, U.S. Highway 101, several beach homes and a hotel located approximately north near the Mussel Shoals exit along Highway 101, the nearby community of La Conchita, and other nearby petroleum production facilities. In 1978, a study was conducted on the impact of the island, \\"Ecological Effects of an Artificial Island, Rincon Island.\\" The study documented marine ecological conditions. Habitat features associated with the armor rock and concrete tetrapods surrounding the island support a microecosystem, a rich and varied fauna and flora associated with the high-relief solid substrate of the island, which differs substantially from the more depauperate natural bottom habitats in the area. Rincon Oil Field Central area of operations on Rincon Island The offshore leasing of the Rincon Oil Field began from 1929 to 1931 with the issuance of leases for the lands and ended in 1955 with the issuance of a new state lease, PRC 1466. Several different oil companies have held these leases over the years. By the end of the 1980s, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) and Berry Petroleum Company held all the various state leasehold interests at Rincon, except one small portion owned by Energy Development Corporation. In 1992, the California State Lands Commission approved the assignment by ARCO to Berry of all its interests in the Rincon leases. When approving that assignment, the Commission required that ARCO remain liable for removing Rincon Island and the causeway leading to it. British Petroleum (BP), which acquired ARCO, now has this liability. In 1995, the Commission approved the assignment of Berry‚Äôs interest in the Rincon leases to RILP with the condition that Berry remain liable for removing the Island and the causeway. =Production= In early 1997, Calgary, Alberta- based Windsor Energy Corp., whose principal property was the Rincon Island property, completed its second long reach well on its Rincon Island lease. Here production increased from about per day of oil equivalent in 1995 to about per day by 1998. When Windsor acquired the Rincon Island Field, 16 wells were producing and 51 wells were shut-in. Windsor quickly brought six of the shut-in wells back into production, abandoned six considered non-commercial, and drilled 19 new commercial wells. The wells at Rincon produced from depths between 1,700 and from the Miley sands of the Upper Pliocene-aged Pico Formation in an anticline, which plunges from the west towards the east. =Key party bankruptcies= On August 20, 1998, Rincon Island Limited Partnership (RILP) and its managing general partner, Canada's Windsor Energy, filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On 29 January of that year, Stanton Capital Corp., a private investment firm, agreed to buy about half of the parent's assets, including the Rincon Island partnership, for approximately $170 million. On May 13, the parent announced that the proposed sale had fallen through because low product prices rendered Stanton's plan to add capital to the assets and take them public unfeasible. Pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization, Rincon continues to operate the state leases, subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. Compass Bank, the principal creditor of RILP, held a first priority lien on the assets of RILP, the stock of RILP's managing general partner, Windsor, and the partner's equity interest in RILP. In June 2001, Compass Bank foreclosed on all of the stock of Windsor and the partner's interest in RILP, thereby assuming indirect control of RILP. RILP, under the indirect control of Compass Bank, continues to operate the state leases on an interim basis. Compass Bank has indicated to staff that it acquired RILP with the intent of disposing of the limited partnership, or all of the assets, as quickly as possible. Compass Bank has actively been seeking a buyer for the properties. Rincon acquired In October 2002, Greka Energy Corp., then a publicly traded company based in New York, bought the Rincon Island operation, which included 56 wells, and assumed about $1.7 million of debt. Greka's current primary areas of activity are in California, where it has interests in heavy oil fields and an asphalt plant. A separate Greka entity, also owned by CEO Randeep Grewal, is active in China, where it has signed production agreements for coalbed methane properties.International Finance Corporation description of Greka Greka is Santa Barbara County's largest onshore oil producer and is also a major employer in Santa Maria. Greka also owns and operates the only asphalt plant in the county, producing asphalt for most of the area's roads, highways and parking lots. Greka was formed in 1999 after the merger of two publicly traded companies, Saba Petroleum Company and Horizontal Ventures. In May 2003, Greka chairman and chief executive officer Randeep S. Grewal formed Alexi Holdings Ltd. to effect a reverse merger with Greka, taking the company private. Prior to the buyout, he held a 14.3% stake in the company. The price paid for the buyout was a 69% premium over the $3.70 closing price for Greka's stock May 19, 2003, the day before Grewal announced his intent to take the company private. CIBC World Markets advised Greka on Grewal's offer. In 2005, Greka Energy filed for voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in New York, beset by legal judgments, state environmental litigation and a federal criminal probe. Greka's Nov 30, 2005, bankruptcy filing, under the name Saba Enterprises and including Greka, Horizontal Ventures and Petro Union, listed debts of up to $50 million but assets of less than $50,000, and Greka listed unsecured creditors including Chevron's UNOCAL arm.Greka Files for Liquidation: June 15, 2005 As all petroleum extracted from California state lands is subject to a royalty, Greka has paid the state about $143,000 for oil and gas pumped from Rincon Island during the first half of 2007. Controversy Planning Permission posted at Rincon Island Rincon Island's production history is controversial, due to spills and safety issues. In February 1998, the Los Angeles Times reported the island facility spilled 130 gallons of crude oil.\\"TOXIC DISCHARGES\\", Los Angeles Times, February 20, 1998 Starting in 1999, the Santa Barbara Air Pollution Control District inspected Greka facilities 855 times, citing about 300 violations.http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a35/Pressroom/News/20080327AD35AR01.aspx During a nine-year period, more than 200 Greka spills threatened or polluted state waters 20 times, according to published reports. On January 3, 2008, the California State Lands Commission shut down Rincon Island due to unsafe conditions at the bridge, which pipes the oil from the island to the shoreline. Greka resumed oil production and, by the beginning of June 2008, had produced 240 barrels of oil at Rincon Island. As of October 2008, production was again suspended at Rincon Island when testing showed that serious structural deficiencies exist with the causeway to the island. Employees use a golf cart to reach the island because vehicle traffic is deemed too dangerous. As of the end of 2008, the lease has produced 2,622 barrels of oil for the year.http://opi.consrv.ca.gov/opi/opi.dll/Search?UsrP_ID=100108188&FormStack;=Main%2COperator%2CLease&WMtr;_LeaseName=State+1466&Action;=Get+Sums+&PriorState;=OprId%3D100000260%2CEncoded%3DTrue The gross revenue to the State of California for 2008 is under $20,000.http://www.slc.ca.gov/Reports/Supplemental_Reports/Audit_Program_Supp_Rpt_final_to_LAO.pdf As indicated by the State Lands Commission Audit Program, the cost of enforcement and monitoring by the State Lands Commission of the Rincon Island 1466 lease is well in excess of $100,000 per year. On June 17, 2011, the federal government sued Greka for over $2.4 million in cleanup costs.http://independent.com/news/2011/jun/23/feds-sue-greka/ Facing a potential termination of its lease by the State Lands Commission for \\"imprudent oil and gas operations,\\" Rincon Island Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of Greka Energy, filed for bankruptcy on August 9, 2016. At the time, the company had not produced oil or gas from Rincon Island since October 2008. On November 30, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court approved a joint motion to grant the State Lands Commission a quitclaim over Rincon Island, which was effected on December 6, 2017. As a result, Rincon Island was added to the California Coastal Sanctuary and the last operational oil drilling and production facility in the Santa Barbara Channel ended. Decommissioning The California State Lands Commission has indicated that the disposition of Rincon Island and its causeway is scheduled in the second phase of its ongoing decommissioning of the former Rincon Island Limited Partnership wells. The final disposition of the island and causeway will require an environmental analysis under CEQA, public input, discretionary approval by the commission itself and other agencies, funding, and hiring a decommissioning contractor. The CEQA process for decommissioning is anticipated to begin in 2020.

Technical managers can be found at the interface of application and technique; they act between the user and the technical means. Examples of technical management are: ICT management, real estate management, financial management, quality management. Often the managed field is a resource of the organisation. Technical managers combine technical and management knowledge for the benefit of the user. In logistics, technical management involves the duties a shipping company must perform for the technical operation of a vessel. This involves management related to crew management with related tasks, logistics related to operations as well as operations, service and maintenance. Often technical management is performed by the ship owning company, but not always.

The series, containing a total of 160 episodes, centers on the romance between two leading protagonists, Daniel Luna (played by Victor Mallarino) and Fabiana Estrella Rivera (played by Paola Rey). On Telemundo, La Baby Sister followed the wildly successful telenovela, Betty La Fea, which has since been reinvented in the US as ABC's Ugly Betty. La Baby Sister was meant to be the successor to Betty la Fea as a hip and funny romantic comedy, and it was partially successful in this goal. Both novelas feature similar characteristics‚Äî both were produced in Colombia, and both feature a mix of romance and humor, modern sound editing and camera work, and a plot that centers on a young female protagonist and her family. Although La Baby Sister gained some acclaim from both critics and viewers, it never achieved the popularity of Betty la Fea. Nonetheless, it is often credited with launching the career of Paola Rey, who has since become one of Colombia's biggest television stars. Plot summary  Daniel Luna and his wife Martha Parejo (played by Marcela Gallego) are a successful and semi- famous couple living among Bogota's upper crust society. They work in the same office, where Martha is a celebrity marriage counselor/television personality (much like Dr. Phil in America), and Daniel is a lawyer and professor specializing in divorce law. In the opening episode, Martha is about to release her newest book, which is an exaltation of her ostensibly perfect marriage. Martha's reputation as a counselor is built on honest and straightforward communication between couples. In one chapter of her book‚Äî a chapter highlighted by the book's publisher‚Äî Martha states that Daniel was often sexually inadequate, but that they have managed to overcome his inadequacies and build a successful marriage based on trust and honesty. However, both trust and honesty crumble for the celebrity couple when Daniel, who has not yet read Martha's newest book, discovers that the entire nation of Colombia believes he is sexually inadequate, which (the directors of the novela imply through various sex scenes) is not true. Martha's book release has a pernicious effect on their marriage, which begins to crumble after Martha finds out that Daniel had a brief sexual encounter with one of his students, Veronica Davila (played by Manuela Gonzalez), who is infatuated with Daniel and who, as the viewers gradually find out, is insane. During the same time period, the Lunas have hired Fabiana Rivera (played by Paola Rey), a beautiful twenty-one-year-old college student, to help them take care of their two children. Fabiana is from a lower-class family, and she is dazzled by the Luna's rich style of living and by the charm her new boss, Daniel. As Martha and Daniel's relationship continues to deteriorate, the two decide to separate, and Daniel increasingly comes to rely on Fabiana to help him cope with raising his children while separating from his wife. Fabiana and Daniel fall in love, and after sharing various furtive kisses (accompanied by feelings of guilt and confusion), they culminate their romance sexually in a hotel. Fabiana and Daniel make plans to run away together, but their plans are shattered when Martha, distraught because her separation from Daniel has become a national scandal fueled by the gossip driven media, accidentally overdoses on anti-depressants. Daniel mistakenly believes that his wife tried to commit suicide, and Martha does nothing to disabuse him of the belief in hopes that his feelings of guilt will help save their marriage. The sexual consummation between Fabiana and Daniel, followed almost immediately by Martha's overdose, takes place during the first third of the novela's 160 episodes, and the rest of the narrative arch involves Daniel struggling between his love for Fabiana and the desire not to hurt his family, and Fabiana's doomed attempts to forget about Daniel. Fabiana continues to work in the Luna household for a time (where she continues to have brief romantic encounters with Daniel), but she leaves after Martha discovers that she and Daniel slept together. Fabiana and Daniel separate, and Fabiana briefly gets engaged to her childhood friend, Edwin Paipa (played by Luis Fernando Salis). But neither she nor Daniel can overcome their illicit love for one another. In the end, the two protagonists cast aside social restrictions against their relationship and the objections of their respective friends and families, and get married. Social Class in La Baby Sister Although much of the La Baby Sister involves either stereotypical romantic themes or silly comical hijinks, the novela does delve into some pertinent social commentary, most notably involving social class. A recurring theme in La Baby Sister is the difference in class between Fabiana and Daniel and their respective families. Most characters, including Fabiana herself at one point, assume that Daniel cannot possibly love Fabiana because she is of a lower social class. Indeed, Daniel says as much to Veronica while trying to deny that he and Fabiana had an affair. Moreover, Martha appears (unrealistically) blind to the affair between Fabiana and Daniel because she assumes that Daniel would never \\"sink so low\\" as to have an affair with hired help, or at least not an affair that would mean anything. Throughout the novela, Martha repeatedly tries to instill class-based discrimination in the education of her children. At one point she, apparently without irony, alludes to George Orwell's Animal Farm by saying to her daughter, \\"All people are equal, but some people are more equal than others.\\" The producers of the novela clearly come down on the progressive side of the class debate: with the exception of Daniel, every upper-class character is stereotyped as snobbish, greedy, insane, or all three. One of the Novela's primary villains, Veronica, continually evokes her membership in the upper- class as justification for her unsavory and occasionally violent actions. In contrast, the Fabiana's working-class family and neighbors are consistently portrayed sympathetically as hard-working people who want nothing more than happiness for everyone, regardless of their social position. The novela also repeatedly portrays class-mobility in Colombia as difficult at best: Fabiana repeatedly tries to enter with Colombia's upper-class and is repeatedly buffeted by discrimination by her social \\"betters.\\" In the final episodes, Daniel realizes that in order to be with Fabiana, he must renounce background in and cut his ties with Bogota's high society, a decision that allows him to be with his love, but which also costs him a lucrative career. The Novela's resolution suggests that, however unjust it may be, class discrimination is as strong as ever in Colombia.  Success and Availability of La Baby Sister  La Baby Sister aired successfully in several Latin American countries. It enjoyed a successful run in America as well, though it seems unlikely that Telemundo, or any other network, will air the series again. It is, however, available for sale on the internet in the form of unauthorized DVDs, an illicit market that gives many telenovlas a second life after their initial broadcasts. Many of the actors in the novella continued to work together on other projects following La Baby Sister, and the main star, Paola Rey, starred in three more telenovelas broadcasts on Telemundo, including La mujer en el espejo, Amores de mercado, and Pasion de Gavilanes.

Although more than 1,000 died, the disaster has long been overshadowed by the earlier loss (on 15 April 1912) of the RMS Titanic, and by the fact that Kiche Maru was one of hundreds of naval calamities caused by a tropical storm in Southern Japan. The sinking of the ship was swiftly reported, though confusion about its name became apparent (it was referred to as the Kieko Maru, the Keiko Maru, the Kioko maru, and the Kickermaru in later accounts). Kiche Maru, a passenger ship, foundered off the island of Honsh≈´, with the loss of all souls aboard. Although the sinking of the Japanese passenger ship was reported in the Western press as part of the news of the 1912 typhoon, and the information has been repeated in English-language lists of historic disasters, no contemporaneous Japanese accounts have been found to describe either the shipwreck, or the ship itself.

James was born in Longbridge, Birmingham. He played for the cricket club associated with Holy Trinity Church, in Bordesley, Birmingham, and together with his fellow members decided to form a football club for exercise and society in the winter months. The club, which they called Small Heath Alliance, played its first match in November 1875 on some waste ground in Arthur Street, Bordesley. James's brothers Tommy and Fred played in that first fixture, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Holte Wanderers of Aston, though he himself did not.Matthews, p. 8. He was appointed club captain in 1878, retaining the position until 1885, and was regularly selected to represent the Birmingham County F.A. in challenge matches against other major associations. In its centenary volume, the association describes the club as :\\"blessed in having Arthur James from 1878 to 1885 as their captain, this player ranking as one of the most brilliant wing forwards of the day, he often represented the Birmingham Association at a time when competition was keen\\".

The station is owned by FRC of Alabama LLC, doing business as \\"Focus Radio Communications\\". Its studios and transmitter are located just west of downtown Huntsville. In November 2009, FRC began operating WTKI under a local marketing agreement, broadcasting a combined news/talk/sports format. Some programming is provided by Fox Sports Radio and Fox Business Network. In 2010, the station will broadcast at least 85 Southern League baseball games as the flagship station of the Huntsville Stars Radio Network. The network also includes sister station WIEZ and WWIC in Scottsboro. History =The beginning= This station signed on as WFUN on November 26, 1946, and was acquired by the Huntsville Broadcasting Company in May 1948. The station served Huntsville since as WFUN, WFIX, WKGL, WHOH, and now WTKI. WFIX (1970s) was a full-service middle-of-the-road adult contemporary station, until the market upheaval of the 1980s when Arbitron expanded the survey area beyond Madison County and the FM stations began their rise to local market dominance. Since the mid-1980s the station has broadcast a number of formats, most notably talk radio, classic country, relationship radio, and in 2002 flipped to sports talk as \\"ESPN 1450\\". The station was the radio flagship of the Huntsville Stars minor league baseball radio network until the 2007 station ownership and format change. WTKI also broadcast games of the Huntsville Channel Cats of the Central Hockey League from the team's inception in 1995 through the penultimate 1998-1999 season. =Switch to WTKI= The station was assigned the WTKI call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 1, 1992. It has held those call letters since then except for an eight-month period in 2002 when it was a \\"relationship radio\\" formatted female-oriented talk station known as WHOH, the \\"Heart of Huntsville.\\" ProTalk logo (2006-2009) In November 2006, Christian Voice of Central Ohio Inc, headed by President Dan Baughman, agreed to buy WTKI from Mountain Mist Media, LLC., headed by President David Barnhardt, for a reported $475,000. As a result, the station flipped formats from sports talk to religious programming in early January 2007. The station, branded as \\"ProTalk 1450\\", was operated as a simulcast of sister station WDPT until both ceased operations and went temporarily silent on January 30, 2009, due to the late 2000s recession. Both stations returned to the air in early November 2009 broadcasting a mix of talk radio and sports talk programming. =WTKI today= On December 23, 2009, Christian Voice of Central Ohio Inc. applied to the FCC to transfer the broadcast license for WTKI to FRC of Alabama LLC, doing business as \\"Focus Radio Communications\\". , the Commission has accepted this application for filing but taken no further action. Focus Radio, which has contracted to provide programming for both WTKI and WEKI (the former WDPT) under a local marketing agreement since November 2009, will pay a total of $235,000 for the licenses and assets of both stations.

The municipality has a seat in the Office of Stralendorf from where it is administered. It lies on the western boundary of Schwerin by the Neum√ºhler See, one of several lakes in the area. History There is evidence that man has settled in the area since the Neolithic period although the exact date of the origin of the municipality is not known. The first mention of the area in writing was in 1217 about the building of a church and a cemetery. The German derivative of the local name is White Fjord, which suggests that it is taken from the Neum√ºhler See and its sinuous form.

Regan-Blake is well-known for her role as part of The Folktellers storytelling duo. She was a founding member of the National Storytelling Network or NSN (formerly the National Association for the Preservation and the Perpetuation of Storytelling or NAPPS). Regan-Blake served as the Artistic Director from 1975 until 1983. She was awarded the Circle of Excellence in 1996 by the National Storytelling Network after being recognized by her peers as a master storyteller. She has appeared onstage as a featured performer or emcee at every National Storytelling Festival since its inception in 1973.  Biography  Regan-Blake first began her work as a storyteller in the early 1970s. She was hired by the Chattanooga Public Library to fill a grant-funded position (as part of the Library Services and Construction Act). With this new position, the library was able to launch the early childhood literacy program, M.O.R.E. (Making Our Reading Enjoyable). In 1973, Connie Regan-Blake and Barbara Freeman attended the first National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, TN. There they met, Ray and Rosa Hicks of Beech Mountain, who became lasting friends and mentors to Regan-Blake. Two years later, Regan-Blake and her cousin, Barbara Freeman left their positions with the Chattanooga Public Library and began touring as The Folktellers storytelling duo. As The Folktellers, Regan-Blake and Freeman pioneered 'tandem telling,' a type of duet storytelling performance. The duo also created the record label Mama T Artists. Over the next two decades, The Folktellers toured across the country, performing at folk music festivals including the Smithsonian Folklife Festivalhttps://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/44155 in Washington D.C.. In 1985, The Folktellers moved to Asheville, NC and began working on a play titled, Mountain Sweet Talk. This two-act, fully staged play starred Regan-Blake and Freeman, incorporating original material and stories of The Folktellers. The show ran for seven seasons (1986-1992) with over 300 performances at the Folk Art Center. Connie Regan-Blake set out as a solo performer in 1995. She collaborated with The Kandinsky Trio, a chamber music group (consisting of Elizabeth Bachelder on piano, Benedict Goodfriend on violin, and Alan Weinstein on cello) based out of Roanoke College, VA. Regan- Blake and The Kandinsky Trio performed Tales of Appalachia, a piece composed by Mike Reid which combined the arts of storytelling and chamber music. Connie Regan-Blake performed in Jonesborough, Tennessee at the International Storytelling Center on June 25, 2010. One of Connie Regan-Blake's original stories is \\"Hope is Back on Me: A Storyteller's Journey in Uganda.\\" It narrates her experience with Bead for Life, a non-profit group helping Ugandan women out of poverty. Regan-Blake has been a long-time community partner with this organization and made a trip to Uganda in 2007. Today, Regan-Blake continues her work as a storyteller as well as providing workshops and coaching under the company name, StoryWindow Productions.

His sufferings are recorded in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs.  The path of persecution  Robert Samuel was the minister of the parish church of East Bergholt, in the Stour valley, during the reign of King Edward VI, at which time it was permitted for priests to be married, and he dwelt there together with his wife. Following the accession of Queen Mary I, a strict edict was issued demanding that all married priests should set aside their wives and return to a life of celibacy. Robert Samuel's wife went to live in Ipswich. As a believer in the reformed faith, however, Samuel attracted the hostility of the virulent anti-reformist, William Foster, from the village of Copdock near Ipswich, a Justice of the Peace, who is described as 'a steward and keeper of the courts.' When, not long before, Dr Rowland Taylor of Hadleigh had found the (Roman) priest John Averth of Aldham, protected by armed guards, actually celebrating the Roman Catholic Mass in Taylor's benefice at Hadleigh, and had protested, it was Foster that had there immediately denounced Taylor as a traitor impeding the Queen's proceedings. Taylor was arrested and after an imprisonment in London and inquisition before the Bishops, was burnt at the stake at Aldham Common in February 1555. After this success Foster turned his attention to Samuel.  Arrest and imprisonment  Samuel was removed from his benefice at Bergholt, but continued secretly to visit the houses of those of his flock who still adhered to the reformed doctrines, so that his influence continued to be felt. Therefore, spies were sent after him, and it was decided to trap him whilst visiting his wife in Ipswich. A large band of assailants surrounded the house at night, seized him and dragged him away from his weeping wife to bear him off to prison. He was first imprisoned in the town gaol, which was then within the West Gate of the town, a medieval gateway within the earthen rampart. While in Ipswich he was succoured by two Ipswich women, Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield. John Bird, who had been the Keeper of the gaol since at least 1546, was in around 1556 accused by the Queen's Commissioners of encouraging the Protestants who were sometimes placed in his care. Samuel was in company with other like-minded prisoners, and 'passed his time meekly among his godly brethren, so long as he was permitted to continue there.'  Letters to the congregation  Robert Samuel wrote two letters To the Christian Congregation, exhorting his fellow- sufferers to > be constant in obeying God, rather than men. For, although they slay our > sinful bodies for God's verity, yet they cannot do it but by God's > sufferance and goodwill, to His praise and honour, and to our eternal joy > and felicity. For our blood shed for the Gospel shall preach it with more > fruit, and greater furtherance, than did our mouths, lives and writings, as > did the blood of Abel, Stephen, with many others more.  Norwich: inquisition, torture, visions  Samuel was next transferred to Norwich, to the prison then within Norwich Castle, for inquisition by the Bishop Dr Hopton, who had 'reclaimed' several heretics. He was subjected to tortures of atrocious cruelty, being \\"chained bolt upright to a great post, in such sort, that standing only on tip-toe he was fain to stay up the whole poise or weight of his body thereby.\\" At the same time he was fed only two or three mouthfuls of bread daily, and three spoonfuls of water. Perhaps as a result of this starvation and torment, after two or three days, \\"he fell into a sleep as it were one-half in a slumber, at which time one clad all in white seemed to stand before him, who ministered comfort to him by these words, 'Samuel, Samuel! be of good cheer, and take a good heart unto thee, for after this day shalt thou never be either hungry or thirsty.' Which thing came to pass accordingly,\\" for he felt neither hunger nor thirst again till he was led away to be burnt. He told his friends that he had received many other such comforts from Christ, but that he would not relate them from modesty. Angels ministered to him, and there was the form of some Other that lightened the gloom of the dungeon. He related a dream to his friends, which later interpreted as prophetic. He seemed to see three separate ladders set up to heaven, one of them longer than the others, but all at length joining together, and becoming one. On the day after his execution Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield, the two Ipswich women who had helped him, were arrested and later burnt.  Samuel's Confession of Faith  Among the various writings left by Samuel is a Confession of Faith which includes a statement as to his opinion of the higher mystical significance of the Holy Communion. Even this, however, was insufficient for the inquisitors who demanded obedience to the doctrine of transsubstantiation: > \\"As soon as I hear these most comfortable and heavenly words spoken and > pronounced by the mouth of the minister, 'This is My Body, which is given > for you,' when I hear (I say) this heavenly harmony of God's infallible > promises and truth, I look not upon, neither do I behold bread and wine; for > I take and believe the words simply and plainly, even as Christ spake them. > For hearing these words, my senses be rapt and utterly excluded, for faith > wholly taketh place, and not flesh, nor the carnal imaginations of our gross > fleshly and unreverent eating, after the manner of our bodily food, which > profiteth nothing at all, as Christ witnesseth, but with a sorrowful and > wounded conscience, and hungry and thirsty soul, and pure and faithful mind, > do fully embrace, behold and feed and look upon, that most glorious body of > Christ in Heaven at the right hand of God the Father, very God and very Man, > which was crucified and was slain, and His blood shed for our sins, there > now making intercession, offering and giving His holy body for me, for my > body, for my ransom, for my full price and satisfaction, who is my Christ, > and all that ever he hath, and by this spiritual and faithful eating of this > lively and heavenly bread I feel the most sweet sap and taste of the fruits, > benefits and unspeakable joys of Christ's death and passion, fully digested > into my soul. For my mind is quieted from all worldly adversities, > turmoilings, and troubles, my conscience is pacified from sin, death, hell > and damnation; my soul is full, and hath even enough, and will no more; for > all things are but loss, vile dung and dross, vain vanity, for the excellent > knowledge-sake of Christ Jesus, my Lord and Saviour. Thus now is Christ's > flesh my very meat indeed, and His blood my very drink indeed, and I am > become flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones. Now I live, yet not I, but > Christ liveth in me. Yea, I dwell in Him, and He in me, for, through faith > in Christ and for Christ's sake, we are one - that is, of one consent, mind, > and fellowship with the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Thus am I > assured and fully persuaded, and on this rock have I builded, by God's > grace, my dwelling and resting-place, for body and soul, life and death. And > thus I commit my cause, under Christ, the righteous and just Judge, who will > another day judge these debates and controversies, whom I humbly beseech to > cast His tender and merciful eyes upon the afflicted and ruinous churches, > and shortly to reduce them into a godly and perpetual concord.\\"  Execution  Robert Samuel died by burning at the stake as a judicial execution, in public in Ipswich on 31 August 1555. This was probably on the Corn Hill at the town centre, though the fact is not certainly recorded. It was reported that he was tied to a pole and forced to stand on tip-toe for several days before finally set ablaze. Those who attended the execution stated that it appeared to them that his burning body shone 'bright and white as new-tried silver.' The two women who had helped him were arrested on 1 September and imprisoned until their burning in Ipswich on 19 February 1556.  Sources  *John Foxe, Booke of Martyrs. *N. F.

The company operates internationally through its subsidiary companies DSD Shipping AS and DSD Cargo AS. The company is owned by the Hermansen family, through the holding company Folke Hermansen AS, after Folke Hermansen gained control of DSD in 1991. Chairman is Yuhong Jin Hermansen, while Ingvald L√∏yning has been CEO since 2015. The DSD Group, where Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap AS (DSD) is the parent company, wholly or partly owns four subsidiary companies. * DSD Shipping AS, a tanker company, which manages the technical and commercial operations of 7 crude oil and product tankers engaged in international shipping. * DSD Cargo AS, a shipping company and transport company with a versatile fleet and linear traffic between the Scandinavian countries, the Baltic States, Poland and (Germany). * Tide AS is one of Norway's and Denmark's largest bus companies. The business areas are public bus services, express- and airport bus services, as well as charter- and travel management.  Company history  DSD headquarters in Stavanger, built in 1971During a funeral at Jelsa, north of Stavanger, Norway, in 1854, the trader Ole Thorsen discussed the idea of launching a steamship company that would operate on a regular basis on the fjords of the county Rogaland, between Stavanger and Ryfylke. There were several important men present during the funeral and the idea struck. The idea was since debated in several newspaper articles in the fall of 1854. A large article in the newspaper \\"Stavanger Amtstidende og Adresseavis\\" emphasised the need for better communication between Stavanger and Ryfylke and publicly endorsed the establishing of a steamship company. Stavanger Handelsforening, the chamber of commerce in Stavanger, at their general meeting on 9 November 1854, also endorsed the idea and started issuing shares for the establishing of a steamship company. On 12 February 1855, the founding General Assembly of what would become Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap was held. The initial shareholders gave the Executive Board power of attorney to purchase a steamship with 50‚Äì60 horsepower. The ship was contracted in Scotland. On Tuesday 30 October 1855, the ship named \\"Ryfylke\\" came to Stavanger, with its captain Johan Gjemre on the bridge. The ship was a sensation and drew much attention. On Saturday 3 November, \\"Ryfylke\\" had its maiden voyage with both invited guests and paying passengers, and on Wednesday 7 November 1855 its first regular trip on its designated route took place. The first years of operation were difficult, with too little revenue. Revenue from mail freight eased the burden, but at the general meeting in 1858, proposals were made for the dissolution of the company. A decision in the Norwegian Parliament Stortinget on state subsidies for private steamship was a turning point. At the same time, Stavanger was developing rapidly. The herring industry was good, which laid the foundation for much of the future shipping and the prosperity of trading. In 1867 DSD got its second ship, the 125 feet long steamship \\"Stavanger\\". In 1869, the steamship \\"Haukelid\\" followed and the year after the steamship \\"Skjold\\". After this \\"Ryfylke\\" was taken out of regular operation and used as a reserve ship. From then on, the company was profitable. In recent times, DSD has had a number of difficult years behind it. From 2011 to 2015, the traditional Stavanger company had a total pre-tax loss of NOK 770 million. In 2016, the results were positive for the first time since 2010, with pre-tax profit of NOK 71.8 million. The reason for this was a significant improvement in revenue by the ferry company Norled, and also improvement by DSD Shipping. 2017 was even better, as the DSD Group had a turnover of NOK 5.9 billion, an increase of 70 percent from NOK 3.5 billion the year before, and a pre-tax profit of NOK 68 million. The reason for the enormous growth was that DSD became a sole proprietor of the Tide bus company in 2017, which was subsequently made a subsidiary of the group, and that Nor Lines AS, had been sold to the shipping company Samskip. In May 2019, DSD decided to sell Norled AS to CBRE Group and CapMan for an estimated 3-4¬Ω billion NKR. Norled is one of Norway's largest maritime and passenger transport companies, operating ferry and express ferry routes in fjords and along the coast of Norway. Company logo The flag and the motif that DSD uses as a logo dates back to 1903. The company's employees were invited to make suggestions for a flag and a draft designed by chief mate Ommund Thingb√∏ won. It is unclear where Thingb√∏ picked up the idea, but the base was the three red rings that were painted around the chimneys of all the ships that Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap operated. At that time it was also common with stars in the flag, which became an element in the motif. The flag has led to some controversy, as it is almost identical to the flag of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. At two occasions, Puerto Rico has formally requested Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap to get the company to change the flag, the first time through the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the 1950s. Lawyers have ruled that since the flag was in use many years before Puerto Rico formally got theirs, there is no violation of international rules. The flags are also not quite the same as the star of the company's flag tilts slightly compared to the star on the flag of Puerto Rico. Although the design of the Puerto Rican flag is actually eight years older than the flag of DSD, it was not officially approved as a national flag until 1952. Puerto Rico is also not an independent and sovereign state, and their flag can only be hoisted on official buildings along with the American Stars and Stripes.

The team was sponsored by the Colombian coffee growers Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia. History The team came into existence just as Colombian cyclists were achieving successes in Europe. This started with a Colombian National Cycling team entering and winning the Tour de l'Avenir in 1980 with Alfonso Florez. The 1983 Tour de France was the first time that the race was \\"open\\" to accommodate amateurs to compete. As a result, the Colombian cyclists were able to compete in a Colombian national cycling team. The following year the Colombian national team, with sponsorship from VARTA batteries, returned to the 1984 Tour de France where Luis Herrera, still an amateur, won the stage to the Alpe d'Huez. After these successes, a professional cycling team was set up that would give contracts and a chance of success in Europe to Colombian cyclists. In 1985 this team was called Varta‚ÄìCaf√© de Colombia‚ÄìMavic and had as manager Jos√© Ra√∫l Meza Orozco. The team was composed of 24 riders from Colombia, 20 of which Caf√© de Colombia had given them their first professional contracts, which included Luis Herrera and Fabio Parra. The following year Rapha√´l G√©miniani was team manager together with Jorge Humberto Tenjo Porras. In 1987 the team, under the guidance of team manager Rafael Antonio Ni√±o and directeur sportif Roberto S√°nchez, obtained perhaps its greatest success in 1987 when Luis Herrera won the Vuelta a Espa√±a.

One of the most notable rococo churches in Poland's capital, its construction was begun in 1664 and completed in 1761. History Interior Visitationist Church in 1780 by Bernardo Bellotto. The first wooden church was established in 1651 by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga de Nevers for the French Order of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This church was burned down by the Swedes during the Deluge in 1656. In 1664 the Visitationists started to build a new oblong church. The first stone was laid by primate Wac≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. This unfinished church burned in 1695. After the fire, the church was restored again. The new foundation was made in 1728 by a stateswoman El≈ºbieta Sieniawska following the plan of her private architect Karol Antoni Bay. The structural work was finished in 1761. The finishing touch was finally given in 1765. The church's main claim to fame, in Polish eyes, is that Fryderyk Chopin used to play the church organ here, mainly during services for schoolchildren. In front of this late-baroque church stands a statue of Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski, primate of Poland from 1948 to 1981. Interior The nave with main altar and 6 side chapels in Baroque style are embellished with rich Rococo decorations. There is an impressive and unique pulpit in a shape of boat and also a lot of old sculptures, paintings by old Polish, Italian and French masters (including Saint Louis de Gonzaga by Daniel Schultz), portraits of famous and noble Poles and tabernacle made of ebony and silver. This exceptional tabernacle, which initially was placed in the chapel of Villa Regia Palace in Warsaw, was donated to the church by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga de Nevers in 1654.

Life and career Wilcox was born in Bristol and began his senior career with Southern League club Bristol Rovers in 1901. His dribbling and goalscoring soon attracted attention, and in March 1903 he joined Football League Second Division club Small Heath for a fee of ¬£125 plus the proceeds of a friendly match between the clubs. In the six matches remaining, he scored seven goalstwo on debut against Blackpool, four in a 12‚Äì0 defeat of Doncaster Rovers that remains the club's record victory, and the winner against Manchester United in the last match of the campaignand Small Heath were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up. The following season he was joint leading scorer in league matches, though with only eight goals, as the team established itself at the higher level. In 1904‚Äì05 he played and scored for The North against The South in an England international trial, but the selectors preferred Stanley Harris at inside left. Wilcox and partner Oakey Field gained a reputation as the \\"best left wing in the First League\\" of that season, but both were injured towards the end of the campaign as Small Heath, who had been challenging for the title, were only able to finish seventh. Wilcox still managed twelve goals, and a further five in 1905‚Äì06 as he again lost time to injury and to a reported disagreement with the club. In March 1906, Wilcox was one of three highly rated playersEngland internationalsSteve Bloomer and Billy Brawn being the otherswho were brought to Middlesbrough in the hope of helping the struggling team avoid relegation from the First Division. Despite the gloomy prognostications of the Observer, they did retain their top-flight status. In 1906‚Äì07 Wilcox contributed twelve league goals as Middlesbrough finished 11th and a further five the following season in a 6th-place finish. In the later stages of his time at Middlesbrough, he was converted to play at half back, and was reported a great success at either centre half or left half. He suffered a knee injury during a match in March 1909 that effectively put an end to his career. He appeared once more for Middlesbrough, in October. Wilcox rejoined Birmingham in January 1911, and the 1911 census, taken some two months later, recorded his occupation as professional footballer for Birmingham F.C., but he made no first-team appearances. The 1939 Register lists him as a stacker in a brewery stores, living with his wife, Annie, in Woodlands Street, Smethwick, where he died in 1959.

It is 832 meters long and reaches from the branch of the Ranst√§dter Steinweg to the branch of the K√§the-Kollwitz-Stra√üe in a mainly northeast-southwest direction. The street has three lanes for car traffic in each direction and two tracks for tramways in the middle which are also used by night busses. The first tramway tracks on the street that is now Goerdelerring have been laid in 1872 as part of the original horse tram network of the city of Leipzig. There are no buildings immediately next to the street. Nevertheless, there are buildings with the address Goerdelerring. The most important one is the main firehouse. On the eastern side there is a small green area, on the western side the parking area of the firehouse and the Leipzig chamber of industry and commerce are situated. The continuation on the city circle is made by the Dittrichring to the south and the Tr√∂ndlinring to the east. The crossing that forms the northern end of the Goerdelerring and the northwestern edge of the city circle is one of the busiest crossings in Leipzig. Until 1945 the street was named Fleischerplatz, the northern crossing had the name Schulplatz.

In addition to its regularly scheduled news and talk programming, the station is an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves radio network, the Auburn Tigers football radio network, and the Auburn Tigers men's basketball radio network. History This station began licensed operation in October 1948 as a 1,000 watt daytime-only station broadcasting at 800 kHz. Originally owned by North Alabama Broadcasting, the station was assigned the WHOS call letters by the Federal Communications Commission. It ran a country music format for most of its first 40 years. In February 1987, the broadcast license for WHOS was transferred from Dixie Broadcasting, Inc., to Dixie Broadcasting, Inc. as Debtor-In-Possession. The transfer was approved by the FCC on February 26, 1987. Dixie Broadcasting had filed bankruptcy in an effort to stave off an adverse civil lawsuit outcome regarding the contracted sale of WDRM to W.H. Pollard, Jr., the then-owner of WBHP (1230 AM) in Huntsville, Alabama. In October 1988, the station, which had been airing a Gospel music format, flipped to an all-Elvis Presley format using the advertising tagline \\"WHOS alive?\\". This novel format garnered the station national media attention but failed to gain a local audience and lasted just six months. After the stunt ended WHOS switched to a simulcast of then co-owned WDRM and its country music format. In January 1992, a deal was reached for the broadcast license for WHOS to be transferred from Dixie Broadcasting, Inc. as Debtor-In-Possession back to Dixie Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 26, 1992, and the transaction was consummated on September 15, 1992. In December 1991, Dixie Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to merge ownership of this station with the ownership of WBHP to a new company named Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, Inc., pending the resolution of Dixie's legal difficulties. In October 1993, with Dixie Broadcasting back in good financial standing and the legal issues settled by the appeals courts, the merger moved forward. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 3, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on November 11, 1993. In November 1996, J. Mack Bramlett, W.H. Pollard Jr., and Trust B Under The Will Of W.H. Pollard Sr. reached an agreement to transfer control of Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, licensee of this station as well as WDRM and WBHP, to Osborn Communications Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 29, 1997. In November 1997, WHOS and WBHP dropped their shared country music format for an all-news format featuring CNN Radio 24 hours a day. In August 1998, Osborn-owned Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, LLC, reached an agreement to sell this station to AMFM Inc. a subsidiary of Ameron Broadcasting Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 2, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on November 5, 1998. In February 1999, AMFM Inc.'s Ameron Broadcasting Corporation made a deal to sell this station to Clear Channel Communications through their Capstar Royalty II Corporation subsidiary. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 2, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on March 5, 1999. This deal, a small part of a larger $16.6 billion transaction, included all five of the Huntsville stations currently in Clear Channel's Huntsville station group.

Background  A seventh-generation ballad singer, storyteller, and claw-hammer banjo player, Sheila Kay Adams was born and raised in the Sodom Laurel community of Madison County, North Carolina, an area renowned for its unbroken tradition of unaccompanied singing of traditional southern Appalachian ballads that dates back to the early Scots/Irish and English Settlers in the mid-17th century. Adams learned to sing from her great-aunt Dellie Chandler Norton and other notable singers in the community such as, Dillard Chandler and the Wallin Family (including NEA National Heritage Fellow Doug Wallin). She began performing in public in her teens and, throughout her career she has performed at festivals, events, music camps, and workshops around this country and the United Kingdom. In 1975, Adams graduated from Mars Hill College. In 2003 she was named Alumna of the Year and later received a LifeWorks recognition in appreciation for her shared commitment to service and responsibility, presented at the college's LifeWorks 150 Alumni Celebration in April 2007. After teaching in the North Carolina public schools for seventeen years, Adams turned to full-time music and storytelling. Music, storytelling, and performance Adams performs ballads from English, Scottish, and Irish traditions as she learned them from her ancestors, as well as innovating other tunes with a signature drop-thumb clawhammer style on the five-string banjo, an ability which has won her recognition and awards,Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011).

He played for Birmingham City in the Second Division of the Football League and for Sunderland in the First Division. Biography Purdon was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He came to England on tour with his South African club in 1950 at the age of 20, was watched by representatives of several clubs, and signed for Birmingham City. During his three seasons at the club he scored 30 goals in 70 games in all competitions and was the club's top scorer in 1953‚Äì54, despite playing only 23 games before his mid-season transfer to Sunderland. He was also a good cricketer, and was named once as twelfth man for Warwickshire.Matthews, p. 118. He moved to Sunderland, then known as the \\"Bank of England club\\" because of their high transfer spending, for a fee of ¬£15,000. Purdon made a spectacular start to his Sunderland career, scoring twice on debut against Cardiff City and following that up with a hat-trick (association football) against Arsenal at Highbury in his second game. The first goal of the three, scored after only ten seconds, was believed to be the fastest goal in Sunderland's history. Playing alongside the likes of Len Shackleton and Billy Bingham, he scored 42 goals in 96 games for the club over a three-year career. Purdon was a big man whose \\"physique allied to a total lack of fear made him a handful for any centre-half\\"; West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Norman Heath was in collision with him during a game and received spinal injuries so severe that he never played again. He and his team-mates were punished by the Football Association for receiving illegal payments from the club. By the time this matter was investigated, Purdon had left Sunderland for Workington of the Third Division North. He played his part in the club coming close to knocking Manchester United's Busby Babes out of the 1957‚Äì58 FA Cup. Workington took an early lead and Purdon came close to adding a second before Dennis Viollet's second-half hat-trick settled the matter. In March 1958 he moved to nearby Barrow, also in the Third Division North, where he also spent a year. He was part of the Barrow team which conceded ten goals in a league match at Hartlepools United. In August 1959 he dropped into non-league football, helping Bath City win the Southern League championship. This success prompted a move back into the Second Division at Bristol Rovers, but he only made four first-team appearances for the club. He emigrated to Canada in 1961, where he played for Toronto City and other Canadian clubs in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League, and also helped New York Ukrainians to win the 1965 National Challenge Cup. He later coached in Canada. Purdon was a founder member and honorary president of Sunderland's North American supporters' club. In company with fellow supporters he had just watched on television Sunderland beating Burnley in the game which almost clinched the club's 2007 promotion to the Premier League when he suffered a stroke. He died in a Toronto hospital two days later at the age of 77.

The parkway travels north from Interstate 215 (I-215) in northwestern Salt Lake City to an interchange named the Wasatch Weave in Farmington with two intermediate interchanges providing access to Woods Cross and Centerville. Wetlands of the nearby Great Salt Lake and nature preserves border the western side of the parkway while the eastern side roughly parallels Union Pacific and Utah Transit Authority rail lines and I-15. On average, between 20,000 and 23,000 vehicles use the parkway daily. Construction began in 2006 and was completed in 2008, with the parkway opening in September of the same year. The parkway was controversial in its construction and was challenged in court several times before a compromise was met between the state and the Sierra Club, which limited the speed on the road and banned semi-trucks on the highway except in emergencies. In addition to the restrictions on speed and trucks, the road was reduced from a six-lane expressway to a four-lane parkway. The compromise agreement restrictions have a sunset date of January 1, 2020, at which time the speed limit will increase to and trucks will no longer be banned. Route description The parkway begins at an incomplete interchange with I-215 in extreme northern Salt Lake County near the Jordan River Off-Highway Vehicle State Recreation Area. The interchange allows motorists from the Interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and travelers to access I-215 southbound. After about , Legacy Parkway enters Davis County, and heads northerly with two lanes in each direction through semi-rural Woods Cross. The parkway then turns northeasterly and back north again, meeting 500 South at a diamond interchange, which also provides a connection to Redwood Road (SR-68). The eastern border of the Legacy Nature Preserve is formed by the parkway as it travels north. In West Bountiful, the parkway curves to the northeast as it follows the contour of the wetlands which lie on the western side of the road. Before reverting to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane (SR-105) at another diamond interchange. Past the intersection, Union Pacific and Utah Transit Authority (FrontRunner) railroad tracks run between the parkway and I-15 to the east. For the remainder of the parkway's length, I-15 is located approximately east. Upon entering Farmington, the parkway gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a triple-junction with I-15, SR-225 and U.S. Route 89 west of Lagoon. This interchange is referred to as the Wasatch Weave. Legacy Parkway approaching 500 South The design of the road was re-envisioned to include extensive wetland protection west of the parkway and in the parkway median, a trail system along the side of the parkway, and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for ease of access to the trail system. Many of the architectural features were also specially-designed to give the parkway a unique feel. There are a total of of protected areas to the west of the highway, and an additional of wetlands along the length of the highway. The Legacy Nature Preserve lays along the western border of the parkway near its southern terminus. Further north, the parkway forms much of the eastern border of the Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area. For the entirety of the parkway's length it is paralleled by the Legacy Parkway Trail, and is partially paralleled by the Denver and Rio Grande Western rail trail. Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as many 22,955 vehicles used the highway on an average day near its junction with 500 South, and as few as 20,240 vehicles used the highway at its southern terminus at I-215. The Federal Highway Administration classifies Legacy Parkway as a MAP-21 Principal Arterial, and as such is part of the National Highway System. History Looking southbound from the 500 South interchange Legacy Parkway is part of the larger Legacy Highway project first proposed by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island or across Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to extend to the west side of the Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600 West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley Research for The Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64 percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19 percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed too many times for that to occur. Initial construction of Legacy Parkway began in 2001; however, it was forced to stop as a result of lawsuits over the completeness of the environmental impact statement (EIS). A federal appeals court ruled that the EIS was \\"inadequate\\" and \\"...arbitrary and capricious\\" as it did not study other alternate routes that were less harmful to wetlands that the parkway was originally to be routed through. A supplemental EIS (SEIS), which changed the routing of the highway as well as increased the amount of land to be part of the Legacy Nature Preserve, was completed in January 2005. The SEIS also added in the trail system that now parallels the parkway. On September 21, 2005, the State of Utah and the Sierra Club (acting on behalf of numerous groups opposing the overall Legacy Highway project) officially signed a compromise regarding Legacy Parkway. Some of the agreements reached include no billboards along the route, no semi-trailer trucks allowed on the parkway (except in cases where they are used in response to an accident or there is construction on I-15), and a speed limit. The speed limit on the parallel I-15 is ; however speeds in the leftmost lane can reach upwards of . Original plans for the highway had included a six-lane expressway, compared to the four-lane controlled-access parkway that was built. Construction of the parkway resumed in March 2006, with limited construction activity followed by heavy construction on the road beginning December 2006. The parkway earned the Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award in 2007. The highway was opened by then-governor Jon Huntsman, Jr., John Njord of UDOT and Stuart Adams of the Utah Transportation Commission on September 13, 2008 around 4:40 PM. The total cost of the parkway was $685 million (equivalent to $ in ). The original budget for the parkway was $451 million (equivalent to $ in ). A 5K and 10K run () and a bike race were held the morning of the opening of the highway along the main roadway to support cancer research. The route was designated a Utah Scenic Byway (as the Great Salt Lake Legacy Parkway Scenic Byway) on May 16, 2002, six years prior to its opening. Should the parkway be extended further north, significant work will have to be done to reroute the parkway or move the Farmington FrontRunner station and shopping complex which was built just north of the parkway.

The term comes from , the Irish word for the English language, and refers to both simple anglicisms and interlanguage forms. It is a result of bilingualism within a society where there is a dominant, superstrate language (in this case, English) and a minority substrate language with few or no monolingual speakers and a perceived \\"lesser\\" status (in this case, Irish). Types B√©arlachas exists in many forms, from the direct translation of English phrases to the common form of creating verbal nouns from English words by adding the suffix -√°il (this is also used to form verbs from native roots, such as trasn√°il, \\"cross over\\", from trasna \\"across\\", tuige√°il (Connacht, Ulster) \\"understanding\\" (Munster tuiscint), from tuig \\"understand\\", and so on). T√°im ag run√°il go dt√≠ an siopa (\\"I'm running towards the shop\\") is an example of B√©arlachas as \\"run√°il\\" is a verb created from the English word \\"run\\" with the Irish suffix -√°il attached; the traditional Irish for this would be T√°im ag rith go dt√≠ an siopa. Calquing also occurs: an English phrase is literally translated into Irish, even though an equivalent Irish phrase already exists. An example of this is \\"Moilligh s√≠os\\" (\\"slow down\\" ‚Äì moill \\"delay\\" + s√≠os \\"downwards\\", calqued from English), instead of the more traditional Maolaigh ar do luas (\\"reduce your velocity\\"), or simply Maolaigh! (\\"Slow down!\\"). Old borrowings Many words that are commonly thought by \\"purists\\" to be b√©arlachas have been a part of the Irish language for a long time, and have become \\"nativised\\". True b√©arlachas is where the word or phrase is known to be English and is not felt to be native to the Irish language, just as in the English language certain French or Latin words and phrases are used with the speaker's full knowledge of their \\"non-English\\" status, such as , , , and . At the same time, certain words that are sometimes assumed to be from English are actually from Norse or Norman French, and as such are not B√©arlachas. For example: * liosta: \\"list\\" () * aidhm: \\"aim\\" (Norman French ; where cusp√≥ir is considered by some to be the 'native' Irish word) * halla: \\"hall\\" (Norse ; the Irish word is √°ras). * v√©arsa, b√©arsa [the b- form considered to be uneducated dialect]: \\"verse\\" (Norman French ; the Irish word is rann) * cathaoir: \\"chair\\" (both words derive from Latin ) * sciorta: \\"skirt\\" (both words are from Norse skyrta) * c√≥ta: \\"coat\\" (both words are from Anglo-Norman cotte) *forc: \\"fork\\" (both from Latin furca) *pl√°ta: \\"plate\\" (both from Old French plate, from Medieval Latin plata) *gr√∫pa: \\"group\\" (both from French groupe) *seans: \\"chance\\" (both from Old French chance) *coinneal: \\"candle\\" (both ultimately from Latin candƒìla) *p√°ip√©ar: \\"paper\\" (Old Irish p√°ip√©r; both words derive from Old French paper, papier) *leathar: \\"leather\\" (Old Irish lethar, Old English le√æer; both words derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *l√©trom) *loch: \\"lake\\", \\"lough\\" (Old Irish loch, Old English lagu; both words derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *l√≥kus, \\"pond, pool\\") Other words are 'early B√©arlachas', having entered the language in the 18th and 19th centuries: * praghas: \\"price\\" (also possibly from Norman French , ) * dabht: \\"doubt\\" (the Irish words are: amhras, g√≥) The word p√©int is ambiguously B√©arlachas; it may have been borrowed directly from English \\"paint\\" or from Old French peint. The verb pinnt√©l (\\"to paint\\") appears in some Old Irish works. Other words are actually Celtic roots that have entered English: *carr: \\"car\\" (Old Irish carr, \\"wagon\\", from Proto-Celtic karros) *cros: \\"cross\\" (the Irish word is from Latin crux; the English form with -s at the end may be a borrowing directly from Old Irish) *clog: \\"clock\\" (Old Irish cloc, Latin clocca, possibly of Celtic derivation) * ambas√°id: \\"embassy\\" (both have their root in Celtic *ambactos, \\"servant, messenger\\") * donn√≥g: \\"dunnock\\" (from Brittonic *dunn- ƒÅco-s, *dunn-occo-s, meaning \\"little brown one\\") *c√©: \\"quay\\" (from Old French chai, from Gaulish caium) * iarann: \\"iron\\" (both words ultimately derive from Proto-Celtic *ƒ´sarnom, \\"iron\\") =False cognates= The word r√≥d (\\"road, route\\"), most commonly seen in iarnr√≥d (iron road, i.e. railway) is actually derived from Old Irish r√≥t (from ro-s√©t, \\"great path\\", or r≈çut, \\"distance, length\\") and is not a borrowing of English road, although it may have been influenced by the Old English root rƒÅd (\\"riding\\"). Oighean, the Irish word for \\"oven\\", is not derived from the English; it comes from Middle Irish aigen (\\"cooking-vessel, pan\\"), from Celtic root *agin√¢ (\\"vessel\\"). English oven is from Old English ofn, from Proto-Germanic *uhnaz. D√© (a term used before names of days of the week, as in D√© hAoine, \\"Friday\\"), is a false cognate: it derives from Latin dies, which is from Proto-Italic *djƒìm, PIE *dy·∏óws (\\"heaven\\"), while English \\"day\\" is from Old English d√¶ƒ°, from Proto-Germanic *dagaz.Kroonen, Guus (2013) Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series; 11), Leiden, Boston: Brill Modern concepts Words used for foreign inventions, imports, and so on, where a native Irish word does not exist, are often a macaronic import as well. These are strictly speaking not b√©arlachas, but examples of loans from foreign languages. In some cases an Irish word has been developed, and in others it has not. This has been a characteristic of word development in the language for as long as written records exist, and is not limited to b√©arlachas. In some cases the original Irish word is no longer known, or has a different meaning within the same semantic field: Modern forms: * f√≥n, guth√°n \\"phone\\" * carr, gluaiste√°n \\"car\\" * badhsuiceal, rothar \\"bicycle\\" Older forms: * iarla (Norse ), tiarna (Irish) \\"lord, earl\\" * p√≥g (Old Welsh , Latin \\"(kiss of) peace\\") \\"kiss\\" * b√°d (Old Norse), currach (Irish) \\"boat\\" * gars√∫n (Munster), gas√∫r (Connacht, Ulster), from French \\"small boy\\", buachaill (Irish) \\"teenager, youth\\" Variation In some cases, the foreign loan has an official pronunciation in Irish, and a colloquial one based on English; the colloquial form is B√©arlachas, while official form is a Gaelicisation of the foreign word: * ceint () \\"cent\\" * bus () \\"bus\\" * st√°das (, ) \\"status\\" The most striking forms of B√©arlachas, however, are the names of the letters of the alphabet‚Äîthe vast majority of which are normally said in the English way, except for ‚Äîas well as the use of words such as bhuel (\\"well\\"), dheas (\\"yes\\"), no (\\"no\\"), jost (\\"just\\"), dhi√∫n√≥ (\\"you know\\" ‚Äì for t√°'s agat) and √°lraight (\\"all right\\" ‚Äì for go maith). Such words are used with their English syntax in Irish: Well, I'll just wait here, you know, till you come back. Are you all right there, lad? - No, I'm not all right at all. Letters that are not traditionally used in Irish orthography occur (such as , as well as at the beginning of words), though in older B√©arlachas words the foreign sounds have been gaelicised: * : Job (beside from French, from Latin) * , : Zoo (where already exists) * w > bh / v: , \\"strolling, walking\\" Most words that begin with in the language are also foreign loans, as did not exist in prehistoric or early Old Irish (such as \\"kiss\\" (Old Welsh , Latin \\"peace\\"), (Latin \\"sin\\"). Republican use During The Troubles, between the 1970s and the 1990s, many physical force Irish republican prisoners in Long Kesh (later the Maze Prison) often spoke in Irish, for cultural reasons and to keep secrets from warders. This was dubbed the \\"Jailtacht\\", a portmanteau of \\"jail\\" and \\"Gaeltacht\\", the name for an Irish-speaking region. It is thought by some that the Republican slogan (\\"Our day will come\\") is a form of B√©arlachas, more idiomatic equivalents being Beidh √°r l√° linn (\\"Our day will be with us\\") or Beidh √°r l√° againn (\\"We will have our day\\"). However, the verb teacht, meaning \\"come\\", is often used in a variety of phrases to express the \\"coming\\" of days, such as th√°inig an l√° go raibh orm an t-oile√°n d‚Äôfh√°gaint (\\"the day came when I had to leave the island)\\". Similar phenomenon in Scottish Gaelic The same concept also exists within Scottish Gaelic, in which language it is referred to as . Some examples include: * st√≤raidh, \\"story\\" (instead of sgeulachd) * g√®am, \\"game\\" (instead of cluiche) * tidsear, \\"teacher\\" (instead of the older m√πin(t)ear) * nurs, \\"nurse\\" (instead of banaltram) References Macaronic forms of English Language contact ","title":"B√©arlachas"},{"id":"13188220","text":"Neuenkirchen is a municipality in the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

Including Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England, they occupy a broad area to the south of Great Langdale, Borrowdale and Wasdale. High and rocky towards the centre of the Lake District, the Southern Fells progressively take on a moorland character toward the south west. In the south east are the well known Furness Fells, their heavily quarried flanks rising above Coniston Water. Partition of the Lakeland Fells The Lake District is a National Park in the north west of the country which, in addition to its lakes, contains a complex range of hills. These are known locally as fells and range from low hills to the highest ground in England. Hundreds of tops exist and many writers have attempted to draw up definitive lists. In doing so the compilers frequently divide the range into smaller areas to aid their description. The most influential of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series has sold in excess of 2 million copies,: The Wainwright Society - The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007 being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary- and later writers have deviated to a greater or lesser extent from this blueprint-Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994) Richards, Mark: Lakeland Fellranger series: Collins (2002)ff: Mid-Western Fells Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Southern Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 4 of Wainwright's work.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: Boundaries Of all Wainwright's boundary decisions, the outer perimeter of the Southern Fells is the most often debated.Dave Hewitt, (ed.); A Bit of Grit on Haystacks (Disley: Millrace, 2004) Two ridges continue south west on either side of the Duddon Valley, the longer ending only at the Irish Sea in the terminal height of Black Combe. Wainwright however chose to excise a wide area of fell from his guidebooks, declaring that \\"south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country for the purposes of this book and the territory southwest omitted from the map\\". He makes similar statements regarding the fells to the south of Dow Crag on the parallel Coniston ridge. The later Fellranger guides mirror part of Wainwright's Southern Fells in the curiously named \\"Mid-Western Fells\\" volume, and then all of the fells south from Wrynose and Hardknott Passes to the sea in a further volume, \\"The Southern Fells\\". The author, Mark Richards, notes his differences with Wainwright in the introduction. Birkett simply includes everything without comment. Even Wainwright ultimately relented and included the southern extremities in an eighth guidebook, \\"The Outlying fells of Lakeland\\" (1974). The northern boundaries are clear, beginning on the west with Wastwater and rising up beyond the head of Wasdale to Sty Head Pass, the popular walkers' route to Borrowdale. Across the border on this side are Great Gable and the Western Fells. The boundary continues north to Stonethwaite in Borrowdale, before turning sharply south east along the Langstrath branch of that valley, including the long ridge of Glaramara within the Southern Fells. At the head of Langstrath the perimeter crosses Stake Pass, another pedestrian route, and sweeps eastward down Great Langdale to Windermere. Stake Pass provides the high level link to the Langdale Pikes in the Central Fells. Although falling within the Southern Fells area, Wainwright makes no mention of the low hills between Coniston and Windermere in the Pictorial Guides. These appear, somewhat illogically, within his Outlying Fells volume. Topography The Southern Fells occupy a broad sector of the circular Lake District massif, trending a little to the west of centre and about across in either direction. In addition to the perimeter dales, Eskdale and the Duddon Valley provide further subdivision flowing out from the centre of the district. Crinkle Crags (left) and Bowfell from Cold Pike In the north, surrounding the head of Eskdale, are the Scafells. Also standing above the valleys of Wasdale, Borrowdale and Great Langdale, this high cirque is open to the south and contains England's highest ground. The range begins on the west with Slight Side before rising to the summits of Scafell, Scafell Pike and Great End. Across the gap of Esk Hause and enclosing the eastern side of Eskdale are Esk Pike, Bowfell and Crinkle Crags. Satellites to this main ridge are Lingmell above Wasdale and the Allen Crags- Glaramara- Rosthwaite Fell ridge jutting deep into Borrowdale. East of Bowfell is Rossett Pike providing the link to the Central Fells. More loosely connected are Illgill Head and Whin Rigg, the fells forming the famous Wastwater Screes. South from Crinkle Crags, between Eskdale and the Duddon, are Hard Knott, Harter Fell and Green Crag. A second ridge falls south easterly from Crinkles over Cold Pike and Pike O'Blisco, crosses the motor road of Wrynose Pass and then rises to Great Carrs, the first of the Coniston (or Furness) Fells. The remainder of this group comprises Swirl How, Grey Friar, Wetherlam, Brim Fell, Coniston Old Man and Dow Crag, together forming the watershed between Coniston and the Duddon. To the east are the low outliers of Holme Fell and Black Fell. Illgill Head and the Wastwater Screes Access for walkers The high Southern Fells can be accessed from many of the principal walking centres of Lakeland, namely the heads of Wasdale, Borrowdale, Langdale and Eskdale. Sty Head, the Stake, Rossett Gill, Grains Gill, Burnmoor Tarn and Esk Hause provide pedestrian links between all of these valleys, many miles apart by road. The main paths from Seathwaite or Wasdale Head to Scafell Pike, and from Great Langdale up Bowfell are heavily used, as is the 'Tourist Route' up Coniston Old Man. These tops will be busy on almost any day of the year. Away from these famous tops however it is possible to find quieter walking, particularly to the south.

Princess Ferial was born on 17 November 1938. At the time of her birth, King Farouk was eighteen years of age and his wife, Farida of Egypt, was seventeen. Her birth was marked by nationwide celebrations which included the distribution of clothes and free breakfasts to thousands of poor. In addition, each of the 1,700 families of infants born on the same day were given one Egyptian pound, which was a large sum at that time. Princess Ferial was later joined by two more sisters, Princesses Fawzia and Fadia. In search of an heir, King Farouk divorced Queen Farida in 1949 and married Narriman Sadek. That marriage produced Fuad II, Ferial's half-brother and last King of Egypt. Life in exile In 1952, the Revolution by the Free Officers sent the Royal Family into exile in Italy. She left Egypt at the age of 13 on the royal yacht Mahroussa.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/royalty- obituaries/6772701/Princess-Ferial-Farouk.html The family's time in exile was spent in Naples, Capri and Rome. Ferial's correspondence with her mother Farida shows that she was very sad to leave Egypt and especially the people she knew and loved there. Ferial was unable to return to Egypt while Nasser remained in power. Not until 1973, three years into Sadat's regime was she allowed access to the country and permitted an Egyptian passport. She would later spend her summers in Egypt with her daughter Yasmine visiting relatives.http://www.thenational.ae/news/the-princess-who-chose-exile =Education= At the will of their father Farouk, Princess Ferial and her sisters were educated privately, and then at Grand Verger Finishing School a boarding school in Lutry, Switzerland. Their mother stayed in Egypt for 10 years after their exile eventually moving to Lebanon and then reuniting with them in Switzerland. =Family life= Her father Farouk was a very strict parent during their exile requiring the sisters to get permission for even trivial things such as hair cuts and wearing nail polish. Her father only gave her permission to teach at a sectarian school in Lausanne if she kept her identity a secret. Ferial lived the majority of her life after her marriage outside of Montreux, where she taught typing and French literature. Later when she married, she and her husband operated a hotel in the area. In 1966, she married the Swiss Jean-Pierre Perreten, at Westminster, London. Perreten was the son of a Swiss hotelier and converted to Islam to make the marriage possible. He took on the name Samir Cheriff as part of his conversion. They had one daughter, Yasmine Perreten-Shaarawi, in 1967. In 2004 she married 'Ali Sha'arawi who is the grandson of Huda Sha'arawi the iconic Egyptian author and feminist. Ferial and Perreten divorced quickly after their daughter's birth. She did not remarry. After her mother died in 1988, the sisters were prompted to file a lawsuit against the Egyptian government over their ownership of a royal palace in the Nile Delta. The sisters believed that the land and property belonged to their mother and that with her death, they were the rightful owners of the property. However the Egyptian court ruled against them because their parents' divorce had voided their mother's claim to the land even before all royal property was taken over during the revolution. Princess Ferial spent the rest of her life out of the public eye taking care of her siblings. Her sister Fawzia suffered from multiple sclerosis and died in 2005. Her brother Fouad went through a great depression after his divorce from his wife Dominique-France Picard. While Ferial wasn't supportive of this marriage she supported her brother through his emotional struggles. Death Princess Ferial died in a hospital on 29 November 2009, aged 71, in Montreux, Switzerland, where she had been receiving treatment for stomach cancer, which she was diagnosed with in 2002. Ferial was buried alongside her family in the Khedival mausoleum of Cairo's Rifa'i Mosque. This is where all members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty are buried. Ancestors Princess Ferial of Egypt is of Circassian (26/32), Turkish (3/32), French (2/32) and Albanian (1/32) descent. References * Egyptian Royalty by Ahmed S.

It is found primarily in the east-central United States, from Maryland south to Georgia, with isolated populations as far west as Oklahoma and as far north as Qu√©bec and Ontario.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map The common names are whorled tickseed, whorled coreopsis, thread-leaved tickseed, thread leaf coreopsis, and pot-of-gold. Description Coreopsis verticillata is an herbaceous perennial that grows tall and about wide, although as it spreads laterally by rhizomes, this width can be exceeded. The stems are wiry. The flower heads are up to across, and both the disc florets and ray florets are bright yellow. The flowers are produced abundantly in clusters from midsummer to fall.Flora of North America, Coreopsis verticillata Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 907. 1753. Habitat Coreopsis verticillata can commonly be found in dry, thin woods and open pinelands, preferring sites with full sun exposure. It can tolerate drought, poor soil, extreme heat, and neglect. Horticultural cultivation Coreopsis verticillata and its horticultural cultivars are not difficult to grow and hence make good starter plants for beginners. They have a long flowering season and are relatively free from pests and diseases. They attract butterflies and are deer resistant. They can be grown in hanging baskets and containers (where irrigation will be necessary), or as border plants. Carolyn Singer, in \\"Deer in My Garden\\", reports that C. verticillata is a good companion plant with other summer-blooming perennials requiring similar conditions.

It connected U.S. Route 20 (US 20) to downtown Syracuse via Skaneateles, Camillus, Manlius, and Cazenovia in Onondaga County and Madison County. The highway began at an intersection with US 20 and NY 321 in the village of Skaneateles and ended at a junction with US 20, NY 20N, and NY 92 near the village of Cazenovia. Most of NY 20SY overlapped another route; however, two sections of NY 20SY‚Äîone in the town of Camillus and another near the village of Fayetteville‚Äîwere not concurrent with another highway. NY 20SY was assigned in 1951, overlapping parts of the pre- existing NY 321, NY 5, NY 92, and NY 20N, a more southerly alternate route of US 20 in the Syracuse area. Both NY 20N and NY 20SY were removed in 1961. The two independent sections of NY 20SY near Camillus and Fayetteville eventually became part of NY 321 and NY 92, respectively. Route description =West of Syracuse= NY 20SY began at an intersection with US 20 (East Genesee Street) and NY 321 (State Street) in the village of Skaneateles. The route proceeded northward, overlapping NY 321 through the lakeside village and into the surrounding town of Skaneateles, where it became State Street Road. Once in Skaneateles, the surroundings became mostly rural ahead of an intersection with the Old Seneca Turnpike. The highway continued on, turning to the northeast as the highway entered the town of Elbridge. The former northern terminus of NY 174 and NY 321 at NY 5 and NY 20SY in Camillus as it appeared in 2008 In Elbridge, NY 20SY and NY 321 followed a more east‚Äìwest routing as it passed through the town and intersected NY 368\\\\. The route progressed eastward, intersecting with Limeledge Road (County Route 236A or CR 236A) as it passed into the town of Camillus. Just east of the town line, NY 20SY and NY 321 split at an intersection with Forward Road, with NY 321 following Forward Road eastward and NY 20SY proceeding north on modern NY 321 to an intersection with NY 5 (West Genesee Street). NY 20SY turned eastward here, joining NY 5 as both highways headed toward the village of Camillus. West of Camillus, NY 5 and NY 20SY passed to the north of the West Hill Golf and Croquet Club before veering to the southeast as the highway approached the village of Camillus and the edge of a valley surrounding Ninemile Creek that contains the village. Upon reaching the lip of the valley, NY 5 and NY 20SY descended northeastward into both the valley and the village. Here, NY 5 and NY 20SY met the northern terminus of NY 174 and NY 321 before exiting the valley and entering an area of Camillus known as Fairmount. =Syracuse= Routes 5 and 20SY proceeded eastward through the primarily residential neighborhood of Fairmount to an intersection with NY 173 (South Onondaga Road) in eastern Fairmount. The routes continued on, passing through the town of Geddes before entering the city of Syracuse. In Syracuse, the two routes followed West Genesee Street and West Erie Boulevard into the downtown district, where NY 5 and NY 20SY intersected NY 48 at the intersection of West Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street and US 11 at the junction of Erie Boulevard and State Street. Signage along the NY 92 / NY 173 overlap in Manlius. This overlap included NY 20N and NY 20SY during the 1950s and early 1960s East of State, NY 20SY continued to follow NY 5 through the eastern part of Syracuse. The two routes met the southern terminus of NY 433 at Midler Avenue before passing north of LeMoyne College and exiting the city of Syracuse. Upon crossing into the town of DeWitt, Routes 5 and 20SY curved southward toward the hamlet of DeWitt, situated at the junction of NY 5 and NY 92. Both NY 5 and NY 20SY turned east onto NY 92, joining the route for just over to the vicinity of Fayetteville. While NY 5 and NY 92 continued east into Fayetteville, NY 20SY turned southeast onto High Bridge Road. =East of Syracuse= The High Bridge Road portion of NY 20SY largely served as a southwestern bypass of Fayetteville. NY 20SY proceeded southeast from NY 5 and NY 92, crossing into the town of Manlius and passing over Limestone Creek at a point known as High Bridge. Just northwest of the village of Manlius, NY 20SY intersected NY 92 at what is now the junction of NY 92 and NY 257. The two routes converged once more, following Fayette Street into the village of Manlius. In the village center, NY 20SY and NY 92 intersected Seneca Street, which carried the overlapping routes of NY 20N and NY 173\\\\. NY 20SY and NY 92 joined NY 20N and NY 173 here, creating a four-route overlap that lasted for two blocks through the village's business district to the junction of Washington and Seneca Streets. Here, NY 173 split from the overlap, following Seneca Street (the old Seneca Turnpike) eastward while the other three highways veered southeast onto Washington Street. The eastern terminus of NY 92 in Cazenovia. This also served as the eastern terminus of NY 20SY and NY 20N NY 20N, NY 20SY, and NY 92 exited the village, paralleling Limestone Creek as the highway headed southeastward through rural portions of the towns of Manlius and Pompey. As Cazenovia Road, the route served Buellville and Oran, two small creekside hamlets in the town of Pompey. Roughly southeast of Manlius, Limestone Creek and the three-route overlap split, with the creek proceeding south through a valley known as Pompey Hollow and the highway continuing into Madison County and the town of Cazenovia within. In Cazenovia, the road became known as Syracuse Road and began to follow a more southerly alignment as it turned ahead of Cazenovia Lake. NY 20N, NY 20SY, and NY 92 gradually approached the lake and ultimately followed the western lakeshore as the roadway approached the village of Cazenovia. The three routes never actually reached the village, however, as all three designations ended at an intersection with US 20 (the Cherry Valley Turnpike) west of the village limits and west of the village center. History 1957 United States Geological Survey topographic map of Camillus, showing one of NY 20SY's two independent segments NY 20SY was assigned in 1951 as an alternate route of US 20 in the Syracuse area. While US 20 bypassed the city of Syracuse to the south, NY 20SY veered north to serve Downtown Syracuse and the eastern and western suburbs of the city. It was the second alternate route of US 20 near Syracuse; the first, NY 20N, was also a northern alternate route of US 20 but it followed a more southerly routing than NY 20SY. Most of NY 20SY was concurrent to other, pre-existing state highways in the Syracuse area, namely NY 321, NY 5, NY 92, NY 173, and NY 20N. NY 5 was assigned in 1924; NY 92, NY 173, and NY 321 were assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; and NY 20N was assigned . While most of NY 20SY was concurrent with at least one other state highway, there were two segments where NY 20SY followed an independent routing. One was in the town of Camillus, where NY 20SY followed a previously unnumbered highway between NY 321 and NY 5; the other was southwest of the village of Fayetteville, where NY 20SY used a previously unnumbered highway to bypass the village while NY 92 passed through it. When NY 20SY was first assigned, it entered downtown Syracuse on NY 5 and followed NY 5 and US 11 through downtown before leaving the area on NY 92. It was realigned by 1954 to follow only NY 5 through downtown. The route left its original alignment at the junction of US 11 and NY 5 in downtown Syracuse and rejoined it at the western terminus of the NY 5 / NY 92 overlap in DeWitt. Both NY 20N and NY 20SY were removed in 1961. The independent section of NY 20SY that bypassed Fayetteville became a realignment of NY 92 upon the removal of NY 20SY. The other independent section in Camillus became a realignment of NY 321 in the late 1980s.

One family came by canoe and settled near the banks of Muvattupuzha river at Ramamangalam. The Murimattathil Kudumbam (family) has more than 600 families living near Ramamangalam. One branch settled at Kolenchery. Thus Murimattathil Bava was born in a Murimattathil family of Kolenchery. He learnt Syriac at a very early age and read many religious books from the collection of his uncle, Youseph Kathanar. When his elder brother, Kunjikkuru Chemmachen, a deacon, died, his parents and uncle Youseph Kathanar expressed their desire that Paulosekutty become deacon to take the place of Kunjikkuru. Paulosekutty was ordained Deacon by the Malankara Metropolitan Philipose Mar Dionysius (Mar Dionysius IV of Cheppad) at the age of seven. Deacon Paulosekutty completed his Syriac education from Konattu Yohannan, Malpan of Pampakkuda. In 1852, at the age of 16, he was ordained priest by the Malankara Metropolitan Philipose Mar Dionysius. Fr. Paulose took the responsibility of Kolencherry Church. He had the opportunity to continue his Syriac education under Yuyakkim Mar Kurilose, Metropolitan from Syria. In 1875 Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Peter III visited Malankara. Paulose met him at Mulanthuraty. The Patriarch arranged for Fr. Paulose to be ordained as Metropolitan. On 17 May 1877, Fr. Paulose was ordained as Mar Ivanios Metropolitan (bishop) at Kunnamkulam Church by Patriarch Peter III. He was assigned the responsibility of the Diocese Kandanad. First Catholicos of the East in India The Vaideeka Synod (Synod of the Clergy) presided over by Ignatius Abdul Masih II and Malankara Association Managing Committee unanimously decided that Mar Ivanios Metropolitan be enthroned as Catholicos of the East. Ignatius Abdul Masih II was the controversially deposed Patriarch of AntiochVadakkekara, p. 95.Tamcke, p. 214. and until the 1950s, some claimed the relocation of the Catholicate to India was without authority from the Universal Syriac Orthodox Synod, thus causing century-long disputes in the Malankara Church. However, this claim was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India in 1958, which accepted the validity and authority of the Catholicos of the East as the Primate of Malankara Orthodox Church. Initially, Mar Ivanios refused to take up the position due to his ill health and old age, but later accepted when pressed to do so. On 15 September 1912, Mar Ivanios Metropolitan was ordained and enthroned as Moran Mar Baselios Paulose I Catholicos of the East at Saint Mary's Church, Niranam by Ignatius Abdul Masih II. When Baselios Paulose I was crowned on the Throne of Saint Thomas, Ignatius Abdul Masih II accepted the autonomy and autocephaly of the Malankara Orthodox Church with its own constitution and powers, which included the right to ordain Metropolitans, to consecrate Holy Chrism and perform other holy services. Paulose I as Catholicos of the East resided at Orthodox Pazhaya Seminary, Kottayam.  Legacy  Baselios Paulose I designed the order and style of the prayers and Holy Qurbana (Eucharist) that is still followed in the church. He established Malankara Suriani Suvishesha Sangham as well as Sunday schools in the church. As Metropolitan he had built 17 churches in the Kandanad Diocese. He also started many schools. He trained many priests at St. Peters and St. Pauls Church of Kolenchery. He bought land at Muvattupuzha to build an Aramana (palace) which became the church headquarters and also built a small church there.  Death  Upon falling ill Paulose I expressed his desire to settle in one of the churches of Kandanad Diocese. However the trustee of the clergy, Mani Paulose Palapillil of Pampakuda, invited him to his church and provided him with the necessary facilities. Bava predicted the day of his demise and a large crowd of people visited him and waited in prayer. He died on 2 May 1913 and was buried at St. Thomas Orthodox Church, Pampakuda on the next day.

He was elected to this high office in 1817. He was an important figure in the early history of his denomination and a pioneer in the history of Pennsylvania and the United States. Birth and early years Andrew was born in Pennsylvania in 1755. We know very little of his early life. He resided in Berks County, in Eastern Pennsylvania. He was raised on a farm, and would have been familiar with the duties and trials of a farmer's life, which in that day were not few. His education would have been very limited, comprising a knowledge of but the simplest branches. Bishop Zeller was known to often repeat the following story from his early boyhood: :There were six boys in his father's family. They lived in a new country, which had to be prepared for the plow before it could yield an abundant harvest. It is altogether probable that, with so large a family to look after, the members of it had only the plainest of food. They resided near the banks of a little stream called the Swatara, which the boys called the Sweet Arrow. These boys would at times gather around a large dish of soup, which was the only article of diet for that meal, and with no other utensils for eating but iron spoons. With these each did his best to satisfy the demands of a strong appetite. They had already learned the art of comparing their dish with the stream near them, and, as they were rapidly emptying their dish, they would occasionally measure its depth with their spoons, and say, \\"The Sweet Arrow is so deep,\\" conscious of the fact that, as the depth diminished, their pleasure was lessened.

It was founded in 1847 where, at the time, it was a stand-alone city out of the confines of Columbus until it was incorporated into the City of Columbus in 1871. In its early years the city was a popular stagecoach stop with people traveling from Worthington to Columbus. Today Old North Columbus is popular for its local music and its unique \\"untouched architecture\\" which is reminiscent of its old roots. Geography Old North Columbus is bounded to the north by Glen Echo Ravine, to the south by Lane Avenue, to the west by the Olentangy River, and to the east by the Conway Railroad Tracks. This Columbus neighborhood is a smaller subdivision of the University District, which comprises all of the neighborhoods surrounding the Ohio State University campus. Etymology Established as North Columbus in 1842, the name of the town largely lost relevance when it was annexed by city of Columbus in 1871. In an effort by the city to reestablish the neighborhood's identity, a street project was proposed in 2000 to add two arches at the north and south borders of the neighborhood bearing the neighborhood's name, Old North Columbus. In 2009, upon the building of the arches, there was a campaign led by the Olde North Columbus Preservation Society to add the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù to the end of ‚ÄúOld‚Äù, on the two arches. According to Preservation Society member Seth Golding, \\"Olde was the spelling in the 1850s. It's more quaint, not just old. \\" Despite Preservation Society claims that the spelling was supposed to be corrected, the two arches retain the original spelling of ‚ÄúOld‚Äù. History 1806 Beers Family Log Cabin located on E Norwich Ave., Columbus, Ohio. Solomen and George W. Beers platted 40 acres of land in 1847 to create the first permanent settlement of Clinton Township, which they named North Columbus. This community was separate from the city of Columbus, which lay just to the south, but was later annexed by Columbus in 1871. During the 19th Century, North Columbus was a stagecoach stop between downtown Columbus and Worthington. Unlike the adjacent temperance-minded neighborhood of Clintonville, North Columbus had a history of saloons and speakeasies adorning the main thoroughfare of what is today High Street. North Columbus was also the site of a brick factory and a mill along the banks of the Olentangy River, which was owned and operated by the Beers Family, who helped to settle the area originally. Soon after being annexed in 1871, the city had a new neighbor in the community in 1873, The Ohio State University. Ohio State brought a major boom to the area and with that boom came more people that needed to live, work, and play. This really was the birth of what Old North Columbus is today. =Notable and historic landmarks= Global Community United Methodist Church Old North Columbus has a number of Historic structures dating back to the early 19th Century. The North Columbus Commercial Historic District, which encompasses the entire stretch of High Street between Hudson Street and Dodridge Street is on the National Register of Historic Places. 1806 Beers Family Log Cabin There is also an original early 19th century log cabin, built in 1806 by David Beers, still present in the neighborhood. The log cabin was built near present-day Dodridge Street, but was later moved to Norwich Avenue. North High School Also appearing on the National Register of Historic Places is the old North High School, a Tudor Revival building designed by famed architect, Frank Packard, which opened in September 2, 1924. The Ramlow Building The Ramlow building, or Ramlow Hall, on the corner of High Street and Dodridge is one of a handful of prominent historic building along High Street, which date back to the late 19th century, and are still present. Built by Catherine Volk Ramlow in 1881, the Ramlow building was a drygoods and grocer merchant. Today, the popular restaurant Hounddog's Pizza resides in the Ramlow building at street level. Medary Elementary School - Columbus, OH Global Community United Methodist Church The Global Community United Methodist Church, formerly the North Methodist Church, was built on the corner of High Street and Wilcox Street in 1874, but was destroyed by a fire in 1929. Despite economic hardships of the Great Depression, the church was rebuilt 12 years later and dedicated on September 27, 1942 by Bishop H. Lester Smith. Medary Elementay School The old Medary Elementary School, located at 2500 Medary Avenue, was built in 1892 by David Riebel, who was hired as the first Columbus Public Schools architect in 1893. The impressive three-story masonry building was built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style of architecture, which was a popular style for many public buildings throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century. Medary Elementary School closed in 2007 and the building has served as the home for the Bridgeway Academy, fka Helping Hands Center for Special Needs since 2008. Transportation The main thoroughfare running North and South through the neighborhood is High St. and running east and west is Hudson St. This is where many restaurants, bars, shops, and entertainment destinations are located, and where most of the activity is centered. From these main thoroughfares, arterial streets the run East and West. These arterials include Lane Ave. and Dodridge St., which are the only two streets in the neighborhood which bridge the Olentangy River to the West. Nearly all other streets running east‚Äìwest can be classified as residential streets, most of which are one-way, in alternating directions. US Route 23 also runs through Old North Columbus using Indianola Ave., Hudson St., Summit St. (southbound), and N. 4th St. (northbound). Old North Columbus is also very accessible by bus. The Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) has local bus routes traveling along High, Summit, and 4th Streets, one express route traveling along High St., and two cross-town routes traveling along Arcadia Ave. and Hudson St. Residential Old North Columbus Neighborhood The residential sector of Old North Columbus has always been a melting pot of significant diversity including the full spectrum of working class to the wealthy as well as its share of students. After World War II there was a tremendous amount of veterans looking to go to school at Ohio State with the GI Bill and at the same time the Baby Boomers were headed to college as well. Pair that with the national trend of \\"white flight\\" moving to the suburbs and you had a recipe for a crazy housing crisis in the Columbus suburbs. This major influx of GIs and students really caused the housing market to flip. Home ownership dropped from over 50% to around 10% as many of the large old houses were converted to multi-family high density housing that would accommodate the renter population. Historically off campus housing has poor housing stock, this is the case for neighborhoods close to Ohio State, however farther north the quality of housing is generally of better quality. Commercial District Old North Columbus has had a long history of restaurants, bars, and music venues, which still holds true today. With the core of commercial district located along High Street, the businesses in the neighborhood range from grocery stores, pharmacies, printing and copy services, laundromats, barber shops and salons, but primarily this has been a popular entertainment district for students at Ohio State. Some of the notable popular restaurants include The Blue Danube, which is known locally as The Blue Dube, or simply The Dube, which has been a popular restaurant of the neighborhood since 1940. Another popular restaurant is Hounddog's Pizza, which is known for its hearse delivery car with a giant hound dog on the roof.

Licensed to St. Pauls, North Carolina, United States, the station serves the Fayetteville area. The station is currently owned by Beasley Media Group, through licensee Beasley Media Group Licenses, LLC, and features programming from ABC Radio. Its studios are located east of downtown Fayetteville, and its transmitter is located west of Lumber Bridge, North Carolina. History On October 14, 1994, Lumbee Regional Development Association, owner of gospel station WYRU in Red Springs, added a 6,500-watt FM station called WLRD. With 100,000-watt WZFX the only urban contemporary station in the Fayetteville market since 1990, \\"The Flava\\" would play the hottest new artists mixed with old school.Michael Futch, \\"'David and Goliath' Do Battle on the Airwaves,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, October 14, 1994. By the spring of 1997, WLRD ranked third, behind WZFX and WKML, in the Arbitron ratings. Later that year, Beasley Media Group purchased WYRU and WLRD from Lumbee Regional Development Association for about $1.2 million. The company had also purchased WZFX, and briefly aired that station's programming on WLRD.Michael Futch, \\"Beasley Group Buys 2 More Stations,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, July 31, 1997. \\"Kiss\\" logo On August 11, 1997 WLRD became Kiss 107.7, playing a more adult version of urban contemporary known as \\"The Touch,\\" with artists such as Al Green, Whitney Houston, Patti Labelle, and Earth, Wind and Fire.Michael Futch, \\"Format Change Gives WLRD, 'Kiss 107.7,' a Woman's Touch,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, August 24, 1997. The station changed its call letters to WUKS, increased its power to 25,000 watts, and added Tom Joyner in the mornings. Later, Kiss added live DJs and, for a while, moved in an adult contemporary direction with George Michael, Dave Koz, The Temptations, Bobby Womack, The Chi-Lites, Babyface, and Kenny G.Michael Futch, \\"Kiss Makes Its Niche with Love Songs,\\" The Fayetteville Observer May 21, 2000. In the spring of 2008, midday host Omega Jones, and afternoon host Jae McKrae, and Calvin P in the evening held their positions respectively. In the fall of 2008, WUKS was ranked #2 overall in the market with 8.5 percent of listeners. That was the first time since 1986 a station other than Foxy 99 or WKML hit the number 2 mark. That successful trio lasted about a year, until February 2009. The station slipped to fourth with 7.6 the next year. The March 2009 debut of similarly formatted WMGU likely played a role in the station's continuous decline to eighth, at 4.3, in the spring of 2010; WMGU was fourth. By early 2010, Taylor Morgan and Calvin P were holding down midday and afternoon drive. At 10:00 am on September 8, 2010, an announcement was made (from afternoon announcer Calvin P) in a variation of this: \\"As always we thank you, our loyal listeners, for listening to WUKS-FM, St. Pauls, Fayetteville over the years. But as you know, things must change. Now, we must kiss and say goodbye.\\" The final song on 107.7 Kiss FM was The Manhattans' \\"Kiss and Say Goodbye\\". Following this track, another announcement was made stating the switch from Kiss FM to 107.7 Jackson FM. The station began playing music from the Jackson family, with the first song being \\"Thriller\\" by Michael Jackson. The Jackson format was a stunt. On Friday, September 10, WUKS resumed under what reports called an \\"urban variety\\" format, using the name \\"107.7 Jamz... Everything that jamz.\\" Beasley said the new sound \\"targets men and women, ages 25 to 54, with a blend of rhythm-and-blues, funk and early hip-hop from the 1970s to today's hits.\\" Beasley market manager Mac Edwards said listeners indicated they wanted more energy and more of the songs they danced to when younger. Today Taylor Morgan sits as the Program Director and midday drive personality. You can also find The Big Teddy Bear live and local during the afternoon drive on Old School 107.7 JAMZ.

The station is has a new format. WLOR is part of the Black Crow Media Group and the broadcast license is held by BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-in-Possession. Its studios are located off University Drive (U.S. 72) in Huntsville, and its transmitter is located north of the city. Black Crow Media Group sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 12, 2010. In November 2011, the company announced reorganization plans that will shift the license to Southern Stone Communications, LLC, under the same parent company. History =Early days= Great American WAAY 1970s The station originally started on November 10, 1946, as WHBS on 1490 AM (1,000 watts day/250 night), which was owned by The Huntsville Times. It later added an FM simulcast in 1948 on 95.1 FM, which was discontinued around 1955. The station moved to 1550 kHz, with an increase of daytime power to 5,000 watts/500 night, on November 4, 1952. From 1958 to 1989, this station used the call letters WAAY as the Top 40-formatted AM sister station of WAAY-TV. The station went to 50,000 watts-daytime power in 1980 (the maximum output permitted for U.S. AM radio stations) and then operated from a separate daytime and nighttime site until 1991. WAAY also was the first station to broadcast in AM stereo in the Huntsville market in 1984, using the Kahn-Hazeltine stereo system. Both WAAY-AM-TV stations were owned and operated by Smith Broadcasting, a local family that has since divested its broadcasting interests. =Finding religion= '80s AM STEREO logo When the AM station was sold, the new owners were required to change the callsign. They chose WAAJ in April 1989 to accompany the station's change to a gospel music and religious format. This format and callsign ran until April 1993 when the station became WLOR. At around 1998, WLOR returned to the air with a black gospel format (daytime only, as the nighttime site had been demolished). In March 2000, the station was purchased by STG Media LLC (Steven J. Shelton, president) for a reported sale price of $425,000. In November 2001, due to a proposed refinancing of the parent company STG Media, LLC, applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses of WAHR, WLOR, and WRTT-FM to Black Crow Media Group subsidiary BCA Media, LLC. Just two days later, another application was filed to shift the licenses to BCA Radio, LLC. The FCC approved the moves on November 15, 2001, and the consummation of the transaction occurred on November 19, 2001. In July 2002 the station began the \\"Jammin' 1550\\" branding and in early 2002 nighttime operations resumed from the daytime site. =True Oldies= In June 2008, ABC's The Touch programming was replaced with ABC's True Oldies Channel format. This \\"true oldies\\" format was programmed by legendary disc jockey Scott Shannon. An FM simulcast of WLOR started on May 1, 2009, on FM translator W251AC at 98.1 FM with a transmitter located on Drake Mountain. The station was re-branded as \\"Sunny 98\\". (The 98.1 translator was previously operated as a WQPR/WBUZ/WKDF translator on Capshaw Mountain.) The station would later drop the True Oldies format and shift to urban oldies. In January 2010, Black Crow Media Group and its subsidiaries filed for \\"Chapter 11\\" bankruptcy, seeking to reorganize rather than be broken up. Their filing with the FCC notified the Commission of the involuntary transfer of the license from BCA Radio, LLC, to an entity known as BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-In- Possession. In November 2011, Black Crow Media Group announced that it was reorganizing its radio holdings and consolidating the four subsidiaries acting as debtors in possession (including BCA Radio, LLC) into a new company named Southern Stone Communications, LLC. The FCC approved the transfer on December 19, 2011. On February 1, 2017, at 10 a.m., WLOR began stunting with TV theme songs. At noon, WLOR changed their format to classic hip hop, branded as \\"98.1 The Beat\\".

It began in 1969 as an extramural program of the Physical Education Department of what was then known as Florence State University. During this period, the team competed against all state schools as a member of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. The team competed in the Northern District against Jacksonville State, Alabama A&M;, Montevallo, Southern Benedictine and Stillman. Coached by Physical Education instructor Don McBrayer, the Lady Lions posted numerous successes, including a state championship win over the University of Alabama in 1975. The Lady Lions also defeated Troy State, Auburn and Montevallo before prevailing over Alabama. Another milestone in the program was crossed in 1976, when Lillian Goodlow, a premiere basketball and volleyball player at Bradshaw High School in Florence, became the first female athlete in UNA history to be awarded an athletic scholarship. =First Conference Title in 1982= Yet another major step was taken in 1982, when the Gulf South Conference first began awarding championships in women's sports. UNA's volleyball team earned the first official lead title for women with a 3-0 win over Jacksonville State. The Lady Lions went on to win six of the first seven GSC volleyball championships. In 1995, Matt Peck was hired as head coach. Over the following decade, Peck led the Lions to eight NCAA appearances, four trips to the Elite Eight, two Final Fours and the 2003 Division II National Championship. In 1996, the Lions amassed a 44-4 record that included UNA's seventh GSC championship and the first ever NCAA Tournament appearance by an Alabama team. In 1997, UNA claimed its second GSC Tournament title and earned its second NCAA Regional bid. UNA became the first GSC institution to advance to the NCAA Division II Elite Eight in 1998. Moreover, the Lions earned their third straight GSC title and first-ever NCAA regional championship. UNA player also became the first volleyball player in GSC history to be selected a first-team All-American. In 1999, with a 35-7 record, UNA won its fourth straight GSC title and completed its fourth straight NCAA appearance, advancing to the Elite Eight for the second time. UNA won its fifth straight GSC title, completed a fifth straight NCAA trip and ascended to the Division II Final Four for the first time. Team members Ashley Moffitt and Nesrin Secklin also earned All-American Honors in 2000 and 2001. The following year, UNA made GSC history, winning its seventh straight conference title and 13th overall volleyball crown. =First National Title for a UNA Women's Team= However, 2003 was a year marked with irony. While the team failed to win a GSC title for the first time in eight years, it excelled in the NCAA South Central Regional, Elite Eight and Final Four to secure the first national championship ever claimed by a UNA women's athletic team. The team regained its GSC title in 2004. In 2006, the Lions lacked only one victory winning the national championship, falling to top-ranked Tampa in the finals of the NCAA Tournament in Pensacola, Florida.

The school colors are royal blue and white, and its mascot is the coyote. History Madera High School's layout has been changed over the years. Originally, a brick schoolhouse served as MHS; this was destroyed in a fire in the early 1900s. In 1907 a new similarly styled brick building‚Äînicknamed the \\"Main Building\\"‚Äîwas constructed. Soon, more buildings began appearing. In 1976, the \\"Main Building\\" was demolished, because it did not meet earthquake standards; the area where it was located is now known as \\"The Pit\\" and is the hub for lunchtime activities. By 2000, the school's current layout had been completed. In 2004, the main office building was refurbished, and most of the school followed suit in 2006. The school's original colors were purple and white. In 1949, with the color purple becoming scarce after the events of World War II, it was changed to its current blue-and-white color scheme. Purple has since been adopted as one of the main colors of Madera South High School. From the 1902 to 1966 the school was officially named Madera Union High School. In 1989, the Madera Unified School District commissioned the building of a new, separate high school; overcrowding at MHS was the main reason for this. Construction began in 1990, but the project was brought to an abrupt end in 1992, for budget reasons. Because the site was not big enough to be considered a stand-alone high school, the campus was renamed \\"South Campus,\\" and served as the second half of Madera High School. The original flagship campus was nicknamed \\"North Campus\\" as a result. However, the November 2002 passing of a school bond allowed South Campus to be completed, and as renovations at North Campus were underway, the new Madera South High School opened its doors in August 2006. The last \\"mega class\\" of Madera High graduated in 2008, being the largest graduating class in MHS history. College and Career Pathways The school offers ten different pathways to \\"help students make connections between the world of work and academics\\". The pathways focus on the fields of: *Engineering *Medicine *Technology *Hospitality *Education *Robotics *Criminal Justice *Visual & Performing Arts Associated Student Body and Sports Program Madera High has its own student government, like most schools. The officers of the ASB represent the students \\"in all major school affairs and acts as the liaison between students and the administration.\\" The commissioners of the ASB cover the areas of: *Academics *Athletics *Clubs & Culture *Community Service *Noontime Activities *Publicity *Rallies *Special Events *Social Media *Spirit *Staff Appreciation *Student Representative to the Board of Education Madera High School offers many athletic opportunities. *Fall Sports: *Cross Country *Football *Girls Golf *Girls Tennis *Girls Volleyball *Gymnastics *Water Polo *Cheer & Dance *Winter Sports: *Girls Basketball *Boys Basketball *Boys Soccer *Girls Soccer *Wrestling *Cheer & Dance *Spring Sports: *Baseball *Boys Golf *Softball *Boys Tennis *Swimming *Track & Field *Boys Volleyball Stadium Road Showdown Since the official split of the two schools, Madera High School and Madera South High School have been rivals. In 2008, the first annual Stadium Road Showdown game was played, named for the street that connects both schools. The winning team is awarded a giant \\"saw,\\" in reference to Madera's roots as a lumber town.

He is best known for his participation in the Winter Olympics in 1994 and 1998, where he represented the United States' bobsleigh team. Early life After graduating from high school, Minton began working as a prison guard near his hometown of Macon in Georgia. During his time as a prison guard, he also worked as a bodybuilder before he began training for a career in bobsleigh after becoming interested in the sport due to seeing Herschel Walker's performance in the 1992 Winter Olympics. In addition to his bobsleigh training, Minton also began training at World Championship Wrestling's Power Plant wrestling school for a career in professional wrestling. Career =Bobsleigh= While still working as a prison guard, Minton was invited to an Olympic bobsleigh training camp in 1993 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, during which time he crashed twice. After completing his training, Minton participated in the 1994 Winter Olympics, where he and Jim Herberich finished fourteenth overall in the two-man event. Following the Olympics, Minton quit his job as a prison guard in order to fully concentrate on his careers as a bobsledder and professional wrestler. At the 1997 FIBT World Championships in St. Moritz, Minton was successful in winning the bronze medal in the four-man event alongside Brian Shimer, Randy Jones, and Robert Olesen. Following his unsuccessful run in the previous Winter Olympics, Minton gained the best finish of his Olympic career as he, Shimer, Jones and Garreth Hines finished in fifth overall in the four-man event at the 1998 Winter Olympics. =Professional wrestling= Prior to his appearance at the 1994 Winter Olympics, Minton began training as a wrestler on January 1, 1994. Although he had yet to make his in-ring debut, his training enabled him to support his family. On June 10, 1995, Minton made his in-ring debut under the ring name Mr. World Class, where he teamed with Gorgeous George III, Maxx Muscle, and The Gambler to defeat David Haskins, King Cobra, Scott Studd, and Super Mario in an eight-man tag team match for the United States Wrestling Association. Following this, he took a year-long hiatus before returning to make his World Championship Wrestling debut as Chip Minton on the July 10, 1996 episode of WorldWide, where he lost to Big Bubba. Minton then took another hiatus from wrestling in order to focus on the 1997 FIBT World Championships before returning on the October 20, 1998 episode of Saturday Night, where he defeated Lenny Lane. On November 22, Minton made his pay-per-view debut at World War 3, where he competed in the eponymous battle royal for a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but was unsuccessful as Kevin Nash ultimately won the match. Beginning in 1999, Minton continued wrestling sporadically on WCW's lower shows Saturday Night and WorldWide as well as on house shows before wrestling his final match on July 9, 1999, where he and Kenny Kaos wrestled to a draw at a house show. =Ministry= After retiring from wrestling, Minton joined Team Impact, a Christian athlete ministry, in September 2007 and continues to perform as a part of its roster.

He was responsible for the first sighting of Oates Coast on 22 February 1911, and named it after Captain Lawrence Oates. He only spent short periods in Antarctica, returning with the Terra Nova to wait out the winters of 1911 and 1912 in Lyttelton, New Zealand. Due to the absence of Robert Falcon Scott on land, Pennell assumed the role of command on the Terra Nova, which would bring fresh supplies back to Antarctica with each voyage. Despite not being a part of the main landing party for the Pole, Pennell was a popular member of the expedition. Herbert Ponting, the photographer of the expedition, recalled in his book The Great White South that Pennell was \\"the most energetic man I have ever known....when Pennell was not occupied with navigating problems, he was either on watch, or conning from the crow's-nest, or else out on the yard-arms helping the seaman set or shorten sail, or otherwise assisting in the handling of the ship. He was a 'whale for work' \\". Pennell married Katie Hodson, the sister of his friend from naval college, on 15 April 1915 during his shore leave. Pennell was promoted to Commander and assigned to HMS Queen Mary, dying in her on 31 May 1916 in the Battle of Jutland, when the ship was sunk by the German ships SMS Seydlitz and SMS Derfflinger.CWGC entry The Pennell Coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica, is named after him.

Recording and composition It was recorded in October 2000 at the Wool Hall Studios in Beckington with Linda Gail Lewis and her band, the Red Hot Pokers and with Walter Samuel as engineer. At the time, it was planned to be the title song for an album that was never released. According to author Clinton Heylin, Lewis' contributions were removed before the song was released on Down the Road.Heylin, 2003. p.491-493Heylin, 2003. p. 529 The song is autobiographical and Morrison's musical tribute to his father, George Morrison who had died from sudden heart failure in 1988. The song suggests that the senior Morrison returned from Detroit, Michigan, in his son's early childhood, and led a life of \\"quiet desperation\\", having failed to find a permanent job and move his family to America. He brought back with him a record collection that would be of the greatest influence on his young son's development as a blues, R&B;, and soul singer. But according to the lyrics of the song his father had become dispirited and spent years of his life just riding his bike to work at the Harland and Wolff shipyard, returning home to sit in front of the television set. In the lyrics of the song, the singer sympathetically assures his father that he did the best he could.Rogan, 2006. p.21 Other performances Van Morrison has often performed this song in concert since its release; it was recorded on a TV film shown on PBS television from a show performed on September 14, 2006 (Austin City Limits), the night before his festival performance at the Austin City Limits Festival.

With her husband's accession to the Albanian throne she became the Princess of Albania (). Outside the country and in diplomatic correspondence, she was styled \\"Princess consort\\", but in Albania she was referred to as Mbret√´resh√´, or Queen. Family Princess Sophie was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Prusia, as daughter of Hereditary Prince Otto Karl Viktor I von Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg (1856-1888) and Princess Lucie zu Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1859-1903). Her paternal grandparents were Prince Otto Friedrich von Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg (1819-1893) and Polish noblewoman Pamela ≈Åabu≈Ñska (1837-1901), while her maternal grandparents were Prince Emil Karl Adolf zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1824-1878) and Princess Pulcheria Cantacuzene (1840-1865). Prince Emil was the son of Prince August Ludwig of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1788‚Äì1874) and Franziska Allesina gennant von Schweitzer (1802‚Äì1878). Early life Both of Princess Sophie's parents died when she was young so she spent much of her youth at the Castle Hemius in F√¢nt√¢nele estate in Moldavia, which was owned by her maternal relatives. Marriage and issue On 30 November 1906 at Waldenburg, Saxony Princess Sophie married Prince Wilhelm of Wied, son of Prince Wilhelm von Wied (1845-1907) and Princess Marie of the Netherlands (1841-1910). Sophie's husband, Prince Wilhelm was closely related to Wilhelm II, German Emperor, being his second cousin. They had two children: *Princess Marie Eleonore of Albania (1909‚Äì1956) ‚ö≠ Prince Alfred von Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg (1905-1941), son of Prince Heinrich von Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg and Princess Olga zu L√∂wenstein- Wertheim-Freudenberg ‚ö≠ Ion Octavian Bunea (1899-1977) *Carol Victor, Hereditary Prince of Albania (1913‚Äì1973) ‚ö≠ Eileen de Coppet n√©e Johnston (1922-1985) Albanian ancestry She had some remote Albanian ancestry, being a descendant of Princess Elena Callimachi, daughter of Prince Scarlat Ghica (1715-1766), who was Prince of Moldavia and Prince of Wallachia, and Princess Ruxandra Muruzi. She was also descended from Princess Ruxandra Ghica, daughter of Grigore I Ghica (1628-1675), Prince of Wallachia and Princess Maria Strurdza. Although officially Romanian, the Ghica Princely family has Albanian roots.http://www.ghika.net/Histoire/Question_Orient.pdf The Ghica family was a Greek Orthodox Phanariote dynasty of Albanian origin Princess of Albania Royal Standard of Sophie. Princess Sophie was close to her husband's aunt Queen Elisabeth of Romania, whom she had known since moving to Romania after the death of her parents. Princess Sophie and Queen Elisabeth sang, painted, composed and played musical instruments together. Queen Elisabeth played an important role in getting Princess Sophie's husband William the Albanian throne by asking Take Ionescu to persuade the great powers to select William. Princess Sophie and Queen Elisabeth both worked to overcome William's reluctance to accept the throne. William of Albania and his wife Princess Sophie arriving in Durr√´s the capital of Principality of Albania, (now Albania) on 7 March 1914 Eventually William agreed, and on 21 February 1914, Prince William and Princess Sophie hosted a delegation of Albanian notables at their castle in Neuwied, where William was formally offered the throne. The Albanian delegation then visited Waldenburg, Saxony, where they paid their respects to Princess Sophie's family. Sophie and her husband arrived in Albania on 7 March 1914, in Durr√´s, the provisional capital. However, her Albanian adventure proved short-lived. On 3 September 1914, with the country in turmoil, Princess Sophie and Prince William left Albania, never to return. However, she officially remained the Princess of Albania until 31 January 1925, when the country was declared a republic. Princess Sophie died at F√¢nt√¢nele, Romania.
