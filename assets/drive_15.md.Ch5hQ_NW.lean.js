The music was scored by G. V. Prakash Kumar. The film opened to mixed reviews, though performing averagely at the box office, and had a successful 100-day run. The film was later also screened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in a non-award ceremony, winning acclaim. Plot The film opens with Ram (Atharvaa) fronting a car driven by two guys apparently drunk and rich and with their girl friend(s). He tries to kill them and eventually they escape in the car opening the title. Then it turns to be that Ram enjoys a successful career in information technology. He is hit on by Radhi (Yashika) as office romance. He turns down her interest and reveals he is in love with a girl who resides in Bangalore and he is going to visit her. Ram drives to Bangalore and meets Charu (Amala Paul) in her apartment. While sleeping, Ram wakes up goes to the streets, search and kills a person (one of them in the car in first scene). Eventually it is revealed that Charu is in danger and Ram is safeguarding her by not letting her out of that apartment until he cleans up the city for her safety. Ram's CEO Latha comes to India from the US and is also engaged to a guy named Vicky. Latha begins to ask her PA Chandru (Santhanam) to find out more about Ram. Latha then asks Chandru to convince Ram to give her lift home, which then Ram agrees to. As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle (Jayaprakash). Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Latha's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film. Charu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted. On the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition. Ram then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days. Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since. The doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle (the doctor) that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram. The doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so-called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone. It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and hugs a so- called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space. Latha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place. The only way these delusions would go, is if Latha acts as if she was Charu, back in Bangalore. Latha then acts as Charu and begins falling in love with Ram. Ram then explains to her that they are going to get married soon. They then reach a temple, where Charu and Ram are meant to marry. Latha had planned with her uncle and Chandru a fake killing so that Ram's delusions can leave him, which fails. Latha is then genuinely kidnapped by two guys, who are her so known fianc√©'s friends. It is revealed that her fianc√© Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky marrying any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better of with Ram as he will keep her happy. Latha's father agrees and Latha insists that she goes to Ram. Latha then goes home to Ram, who still believes that Charu has come home long before. The film ends with Latha raising her arms asking for a hug from Ram, which Ram smiles and gives her.

Healy BL, (1887‚Äì1943) was an Irish lawyer and author, who is best remembered for his legal memoir The Old Munster Circuit. He was born in Cork, son of the well-known solicitor Maurice Healy and nephew of Timothy Michael Healy, the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State. His mother was a sister of A.M. Sullivan, who was the last barrister to hold the title Serjeant, and was noted for his unsuccessful defence of Roger Casement. Timothy Sullivan, the second Chief Justice of Ireland, was a cousin of Maurice, as was Kevin O'Higgins, a leading figure in the early Irish Free State Government.Ferguson, Kenneth ed. Kings Inns Barristers 1868-1968 Kings Inns Dublin 2005 Maurice was educated at Clongowes Wood College and University College Dublin. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1910, and to the English Bar in 1914 and saw action in the First World War on the Western Front and at Gallipoli. He received the MC in 1919 after serving in France and also in Germany during the immediate post-war occupation. Maurice at one point stood for Parliament as a candidate for West Waterford. After the Irish War of Independence, while several of his close relatives became prominent political figures in the Irish Free State, he chose to practice at the English Bar. While he would have been happy enough to see Ireland gain Home Rule by peaceful means, he had a horror of revolutionary violence (although he also denounced the crimes committed by the Black and Tans) and he seems to have found life in the new State uncongenial. He was made King's Counsel in 1931. He became Recorder of Coventry in 1941; it was suggested this might be the prelude to a High Court judgeship, but any such hope was cut short by his premature death. He wrote celebrated books on wine - Claret and the white wines of Bordeaux (1934), and Stay me with Flagons (1940). He also wrote poetry, mostly light and humorous. His most famous work is The Old Munster Circuit (1939)Michael Joseph Ltd. London 1939 an affectionate and nostalgic portrait of life at the Irish Bar, especially on the Munster (Southern) Circuit between 1900 and 1920. The book was an instant success; the Spectator called it \\"Entirely delightful to read\\" and it has retained its popularity ever since. With Andr√© Simon (who referred to Healy as 'my dearly beloved disciple') and others he founded the Saintsbury Club in 1931, which still meets today, reportedly stating that it should be created \`to perpetuate and honour his name' (Professor George Saintsbury). A legendary wit and conversationalist, Healy also made a number of celebrated BBC broadcasts during the war years.

Notice the size of the bench related to the trunk diameter. Trsteno Arboretum, located in Trsteno, Croatia, is the oldest arboretum in this part of the world. The arboretum was erected by the local noble family Gozze (see House of Gozze) in the late 15th century, who requested ship captains to bring back seeds and plants from their travels. The exact start date for the arboretum is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. It has been the property of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948, when it was donated. The Arboretum reserves a very special place among the old Ragusan, Dalmatian and Mediterranean parks. It includes a park surrounding the fifteenth century summer residence, which is a monument of garden architecture, and a nineteenth century park at Drvarica. The arboretum passed into Yugoslav state ownership in 1945, and was declared a natural rarity in 1948. Since 1950 it has been managed by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1962 the Arboretum Trsteno was registered in the list of protected natural monuments list as a monument of landscape architecture. The protected area covers around 255,000 square metres. Trsteno suffered extensive damage and looting during the Croatian War of Independence when on October 2 and 3rd, 1991, the Yugoslav People's Army launched a series of gunboat and air attacks and set the Arboretum afire, destroying a large part of it, and causing partial damage to the summer residence and the oldest part of the arboretum. The arboretum was further severely damaged in 2000 by a forest fire during a drought, when around 120,000 square metres were lost in fire. The pride of the arboretum, two Oriental Planes located on the central market place of Trsteno, survived both disasters undamaged. They are over 500 years old and are unique specimens of their kind in Europe. The ancient trees are both about 45/60 m tall and their trunks are 5 m in diameter. Within what was once the noble family's country house, there is the oldest Renaissance park in Croatia, designed in 1502, with numerous exotic plants.  In popular culture  In the third season and fourth season of the television series Game of Thrones, Trsteno Arboretum was used as the setting of the Red Keep palace gardens in King's Landing.

He was born in Sion Mills, County Tyrone, Ireland, the son of James and Eliza (Reid) Christie. He married Carmelite Sarah Brewer in 1872. His wife was related to David Josiah Brewer, Stephen Johnson Field (both US Supreme Court Justices) and David Dudley Field I. Their correspondence, diaries and papers are located at the Minnesota Historical Society.Brother of Mine: The Civil War Letters of Thomas & William Christie, editor Hampton Smith, Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2011, p. 3-19 Early family life James Christie, Thomas's father, left Dundee Scotland to work in the flax mills of Ireland. James' brothers, Alexander and William, emigrated in the 1840s to the United States where they worked as machinists. During the winter season they worked in Cuba, operating machines designed by Dudley Pray of Boston, that were used in the sugar cane fields. In 1846, they sent for Christie family in Ireland and their extended family in Dundee. Eventually all settled near each other in Clyman Township, Dodge County, Wisconsin. Thomas's older brother, William Gilcrist Christie went to Minnesota. James sent Thomas there to help William with his farm. Civil War In October 1861, Thomas and William enlisted at Fort Snelling MN in the 1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery. They were in the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" in the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and in 1864 joined Sherman's army for the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. They participated in the Battle of Atlanta and Sherman's March to the Sea. Both Thomas and William wrote to their family during their service. Thomas mustered out in 1865. College and seminaries After his discharge he surveyed land for the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company near Winona, MN. In April 1866 he entered Beloit College and graduated in July 1871. He met his wife at Rockford Seminary for Women where she graduated in 1871. In August 1871 he started teaching at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He married in March 1872 and returned to Beloit College in Sept 1872 to teach and to complete work on his master's degree, which he received in 1874. He went to Andover Theological Seminary for further studies and was ordained a minister in Beloit. Turkish period In September 1877 he and his family were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to Turkey. He taught in Marash, Turkey at the Central Turkey Theological Seminary for 16 years. From 1881-82 the Christies were in Adana. In 1883 they moved to Tarsus, Turkey where he assumed the presidency of St. Paul's Institute. Dr. Christie secured an endowment from Elliott Fitch Shepard in 1885 for the college. At times Thomas was away from the college for extended periods (once for 4 years) and Carmelite acted on his behalf. The Christies provided refuge, relief and assistance to many Armenian and Turkish people in times of trouble and peace. They were in Turkey during the massacres of 1895, 1909 and the Armenian genocide in 1915. Thomas and Miner Rogers, his son-in-law, were at a gathering of ministers and missionaries at Adana in 1909. While assisting Armenian ministers, Miner was killed by Turkish irregulars. The Turkish irregulars left Adana, came to Tarsus and burned the Armenian quarter. Carmelite worked with the local Turkish government to protect the College. She opened the College to the Tarsus refugees and told the irregulars that it was American soil. This probably saved hundreds, if not thousands, of refugees from death. The irregular's suddenly left Tarsus and Thomas returned from Adana. Thomas was said to never be the same after these events. In 1915 he went to Constantinople to protest the treatment of Armenian teachers and was not allowed to return to Tarsus. Carmelite remained in Tarsus during World War I. Thomas spent the Great War in America. He served as Chaplin at Camp Kearney in California. In January 1919 he sailed from Seattle to Hong Kong and Port Said to return to Tarsus. He arrived in April 1919 to a \\"royal reception\\", of friends of all classes and religions, French and Turkish officials and students. His health was not good. He and Carmelite returned to the United States in July 1920 and lived in Southern California. Thomas and Carmelite are buried in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mission's plot in the Walnut Street Cemetery, Newton Massachusetts. Children Thomas and Carmelite had 7 children, 3 did not reach their 25th birthday. *Emerson Brewer Christie (1878‚Äì1967) was an ethnologist and linguist.

Shortly afterwards, Save the Hill Grove Cats‚Äîrun by the same group of campaigners‚Äîwas set up in opposition to Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories, successfully closing the farm in 1999.Pallister, David. Embattled breeding farm closes, The Guardian, 14 August 1999. The Hill Grove campaign then set up Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty to close Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract animal-testing facility, a controversial campaign that continues. In parallel, Shamrock Farm in Sussex, Britain's only non-human primate importation and quarantine centre, was targeted; it closed in 2000 after a 15-month campaign by \\"Save the Shamrock Monkeys,\\" and an investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.Mann 2007, p. 556. Regal Rabbits in Surrey, which bred rabbits for animal laboratories, closed in 2000, and Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs was set up in Staffordshire against Darley Oaks Farm, which supplied guinea pigs for animal research, ending in May 2006 after a controversial grave desecration claimed by the Animal Rights Militia.\\"Police comb desecrated grave site\\", BBC News, 9 October 2004. *Also see \\"British Animal Rights Protesters Admit Plotting Against Farmers\\", Reuters, 11 April 2007. Incidents On 6 January 2008, the Animal Liberation Front raided Highgate farm and removed 129 rabbits. A quad bike, lawnmower, van and a sports car were also reported to have been paintstripped and glued, causing ¬£100,000 worth of damage. The ALF said they carried out the raid to stop the rabbits being sold to laboratories such as Huntingdon Life Sciences and other universities in the UK.ALF Communique: 09/01/08, 9 January 2008.VIDEO: 'Liberated' rabbits will die 2008-02-19[, Market Rasen Mail, 14 February 2008.

On 27 July 2009, half a dozen SHAC activists set up at protest camp for a few days 100 yards from the farm.Protest Camp At Rabbit Farm, Market Rasen Mail, 29 July 2009.Protest Camp Set Up At Highgate Rabbit Farm, SHAC, 27 July 2009. In September that year, as part of a Global Week of Action Against Laboratory Animal Breeders, 400 campaigners from SHAC gathered outside the farm. Over 100 police officers were deployed from over five forces, although the day passed peacefully with no arrests. The protest was hailed by campaigners as a success, bringing the farm to local attention.Farmer's fear over protesters' attacks , This Is Lincolnshire, 28 September 2009.Animal rights demo goes off peacefully, Market Rasen Mail, 28 September 2009. On 19 July 2010 a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van left at the farm was set on fire, destroying the vehicle. Eight rabbits inside the van died during the attack.

Court cases :Further information: SHAC: Operation Achilles In July 2008, a 22-year-old man, Lewis Pogson, was arrested in Worthing as part of an investigation into the ALF raid, which included searching the Friend Animal Sanctuary at East Peckham, near Paddock Wood, Kent.Arrest in 'animal liberation' burglary, Market Rasen, 11 July 2008. He pleaded not guilty but was later found guilty of taking part in the raid and awaits sentencing.Rabbit farm raid charges denied, Lincolnshire Echo, 24 January 2009.Animal-rights campaigner guilty of rabbit farm raid, Kent & Sussex Courier, 4 December 2009. Pogson subsequently published an account of his experiences. In October four more activists were arrested and accused of conspiracy to cause damage at Highgate Farm, including further charges of interfering with a contractual relationship so as to harm an animal research establishment and conspiracy. None of those accused were connected to the earlier ALF raid, but had links with SHAC. The prosecution claimed the activists were carrying out a ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù to plan further criminal damage, designed to interfere with HLS' contract with the farm.

It is located west-northwest of Hanna City, Illinois. It was closed in 1968. It is still in use by the Federal Aviation Administration as a Joint Surveillance System radar station. History Hanna City Air Force Station (AFS) was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. were acquired between 1952 and July 1959. The Air Force constructed and operated the station, which included over 35 buildings and miscellaneous smaller structures. The 791st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Hanna City AFS on 10 May 1951 and began operations using AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 Hanna City AFS replaced the AN/FPS-3 with an AN/FPS-20 search radar, and added an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar. During 1959 the AN/FPS-4 was replaced by a second height-finder radar (AN/FPS-6B), and Hanna City AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-07 at Truax Field, Wisconsin. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 791st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 November 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-85. In 1964 the AN/FPS-20A was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-67, and an AN/FPS-90 replaced the AN/FPS-6B height-finder radar. The AN/FPS-67 was upgraded to an AN/FPS-67B in 1968. The AN/FPS-6A was removed some time in this time frame. The 791st Radar Squadron was inactivated on 18 June 1968, and the site was closed on 30 June due to budget reductions. The radar towers and four buildings were transferred to the FAA and site remains an active JSS radar site. The remainder of the site was then declared excess to the General Services Administration on 28 January 1969 and conveyed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) on August 8, 1969. It operated as Hanna City Work Camp, an Illinois Department of Corrections minimum security prison. The old USAF buildings were still in use up to 2002 and structures used as observation towers appeared to be the old four-legged steel temperate radar towers. The Hanna City Work Camp closed in October 2002 and the state of Illinois turned over the work camp site to Peoria County in 2009. As of August 2009, the site was occasionally being used for training of Peoria County Sheriff's Office for Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT). As of 2012, the FAA radar was still at the site and Peoria County was looking for ideas for usage of the remainder of the property, including creation of an agribusiness incubator or community organic farm.

He was initially a follower of the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, and later became a Tang general, mostly known for his service under Li Keyong. He was known for ferocity in carrying out raids.  Background  Li Hanzhi was born in 842, during the reign of Emperor Wuzong. He was from Xiangcheng (È†ÖÂüé, in modern Zhoukou, Henan). His father Li Wen () was, and his family had been, farmers for generations. It was said that in his youth, Li Hanzhi was strong and dextrous, and he was capable of fighting several people at the same time. He initially studied Confucian doctrines, but could not achieve much in doing so, and thereafter became a Buddhist monk. However, because his behavior was not proper, wherever he went, he found no acceptance; in particular, when he begged for food at Suanzao (ÈÖ∏Ê£ó, in modern Xinxiang, Henan), no one would give him any food. In anger, he abandoned his monk clothing and became a bandit in the region. At that time, as Huang Chao had risen in rebellion against then-reigning Emperor Xizong, Li joined Huang and became a key general in Huang's army. In 879, however, when Gao Pian the Tang military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) sent his officers Zhang Lin () and Liang Zan () to attack Huang, the Huainan army initially prevailed, and Li surrendered to the Huainan army, along with Qin Yan, Bi Shiduo, and Xu Qing (). (It was after this defeat that Huang took his army south to the Lingnan region.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253.  Initial service under Gao Pian and Zhuge Shuang  Gao Pian made Li Hanzhi an officer in his army, and later commissioned as the prefect of Guang Prefecture (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan). At a later point, when Qin Zongquan the military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) rebelled against Tang and seized nearby territory, Li was pressured by the Fengguo army and abandoned Guang Prefecture. He returned home to Xiangcheng and gathered his forces there, and submitted to Zhuge Shuang the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). Zhuge made him the prefect of Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Luoyang, Henan). In 883, Han Jian the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), who had captured Heyang at one point but then lost it to Zhuge, attacked Heyang again. Zhuge sent Li to engage Han, and Li defeated Han at Wuzhi (Ê≠¶Èôü, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and repelled his attack. (As a result of the defeat, Han was subsequently overthrown by his officer Le Xingda, and was killed shortly after.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Subsequently, when Emperor Xizong commissioned Zhuge as one of the commanders of the forces against Qin, Zhuge commissioned Li as his deputy, as well as the defender of the Tang eastern capital Luoyang. As Luoyang had been laid waste by the wars by that point, Li made Shengshan Temple () his headquarters. Meanwhile, when Li Keyong, the ethnically Shatuo military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), went through Luoyang on the way back to Hedong after a campaign against Huang, Li welcomed him and formed a friendship with him. In 885, Qin sent his general Sun Ru to attack Luoyang. Li battled Sun for several months, but eventually ran out of food supplies, so he abandoned Luoyang and set up his headquarters at Mianchi (Êæ†Ê±†, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), allowing Sun to seize Luoyang. However, Sun abandoned Luoyang after a month (after burning the palaces at Luoyang), and Li was able to take his army and return to Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. In 886, Zhuge died, and initially the officers Liu Jing () and Zhang Quanyi supported Zhuge's son Zhuge Zhongfang () as the acting military governor, but Liu held the actual authorities. He feared that Li would not easily be controllable, so he entered Luoyang himself and attacked Li at Mianchi. Li defeated him and slaughtered most of his army. Li then prepared to give chase across the Yellow River (as Heyang's capital, the city of Heyang, was just north of the Yellow River). Liu sent Zhang to resist Li, but by this point, Zhang was also alienated by Liu's domination of the circuit, and then instead joined Li in attacking Heyang. They were, however, defeated by Liu, and withdrew to Huai Prefecture. However, Sun soon returned to the region and captured Heyang, forcing Zhuge Zhongfang to flee to Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Sun himself claimed the title of military governor of Heyang, but Zhang, who was then still at Huai Prefecture, and Li, who by that point was at Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), held out and refused to submit to Sun. In 887, after Xuanwu's military governor Zhu Quanzhong defeated Qin when Qin attacked him, the generals that Qin sent out to the surrounding territory, including Sun, all abandoned their campaigns. After Sun abandoned Heyang, Li and Zhang entered Heyang, and jointly sought aid from Li Keyong. Li Keyong sent his officer An Jinjun () to aid them and commissioned An the prefect of Ze, Li the military governor of Heyang, and Zhang the mayor of Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257.  Loss of Heyang Circuit  Li Hanzhi and Zhang Quanyi had a close friendship initially, but the friendship gradually waned over Li's lack of respect for Zhang's campaign to rebuild Luoyang. Further, even though Zhang tried to supply Li's army well, Li often seized Zhang's subordinates and tortured them if they could not satisfy Li's demands. In 888, while Li was preparing a campaign against Wang Chongying the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Wang secretly persuaded Zhang to turn against Li. Zhang thus took his forces and attacked Heyang, capturing it and taking Li's family captive. Zhang then claimed the title of military governor of Heyang. Li fled to Ze Prefecture and sought aid from Li Keyong. Li Keyong sent his officer Kang Junli to assist Li Hanzhi to try to recapture Heyang, with Li Cunxiao, Xue Atan (), Shi Yan (), An Jinjun, and An Xiuxiu () assisting Kang. Zhang defended against the siege, but soon ran out of food. He thus sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong. Zhu sent Ding Hui, Ge Congzhou, and Niu Cunjie () to aid Zhang. They inflicted losses on the Hedong army, causing An Xiuxiu to desert (as he feared punishment for the defeat). When the Xuanwu forces next acted as if they were going to cut off Hedong forces' escape path through the Taihang Mountains, Kang took the Hedong forces and withdrew. Zhu commissioned Ding as the acting military governor of Heyang, while returning Zhang to Luoyang as its mayor. Li Hanzhi, meanwhile, withdrew to Ze Prefecture and continued to claim the title of military governor of Heyang; he also sent his son Li Qi () to Hedong to serve under Li Keyong. It was said that he spent his days raiding the region as far east as Huai and Meng (Â≠üÂ∑û, in modern Luoyang) Prefectures and as far west as Jin (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Jincheng) and Jiang (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng) Prefectures, such that the region became completely depopulated. In particular, there was a fort built by the people on Mount Moyun (Êë©Èõ≤Â±±, in modern Yuncheng) to defend themselves during the wars. In the past, no army was able to come close to the fort, but Li Hanzhi captured it, earning him the nickname of Li Moyun. When he subsequently tried to again join forces with Hedong troops later that year to recapture Heyang, however, he was repelled by Ding.  Service under Li Keyong  Li Hanzhi thereafter often served under Li Keyong in Li Keyong's campaigns. In 889, for example, Li Keyong sent him and Li Cunxiao to attack Meng Fangli the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, long headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi, although Meng was then having his headquarters at Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei)). They defeated Meng's forces, and Meng committed suicide. Meng Fangli's brother Meng Qian tried to hold out against the Hedong forces with aid from Xuanwu, but soon was forced to surrender.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 890, when Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, at the instigation of the chancellor Zhang Jun, as well as Zhu Quanzhong, Li Kuangchou the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), and Helian Duo the military governor of Datong Circuit (Â§ßÂêå, headquartered in modern Datong, Shanxi), announced a general campaign against Li Keyong, one of the prongs of the imperial/Xuanwu/Lulong joint attacks at Heyong was aimed at Li Hanzhi at Ze Prefecture, and as part of the announcement, Emperor Zhaozong stripped Li Hanzhi, as well as Li Keyong, of all offices and titles. Li Keyong sent Li Cunxiao to aid Li Hanzhi; Li Cunxiao, after capturing Zhang Jun's deputy Sun Kui () in a surprise attack, defeated the Xuanwu forces sieging Ze Prefecture, forcing them to withdraw. After Li Keyong subsequently defeated Zhang's main forces, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to exile Zhang and fellow chancellor Kong Wei in 891 and restore Li Keyong's and Li Hanzhi's offices. In 895, when Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and Han Jian (not the same Han Jian who had been the military governor of Weibo) the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) attacked the imperial capital Chang'an and executed two former chancellors whom they had perceived to be against them (Wei Zhaodu and Li Xi) against Emperor Zhaozong's orders, Li Keyong, assisted by Li Hanzhi, went to the Chang'an region to aid the emperor. They subsequently attacked Jingnan, and Li Hanzhi defeated the forces Li Maozhen sent to aid Wang, causing Wang to flee and be killed by his subordinates in flight, allowing the imperial government to temporary resume control of Jingnan Circuit. For his accomplishments, Li Hanzhi was given the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Emperor Zhaozong also created him the Prince of Longxi.  Submission to Zhu Quanzhong  However, the Jingnan campaign also sowed the seed of Li Hanzhi's dissatisfaction toward Li Keyong. After Jingnan fell to Li Keyong, Li Hanzhi requested that he be given the circuit, which Li Keyong refused ‚Äî citing the fact that he had promised to turn the circuit to the imperial government and had already recommended the imperial general Su Wenjian () as the new military governor. Li Hanzhi complained bitterly to Li Keyong's strategist Gai Yu, claiming that all he wanted was a small circuit at which he and his army could rest. Gai tried to speak on his behalf, to no avail ‚Äî and, over the next few years, whenever Li Keyong conquered a circuit or one of the circuits under his control needed a military governor, Li Keyong would refuse to consider Li Hanzhi. Gai feared that Li Hanzhi would be resentful, but when he spoke with Li Keyong, Li Keyong stated that the reason why he did not want to give a circuit to Li Hanzhi was that he feared that if Li Hanzhi had a circuit, he would no longer follow Li Keyong's orders. Around the new year 899, one of Li Keyong's subordinates, Xue Zhiqin () the military governor of Zhaoyi, died. A replacement was not quickly announced. Li Hanzhi decided to preempt Li Keyong; he entered Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (), taking it over, and then submitted a report to Li Keyong asking to be made military governor. Li Keyong, in anger, sent messengers to rebuke him. Li Hanzhi then turned against Li Keyong, arresting the Hedong officers at Lu Prefecture and delivering them, with his son Li Hao (), to Zhu Quanzhong, asking for aid. Li Keyong launched an attack on Li Hanzhi, with his nephew Li Sizhao quickly capturing Ze Prefecture and taking Li Hanzhi's family members prisoner. (Li Keyong also wanted to put Li Qi to death, but Li Keyong's son Li Cunxu, who was friendly with Li Qi, gave Li Qi a horse to escape on.) Zhu thereafter commissioned Li Hanzhi as the military governor of Zhaoyi. Li Keyong then sent Li Junqing () to siege Lu Prefecture. Zhu himself headed to Heyang to prepare further operations, but sent Zhang Cunjing () to give immediate aid to Li Hanzhi. Zhang defeated Li Junqing and forced him to withdraw. Li Keyong put Li Junqing to death, and replaced him with Li Sizhao. At that time, Li Hanzhi fell ill, and Zhu decided to swap his and Ding Hui's circuits, making him the military governor of Heyang and Ding the military governor of Zhaoyi. Li Hanzhi thus headed south to Heyang Circuit, and he died after reaching Huai Prefecture.

According to WAD Magazine, \\"They were born dancers. They walked at 5 months, seriously moved their bodies at 18 months old, and at 9 they showed off steps they had invented to youngsters twice their age in their neighborhood.\\" In 2005, the brothers recruited five members to form their own dance team called Criminalz Crew, spending the next few years competing in hip-hop tournaments and entertaining crowds as street performers and in clubs.

He formed his first music group 'Pop' (–ü–æ–ø) at only 12 years in 1975 and was actively engaged playing in the garages and bomb shelters around Skopje.

Then the band fell under bankruptcy. In the years that followed he participated in several national musical festivals, for which Igor acknowledges, is his biggest mistake in the field of music.

The cave is known for the two eye-like holes in its ceiling, known as God's eyes. Prohodna is the best known attraction in the Karlukovo Gorge (part of the Geological Park Iskar-Panega), one of the largest karst regions in Bulgaria and a popular location for speleology. Formed during the Quaternary, Prohodna is long, which makes it the longest cave passage in Bulgaria. The cave has two entrances which lie opposite one another, known respectively as the Small Entrance and the Big Entrance. The former is high and the latter reaches in height. The cave owes its name, which literally means Thoroughfare Cave or Passage Cave, to this feature. The size of the Big Entrance of Prohodna makes it suitable for bungee jumpinghttps://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping, and it is among the popular spots in Bulgaria for that activity. There are traces of prehistoric habitation in the Prohodna cave, which testify that humans lived in the cave during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic. Prohodna is most notable for the two equal-sized holes in the ceiling of its middle chamber. The holes, formed through erosion, let in light into the cave. The formation is popularly known as God's eyes. The phenomenon was featured in the 1988 Bulgarian film Time of Violence; in the scene, a priest named Aligorko prays below the Eyes. The cave lies from Karlukovo, near the Karlukovo‚ÄìLukovit road. It is also accessible from Rumyantsevo, and there is a parking lot near the Small Entrance. Near Prohodna is the much longer cave Temnata Dupka, and a pathway from the Big Entrance of Prohodna leads to the Petar Tranteev National Caving House, one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.

In Khmer, she is known by her title Neang Kong-hing (, lit. \\"lady princess\\"), or as Preah Thorani' (·ûñ·üí·ûö·üá·ûí·ûö·ûé·û∏) or Preah Mae Thorani (Mother Earth Goddess). In Burmese, she is known as Wathondare (·Äù·Äû·ÄØ·Äî·Äπ·Äì·Äõ·Ä±) or Wathondara (·Äù·Äû·ÄØ·Äî·Äπ·Äì·Äõ·Ä¨) (from ) and variously transliterated as Wathundari, Wathundaye, Vasundari, etc. In Thai and other Tai languages, she is known as Thorani (from ) in various appellations, including Nang Thorani (), Mae Thorani (), and Phra Mae Thorani (). Iconography and symbology Wat Phnom mural: Phra Mae Thorani placing herself between the demons and Gautama Buddha. Images of Phra Mae Thorani are common in shrines and Buddhist temples of Burma, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. According to Buddhist myths, Phra Mae Thorani is personified as a young woman wringing the cool waters of detachment out of her hair to drown Mara, the demon sent to tempt Gautama Buddha as he meditated under the Bodhi Tree. In temple murals, Phra Mae Thorani is often depicted with the Buddha in the mudra known as calling the earth to witness. The waters flowing forth from her long hair wash away the armies of Mara and symbolize the water of the bodhisattva's perfection of generosity (dana parami). Calling the earth to witness Calling the earth to witness In the iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand, \\"touching the earth\\" mudra (Maravijaya Attitude) refers to the Buddha's pointing towards the earth to summon the Earth Goddess to come to his assistance in obtaining enlightenment by witnessing to his past good deeds. Phra Mae Thorani fountain, Bangkok  Buddhist water libation  Photograph of a libation ceremony in 1900. In Buddhism in Burma, the water ceremony (yay zet cha), which involves the ceremonial pouring of water from a glass into a vase, drop by drop, concludes most Buddhist ceremonies including donation celebrations and feasts. This ceremonial libation is done to share the accrued merit with all other living beings in all 31 planes of existence. While the water is poured, a confession of faith, called the hsu taung imaya dhammanu, is recited and led by the monks. Then, the merit is distributed by the donors, called ahmya wei, by saying Ahmya ahmya ahmya yu daw mu gya ba gon law three times, with the audience responding thadu, Pali for \\"well done.\\" The earth goddess, known in Burmese as Wathondara () or Wathondare (), is invoked to witness these meritorious deeds. Afterward, the libated water is poured on soil outside, to return the water to the goddess.

She was hijacked by Somali pirates on January 15, 2011 and rescued six days later by South Korean Navy commandos. Description Built in 2001, the Samho Jewelry has a gross tonnage of 11,566 GT. She is long, has a beam of and a draft of . Owned by 2,500 investors represented by the Acta Group in Norway, the ship is registered in the port of Valletta, Malta and operated by the Samho Shipping Company of Busan, South Korea. History In January 2008, the Samho Jewelry was placed under inspection in Mumbai by the International Transport Workers' Federation for labor issues related to flag of convenience practices. Investigators found that Burmese, Croatian, Polish and Russian crewmembers were being paid less than ITF minimum wages and directed the owners of the vessel to sign a wage agreement with the Korean Seafarers' Union. In 2010, a record $9.5 million ransom was paid to Somali pirates for the release of the Samho Dream, another vessel operated by the Samho Shipping Company. =2011 hijacking= The Samho Jewelry was traveling from the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka when it was captured off the Somali coast by pirates on January 15, 2011. Tanker captain Seok Hae-gyun changed the ship's course to keep in international waters as long as possible. The crew of eight South Koreans, 11 Burmese and two Indonesians were held as hostages. The Norwegian government had been criticized for not being part of the anti-piracy effort and had no military presence in the area at the time. The Samho Shipping Company was facing huge losses because it was obliged to continue paying Acta under its charter even while the vessel was held by pirates. Though Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance and Green Insurance had insured the ship for up to $45 million, their reinsurance policy through the Korean Reinsurance company would not cover \\"war risk\\". On January 16, 2011, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak issued an order to \\"comprehensively deal with\\" the crisis. The South Korean destroyer ROKS Choi Young was dispatched to the area to launch the operation, dubbed \\"Dawn of Gulf of Aden\\", at 9:58 am Korea Standard Time on January 21, 2011. ROK Navy commandos used a speed boat and ladders to climb aboard while a Westland Lynx helicopter and the destroyer provided covering fire. Once on board, the commandos fought a five-hour battle, going compartment to compartment in search of pirates. The pirates were found all over the ship, including in the board, pontoon and engine room. All 21 crew members were freed, though Seok, the captain, survived multiple gunshot wounds at close range by a pirate who was believed to be the leader. Seok had executed a risky plan to mix water into the ship's engine oil to disrupt its propulsion and slow it down. Chief officer Kim Doo-Chan stated that he had lost several teeth from being \\"trampled and beaten ... just for talking with our captain.\\" Eight pirates were killed in the raid and five captured alive. President Lee announced the successful rescue on the national television networks. In his address, he stated, ‚ÄúWe will not tolerate any behavior that threatens the lives and safety of our people in the future.\\" The Christian Science Monitor, among other political analysts, believe the operation and presidential address were intended as \\"a thinly veiled warning to Pyongyang that South Korean forces are prepared to fight.\\" The South Korean government had been heavily criticized by citizens for a weak response to North Korean attacks in the past year including the ROKS Cheonan sinking and the Yeonpyeong bombing. Aftermath Aerial photo of Salalah. After the rescue, the Samho Jewelry headed for the Omani port of Salalah, where the crew was to receive medical checkups before being flown back to South Korea. Seok was stabilized after five hours of surgery at a hospital in Salalah. Local Korean workers donated blood on his behalf. On January 29, Seok was airlifted to Seoul Airbase in Seongnam. He underwent three additional hours of surgery at Ajou University Hospital. Ryu Hee-sug, the director of the hospital, stated that Seok's condition had deteriorated because of the onset of infection from six gunshot wounds: \\"Things could have taken a turn for the worse had he stayed in Oman for a few more days. It was an appropriate decision to bring him to Korea for the surgery.\\" Seok has been called a hero for his actions during the hijacking. President Lee called the hospital to offer words of encouragement: \\"Many citizens have high expectations and are cheering [for you].\\" The five captured pirates were flown to Seoul on January 29, and arrived in Busan on the next day for their upcoming trial. The defendants face charges of maritime robbery, attempted murder and ship hijacking. During interrogation, the pirates denied knowing one another nor who had shot the captain of the tanker, though investigators believe Arai Mahomed to be the gunman. The shooter would have been eligible for the death penalty if Seok had died. On February 2, the crew of the Samho Jewelry arrived at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, recounting that they had been violently beaten by the pirates and threatened with death. Chief engineer Chung Mann-Ki revealed that the crew had secretly sabotaged the tanker's systems, including the rudder, in an effort to thwart the pirates. Most of the crew members had been on the bridge when the commandos stormed the ship. Republic of Korea Coast Guard chief Kim Chung-kyu stated that the investigation found one of the bullets retrieved from Seok's body appeared to match that of the Navy, indicating that he had also been hit by friendly fire. In response to the rescue operation, other pirates in Somalia claimed that they will kill any future Korean hostages and may have moved other Korean hostages off existing hijacked ships to inland locations.

Early life  Katz was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His interest in theater was sparked by stories of his great-grandfather, who was a Yiddish theater producer on the Lower East Side of New York City. Katz attended Chestnut Hill Academy and graduated from the Hun School of Princeton, where in 1985 he founded their modern crew program. He attended Williams College where he was a double-major, receiving a BA in philosophy and religion.

The Independent. 3 February 2014. '\\"I saw him last week, and he was clean and sober, his old self,\\" David Bar Katz, the playwright and friend who found Hoffman lying on his bathroom floor in a T-shirt and a pair of shorts, told The New York Times yesterday. \\"I really thought this chapter was over.\\"' He was the object of a hoax after Hoffman's death. The Enquirer published an article that he was Hoffman's lover and gave him narcotics. Neither was true, Katz sued, and it was settled two days later. Katz wished to honor Hoffman, rather than gain anything for himself, so formed the American Playwriting Foundation, which administers The Relentless Award, an annual prize of $45,000 for an un-produced play awarded in Hoffman‚Äôs honor. The award has become one of the most impactful in American Theater, launching many acclaimed plays, including \\"The Wolves\\", \\"Dance Nation\\" and \\"Is God Is\\".

It is surrounded by the municipalities of Ventas de Huelma, Esc√∫zar, Alhend√≠n, Jayena, Arenas del Rey and Cac√≠n. Other nearby towns are Pantano de los Bermejales and √Åcula. Agr√≥n is one of the fifty-two entities that make up the Metropolitan Area of Granada. 460x460px  History  Its toponym, of Latin reminiscences - \\"Agrum\\", which means \\"Field\\" - refers to an agricultural activity that has been the livelihood of its inhabitants throughout history. The municipality, in terms of the development of historical events, has been closely linked, like all the others in this area of El Temple, to Alhama de Granada and, like it, has seen the times of theRoman Empire, the long Muslim domination, the subsequent Christianization after the Granada war and, already in the 19th century, the presence in its lands ofNapoleonic troops during the War of Independence. Today, the Dukes of Wellington own a large estate called Fatimbullar in Agr√≥n.  Demography  After the mechanization of the agricultural world, Agr√≥n fell into a deep crisis, decreasing its population continuously since 1960 when there was massive emigration to other parts of the country -mainly to Catalonia- and Germany. According to the National Statistics Institute of Spain, in 2017 Agr√≥n had 290 registered inhabitants.:es:Ine.es  Politics  The electoral results in the last municipal elections are reflected in the following table: Electoral results in the last municipalities elections The Socialist Party won with 114 votes, and the current mayor is Mar√≠a del Pilar L√≥pez Romero.

It was released in Japan on March 10, 2011, in Europe on March 25, 2011, in North America on March 27, 2011, and in Australia on March 31, 2011. It is part of the Asphalt series and was one of eight 3DS launch titles published by Ubisoft. It was revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 (E3 2010). A direct conversion of an Apple iOS game, Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, Asphalt 3D includes 17 tracks based on real-life locations and 42 licensed sports vehicles. It features several game modes including multiplayer support for up to six players using local wireless play. Asphalt 3D received negative reviews, with much of the criticism directed at poor controls, numerous bugs, poor visuals, and a choppy framerate. It has received compilation scores of 43% and 47% on Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. Gameplay and premise A screenshot of a race in progress. Asphalt 3D is a racing game, in which the player must maneuver an automobile to compete against computer-controlled drivers on various race tracks. Players earn rewards such as car upgrades and XP points for winning races throughout the game, and reaching higher levels allows them to use better sports cars to unlock. The game features 17 tracks based on real-life locations including San Francisco and Paris. The games also features over 40 licensed sports cars and motorcycles, from companies like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Bentley, Maserati, BMW, Nissan, Audi and Ducati. The game features eight game modes, including \\"Career Mode\\"; \\"Vigilante\\", an elimination mode; a Need for Speed- inspired \\"High Speed Chase\\" mode, in which the player must outrun police cars; and a multiplayer option for up to six players using local wireless play. The game makes use of the 3DS system's accelerometer, which is similar to the Asphalt titles on Apple iOS platforms, and allows the player to control the vehicle by moving the game console like a steering wheel. Development Asphalt 3D was revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. The game was listed by Ubisoft as one of eight 3DS games they planned to release to coincide with the launch of the 3DS in Europe and North America. The game was released in Japan on March 10, 2011, North America on March 27, 2011, Europe on March 25, 2011, and Australia on March 31, 2011. Asphalt 3D was a direct port of Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, which was released for iOS devices. Asphalt 3D contains 42 cars, three of which are available at the beginning. Reception Asphalt 3D has received negative reviews from critics, currently holding an average score of 47% at GameRankings and 43/100 at Metacritic, based on 30 and 37 reviews respectively. The game was described by critics as \\"an absolute joke\\", \\"a buggy mess\\" and \\"truly horrible\\" due to \\"terrible physics, stiff controls and poor graphics\\", along with frame rate issues and glitches. IGN's Martin Robinson stated that \\"a game can't even be bothered to stream its own pre-rendered intro smoothly\\". Although praising of its \\"decent car models\\", GameTrailers noted that it \\"suffers from choppy performance, lots of pop-in, laughable animations, and tire marks that float above the road in 3D. It's as if it was made merely to look good in screen shots.\\" Justin Towell of GamesRadar felt that the \\"angular scenery are reminiscent of the N64\\". The review said overall \\"So what can I say in summary? It's a ¬£39.99 inferior remix of a ¬£2.99 iPhone game with bad sound, bad graphics and shockingly slapdash collision logic. Not only is it the worst game of the 3DS' launch line-up, it's a contender for the title of 'worst launch game of all time'. Worse than Pen Pen. Worse than Tama. Worse even than Altered Beast. Do I really need to say it? Avoid.\\". Nintendo World Report staff writer Josh Max complained of its lack of tutorial sections and stated that it \\"does nothing to represent the capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS\\". In their buyer's guide, NWR writer Matthew Blundon and director Neal Ronaghan stated that \\"when there are far better racers available, namely Ridge Racer 3D, why waste your money on an inferior product such as Asphalt 3D?\\" References External links *Official website (Archived, North America) Category:2011 video games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games Category:Asphalt (series) Category:Video games developed in France Category:Gameloft games Category:Konami games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games ","title":"Asphalt 3D"},{"id":"30496882","text":"is a Japanese autobiographical novel by Hiroshi Tamura.

I.S.P.C.K publishing p196  History  The Christians of colonial India were active in the Indian National Congress and wider Indian independence movement, being collectively represented in the All India Conference of Indian Christians, which advocated for swaraj and opposed the partition of India. The meeting of the All India Conference of Indian Christians in Lahore in December 1922, which had a large attendance of Punjabis, resolved that the clergymen of the Church in India should be drawn from the ranks of Indians, rather than foreigners. The AICIC also stated that Indian Christians would not tolerate any discrimination based on race or skin colour. S. K. Datta of Lahore, who served as the principal of Forman Christian College, became the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians, representing the Indian Christian community at the Second Round Table Conference, where he agreed with Mahatma Gandhi's views on minorities and Depressed Classes. On 30 October 1945, the All India Conference of Indian Christians formed a joint committee with the Catholic Union of India that passed a resolution in which, \\"in the future constitution of India, the profession, practice and propagation of religion should be guaranteed and that a change of religion should not involve any civil or political disability.\\" This joint committee enabled the Christians in colonial India to stand united, and in front of the British Parliamentary Delegation \\"the committee members unanimously supported the move for independence and expressed complete confidence in the future of the community in India.\\" The office for this joint committee was opened in Delhi, in which the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University M. Rahnasamy served as President and B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore served as General Secretary. Six members of the joint committee were elected to the Minorities Committee of the Constituent Assembly. Following the partition of colonial India, the Catholic Union of India granted independence to its branches in Sind and Baluchistan in its Second Annual General Meeting in Bangalore in October 1947, which was presided by Ruthnasamy.

In 1938, she finished her education at Coe College and started to work as a secretary for the Chamber of Commerce in Cedar Rapids. To that time she began to find swimming laps boring and to develop her idea of combining swimming with music and dance. After studying a book about rhythmic swimming she created a routine of swimming strokes which were set to music. On the suggestion of her husband, coach and manager Henry Gundling, Beulah took part at the duet competition in synchronized swimming at the Outdoor Nationals in Des Moines in 1948 together with Noreen Fenner and placed 10th.Biography of Beulah Gundling on the website of Coe College, Cedar Rapids (Iowa, USA, 2006).

ISSN 1368-485X Design and development First flown in 1987, the original Sparrow Ultralight is a single seater designed as an FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles compliant aircraft with an empty weight within that category's empty weight limit, when equipped with a light enough engine. The Sparrow can also be built in the US homebuilt and light-sport aircraft categories. The aircraft has a 4130 steel tube frame fuselage and a wing constructed with dual aluminium I-beam spars, with stamped aluminum wing ribs, all covered in doped fabric. The wings are supported by V-struts and jury struts. The landing gear is bungee suspended. The Sparrow has a fully enclosed cockpit design, allowing flying in cooler weather. The Sparrow was available as a kit that includes a pre-welded fuselage and quick-build wings. The power range is and the original standard engine specified was the Rotax 277 with the Rotax 503 as an option, although the additional weight puts the aircraft in the US homebuilt category. Other lightweight engines employed include the Zenoah G-25 and the 2si 215. The Sparrow can be equipped with skis for winter operations. Construction times from the kit are reported to be 400‚Äì500 hours. The design was named Grand Champion at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh upon its introduction in 1987.

It contains a single species, Vytshegdosuchus zheshartensis. Vytshegdosuchus was named by Andreii Sennikov in 1988. Discovery Vytshegdosuchus is known from the holotype PIN 3361/134, a right ilium, and possibly from the paratype PIN 3361/127, a partial femur. These specimens were collected from the a fossil assemblage called the Parotosuchus fauna of the Upper Yarenskian Gorizont, in the Zheshart locality along the Vychegda River in Aikino district of the Komi Republic. A pterygoid and postcranial material from the Gam locality, a cervical vertebra (PIN 3369/139) from another locality and postcrania from the Mezhog locality were also assigned to Vytshegdosuchus by Sennikov (1999). Nesbitt (2009) argued that the specimens referred to Vytshegdosuchus cannot unambiguously be assigned to that taxon, as these localities are well separated, and the bones were found isolated. Vytshegdosuchus occurs with the erythrosuchian Garjainia and the possible proterosuchian Gamosaurus and demonstrates there was clear temporal overlap with paracrocodylomorph archosaurs and at least erythrosuchians as predicted earlier by phylogenetic analyses. A similar faunal assemblage is present in the Heshanggou Formation of China, which dates to the late Early and possibly early Middle Triassic, as evidenced by the cooccurrence of the basal erythrosuchian Fugusuchus and the poposauroid Xilousuchus. The holotype of Vytshegdosuchus is also the oldest material currently considered as belonging to Archosauria from Russia, and the only from the Early Triassic. Furthermore, a numerical phylogenetic analysis performed by Nesbitt (2011) placed it in the Paracrocodylomorpha. The Yarenskian Gorizont is generally considered late Olenekian in age on the basis of palynology and the presence of the characteristic Olenekian temnospondyl Parotosuchus. Parotosuchus also occurs in Germany within three formations of the Middle Buntsandstein, and is therefore broadly of Olenekian age and considered an index taxon for these strata. Vytshegdosuchus is from the Gamskian, the upper biochron of the Yarenskian Gorizont and may therefore be latest Olenekian in age and approximately contemporaneous with the poposauroid Ctenosauriscus. Description Vytshegdosuchus was originally assigned to the Rauisuchidae based on comparisons with loricatans such as Rauisuchus, Saurosuchus and Arganasuchus. Gower and Sennikov (2000), who revised its diagnosis, focused on the holotype ilium. It preserved a thickened ridge dorsal to the supra-acetabular crest, which according to Nesbitt (2009) is a character only present in many paracrocodylomorphs. Although the anterior process curves medially at its anterior extent according to Sennikov (1988), a character which is not present in these paracrocodylomorphs, an ilium (SAM- PK-11753) from the Anisian-aged Lifua Member of the Manda Formation shows an identical feature. The femur assigned to Vytshegdosuchus is consistent with proterosuchids, Euparkeria and archosaurs since, according to Gower and Sennikov (2000), it has no intertrochanteric fossa and a low fourth trochanter. Furthermore, the femur has a groove on its proximal surface, a character state found in paracrocodylomorphs, as well as some dinosauriforms. The lack of distinct anteromedial tuber of the femur' proximal end is found in nearly all archosaurs ancestrally. Thus, both the ilium and the femur bear features only present in Archosauria, regardless of their association. Therefore, Nesbitt (2009) suggested that Vytshegdosuchus is an archosaur which is assignable to Paracrocodylomorpha.

The game was released in Japan in 2012, and was released worldwide by Nintendo in 2014. Plot The game is set in the fantasy world of Reveria, which is made up of several cities, plains, and mountains. Its rulers spend their days ruling over their citizens and guiding them in their Life paths. One day this peaceful state is shattered when a strange, purple meteorite, falls into the house of the player, setting off a chain of events foretold in an ancient prophecy involving Reveria's goddess and the moon Lunares. The player is asked by King Erik of the land of Castele to investigate these strange occurrences, as the meteorites, later dubbed Doomstones by the world's inhabitants, have the ability to fill creatures with dark, destructive energy. They are joined in this quest by a glowing butterfly that has the ability to speak. As the game progresses, the butterfly reveals that her real name and form is Yuelia, the daughter of Celestia, whom the people of Reveria worship as the Life Goddess. They soon discover that the Doomstones are chunks of a dome that surrounds Reveria that has been slowly falling apart. This had happened in the past once before, but was stopped by Celestia, at the cost of her never being able to return to Lunares. Yuelia and her sister Noelia, discover that the only way to save the world is to gather the wishes of as many people as possible and take them up to Lunares, where those wishes will restore the dome completely. The player and the two sisters manage to successfully travel to Lunares, but soon find out that they do not have enough wishes to restore the dome. Yuelia, becoming content with her Life on Reveria, wishes that she never has to leave. With that final wish, the end of the world is averted and Reveria is saved once again, ending the main story. Gameplay Fantasy Life is a role-playing life simulation game, in which players can choose from any of the twelve jobs known as \\"life classes\\". Gameplay centers upon the player taking on various tasks given to them and choosing one of twelve Life classes. Upon achieving various goals such as completing tasks in the game, buying a new house, or decorating said house, players will gain \\"Bliss points\\" that will unlock additional features like larger storage, or the ability to expand your home. Players are able to customize several aspects of their character. As the game progresses players have the ability to unlock several new areas, as well as playable characters that can join them on their journey and help them fight monsters. Playable characters include King Erik's daughter Laura and Port Puerto governess Olivia, as well as several Life class specific characters that will unlock after the player has reached a certain class level. Players choose from one of twelve classes, each of which has its own \\"Life Master\\" that will assign tasks and award points to the player, allowing them to rank up within their Life. Each rank gives the player the ability to perform additional tasks and will give Life bonuses (additional vital stat points and abilities) to the player. As the player masters each Life class they gain the ability to more easily produce and access materials on their own, as opposed to purchasing them via a storefront. Players can level up through the ranks of each life class; starting out as a Fledgling and ending with the Legend rank. If the player has the Origin Island DLC, a new rank called the Creator (or God in Europe) rank is added. Reception Critical reception for Fantasy Life was mostly positive. The game holds a rating of 73 on Metacritic based on 51 reviews, signifying average reviews. Megan Sullivan of IGN awarded the game with 8/10, stating that it \\"is a fun blend of life simulation and RPG\\" and that it \\"offers a cornucopia of activities to do\\". Conversely, Polygon's Griffin McElroy said that it is \\"more mundane than fantastic.\\" In April 2013, Level-5 revealed that the game had sold over 300,000 copies in Japan. McElroy criticized the games battling mechanics, saying that they \\"require almost no strategy\\" and that \\"even the game‚Äôs toughest foes can be easily outwitted; every enemy has an invisible boundary they‚Äôll never move past, so defeating any enemy is as easy as hitting them, running to the boundary and repeating\\". Jeuxvideo's Kaaraj praised the games cutscenes, but criticized the game for only having a few of them. The game's story was criticized by several reviewers, with McElroy saying that it might be its \\"most repetitive element\\", IGN's Sullivan claiming that it \\"has pacing issues\\", and Destructoid's Brittany Vincent noting that \\"the beginning of the game is riddled with JRPG narrative tropes\\"; however, Eurogamer's Simon Parkin praised the games story, calling it \\"witty\\". USgamer's Jeremy Parish noted several similarities between Fantasy Life's story and the story of Dragon Quest IX. Sequel The game was re-released, titled Fantasy Life Link!, in Japan on 25 July 2013. New features include online play with friends, a rise in level cap, additional quests, and the ability to take screenshots, among others. The international version of Fantasy Life included all the additional content of Link!, with the exception of the Origin Island DLC. In April 2015, Level-5 revealed a sequel titled Fantasy Life 2: Two Moons and the Village of God, which was originally set for release on Android and iOS devices in 2016. The game was later renamed Fantasy Life Online, and suffered numerous delays over a period of three years, which pushed its release back to July 23, 2018, where it garnered over two million downloads in Japan within two weeks.

In 1997 it was relegated, but from 1998 it joined forced with neighbor and rival Orkdal IL to field the team Orkdal IL/Orkanger IF (OIL/OIF), still in the Second Division. The merger was later formalized through the club Orkla FK. Orkanger IF still fielded teams below junior level. Late in September 2010 Orkanger IF held a general election among its members to see if the club still wanted to contribute in the collaboration to keep Orkla FK alive. In the election, about 60% of the votes went in favour of withdrawing from the collaboration. The result meant that Orkanger IF were free to field their own team in the men's league. As of this, Orkanger IF have two men's teams (a first team and a B team) in the Sixth Division. The manager is Ronny Folvik. Orienteer Ellen Sofie Olsvik represented the club for a period.

Fonthill Castle Fonthill Castle was built in 1852 as the country estate of Shakespearean actor Edwin Forrest and his wife, the actress Catherine Norton Sinclair. According to Lawrence Barrett, the plans were formed by Mrs. Forrest and approved by her husband.Barrett, Lawrence and Forrest, Edwin. Edwin Forrest, James R. Osgood and Company, Boston, 1881 Steven E.

The name Fonthill was derived from William Beckford's Gothic Fonthill Abbey in England.\\"Fonthill Castle\\", Historic Campus Architecture Project, The Council of Independent Colleges Forrest later sold the property to the Sisters of Charity of New York who relocated the Academy of Mount Saint Vincent from McGowan's Pass when the City of New York was developing Central Park. The castle has served as a convent, chapel, museum, chaplain's residence, and the college library. It later came to house the admissions office of the College of Mount Saint Vincent. Fonthill is a Gothic Revival style building consisting of a cluster of six octagonal towers at varying heights, built of hammered grey stone. Five of the towers radiate from a three-story central tower. A sketch of Fonthill's octagons among the papers of Alexander Jackson Davis suggests that he had some part in its design, although it has also been attributed to Thomas C. Smith. In 1942, the castle became the Elizabeth Seton Library and, in 1969, the college admissions office. Administration Building The Administration Building was built between 1857 and 1859 in the Early Romanesque revival style. The initial structure of the administration building was designed built by Henry Engelbert, an architect active in NYC from 1852‚Äì1879.\\"Administration Building\\", Historic Campus Architecture Project, The Council of Independent Colleges The building was expanded in 1865, 1883, 1906‚Äì1908, and in 1951. The original building is a five-story red brick building on a fieldstone base. It features a six-story square tower topped by a copper lantern and spire. The tower is flanked by five story gabled sections. See also: At the base of the tower, a double stairway rises from a porte cochere to the level of the veranda, leading to the entrance. In 1910 the Academy of Mount St. Vincent became the College of Mount Saint Vincent. The original academy building now serves as the Administration building of the college, and the additions house related administrative and academic functions.

His films received four British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTAs) and five Oscar nominations (four as director and writer and one as writer only) all in the short documentary classification. Education Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, he was educated at Newcastle Royal Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Film career His first film, Hadrian's Wall, was made while he was at university and was self-financed. On the basis of this film he was able to enter the film industry as a trainee assistant for World Wide Films. His first commercial film, released in 1955, was Oil Harbour, Aden, made for the sponsor George Wimpey & Co who had the contract to build a port to service a nearby oil refinery being built by BP. Williams acted as cameraman as well as writer and director during the two year location filming. His first big break came in 1955 when World Wide Films was appointed by BP to film the British Trans-Antarctic Expedition, under Dr Vivian Fuchs, which BP was sponsoring. Williams became a member of the sixteen-person party the sailed to the Weddell Sea aboard Theron with the intention of establishing an advance base for the main party due to arrive the following year. During the outward journey the ship became frozen is sea ice and also had to depart more rapidly than originally intended, having deposited the shore party who were to stay through the Antarctic winter. The resulting film, Foothold on Antarctica, was released in 1956. It received a private viewing at Buckingham Palace and went on to receive an Oscar nomination. The film was also shown on a number of occasions as part of public events which included a talk from Sir Vivian Fuchs and which raised private donations towards the costs of the expedition. His next film, Oxford, made in 1956, was commissioned by the Central Office of Information as part of their efforts to attract overseas students. In 1957 Williams moved from World Wide Films to Greenpark Films. He wrote and directed From the Good Earth in 1957 under the sponsorship of Hovis. This was followed by There Was a Door (1957), which looked at the care of the severely learning disabled and was sponsored by the Manchester Regional Hospital Board. This film represented his first social subject, an area that the British documentary film industry since the 1930s had had a strong track record. The film was subsequently televised by the BBC. In 1959 he made The Road to MIS, a film sponsored by BP to mark its fiftieth anniversary. Following The Road to MIS, Derek Williams became a freelance director and writer. Subsequent films were Bank of England (1960), Hunted in Holland (1961), The Cattle Carters (1962) and Treasure in Malta (1963), the latter three films being drama documentaries. Hunted in Holland and Treasure in Malta were frequently shown to Saturday morning children's film audiences in the 1960s, and The Cattle Carters was frequently shown on BBC2 as a Trade Test Colour Film. In 1962 Derek Williams accepted an offer from Films of Scotland to direct a film to commemorate the centennial of Glasgow's appointment of its first Medical Officer for Health. Williams' candid attempts to portray the Glasgow of the times brought him into conflict with John Grierson of Films of Scotland, who wanted a more positive portrayal of Glasgow. Williams was not credited on the release of the finished film, Health of a City (1965). His next film was sponsored by BP about their attempts to find oil in northern Alaska. The film was released as North Slope - Alaska in 1964 and is notable for its music composed by the composer Edward Williams. His subsequent films were also sponsored by BP. I Do - And I Understand (1964) was on behalf of the Nuffield MAths Project and won a Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA, the predecessor to BAFTA). Turkey the Bridge focused on Turkeys historical and cultural heritage. It was edited by Kevin Brownlow and was Oscar nominated. His next film, having worked on but not been credited for North Sea Quest (1967), was Algerian Pipeline (1967)made for John Brown Ltd who were building a pipeline. 1967 also saw the making of Indus Water sponsored by The World Bank and with original music composed by Wilfred Joseph. The film looked at a project undertaken under an Indian and Pakistan treaty to mutually harness the waters of the Indus for agriculture. This film also won a SFTA award. In 1969, rejoining Greenpark Films, Williams made The Taking Mood for BP New Zealand, another small scale dramatic piece. This was to be Derek Williams' last dramatic film which proved not to be his strongest genre. Arguably his most important and widely recognised film was to follow in 1970. Entitled The Shadow of Progress and sponsored by BP, the film was an early example of the environmental movement. The film exposed the consequences of industrialisation, particularly with regard to pollution, though coming prior to the identification of global warming, its focus is more on the visual impact and damage to wild-life and the lived environment. Over 1,900 copies of the film were printed and circulated in a number of languages and the film was twice shown by the BBC on prime time. The following year he made Alaska - The Great Land again under BP sponsorship focusing on the history, wildlife and culture of Alaska. Edward Williams was the composer of the music. The film resulted in Derek Williams' last SFTA award. In 1972, he made Tide of Traffic under BP sponsorship, part of a planned three part series (The Shadow of Progress, Tide of Traffic and a scripted but never made film on the issues created by population growth). Tide of Traffic was about the impact of the car particularly in terms of its damage to the urban environment. The film received an Oscar nomination and a Venice Golden Mercury. In 1973 he made Scotland, a film sponsored by BP and focused on the history and culture of Scotland. His last film for Greenpark was made the following year. A Heritage to Build on, released in 1975, was sponsored by the Cement and Concrete Association. He wrote the script for The End of the Road (1976) about Alaska, which went on to receive an Oscar nomination. By now the British documentary industry was in rapid decline with the growing strength of television and the dwindling availability of industrial sponsorship, particularly following the 1973 oil shock. However, in his last significant budget film, The Shetland Experience (1977), Williams worked under the sponsorship of the Sullom Voe Association to record the history, nature and culture of Shetland as the oil began to come ashore to Sullom Voe Terminal. The film was Oscar nominated and Williams was able to attend the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles for the only time. In 1979 he made Planet Water for BP, though on a much more limited budget than the films of the early 1970s. The film focused on the problems of access to water and covered some of the theme which were to be part of the unmade film on population growth. Most of his remaining films reflected the declining sponsorship available and were of a more obviously commercial nature. These include The Science of Art (1976) for Winsor & Newton, The Chemistry of India (1979) for ICI, Army Cadet (1980) and an army recruitment film, South East Pipeline (1982) for Esso, Fair Wear and Tear (1982) for BP, Diamond Day (1982) for De Beers, Configuration Management (1985) and Replenishment at Sea (1986) for the UK Armed Forces.

He made four game-winning field goals in his career, the most memorable of which led Iowa to a victory over Michigan in 1985. Early life Rob Houghtlin attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. He played for one season at Miami University before transferring to the University of Iowa, Silver anniversary of ‚ÄúThe Kick‚Äù walking on as a sophomore before the 1985 season. Houghtlin success with dramatic, game- winning kicks began at an early age. With less than a minute to play, his Winnetka Chiefs 8th grade football team marched 92 yard to tie Antioch in the Northern Illinois championship. Forgoing the traditional one point run, Winnetka chose to kick for two points; Houghtlin nailed the game-winner as time expired. By 1982, his senior year in high school, Houghtlin was considered one of the best kickers in the state of Illinois. Facing fierce rival Evanston High School in the state quarterfinals, Houghtlin kicked a 50-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to end Evanston's playoff run. In addition to kicking, he also played defensive back throughout his high school career. College career On October 19, 1985, the Iowa Hawkeyes were ranked #1 in the nation, while the Michigan Wolverines were ranked #2. Michigan came to Iowa City for a rare matchup of the top two teams in the nation. Iowa trailed, 10-9, with two seconds to play in the game. Houghtlin kicked a 29-yard field goal from the right hash mark as time expired to give Iowa a 12-10 win.Hawkeye Legends, Lists, & Lore, by Mike Finn & Chad Leistikow, Page 174 () Later that season, he made a 25-yard field goal as time ran out to beat Purdue, 27-24. L.A. Times article Houghtlin was an all-Big Ten selection after his sophomore season. As a junior in 1986, he missed a 52-yard field goal at the end of a 27-27 tie game against Minnesota; however, a Minnesota penalty gave Houghtlin another opportunity, and he made a 37-yard field goal as time expired to defeat the Gophers, 30-27.Hawkeye Legends, Lists, & Lore, by Mike Finn & Chad Leistikow, Page 179 () Iowa's final game that year was the 1986 Holiday Bowl against San Diego State, where Iowa trailed, 38-36, with four seconds remaining. Chuck Hartlieb caught a high snap, and Houghtlin booted a 41-yard field goal as time expired to give Iowa a 39-38 victory. L.A. Times article Houghtlin was again an all-Big Ten selection as a senior in 1987, eventually leaving Iowa as the school's all-time leader in field goals and points.Hawkeye Legends, Lists, & Lore, by Mike Finn & Chad Leistikow, Page 179 () Professional career Houghtlin was not drafted by the NFL, but in 1988 was invited to training camp with both the Atlanta Falcons and Chicago Bears; he did not make the final roster for either club. The following spring, he signed with the Chicago Bruisers of the Arena Football League. There would be no thrilling, last-second kicks for Houghtlin with the Bruisers; in fact, he missed all twelve attempts in the 1989 regular season, still an AFL record for most field goal attempts without success. (Houghtlin did kick one field goal in four attempts in what would be his last pro game, a 43-10 playoff loss to the Detroit Drive.)

The episode, written by co- executive producer Josh Singer and directed by filmmaker Joe Chappelle, is set in a fictional upstate New York town and begins with the discovery of a seemingly deformed child by a state trooper. The Fringe investigative team of Olivia Dunham, Walter Bishop, and Peter Bishop arrives on the scene, only to discover a secret government experiment gone awry, with signs from Walter's past. Originally called \\"Edina City Limits\\", the episode's title was changed shortly before it aired. It premiered in the United States on January 14, 2010, on Fox, to 6.529 million viewers and a 2.6 share 18‚Äì49. The episode received average reviews, as many critics compared it either negatively or positively to a B-movie, though most agreed that it seemed to be rehashed from older The X-Files episodes. Several of the main actors, however, thoroughly enjoyed the episode; Noble named it one of his favorite Fringe episodes. Critics also noted the popular culture references to The Wizard of Oz (1939), Deliverance (1972), and Joseph Merrick. Plot In upstate New York, a child is picked up on the road by a state trooper. While en route, the child suddenly morphs into a deformed creature. At the station, the troopers try to decide what to do with him, and one takes his picture. Two other deformed people enter the station, kill the troopers and take the boy. The Fringe team comes on the scene to investigate and find the boy's photograph, along with recorded sightings of deformed people going back 30 years. They arrive in Edina, the city these sightings occurred near, and Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) hears a buzz called the \\"Edina hum\\". The sheriff explains it is coming from a nearby military base and offers to show them case files of past sightings. While driving, the SUV containing Olivia, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) is run off the road by another vehicle, whose driver then starts shooting at them before getting shot and leaving. The FBI find the abandoned vehicle and follow a blood trail to the shooter. Peter is visibly disturbed after killing his first person, and Olivia tries to comfort him. Agent Broyles discovers that the army did classified experiments in Edina called \\"Project Elephant\\", but most of the records are gone. The team brings the body, along with a butterfly Walter found in the town and thought Astrid would like, back to the lab in Boston. They discover that both have transformed into deformed versions of themselves. Peter and Olivia go back to Edina to talk with the sheriff and try to locate the owner of the truck. Meanwhile, back in the lab, Walter tries to remember why the case feels so familiar. Throughout the episode Walter had been humming some strange melody, and he and Astrid realize he might previously have worked on the project with the army. The melody was a memory trick Walter used to remind himself where he stored the experiment files so many years ago. The experiment was done by the army in the late 1970s to test how electromagnetic pulses can camouflage soldiers and was conducted on the townspeople; the army was unaware of the long-term effects of the study until it was too late, and the people were stuck in a deformed state. The \\"hum\\" hides their deformities from the human eye through a massive electromagnetic pulse that runs through the town, and once they leave and are out of the pulse's reach, their true deformities show. Walter and Astrid find the source of the electromagnetic pulse, and begin investigating the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell-bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life. Production The episode was the second written by co-executive producer and writer Josh Singer, and was the third directed by co-executive producer Joe Chappelle. It was originally titled \\"Edina City Limits\\" in press and promotional items, until Fox changed it to \\"Johari Window\\" without explanation on January 5, a week before it broadcast. A johari window is a cognitive psychological tool used to help people better understand their interpersonal communication and relationships, and may have been chosen as the episode's title because it corresponded to the transformative nature of the plot. The sound mixing department's inspiration for the \\"Edina hum\\" (the frequency hiding the deformities of the townsfolk) came from executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Supervising sound editor Paul Curtis later recalled Pinkner's asking for it to sound like \\"100-year locusts back east\\", consequently what the crew \\"basically...ended up with were bugs\\". They also layered in a variety of machine sounds. Sound effects editor Bruce Tanis remarked that because the background sound lasted the entire episode, it had to be handled \\"thoughtfully\\". John Noble later remarked \\"Johari Window\\" was one of his favorite episodes. Actor Joshua Jackson later remarked that \\"Johari Window\\" was a \\"stand-alone\\" episode in an interview: \\"There is nothing from that thing that broadens the story, except at the heart of it, is a story about love and acceptance and family... Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well\\". Actor John Noble added, \\"Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'. I thought it was one of my favourite stories\\". Cultural references When Walter refuses to get out of the car to enter a supermarket, he mentions he is \\"learning to appreciate cowardice\\" and that \\"the lion had a point\\", a reference, he explains to Peter, about the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Walter also mentions flying monkeys and talking lions later in the episode, both also homages to the movie. Later, Walter excitedly says he remembers someone who played the banjo and looked like the kidnapped, deformed boy, and starts humming a tune. Peter completes the tune and explains it is from the movie Deliverance (1972), which depicts murderous, inbred, and deformed people living in rural Georgia. The army experiment was titled \\"Project Elephant\\", a possible reference to Joseph Merrick, a deformed person known as the \\"Elephant Man\\". When Walter shows Astrid how the moth changes back to the butterfly when they enter the town, he says, \\" a friend once said ' any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'\\" This was originally said by Arthur C. Clarke, originally appearing in Clarke's 1973 revision of \\"Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination\\". Reception =Ratings= \\"Johari Window\\" was watched by more than 6.529 million viewers, achieving a 2.6 share of viewers aged 18‚Äì49. It rose thirteen percent from the previous week's episode, and was the highest rated night of Fringe since the season premiere. =Reviews= Ramsey Isler of IGN thought there was not much original or well-done about the episode, and negatively compared it to previous episodes of The X-Files. He wrote the \\"slow...story [lacked] the intrigue and excitement that other episodes in the series had,\\" but praised its conclusion as a \\"pay off\\". John McCracken of TV Guide also compared it to The X-Files, and thought the episode was \\"tedious\\" and \\"largely felt like a by-the-numbers B-movie affair\\". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad enjoyed the \\"B-movie\\" aspects of the plot however, calling them \\"fun\\". She thought the episode felt like \\"a thriller movie,\\" and praised Noble's acting as \\"brilliantly\\". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, explaining that \\"despite some good makeup effects and a few emotional moments, \\"Johari Window\\" [was] distressingly average\\". Andrew Hanson of the LA Times enjoyed how the \\"Edina hum\\" remained in the background of every town scene, but missed the \\"investigation exposition\\"-supplying presence of Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo).

His book, The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates, first published in 1988 and subsequently updated and revised, is regarded as the authoritative reference work on the subject. His other books included Words of Peace, which brought together selections from the acceptance speeches of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and five volumes of Nobel Lectures in Peace. Life and career Irwin Abrams was born in San Francisco in 1914. He graduated from Lowell High School in December 1930 at the age of 16. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and a master's degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University. In 1936-37, he traveled to Europe to do research for his dissertation. It was a formative experience. He met many outstanding leaders and scholars of the international peace movement and delved into previously unknown source materials. \\"Abrams opened and explored archival sources on which a generation of historians would come to depend,\\" the Magazine of History said in a 1994 profile. \\"His dissertation, A History of European Peace Societies, 1867-1899, won the Charles Sumner Peace Prize and, although it was never published, it has been called 'the most quoted unpublished dissertation in history'. Whether or not that is factual, it has the ring of truth, for Abrams's 1938 work and his subsequent writing gave direction and inspiration to historians on both sides of the Atlantic when the study of peace in history blossomed a generation later.\\"Chatfield, Charles; \\"Profile of a Peace Historian\\", The OAH Magazine of History\\", Spring 1994. Born Jewish, Abrams became a Quaker in the late 1930s, inspired in part by his research on the early peace movement and his friendships with British philosopher Gerald Heard and others. He later wrote that joining the Society of Friends was the final step in a move away from liberal humanism toward the ideal of pacifism and nonviolence. He came to believe that \\"to change the world you had to change yourself.\\" Chatfield, Charles; \\"Profile of a Peace Historian\\", The OAH Magazine of History, Spring 1994. During World War II, Abrams fulfilled his obligations as a conscientious objector by working with the American Friends Service Committee, or AFSC, in Philadelphia. He researched international relief work, directed training for AFSC relief workers from 1943 to 1946 and organized the Quaker International Workcamp Program the following year. During that time, his wife Freda, whom he had married in 1939, stayed home with their two young children, David and Carole. A third child, James, was born a few years later. The family moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1947 when Abrams joined the faculty of Antioch College. He organized the Department of History and created an introduction to western civilization still fondly remembered by many Antioch alumni. He became a full professor in 1951, Distinguished University Professor in 1979, and \\"emeritus\\" two years later. Throughout his Antioch years, Abrams was nudged beyond the classroom by his Quaker concern for peace, his pioneering studies of the historic European peace movement and his own international experience. He became, as he wrote, \\"a theorist and practitioner\\" in study abroad and intercultural experience. The number of international exchanges, including study abroad, was rising rapidly, and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to encourage cross-cultural understanding.Bloch, Andrzej; \\"Antioch Education Abroad: Irwin Abrams\\", Antioch University, December 2010. After his retirement from teaching, Abrams published the first of several books on the Nobel Peace Prize. His The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History was published in 1989. It was recognized as an \\"outstanding reference work\\" by the American Library Association. He went on to publish other works on the prize, including Words of Peace, which brings together selections from the acceptance speeches of the prizewinners, and five volumes of Nobel Lectures in Peace. Of writing about the laureates, he wrote, \\"It's been a rich experience to live with these people all of these years.\\"Chiddister, Diane; \\"Historian Irwin Abrams Captures Inspirational Work of Peacemakers\\", Yellow Springs News, January 3, 2002. He met many of the prizewinners, including the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Willy Brandt and Martin Luther King, Jr. Another laureate, Jos√© Ramos-Horta, the current president of East Timor, considered him a friend. Abrams \\"led a life of scholarly integrity, intellectual and moral rectitude, compassion and faith in humanity, encompassing a whole century of profound transformation in the history of our small world\\", he said.Ramos-Horta, Jos√©; From unpublished remarks on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, June 28, 2003. Abrams was honored on numerous occasions by colleagues and former students. In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from Antioch University. In 2000, he was given a distinguished lifetime service award by the Peace History Society and the Peace History Commission of the International Peace Research Association. In 2003, the Antioch College Alumni Association presented him with the Arthur Morgan Award \\"for his long and exemplary service to the Antioch College community, the education community and the global community\\". Abrams said that the happiest outcome of his teaching years was when his students from the class of 1955 came together in 2005 ‚Äì 50 years later ‚Äì and raised funds for a peace education memorial fund in his name. He was inducted into the \\"Walk of Fame\\" in Dayton, Ohio, in the fall of 2007 and has a square on the sidewalk on W. Third Street in Dayton commemorating his achievements.

Originating in Philadelphia and spreading to the New York City Subway and beyond, graffiti is among the most common forms of vandalism committed today.  Growth of graffiti culture in New York  Modern graffiti began in Philadelphia, in the 1960s, but it appeared briefly before that shortly after the death of Charlie Parker (nicknamed \\"Yardbird\\" or \\"Bird\\") in 1955. Graffiti then began appearing around New York City with the words \\"Bird Lives\\"Ross Russell. Bird Lives!: The High Life And Hard Times Of Charlie (yardbird) Parker Da Capo Press. but it was not for about one and a half more decades that graffiti became noticeable in NYC. So, around 1970-71 the center of graffiti culture shifted from Philadelphia to New York City, especially around Washington Heights, where suspects such as TAKI 183 and Tracy 168 started to gain notoriety for their frequent vandalism. Using a naming convention in which they would add their street number to their nickname, they \\"bombed\\" a train with their work, letting the subway take it throughout the city.About New York City Graffiti, part 1 Bubble lettering was popular among perpetrators from the Bronx, but was replaced with a new \\"wildstyle\\", a term coined by Tracy 168 and a legendary original Graffiti crew with over 500 members including Blade, Cope 2, T Kid 170, Cap, Juice 177, and Dan Plasma.Peter Shapiro, Rough Guide to Hip Hop, 2nd. ed., London: Rough Guides, 2007.David Toop, Rap Attack, 3rd ed., London: Serpent's Tail, 2000. Graffiti tags started to grow in style and size. Notable names from that time include DONDI, Lady Pink, Zephyr, Julio 204, STAY HIGH 149, PHASE 2. Graffiti was growing competitive and artists desired to see their names across the city. Around 1974 suspects like Tracy 168, CLIFF 159 and BLADE ONE started to create works with more than just their names: they added illustrations, full of scenery and cartoon characters, to their tags, laying the groundwork for the mural-car. The standards from the early 1970s continue to evolve, and the late 1970s and early 1980s saw new styles and ideas. As graffiti spread beyond Washington Heights and the Bronx, a graffiti crime wave was born. Fab 5 Freddy (Friendly Freddie, Fred Brathwaite) was one of the most notorious graffiti figures of that era. He notes how differences in spray technique and letters between Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn began to merge in the late 1970s: \\"out of that came 'Wild Style'.\\"Fab 5 Freddy quote in: Lippard, Lucy. Mixed Blessings: Art in Multicultural America. New York: The New Press, 1990. Fab 5 Freddy is often credited with helping to spread the influence of graffiti and rap music beyond its early foundations in the Bronx, and making links in the mostly white downtown art and music scenes. It was around this time that the established art world started becoming receptive to the graffiti culture for the first time since Hugo Martinez's Razor Gallery in the early 1970s. The growth of graffiti in New York City was enabled by its subway system, whose accessibility and interconnectedness emboldened the movement, who now often operated through coordinated efforts.David Grazian, \\"Mix It Up\\", W W Norton & Co Inc, 2010, , p.14 It was further left unchecked due to the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would be a while before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The Abraham Beame Administration established a police squad of about 10 police officers to work in anti graffiti capacity. The squad attended informal meetings and socialized with minor suspects to gather information to help them apprehend leaders. Although the squad gathered information on thousands of graffiti vandals, inadequate manpower prevented them from following through with arrests. Graffiti vandal arrests in New York City were reported at around 4,500 between 1972-1974, 998 in 1976, 578 in 1977, 272 in 1978, 205 in 1979.  Decline of New York City graffiti subculture: enforcement and control  Storefront graffiti of a restaurant in Chinatown, Manhattan As graffiti became associated with crime, many demanded that the government take a more serious stance towards it, particularly after the popularization of the Fixing Broken Windows philosophy. By the 1980s, increased police surveillance and implementation of increased security measures (razor wire, guard dogs) combined with continuous efforts to clean it up led to the weakening of New York's graffiti subculture. As a result of subways being harder to paint, more writers went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing. But the streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made obtaining materials difficult. Many graffiti artists, however, chose to see the new problems as a challenge rather than a reason to quit. A downside to these challenges was that the artists became very territorial of good writing spots, and strength and unity in numbers (gangs) became increasingly important. This was stated to be the end for the casual subway graffiti artists. In 1984 New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) began a five-year program to eradicate graffiti. The years between 1985 and 1989 became known as the \\"diehard\\" era. A last shot for the graffiti artists of this time was in the form of subway cars destined for the scrap yard. With the increased security, the culture had taken a step back. The previous elaborate \\"burners\\" on the outside of cars were now marred with simplistic marker tags which often soaked through the paint. By mid-1986 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the NYCTA were winning their \\"war on graffiti,\\" with the last graffitied train removed from service in 1989.About New York City Graffiti, part 2 As the population of artists lowered so did the violence associated with graffiti crews and \\"bombing.\\" However, teenagers from inner London and other European cities with family and other links to New York City had by this time taken up some of the traditions of subway Graffiti and exported them home, although New York City writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-80s and \\"put up pieces\\" on or near the western ends of the Metropolitan line, outside London. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \\"mission\\" to americanize the London Underground Limited (LUL) through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London \\"train writers\\" (LUL writers) adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on LUL rolling stock became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on LUL trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few LUL writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip-hop culture like the BBC's 'Bad Meaning Good', which included a section featuring interviews with LUL writers and a few examples of their pieces. Clean Train Movement era Graffiti on the Lower East Side The Clean Train Movement, wherein the rolling stock was either cleaned or outright replaced, started in 1985, with the last graffiti-covered train out of service by 1989. With subway trains being increasingly inaccessible, other property became the targets of graffiti. Rooftops became the new billboards for some 80s-era writers. The current era in graffiti is characterized by a majority of graffiti artists moving from subway or train cars to \\"street galleries.\\" Prior to the Clean Train Movement, the streets were largely left untouched not only in New York City, but in other major American cities as well. After the transit company began diligently cleaning their trains, graffiti burst onto the streets of America to an unexpecting and unappreciative public. The graffiti also spread to trains on Rome Metro's Line B, which ordered new trains in the 1990s that were quickly tagged with graffiti. The trains on Rome's metro are still heavily tagged to this day, partially due to the fact that graffiti still is rampant on the Metro's trains despite efforts to clean it. However, the Rome Metro's Line A does not have graffiti on its trains because they have newer, more graffiti-resistant rolling stock, which is also being phased in on Line B. Meanwhile, in New York in 1995, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani set up the Anti-Graffiti Task Force,Anti- Graffiti Task Force a multi-agency initiative to combat graffiti in New York City. This began a crackdown on \\"quality-of-life crimes\\" throughout the city, and one of the largest anti-graffiti campaigns in U.S. history. That same year Title 10-117 of the New York Administrative Code banned the sale of aerosol spray-paint cans to children under 18. The law also requires that merchants who sell spray paint must either lock it in a case or display the cans behind a counter, out of reach of potential shoplifters. Violations of the city's anti-graffiti law carry fines of US$350 per incident. On January 1, 2006, in New York City, legislation created by Councilmember Peter Vallone, Jr. attempted to raise the minimum age for possession of spray paint or permanent markers from 18 to 21. The law prompted outrage by fashion and media mogul Marc Ecko who sued Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Councilmember Vallone on behalf of art students and \\"legitimate\\" graffiti artists. On May 1, 2006, Judge George B. Daniels granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction against the recent amendments to the anti-graffiti legislation, effectively prohibiting the New York Police Department from enforcing the higher minimum age. A similar measure was proposed in New Castle County, Delaware in April 2006 and passed into law as a county ordinance in May 2006. At the same time, graffiti has begun to enter mainstream. Much controversy arose on whether graffiti should be considered an actual form of art. In 1974, Norman Mailer published an essay, The Faith of Graffiti, that explores the question of graffiti as art and includes interviews from early subway train graffitists, and then New York City mayor, John Lindsey. Since the 1980s, museums and art galleries started treating graffiti seriously. Many graffiti artists had taken to displaying their works in galleries and owning their own studios. This practice started in the early 1980s with artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, who started out tagging locations with his signature SAMO (\\"Same Old Shit\\"), and Keith Haring, who was also able to take his art into studio spaces. In some cases, graffiti artists had achieved such elaborate graffiti (especially those done in memory of a deceased person) on storefront gates that shopkeepers have hesitated to cover them up. In the Bronx after the death of rapper Big Pun, several murals dedicated to his life done by Bio, Nicer TATS CRU appeared virtually overnight; similar outpourings occurred after the deaths of The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Big L, and Jam Master Jay.

It is characterized by the development of myoclonic seizures and/or myoclonic astatic seizures. Signs and symptoms * Tonic-clonic seizures: seizures with repetitive sequences of stiffening and jerking of the extremities. * Myoclonic seizures: seizures with rapid, brief contractions of muscles. * Atonic seizures: seizures with a sudden loss of muscle tone, often resulting in sudden collapse. These are also called drop seizures. * Absence seizures: a generalized seizure characterized by staring off and occasionally some orofacial automatisms. * Myoclonic astatic seizures: seizures that involve a myoclonic seizure followed immediately by an atonic seizure. This type of seizure is exclusive to MAE and is one of the defining characteristics of this syndrome. * Tonic seizures: muscle stiffening or rigidity. This seizure is rare in this syndrome. =Onset= The onset of seizures is between the ages of 2 and 5 years of age. EEG shows regular and irregular bilaterally synchronous 2- to 3-Hz spike-waves and polyspike patterns with a 4- to 7-Hz background. 84% of affected children show normal development prior to seizures; the remainder show moderate psychomotor retardation mainly affecting speech. Boys (74%) are more often affected than girls (Doose and Baier 1987a).http://www.ilae-epilepsy.org/ctf/myoclonic_astatic_child.html Diagnosis Treatments The treatment for seizures may include antiepileptic medications, diet and vagus nerve stimulator. =Medication= Any number of medications may be used to both prevent and treat seizures. Generally after three medications are tried, different treatment should be considered. Some medications are harmful to those with this syndrome and can increase seizures. =Diet= The ketogenic diet mimics some of the effects of starvation, in which the body first uses up glucose and glycogen before burning stored body fat. In the absence of glucose, the body produces ketones, a chemical by-product of fat metabolism that has been known to inhibit seizures.

The low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) is a new dietary therapy currently being studied to treat epilepsy. LGIT attempts to reproduce the positive effects of the ketogenic diet. The treatment allows a more generous intake of carbohydrates than the ketogenic diet, but is restricted to foods that have a low glycemic index, meaning foods that have a relatively low impact on blood-glucose levels. These foods include meats, cheeses, and most vegetables because these foods have a relatively low glycemic index. Foods do not have to be weighed, but instead careful attention must be paid to portion size and balancing the intake of carbohydrates throughout the day with adequate amounts of fats and proteins.http://www.med.nyu.edu/cec/treatment/diet/glycemic.html Prognosis Epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures has a variable course and outcome. Spontaneous remission with normal development has been observed in a few untreated cases. Complete seizure control can be achieved in about half of the cases with antiepileptic drug treatment (Doose and Baier 1987b; Dulac et al. 1990). In the remainder of cases, the level of intelligence deteriorates and the children become severely intellectually disabled. Other neurologic abnormalities such as ataxia, poor motor function, dysarthria, and poor language development may emerge (Doose 1992b). However, this proportion may not be representative because in this series the data were collected in an institution for children with severe epilepsy. The outcome is unfavorable if generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic seizures appear at the onset or occur frequently during the course. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures usually occur during the daytime in this disorder, at least in the early stages. Nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which may develop later, are another unfavorable sign. If tonic seizures appear, prognosis is poor. Status epilepticus with myoclonic, astatic, myoclonic-astatic, or absence seizures is another ominous sign, especially when prolonged or appearing early. Failure to suppress the EEG abnormalities (4- to 7-Hz rhythms and spike-wave discharges) during therapy and absence of occipital alpha-rhythm with therapy also suggest a poor prognosis (Doose 1992a).http://www.ilae- epilepsy.org/ctf/myoclonic_astatic_child.html History Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy was first described and identified in 1970 by Herman Doose as an epilepsy syndrome, hence its original label, Doose syndrome. 1989, it was classified as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

It is the second book in the Frog and Toad series, whose four books completed by Lobel comprise five easy-to-read short stories each. It was a Newbery Honor Book, or runner-up for the American Library Association Newbery Medal, which recognizes the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". Frog and Toad Together was adapted as a film. Summary Best friends Frog and Toad are always together. The five stories feature flowers, cookies, bravery, dreams, and, most importantly, friendship. =A List= Toad wakes up one morning and decides to write a list of things to do for the day. After writing the list and doing the first four items on it (wake up, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go to Frog's house), he goes over to Frog's house and invites him to take a walk with him. During the walk, while Toad is crossing off \\"Take walk with Frog\\", a sudden gust of wind blows the list away. Frog tries to catch the list, but to no avail. As Toad cannot remember what else was on the list, he and Frog just sit and do nothing until night falls and Toad suddenly remembers that going to sleep was the last thing on his list, which is what the two friends do. =The Garden= Toad is impressed with the garden Frog has grown and wishes he had one too. Frog advises that it was hard work, and gives him a bag of flower seeds. Once Toad plants the seeds, he shouts at them to start growing, prompting Frog to come up and tell him the seeds are afraid to grow at the moment. Even when Frog tells Toad to leave the seeds alone and let the sun and rain do their work to help the seeds grow, Toad tries every other way (reading a story, singing songs, reading poetry, and playing music), all of which fail. Exhausted, Toad falls asleep one night, and the next morning, Frog wakes Toad up to show him his seeds are starting to grow. Toad is glad and relieved he will soon have a garden as good as Frog's, but agrees that it was hard work. =Cookies= Toad bakes some cookies and goes over to Frog's house to share the cookies with him. Toad has made the cookies so delicious that he and Frog at first cannot stop eating them, even when they promise themselves to stop. Frog eventually announces they need willpower to stop themselves from eating all the cookies. Even though Frog puts the cookies in a box, ties up the box with string, and puts it on a high shelf, Toad points out what they can still do to eat the rest of the cookies. Frog eventually opens the box, but this time takes it outside and allows birds to eat the remaining cookies. Even though Frog and Toad now have plenty of willpower, Toad decides to bake a cake next. =Dragons and Giants= While reading a book about knights in shining armor, Frog and Toad are impressed with how brave the heroes in the book are and wonder if they are brave themselves. Despite the mirror showing that they look brave, the friends decide to test their bravery by climbing a nearby mountain. After escaping a hungry snake and narrowly avoiding an avalanche, Frog and Toad reach the top of the mountain, but leave in a hurry after a near-escape from a hawk, each time declaring (with decreasing sincerity) that they are not afraid. Once they arrive back at Toad's house and hide in the closet and the bed, Frog and Toad admit that they are brave enough to have each other as good friends. =The Dream= One day, while Toad is asleep in bed, he has a dream in which he is on stage and wearing a costume. A voice from an unseen character presents Toad as the Greatest Toad in All the World with Frog as Toad's only audience. Toad does every act great (playing the piano, walking on a high wire, and dancing) and while he does these things and asks Frog if he can do them, Frog shrinks in size and admits he could not do them. Eventually, the dream becomes a nightmare when Toad's dancing act has made Frog shrink rapidly to never even be seen or heard. Worried for his friend, Toad prevents the voice from announcing his next act and tries calling out for Frog, only for the dream to end with him spinning in the dark. Toad wakes up from his dream to see Frog in his house, and when they both play together outside, is very relieved that what he experienced was only a bad dream.

The F√∂lene Runestones are two Viking Age memorial runestones which are located near the church in F√∂lene, which is about two kilometers west of Herrljunga, V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of V√§sterg√∂tland. The stones are memorials to two men who were described as holding the title drengr. Vg 153 Runestone Vg 153. V√§sterg√∂tland Runic Inscription 153 or Vg 153 is the Rundata catalog number for an inscription on a granite stone that is 1.6 meters in height. The inscription, which is missing its upper section, consists of runic text in a band along the edge of the stone. It is classified tentatively, due to the missing section, as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the classification for inscriptions with text bands with straight ends that do not have any serpent or beast heads attached. The inscription was first noted with its damage in 1791 as being part of the foundation of the church wall. Before the historical significance of runestones was understood, they were often re- used as construction material for bridges, roads, and buildings such as churches. The stone was removed in 1937 and is located along with Vg 154 near the entrance to the church. The runic text of Vg 153 states that it was raised by a man named Bj√¥rn as a memorial to his son, whose name was on the missing upper portion of the stone. The son is described as being har√æa go√æan dr√¶ng or \\"a very good valiant man\\", using the term drengr. A drengr in Denmark was a term mainly associated with members of a warrior group. It has been suggested that drengr along with thegn was first used as a title associated with men from Denmark and Sweden in service to Danish kings, but, from its context in inscriptions, over time became more generalized and was used by groups such as merchants or the crew of a ship. A similar phrase was used in the inscription on Vg 154. Other runestones describing the deceased using the words har√æa go√æan dr√¶ng in some order include DR 1 in Haddeby, DR 68 in √Örhus, DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 127 in Hobro, DR 268 in √ñstra Vemmenh√∂g, DR 276 in √ñrsj√∂, DR 288 and DR 289 in Bj√§resj√∂, Sm 48 in Torp, Vg 61 in H√§rlingstorp, Vg 90 in Torestorp, Vg 112 in √Ös, Vg 114 in B√∂rjesg√•rden, the now-lost Vg 126 in Larvs, Vg 130 in Sk√•num, Vg 157 in Storeg√•rden, Vg 162 in Bengtsg√•rden, Vg 179 in Lilleg√•rden, Vg 181 in Frug√•rden, Vg 184 in Smula (using a plural form), the now-lost √ñg 60 in J√§rmstastenen, √ñg 104 in Gillberga, and possibly on U 610 in Granhammar. =Inscription= Vg 154 and Vg 153 at the entrance to the church.

Construction The construction contract for the lighter intended for service in Boston harbor, but shortly after trials diverted to New Bedford, was let on 5 March 1907 and builder's trials completed in October with construction having been completed six weeks before stipulated.

It has sections for association football, speed skating and Nordic skiing. It was founded on 21 November 1896 as Meldalskogen SL. The name was changed to L√∏kken IL on 30 March 1898. The name was changed to L√∏kken IF on 26 July 1947 as two clubs merged with L√∏kken IL. One club was IF Thor, founded in 1918 and incorporating the short-lived L√∏kken AIL (1924‚Äì1926). IF Thor was a member of the Workers' Confederation of Sports, but later joined the Red Sport federation. When they did that, a new Workers' Confederation of Sports club was founded by the name SK Fjell in 1930. This was the third club to participate in the 1947 merger. L√∏kken IL was founded as a Nordic skiing club, and also participated in cycling and speed skating. IF Thor concentrated on football and skiing, but also participated in swimming, track and field, cycling and sport shooting. SK Fjell concentrated on skiing and football, and was also a practitioner of swimming, bandy, boxing and race walking, and in 1945 it added handball for women. SK Fjell and IF Thor played each other in a women's football match in 1939, perhaps the first of its kind in Norway. In addition to these clubs, chess was played at L√∏kken Verk, by the club L√∏kken SK. SK Fjell was the dominating club at the time of the merger, while IF Thor struggled remarkably. Notable skiers were K√•re Vaslag and the five brothers Henry, Torger, Kyrre, Egil and Arthur E. Tokle. L√∏kken IL had had many able members, including the World Championships (1938 and 1939 respectively) participants Rudolf Kojan and John Sagvold. Some of these continued after the Second World War. In the 1950 World Championships the now-US citizen Arthur Tokle participated together with Norwegian Vidar Lindboe-Hansen and Swede K√•re Karlsson who together with his brother Evert Karlsson had represented L√∏kken in their youth. The best ski jumper in newer times was Kurt B√∏rset. Vidar L√∏fshus has one World Cup start in skiing. Speed skater Jan Egil Storholt is from L√∏kken Verk. Stig Berge was an able orienteer while orienteering was practiced for a period in L√∏kken. The club has dropped several sports from its roster, and only football, skiing and speed skating is left. The men's football team played in the Third Division, the fourth tier of Norwegian football from 1997 to 2002. The club does not currently field a senior team, only some children's teams. The clubs had good ski jumping hills and good trails for cross-country skiing. On 4 July 1954 L√∏kken IF opened a decent field for football and track and field. In 1997 the track was demolished, as an artificial turf was paid for by the local corporation, Orkla. The speed skating arena is Granatj√∏nna.

Johann Sebastian Bach and ... hard rock\\", saying the song \\"expresses the urgent feelings of our times and deals with such meaningful subject matter as nuclear war, apathy, religious discontent and the underlying confusion of today's generation.\\" The magazine's \\"Spotlight Singles\\" reviewer that week said, \\"With appeal for all programming and buyers, the vital lyric message based upon today's world situation must be heard throughout.\\"Billboard, \\"Spotlight Singles\\", p. 87 The song reflects contemporary topics and anxieties of the times, with references to such subject matter as nuclear holocaust (\\"'Neath the spreading mushroom tree / The world revolves in apathy as overhead, a row of specks (the specks being bomber planes in the sky) roars on, drowned out by discotheques (humankind being so apathetic to the world blowing up that they focus on frivolous things like dancing and partying) And if a secret button's pressed / because one man has been outguessed / Who will answer?\\"), drug use (\\"In the rooms with darkened shades / the scent of sandalwood pervades. / The colored thoughts in muddled heads / Reclining in the rumpled beds / Of unmade dreams that can't come true....\\"), war (\\"On a strange and distant hill / A young man's lying very still. / His arms will never hold his child / Because a bullet running wild / Has struck him down....\\"), divorce (\\"Side by side two people stand / Together vowing, hand-in-hand / That love's imbedded in their hearts / But soon an empty feeling starts / To overwhelm their hollow lives\\"), and suicide (\\"High upon a lonely ledge / a figure teeters near the edge / And jeering crowds collect below / To egg him on with, 'Go, man, go!'\\") culminating in an existential question: \\"If the soul is darkened / By a fear it cannot name / If the mind is baffled / When the rules don't fit the game / Who will answer?\\" The liner notes on the single state that, \\"As music speaks for the times, it also changes with the times. In Who Will Answer? we find contemporary lyrics that reflect the feelings and concerns of today's world. To the music of Gregorian-type chanting, Baroque harpsichord figures and hard rock, Sheila Davis' penetrating poem can hardly be considered of the 'moon- June' variety.\\"Liner notes quoted at (May require long sidescroll on some browsers) The middle stanza is spoken by Ames, rather than sung.

Neue Deutsche Biographie. Erg√§nzungen und Berichtigungen. , ed. Historische Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, April 2010.) was a Carniolan noble from the influential Auersperg family, leader of the defending forces at the Battle of Sisak in 1593. Life and career Andreas von Auersperg was born in the Carniolan town of ≈Ωu≈æemberk (Seisenberg) into one of the leading Protestant Austrian families in the Duchy of Carniola as the youngest son of Wolfgang-Engelbert von Auersperg, Lord of Sch√∂nberg, Seisenberg and Fl√∂dnig, and Anna Maria von Lamberg. After his parents' early demise, the governor of Carniola, Baron Weikhard von Auersperg (1533‚Äì1581), became the guardian of the one-year-old boy. In 1569, the 13-year-old registered at the University of T√ºbingen,Die Matrikeln der Universit√§t T√ºbingen: 1477-1600, ed. W√ºrttembergische Kommission f√ºr Landesgeschichte.

In 1573 and 1574, he also studied at the renowned universities of Padua and Bologna. 150px Andreas became a soldier accompanying Archduke Matthew on his campaign in the Netherlands (1577‚Äì1578), fighting as a captain on the Croatian-Turkish border in 1578 and 1579 under Hans Ferenberger von Auer and Christoph von Auersperg. In 1583 he rose to the rank of colonel and was appointed commander-in-chief (Feldobrist) of the Croatian and Dalmatian frontier lands in Karlstadt in 1589. Battle of Sisak On 22 June 1593, the day of Saint Acacius,Peter von Radics, Die Schlacht bei Sissek 22. Juni 1593 am Festtage des heiligen Achatius, Laibach [i.e. Ljubljana], Blasnik, 1861 the leader of the Ten thousand martyrs, a battle occurred near the fortress of Sisak in present-day Croatia, where the Sava and Kupa rivers meet. It was the last fortress the Ottomans needed to conquer in order to expand northward into central Europe virtually unopposed. Sources reportJoseph von Hammer-Purgstall, Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches.

I, p. 43 f. (Annals of the Turkish Empire: from 1591 to 1659. Transl. Charles Fraser. London: Oriental Translation Fund, 1832), and Austrian sources, e.g. Franz Christoph von Khevenh√ºller (1588-1650), Annales Ferdinandei, Leipzig: Weidmann 1721-1726, vol. IV, p. 1093, that the Ottoman army attacking the fortress was 38,000 strong, commanded by the Bosnian beylerbey (governor-general), Hasan Pasha (born Niko Predojeviƒá). The Carniolan army under the command of the Ban of Croatia, Tam√°s Erd≈ëdy, which was defending the fort counted only 4,000 to 5,000 men led by Andreas von Auersperg and Ruprecht von Eggenberg and reinforced by 1,240 Croatian horsemen and 500 Silesian mounted riflemen. Hasan Pasha attacked with his main force but was repelled by the heavy fire of the defending army. The Turks then retreated to the bridge they had just crossed, but Auersperg sent the arquebusars to capture the bridge. The Ottomans were then forced to swim to the other side of the river. About 8,000 Ottomans died during the retreat, including Hasan Pasha, who drowned in the river. The remaining Ottomans (who were guarding the camp) set their gunpowder on fire and fled. Thus, Auersperg won the Battle of Sisak and saved central Europe from imminent Ottoman invasion, whereupon Pope Clement VIII sent the Protestant‚Äîwho was nicknamed the \\"Carniolan Achilles\\" or even the \\"Christian Achill(es)\\" and called \\"the Terror of the Turks\\"‚Äîa handwritten letter of congratulation.

Powell was educated at Abingdon School. While at school he was in a band called Illiterate Hands, which also featured future Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and Andy Yorke, brother of Thom Yorke. He currently works as Frank Turner's live and studio drummer as a member of The Sleeping Souls and is also a member of the Oxford based alternative rock band Dive Dive. He was formerly a member of Unbelievable Truth. He is endorsed by Pro-Mark Sticks and Sabian Cymbals. Frank Turner and The Sleeping Souls headlined at Wembley Arena in April 2012, and played at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.  The Sad Song Co. The Sad Song Co. is a solo project of Powell that also features bass player Jason Moulster, begun in 2000 in Oxford. Powell took the songs he had been writing for Unbelievable Truth and recorded them for the debut The Sad Song Co. album miseryguts, which was released in 2003. Moulster contributed bass throughout. Following a few years touring with Dive Dive in support of their first two albums Powell recorded his second album Poignant Device. Marillion contributed use of their Racket Studios while they were on tour, and it was completed with George Shilling at his Bank Cottage Studios later that year. By the time of its release in 2007 three quarters of Dive Dive had begun acting as Frank Turner‚Äôs backing band on record and on tour, so there was little opportunity for touring, outside of the release show for the album supporting Marillion at their fan weekend in Port Zelande, the Netherlands. During breaks in touring in 2014 and 2015, Powell wrote and recorded another album titled in amber. After crowdfunding through PledgeMusic, the album was released on August 26, 2016, and he undertook a UK tour in October, between tours with Frank Turner. Another album entitled Worth was released in 2018.

Location K√∂nigsruhe lies in the Hirschgrund (\\"Stag Bottom\\") immediately next to the River Bode, a mountain river that has cut deeply into the surrounding mountains at this point. The footpath along the gorge from Thale to Treseburg runs through the settlement which lies in the borough of Thale. As far as K√∂nigsruhe, the track can be used by motor vehicles from the direction of Thale when required, but is normally closed to traffic. A narrow, stone bridge, the Jungfern Bridge (Jungfernbr√ºcke), crosses the Bode in K√∂nigsruhe. History In 1834 a shopkeeper, Christian Jung from Thale, built a wooden hut with a fireplace in the Hirschgrund in the Bode Gorge. In 1856 another larger building followed, which was sited next to the bridge over the Bode. Initially it was called Hirschgrund. To commemorate the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, who stayed here on 5 May 1834, the extended inn was called Hotel K√∂nigsruhe (\\"King's Rest\\") in 1875. The name K√∂nigsruhe remained until the period of the German Democratic Republic when, for political reasons, the place was renamed Hirschgrund. In August 1994 the Bauer family bought the property and, since 1995, it has once again been given the name \\"K√∂nigsruhe\\". Economy Tourism dominates the economy. A restaurant with a beer garden (Hirschgrund 1) is used by numerous hikers walking the nationally known trails across the Harz region. In addition there is guest accommodation. In K√∂nigsruhe there is a mountain rescue station owned by the Harz mountain rescue organisation which looks after the path to Thale and also has its own rescue vehicle. Places of interest In addition to the impressive nature of the Bode Gorge, local attractions include the Seven Brothers' Rocks (Siebenbr√ºderfelsen) at the exit of the settlement towards Thale and the Jungfern Bridge (Jungfernbr√ºcke) newly erected at the beginning of the 20th century over the Bode.

They are highly conserved genome regions that share 100% identity among human, mouse and rat. UCRs are 481 sequences longer than 200 bases. They are frequently located at genomic regions involved in cancer, differentially expressed in human leukemias and carcinomas and in some instances regulated by microRNAs. The first release of UCbase was published by Taccioli, C. et al. in 2009. Recent updates include new annotation based on hg19 Human genome, information about disorders related to the chromosome coordinates using the SNOMED CT classification, a query tool to search for SNPs, and a new text box to directly interrogate the database using a MySQL interface. Moreover, a sequence comparison tool allows the researchers to match selected sequences against ultraconserved elements located in genomic regions involved in specific disorders. To facilitate the interactive, visual interpretation of UCR chromosomal coordinates, the authors have implemented the graph visualization feature of UCbase creating a link to UCSC genome browser.

He was among the first group of Franciscan missionaries who arrived in the Islands on July 2, 1578. He spent most of his missionary life in the Philippines, where he founded numerous towns in Luzon and authored several religious and linguistic books, most notably the Doctrina Cristiana (Christian Doctrine), the first book ever printed in the Philippines. Early years Juan de Plasencia was born in the early 16th century as Juan Portocarrero in Plasencia, in the region of Extremadura, Spain. He was one of the seven children of Pedro Portocarrero, a captain of a Spanish schooner. Juan de Plasencia grew up during the period known as the Siglo de Oro, a Golden Age when arts and literature flourished in many parts of Spain, among them his native Extremadura. It is not well known when or where he first entered the Order of the Franciscans. Some scholars point at the Convento de Villanueva de la Serena, in Plasencia, while others speculate that he might have traveled to Italy and joined a convent there, at a time when a large part of Italy was under Spanish rule. According to researchers, he took the habit as a young man at the Cloister of Saint Francis in Sorrento, Italy. Life in the Philippines He is believed to have arrived to the Philippines on July 2, 1578, after a stopover in Mexico. As soon as he arrived, he joined forces with another missionary, Fray Diego de Oropesa, and they both started preaching around Laguna de Bay and Tayabas, Quezon, in Quezon Province, where he founded several towns. During the following years they are also credited with the foundation of a large number of towns in the provinces of Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal, such as Tayabas, Caliraya, Lucban, Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Lilio (Liliw), Pila, Santa Cruz, Lumban, Pangil, Siniloan, Morong, Antipolo, Taytay, and Meycauayan.Felix de Huerta, OFM. Estado, geografico, topografico, Estadistico, Historico-Religioso de la Santa y apostolica provincia de San Gregorio Magno,. Binondo, Manila: 1885 p. 71 As a friar, Juan de Plasencia lived up to his pledge, leading a lifestyle devoid of any luxury and in constant contact with the people he was trying to convert to Christianity. He was also known to be a defender of the native population, looking after the poor, ill, or neglected, and standing up for their rights on numerous occasions. He was also very keen on creating primary schools, and requested official sanction for the creation of educational centers where \\"Filipinos could not only learn Christian doctrine, but also reading and writing, and some arts and crafts, so they would become after, not only good Christians but also useful citizens\\", an initiative that was approved by Domingo de Salazar, the first Bishop of the See of Manila (1512‚Äì1594). Written works Juan de Plasencia wrote a number of books designed primarily to promote the understanding of both the Spanish language among the natives, and the local languages among the missionaries, to facilitate the task of spreading Christianity. He acknowledged at an early stage the need of mastering the language of the natives in order to facilitate evangelization, and in a letter to the King of Spain, dated June 18, 1585, he mentioned some of his works to that effect: He is the author of what is believed to be the first book printed in the Philippines, the Doctrina Cristiana, that was not only printed in Spanish, but also in Tagalog, in both Latin script and the commonly used Baybayin script of the natives of the time, and it even had a version in Chinese. Other works attributed to him are the \\"Relacion de las Costumbres de Los Tagalos\\" (1589), that not only helped understand and preserve many of the traditional ways of the local population, but also provided the first form of Civil Code, used by local governors to administer justice. A mystical work which he entitled \\"La Santina\\", was an Opus number on prayer and contemplation entirely done in the Tagalog language so the natives who did not know Spanish could also engage in the spiritual exercises of their teachers. Death Juan de Plasencia died in Liliw, Laguna in 1590.

It opened in 1938 and closed in 1983. History Clacton-on-Sea is the largest town on the Tendring Peninsula in Essex and was founded in 1871. It is a seaside resort that attracted many tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s, but like many other British seaside resorts went into decline as a holiday destination since holidays abroad became more affordable. In 1936 Billy Butlin made moves to create a new holiday camp there, by buying and refurbishing the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. After gaining the support of the local council, construction began and the camp opened on 11 June 1938. During the War years, all the Butlin's camps were requisitioned by the Government. Clacton was originally planned to be used as a POW camp, but it was spared this indignity and was used as a training site for the pioneer corps. However during its occupation, the camp suffered significant damage and substantial repairs had to be carried out to put the camp back into operation. It reopened to the public in 1946. In 1972, the Butlin's organisation was bought by the Rank Group. The Clacton camp was open until 1983 when due to package holidays and changing tastes, the holiday camp was closed and sold to a group of former departmental managers at the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park called Atlas Park. Atlas Park only lasted a year and the land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.

The Popular Christian Movement differed somewhat from other official parties in that it sought ‚Äì and to a degree maintained ‚Äì contact with peasant union organizations. This rallying of peasant support was part of Ren√© Barrientos's strategy of allying the military with the conservative post- reform peasantry. No subsequent military leader has been able to sustain this alliance effectively.

It was based on the successful 1943 Broadway play of the same name. The title comes from Hitler's threat: \\"Today Germany; tomorrow the world.\\"TCM.com. Accessed January 16, 2011. Background The play Tomorrow, the World! opened on Broadway in New York City on 14 April 1943 and closed 17 June 1944 after 500 performances. The opening-night cast included Skip Homeier as Emil and Edit Angold as Frieda, both of whom originated their movie roles in the play, and Ralph Bellamy as Mike Frame, Shirley Booth as Leona Richards and Kathryn Givney as Jessie Frame.IMDB.com, trivia.

He wanted to change the title of the film to \\"The Intruder,\\" but a poll of exhibitors voted him down. Plot Emil Bruckner (Skip Homeier), a young German orphan, comes to live in the United States with his American uncle (Fredric March).

Accessed January 16, 2011. Emil's father, Karl Bruckner, had died after being sent to a concentration camp for opposing the Nazi regime. His uncle, Mike Frame, holds Karl in the highest regard for his ideas, commitment to the ideas of universal peace, and his courage. The Nazis, however, have taught Emil that his father was a coward, a traitor to the state, and committed suicide. Emil believes the lies and mutilates a highly prized painting of his father. All the characters have their unique perspectives and reactions in response to Emil's outlandish display of Third Reich sensibilities and most want to find the good in the boy- especially his loving and very tolerant cousin Pat (Joan Carroll). Emil, however, has other ideas, donning a Nazi armband soon after his arrival. Emil refuses to make friends, spouts propaganda he learned in the Hitler Youth, and seeks to act as a Nazi agent on enemy soil, even attempting to recruit the Frames' German maid to his cause. He's horrified to find out that he's going to be mixing with kids of all backgrounds that he's been taught are inferior and that his teacher, Leona Richards- soon to be his aunt- is a Jew. He goes out of his way to mock a Polish boy and later ridicules the boy when he finds him hanging laundry. After first avoiding a fight, he pushes the boy into the mud from behind, and then slices the laundry line so that the clean linen will fall into the mud as well. When a shy girl sees what he has done he terrifies her into silence with the knowledge that her father is a prisoner of war in Germany, and threatens to have her father hurt. In an ironic moment, Emil is the one who exposes the incident to his teacher: unaware of the American custom of not squealing, he seeks to get his version on the record first and accuse others of lying. The resulting confrontation ends with Emil fleeing the school and scrawling anti-Semitic graffiti against his teacher, Miss Richards, on the sidewalk. Seeking to break the engagement between his teacher and his Uncle Mike, Emile finally provokes her into slapping him (by calling her a \\"Jewish tramp\\") and then attempts to manipulate his Aunt Jessie, whose jealousy of the relationship he had perceived, into an alliance to this purpose, but only forces her to confront her own guilt. Just before his birthday party is due to begin, Emil's cousin- Mike's daughter, Pat- catches him trying to break into a desk where he hopes to find classified documents. Following her to the basement, he attacks her with a fire iron and leaves her badly injured before fleeing the house. His schoolmates eventually apprehend him and bring him home to face the police. Before their arrival, he provokes his Uncle Mike with another threat against Pat, and Leona Richards intervenes to keep Mike from killing him. Alone with Emil, Leona forces him to open one of his birthday presents. Seeing his cousin Pat's thoughtful gift for him finally triggers Emil's first experience of remorse and guilt. Leona urges Mike to offer compassion and understanding rather than send Emil away. As Emil confronts his feelings about his father's death and his treatment at the hands of the Nazis, hope for redemption finally begins to appear and he remains with his new family.

It is one of the Roman Catholic parishes in the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend.  History  St. Adalbert Parish was founded in 1910 as the last of four Polish Roman Catholic parishes located in South Bend, Indiana. Although many immigrants came to this area in a very poor condition their faith spurred them on and led them to the construction of several churches, the largest being St. Adalbert. The mural on the north wall of the church best, painted by John A. Mallin in 1941, epitomizes the humble but determined beginnings of the church. In the mural Polish immigrants are shown constructing and beating their swords into plowshares. Industrial development can be seen in the form of factories in the distance and above the whole scene the people‚Äôs pastor is pointing to a cloud with the fallen Christ under his heavy cross struggling along. This struggle of Christ exemplifies what the Polish people have endured in establishing St. Adalbert‚Äôs. Far above the picture of Christ is a Polish inscription which is translated: ‚ÄúBy the sweat of your brow you have received the bread of life‚Äù On August 7, 1905, the St. Adalbert Fraternal Aid Society was officially organized. The new parish was to be named after St. Adalbert, Bishop and Martyr, with the settlement called ‚ÄúKrakow‚Äù. This group of dedicated organizers made house to house collections to purchase land for the church and school building. The nickels and dimes amounted over a period of time until $402.10 was collected to purchase two lots on Warren and Huron Streets. It was decided through the advice of Rev. Valentine Czyzewski, to purchase land on Olive between Huron and Grace in 1907as the site of construction. By the fall of 1909, the foundation for the building was laid and the present school had its beginning. Funds for the completion of the structure were not readily available, and nearly $8,000 was needed to finish the project. Rev. Czyzewski spearheaded the house-to-house collection, took a census to establish the membership of the new parish, provided spiritual guidance and was the temporary director of organizing the parish. The Most Rev. Herman Joseph Alerding appointed a pastor, Rev. John Kubacki, who arrived on July 2, 1910. Rev. Kubacki seized the opportunity to organize several parish societies and began ministering to the parishioners' spiritual needs while members of the parish began collecting funds for construction of the new parish. Soon thereafter the cornerstone was dedicated on Sunday, September 4. 1910 by the Most Rev. Paul Peter Rhode, the first Polish Bishop in the United States. The first mass was celebrated on October 16, 1910 in the open air, upon special permission for all parishioners to attend, between the two walls of the new church by Rev. Kubacki. Under the leadership of Rev. Kubacki, the men and women voluntarily continued to erect the new Church - Parish School building. The entire building later became the present Parish School and Heritage Center. Fr. John Kubacki celebrates the first mass of St. Adalbert Parish on October 16, 1910. The Parish School was dedicated on September 4, 1911, and the Felician Sisters from Detroit, Michigan opened and staffed the school that same September. Rev. John Wroblewski was the first resident assistant coming to St Adalbert‚Äôs on June 23, 1912. The three original church bells were also installed that same year. At the corner of Huron Street and Olive Street, the Christ statue was dedicated on the occasion of Rev. Kubacki‚Äôs Silver Jubilee on June 19, 1919. Under Rev Kubacki several assistants served the parish. In 1913, Rev John Tarlowski replaced Father Wroblewski. In June 1915 the present rectory was completed and accommodated the following assistants during that period: Rev Herek, Rev Vincent Rozmus, Rev. John Mard and Theophil Chemma. The new parish also had its share of those entering the priesthood with Rev John Wroblewski being ordained in 1912 and Rev. Michael Gadacz in 1917. Msgr. Jan Osadnik celebrates his investiture as Monsignor with parishioners on July 3, 1927. The next Pastor was Rev. John W Osadnik led the parish beginning on February 7, 1920. His forte was being responsible for so many souls and he concerned himself at all times with making them conscious of daily progress in Christian virtue. Bernice Klug became the first parish organist in 1920. Rev Osadnik decided soon after he became pastor that the Church School building was inadequate as a church and school. Therefore, a parish meeting was held in 1923 to discuss the renovation of the original building for a school and the erection of a new church. The official laying and dedication of the cornerstone for the new church took place on July 29, 1923. Due to lack of funds, the work began but proceeded slowly. This was but another example of the continued struggle of the parishioners spurred on by a fervent pastor. The new church, considered the largest and most beautiful in the Diocese was completed in spring of 1926 at a cost of $23,000 and was blessed by Bishop John F. Noll. It originally was built to be the diocese's cathedral, but a new building was then designated, in what was considered a slight to the polish community. Rev. Aloysius Jarka and Rev. John Biernacki served as assistants at that time. In May 1931, a temporary parish hall was erected because the depression caused deep financial stress. The Parish celebrated its Silver Jubilee on Sunday, October 20, 1935. Now a Monsignor, Rev. Osadnik retired on January 23, 1940. He was followed by Rev. Aloysius Jarka appointed by Bishop Noll. Due to illness Rev. Jarka‚Äôs pastorship was short and he passed on September 20, 1943. Another memorable event took place during this era as Rev. Louis Ratajczak became the first parishioner to be ordained on May 26, 1923 by Bishop Aldering. Other assistants serving the growing congregation included Rev. Anthony Nadolny, Rev. Michael A. Petzold, Rev. Augustine S. Kondziela, Rev. Wenceslaus A. Karp, Rev. Michael Urbanski, Rev. Leon Pisula, Rev. John Moskal and Rev. Joseph Zielinski. New ordinations of parishioners continued in 1931 with Rev. Clement Ewald, Rev. Casimir Moskwinski and Rev. Louis Jeziorski being ordained priests. Upon the death of Rev. Jarka, the Rev. Joseph Zielinski was appointed administrator of the parish. On January 27, 1944 Rev. Ignatius Gapczynski was appointed pastor by Bishop Noll. Rev. Gapczynski introduced English sermons on Sundays for the benefit of younger Poles and people of other nationalities. Many improvements were also done to the whole facility during his pastorate. One of the most notable was the liquidation of the parish debt on February 1, 1948. By 1950 Rev. Gapczynski was elevated to the position of Monsignor. Serving the parishioners as assistants under Rev. Gapczynski were Rev. John J Jakubielski, Rev. Andrew C Topor, and Rev. Thomas Depa. It was under Msgr. Gapczynski that Rev. Eugene Kazmierczak served as an assistant beginning on July 4, 1951. Under Msgr, Gapczynski a new power house was added in 1957 and a new Sisters Convent in 1963. The Golden Jubilee was also celebrated in 1960. Through 75 years the school prospered with its enrollment peaking in 1929-30 at 1112 students. Graduates ordained over the years include Rev. Henry Smarcz (2-2-1945), Rev. William Gieranowski (6-9-1949), along with Rev. Thaddeus Olszewski, Rev. Matt Sienkiewicz and Rev. Leonard Chrobot ordained during Msgr. Gapczynski‚Äôs latter years. On July 20, 1964 the Very Rev. Ignatius Gapczynski died and Rev. Kazmierczak was appointed acting pastor. Rev. John J. Moskal was appointed pastor that same year on September 1, 1966. The Rev. Kazmierczak was assigned to Geneva, Indiana. Rev. Moskal remained pastor until 1972. Under Father Moskal, Rev. Matt Kafka and Rev. Thaddeus Kwak served as assistants. On July 1, 1972 Rev. Eugene J Kazmierczak was appointed the new pastor. In June 1972 the parish Hall burned down presenting the first major challenge to the new pastor. In 1973 a Building Committee was formulated and by 1974 the hall and old sisters home was demolished. In April 1974, the Harvest House Program was started and has become to this day a focal point for many senior citizens. Following Rev. Kazmierczak, native-son Rev. Leonard Chrobot served as pastor from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, Rev. Daryl Rybicki arrived as pastor, serving until 2002. In 2002, Most. Rev. John Michael D'Arcy sent Monsignor William Lester to administer the parish until it merged with St. Stephen of Hungary Parish in South Bend. The traditionally immigrant neighborhood of St. Adalbert had become home to new immigrants, Latinos. St. Stephen Parish was home to both Hungarians and Latinos. In May 2003, St. Stephen closed, and the parishioners came to St. Adalbert. With the merger, the parish was entrusted to the pastoral care of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Rev. David Porterfield, C.S.C. administered the merged parish with Rev. Christopher W. Cox, C.S.C. as his associate pastor. On July 1, 2004, Rev. Cox was appointed pastor of both St. Adalbert Parish and St. Casimir Parish, South Bend. Most Rev. Kevin C. Rhoades preaches during the Centennial Mass at St. Adalbert Parish on November 7, 2010. With the retirement of Sr. Dian Majsterek, SSJ-TOF, a lay principal was appointed for the first time in parish history. The school, troubled with financial issues and declining enrollment, had a resurrection with the combined parishes. Enrollment in 2003 was just 93 children, but, by 2010, enrollment had risen to 185 students. On July 1, 2010, Rev. Peter J. Pacini, C.S.C. became pastor of St. Adalbert Parish. The Parish celebrated its centennial on Nov. 7, 2010 with a multilingual mass celebrated by Most Rev. Kevin C. Rhoades and followed by a festive dinner. On July 1, 2016, Rev. Paul M. Ybarra, C.S.C. became pastor of St. Adalbert Parish.  Pastors  * Rev. John Kubacki (1910‚Äì1920) * Msgr. John W. Osadnik (1920‚Äì1940) * Rev. Aloysius Jarka (1940‚Äì1943) * Rev.

As a member of the then-Metrostars (now New York Red Bulls) u-19 side, he reached the North American final of the Super Y-League. The following summer he departed for Europe, having the opportunity to train with Cypriot top flight club AC Omonia. Upon return from Cyprus he made his way into collegiate soccer, joining top-tier Division III side Stevens Institute of Technology. =Stevens Institute of Technology= At Stevens he made 88 starts in four years, with a total of 22 goals in 90 appearances. A two-time all-Metro Region first-team selection, he was named a first-team NSCAA All- American in his senior season 2006, as well as being named Skyline Conference Player of the Year. That senior season he racked up an impressive scoring haul of 9 goals and 8 assists, good for 26 total points and a fourth highest scoring total in the side as a centreback. =Professional era= 2. Cyprus and England trials Upon graduation, Gkionis made the decision to continue his playing career and made a move to Europe, first joining up with MEAP Nisou of the Cypriot Second Division for the 2007‚Äì2008 season. Following a successful season in which he made 23 appearances and scored 3 goals, Niko made the attempt to jump to English football, going on trial with Crewe Alexandra F.C., Accrington Stanley F.C., and Barnsley F.C. Though not securing a contract in the three attempts, Gkionis got a valuable glimpse at the higher levels of the game, and received plaudits from those he attempted to impress. Barnsley manager Simon Davey praised Gkionis' technical ability, work rate, mental awareness, anticipation, and general knowledge and understanding of the game, stating that \\"[Nick] did well to prove to us that he was a player who could play at our level.\\" Move to Belgium For the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Niko eventually landed with R.R.F.C.

More importantly, his play earned him looks from higher- tier clubs in the country, and for 2009‚Äì2010 he saw himself making a two- division jump to the fully professional EXQI League, joining R.F.C. de Li√®ge. He impressed in his opportunities to play for the club, scoring a single goal in 13 appearances, but a change in management and direction in the midst of a relegation fight saw him depart for Excelsior Veldwezelt in the winter transfer window. Playing in the Belgian Third Division B, he made 13 more appearances for the season and scored an impressive five goals for the club. =Positions= His primary positions are as a defensive midfielder or central defender, though he can also play as a central midfielder.

WikEM WikEM is a wiki-based website and point- of-care mobile application for emergency medicine clinicians. WikEM started as a database created from notes and checklists passed from each resident class to the next at the Harbor-UCLA emergency medicine residency program, but is now open to all clinical providers. WikEM was launched in its current form in 2009. WikEM's mobile applications are available in both iOS and Android, allowing for quick mobile usage, as well as offline use in austere environments and disaster situations. It calls itself The Global Emergency Medicine Wiki. WikiLectures WikiLectures is a collaborative project focused on creating and storing medical study materials. It is developed by students and teachers from various Czech and Slovak medical faculties. WikiLectures is part of the project MEFANET, a network linking medical schools in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Editors of WikiLectures take care of promoting the authors, editorial process contributions, technical support, WikiLectures structure and ensure the safety of the project. WikiLectures contain articles, notes, prepared exam topics, guides for practitioners, and study books. WikiLectures are constantly growing. The articles are written by medical students, faculty professionals and doctors. The administration and security is provided by the editorial board.

Defunct =AskDrWiki= AskDrWiki is a medical wiki encyclopedia created by Cleveland Clinic Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson. The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. It was launched in August 2006. The site now holds medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles, of which there are over 2,000 . The purpose of the site was to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to Wikipedia because it runs on MediaWiki software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs in that all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer health-related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up-to-date medical information for healthcare providers. In December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in a British Medical Journal article, \\"How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine\\",\\"How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine\\" as one of the early adopters of using video hosting sites such as YouTube and Google Video to host medical videos.

As a broad concept, it emerged in the context of sports training, in the context of a set of attributes that allow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope with difficult training and difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing confidence. In recent decades, the term has been commonly used by coaches, sport psychologists, sports commentators, and business leaders. There are several factors as to why a positive mentality or mental toughness is a benefactor to success. An elite athlete must be able to handle pressure, have self-belief and avoid lifestyle distractions. They must have that urge to win and know that they have all the capabilities to do anything they desire. This separates good athletes from the elite athletes (Jones et al.,2002).Declan Connaughton,2008. The development and maintenance of mental toughness: Perceptions of elite performers. Journal of Sports Sciences, Issue 1, Volume 26, Pages 83-95. Samples of attributes were taken by Graham Jones to examine differences of success between athletes and which ones possess a strong mentality. It was proven that there were 30 attributes suggesting mental toughness in super elite athlete but only an average of 12 in elite athletes indicating the mental difference to become a super elite performer (Jones et al.,2007). This illustrates how important a positive mentality is for athletes to be successful.  Definition  \\"Mental toughness\\" is frequently used colloquially to refer to any set of positive attributes that helps a person to cope with difficult situations. Coaches and sport commentators freely use the term mental toughness to describe the mental state of athletes who persevere through difficult sport circumstances to succeed. In support of this, a number of studies have linked mental toughness to sporting success or achievement.Cowden, R. (2017). Mental toughness and success in sport: A review and prospect. The Open Sports Science Journal, 10, 1-14. doi:10.2174/1875399X01710010001 However, it is often simply applied as a default explanation for any victory, which is highly problematic as an attribution. Criticisms about the use of this imprecise approach abound (for example, Moran (2012)Moran, A. P. (2012). Sport and Exercise Psychology: A Critical Introduction (2nd ed.). Routledge.). However, within the past 15 years, scientific research has attempted a formal definition of mental toughness as a psychological construct with clear measurement criteria, allowing robust analyses and comparisons to be made. In particular, three research teams have produced both a definition and a construct definition for mental toughness:  Jones, Hanton, and Connaughton  Graham Jones, Sheldon Hanton, and Declan Connaughton of the United States used personal construct psychology in interviews with elite athletes, as well as elite-level coaches and sport psychologists, to arrive at the following definition of mental toughness: * Mental toughness is \\"Having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to: generally, cope better than your opponents with the many demands (competition, training, lifestyle) that sport places on a performer; specifically, be more consistent and better than your opponents in remaining determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure.\\" (Jones, Hanton, & Connaughton, 2002, p. 209). These same researchers published a second paper in 2007, which provided four dimensions (categories) for mental toughness attributes. One general dimension was outlined: a performer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-belief). Three time-specific dimensions were outlined: training, competition, and post-competition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental toughness (such as handling pressure, handling failure and pushing yourself to your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at these times.  Clough and Earle  Peter Clough et al. (2002) proposed a model of mental toughness, conceptualising it more like a personality trait. Their model has four components: confidence; challenge; control and commitment. In initially conceptualising mental toughness and developing the MTQ48 questionnaire measurement tool, the approach taken by Clough et al. (2002) was to combine existing psychological theory and applied sport psychology in an attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice. Clough et al. saw clear comparisons between their emerging mental toughness data and the concept of hardiness, a key individual difference and resistance resource that helps buffer stress and has become an accepted concept in health psychology within the study of the stress-illness relationship. Clough et al. are clear that mental toughness is concept with broad application and should not be limited to the sports domain. They feel that sports specific measures are unlikely to move the field forward in any meaningful ways. The development work relating to their model is fully described and discussed in their book on mental toughness.Clough, P.J. & Strycharczyk, D (2012) Applied mental toughness: A tool kit for the 21st Century. Kogan Page  Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock  Daniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon, and James Dimmock of Australia have proposed a different definition and framework of mental toughness, based primarily on their work with Australian footballers. Using personal construct psychology, these authors proposed the following definition of mental toughness: Although this definition was produced through work with Australian footballers, it has been generalized to other sports, including cricket and soccer. This definition conceives of mental toughness as having both reactive and proactive qualities, meaning that mentally tough players can use mental toughness attributes to help endure and perform well during adverse situations, but can also employ other attributes of mental toughness when the game is going well, to keep them playing at their best.  Studies  Some psychologists have argued that a separate, sport-specific definitions of mental toughness should be developed.Crust, L. (2007). Mental toughness in sport: A review. International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 5(3), 270-290. Retrieved from http://www.informaworld.com/index/934187662.pdf They have highlighted that the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in one sport may differ greatly from the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in a different sport. Differences have been hypothesized between male and female athletes, as well as between \\"team sport\\" and \\"individual sport\\" athletes, but to date, little empirical evidence has shown what these differences are. Sport-specific studies of mental toughness have been conducted in cricket, soccer, gymnastics, and Australian football. These studies have not employed a common framework, although many have used the definition of mental toughness provided by either the Jones et al. study, or the Gucciardi et al. study. Many sports focused studies have employed the Clough model of mental toughness. They have, using samples of athletes, shown a link between toughness, coping, emotional reactivity, psychological skills and performance. One of the few published studies that takes mental toughness out of the sporting domain is based on the 4 'C's model. In this study it was shown that senior managers are tougher than their junior colleagues. Clough and his team are working in a number of areas outside of sport ‚Äì education, health, social as well as occupational to explore the relevance of mental toughness in these areas. In 2019, a study using a personality assessment identified six personality traits of top Division 1 and professional athletes that define mental toughness. This study also highlighted that the traits that make up mental toughness and predict athletic success are some of the same traits seen in the most successful sale professionals. In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes. = Developmental studies = There is an active debate about whether mental toughness is primarily a developed characteristic, or has a genetic basis. Two studies suggest that foundational processes occur during development that allow a person to build mental toughness throughout life. For instance, a study of American soccer players, parents, and coaches found that parents provide a \\"generalized form\\" of mental toughness upon which coaches can build a sport-specific form of mental toughness. A similar study suggested that mental toughness development proceeds first through the development of a tough attitude (strong focus and strong self-belief); upon a tough attitude, an athlete learns how to develop mental toughness attributes needed for training, then for competition. Another study examined the developmental experiences of ten super-elite athletes and found that coaches and significant adults played an important role in mental toughness development through all stages of talent development. Conversely, the work of Horsburgh et al. (2009) demonstrates that genetic and non-shared environmental factors contribute to the development of mental toughness (as measured by the MTQ48), and that mental toughness behaves \\"in the same manner as virtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in behavioural genetic study\\".p. 104 In establishing significant relationships with the big five personality factors of Costa and McCrae (1992), these researchers have also provided evidence to support Clough et al.‚Äôs conceptualisation of mental toughness. Whilst clearly embracing the importance of genetics, Clough clearly acknowledges that mental toughness can be developed.  Similar constructs  Mental toughness has been equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as resilience and hardiness. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness, and researchers have found the two constructs are positively associated with one another.Cowden, R.G., Meyer-Weitz, A., & Oppong Asante, K. (2013). Mental toughness in competitive tennis: Relationships with resilience and stress. Frontiers in Psychology, 7(320). doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00320. However, psychologists define resilience as a positive adaptive process of coping with stress and adversity, as opposed to a collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a personality trait, which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues the use of the term mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013).Tibbert, S. J. (2013). MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND OVERTRAINING BEHAVIOURS Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Victoria University. She reported that \\"the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate curvilinear correlations with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The curvilinear correlations reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.  Measurement  Two instruments have been developed and validated since 2009. Gucciardi and colleagues validated the American Football Mental Toughness Inventory (AFMTI), while Sheard and Golby validated the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). The MTQ48 pre dates these by some seven years. The factor structure of the MTQ48 has been supported by an independent research grouping led by Horsburgh (2009). Dr Lee Crust, University of Lincoln, compared the SMTQ with the MTQ 48 and concluded \\"Both instruments appear to tap the core components of MT but the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure\\". The MTQ48 questionnaire has demonstrable criterion related, construct and content validity. Reliability has been assessed by numerous independent researchers and it has clearly demonstrable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. All component scales exceed 0.70 and the overall measure has a reliability in excess of 0.90. Nevertheless both the construct validity and the psychometric properties of this test have been questioned by Andersen (2011).Andersen, M. B. (2011). Who's mental? Who's tough and who's both? Mutton constructs dressed up as lamb. In: Mental toughness in sport : developments in research and theory. Gucciardi, Daniel F and Gordan, Sandy, eds. Routledge Research in Sport and Exercise Science . Routledge, Abington, Oxon, U.K. ; New York, pp. 69-88. Several other instruments have purported to measure mental toughness, but research has called their validity into question. For example, the Performance Profile Inventory (PPI) developed by Jim Loehr used seven subscales to compute a mental toughness score. The Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI) developed by Middleton and colleagues measures mental toughness using 12 subscales and appears to show strong theoretical evidence for its formation. However, construct validation has only been performed with a narrow sample of athletes, leaving its psychometric properties up for debate.

Johnson, 532 U.S. 782 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case which concerned whether instructions given to a Texas jury were constitutionally adequate to emphasize the mitigating factors in sentencing of mental retardation.. The Texas courts had determined the sentencing instructions were consistent with prior Supreme Court jurisprudence, but the Court in a divided decision reversed, finding the sentencing instructions insufficient. This was the second time Penry's case made it to the Supreme Court. Background In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Penry v. Lynaugh. that Johnny Paul Penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment after finding that Texas' special instruction questions did not permit the jury to consider mitigating evidence involving his mental retardation. On retrial in 1990, Penry was again found guilty of murder. The defense again put on evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments. Ultimately, a psychiatric evaluation, which stated that Penry would be dangerous to others if released, prepared at the request of Penry's former counsel, was cited. Upon submission to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering the same special questions in the first trial. Additionally, the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction on mitigating evidence. The court sentenced Penry to death in connection with the jury's answers to the special issues. In affirming the verdict, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Penry's claims that the admission of language from the psychiatric evaluation violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and that the jury instructions were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider his specific mitigating evidence. Penry's petitions for state and federal habeas corpus relief failed. Opinion of the Court The decision of the Court, authored by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, was in two parts. Firstly, the Court was unanimous in finding that the inclusion of the psychiatric report was constitutional. O'Connor expressed \\"considerable doubt\\" that the psychiatric report \\"even if erroneous, had a 'substantial and injurious effect'\\" on the outcome of the trial. However, the Court split 6-3 on whether the supplemental jury instructions on mitigating evidence were constitutionally adequate; the majority holding they were not. \\"Any realistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental instruction operated would therefore lead to the same conclusion we reached in Penry I,\\" wrote Justice O'Connor \\"'A reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.'\\" Therefore, the case was sent back to Texas for renewed sentencing. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent as to this part of the decision, joined by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Scalia. Thomas explained that he disagreed with the majority \\"...because I believe the most recent sentencing court gave the jurors an opportunity to consider the evidence Penry presented\\". He concluded by attacking the standards the majority used to define proper sentencing instructions, saying the Court was sending \\"mixed signals to the Texas courts.\\"532 U.S. at 809 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Subsequently to this case, the Supreme Court held in Atkins v. Virginia that execution of persons who are mentally retarded is unconstitutional. This functionally prevented Penry from receiving the death penalty, and he would later be resentenced to life imprisonment.http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_offenders_no_longer_on_dr.html The decision was part of a series of decisions on the death penalty, all dealing with the \\"national consensus\\" on the question.Acker, James.

His sister, Niloufer, was born three years earlier. Having earned an Indian School Certificate at Campion School, Mumbai, he moved across the country for a B.Tech. at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, and then across the world, on a scholarship, for an M.C.E. at the University of Delaware. As a systems analyst at Fortune 100 companies such as Ford, the only writing he did was handwriting. A handwriting newspaper column in Detroit analyzed his handwriting, after which the columnist shared his cursive sample with an analysts‚Äô club. They declared his evolved Indian style to be a creative one, suggested he had unusual insights, and recommended that he share them. A few years later, while working in Jacksonville, Florida, he accepted his calling to become a writer. He went back to school for an M.A. in English, with a concentration in creative writing, at the University of North Florida. That made him the rare person with engineering and fiction theses in the United States library system. He taught literature and creative writing at UNF from 1993 to 2003. From 1994 to 2001 he was a fiction and poetry editor at the now defunct State Street Review. In 1999, he became an American citizen. From 2004 to 2008 he was the final judge and presenter of the Page Edwards Short Fiction Award at the also defunct Florida First Coast Writers' Festival. In 2004 he was Visiting Writer in Residence at Augsburg College, Minneapolis. In 2006 he was an artist in residence at Escape to Create, Seaside, Florida. In 2007 he was an artist in residence at the art colony of Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York. And in 2010 Yaddo selected him again. Since 2009, he has led a summer fiction workshop at the UNF Writers Conference. In 2013, he became an Overseas Citizen of India, the closest thing to dual citizenship that India allows. Fracis' fiction found publication in Other Voices (magazine), Chicago; India Currents, San Jose; State Street Review, Jacksonville; The Antigonish Review, Nova Scotia; Weber Studies, Utah; The Toronto Review, Toronto; Ort der Augen, Germany; Writecorner website, Gainesville, Fla.; South Asian Review, Pennsylvania; and Slice Magazine, New York. In addition to letters to the editor in The New Yorker, his literary commentary has been in The Florida Times-Union, FEZANA Journal, and The News India-Times. In 1999, he was awarded the Florida Individual Artist Fellowship in Literature. His collection, Ticket to Minto: Stories of India and America, was a finalist for the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction. In 2001, the book won the Iowa Short Fiction Award and was published by the University of Iowa Press. In 2002, he was awarded a Walter E. Dakin Fellowship in Fiction at the Sewanee Writers' Conference, Tennessee. That year, Ticket to Minto was released in India by Indialog Publications. Its German translation by Thomas Loschner, Fahrschein bis Minto, was released by Mitteldeutscher Verlag at the 2006 Frankfurt Book Fair and selected one of the year's Most Beautiful Books by the Stiftung Deutsche Buchkunst (German Foundation for Book Art). Fracis' themes deal with displacement, alienation, injustice, culture clash, and cross-cultural bridges. These themes reappear in excerpts from a forthcoming novel called Go Home. An excerpt, \\"Distant Vision,\\" was published in Slice Magazine and nominated for a 2010 Pushcart Prize. Another excerpt, \\"Country Roads,\\" appeared in South Asian Review. He is represented by New York literary agent Irene Skolnick, who also represents Vikram Seth (A Suitable Boy) and Joyce Johnson (Minor Characters).

Cloudant scales databases on the CouchDB framework and provides hosting, administrative tools, analytics and commercial support for CouchDB and BigCouch. Cloudant's distributed CouchDB service is used the same way as standalone CouchDB, with the added advantage of data being redundantly distributed over multiple machines. Cloudant was acquired by IBM from the start-up company of the same name. The acquisition was announced on February 24, 2014, The acquisition was completed on March 4 of that year. By March 31, 2018, Cloudant Shared Plan will be retired and migrated to IBM Cloud.  History  Cloudant was founded by Alan Hoffman, Adam Kocoloski, and Michael Miller. The three met in the physics department at MIT where they worked with large data sets from experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In early 2008 their ideas for fixing the \\"big data problem\\" caught the attention of Silicon Valley-based Y Combinator, which resulted in $20,000 seed funding. The company also received an early seed round of $1 million from Avalon Ventures in August 2010. Cloudant was designed for cloud computing, automatically distributing data across multiple servers in addition to scaling the database to accommodate web applications. In August 2010, Cloudant released free BigCouch under an Apache License(2.0). Cloudant offered services including support, consulting services and training. Cloudant delivered their first product in the third quarter of 2010. Cloudant has over 2500 customers for its hosted service as of January 2011.

He wants to find and taste it. =Utmarschen (Marching out)= Brakebein managed to convince the other Trolls to find the Legendary Beer. So they leave their forest and finally reach the coastal town of the pirate Busken. As Busken has many ships, the Trolls decide to attack him. =Piratkriegen (The Pirate War)= The Trolls attack and defeat Busken and take his biggest ship. =Den √Öpne Sj√∏ (The Big Ocean)= The Trolls sail on the ocean and still celebrate their defeat over Busken. They plunder every ship they see and soon everyone is scared of the infamous Trolls. Later the Trolls meet Thor Heyerdal on a little float. Brakebein commands him to tell everything about the Legendarisk √òl. Heyerdal claims not to know anything about it which makes Brakebein very angry. =Das MeerUngeheuer (The Sea Monster)= There is a huge Sea Monster. The Monster is bigger than every ship and eats anything that moves. Brakebein is lying in his bed and hears nothing, which is very uncommon for a ship full of trolls. So he goes out and sees the Sea Monster eating one of the Trolls. Brakebein and his friends beat the Monster and prepare the celebration of their victory. =Essenfest (Eating party)= The Trolls celebrate the victory over the Sea Monster and eat it. =Inni den Grotte (Inside the Cave)= Brakebein spots an Island. The Trolls don't know how to stop the ship and so it hits the coast. Brakebein goes straight into the forest in order to find some Beer, the other Trolls search food at the beach. =PresteFeste (Priest Party)= Brakebein returns from the Forest. He did not find any Beer, but captured two Priests. After having barbecued them, the Trolls leave the island again, still looking for the legendary beer. =Yameeka= The Trolls find another island where the people smoke a peace pipe. The Trolls have much fun with them but Brakebein tires and decides to continue the search for the legendary Beer. =Skogsgjensyn (Returning to the Forest)= The Trolls don't feel like searching the legendary Beer anymore and convince Brakebein to return home.

It stars Yiddish language film actor Moishe Oysher in his only English-language film performance, and comedian Joey Adams (born Joseph Abramowitz), and was directed by Max Nosseck.Brandeis.edu. Accessed January 16, 2011. Synopsis Leo, the main character, is a Holocaust survivor who suffers from total amnesia. When he immigrates to the U.S. he manages to find a job as a hotel desk clerk. When he accepts a drink in the hotel bar, he suddenly starts singing, amazing those around him‚Äîand himself‚Äîwith his magnificent voice. Taking advantage of his gift, he begins singing in nightclubs. Eventually, with the help of a psychiatrist and partly as a result of a blow to the head during a mugging, his memories begin to return, and he realizes that he is the son of a great Jewish Hazzan (Cantor) in Europe. As memories of his parents, who perished in the Holocaust, return to him, he abandons his nightclub career to follow his father's footsteps as a synagogue cantor.IMDB.com. The final scene shows Leo (who now remembers that his real name is \\"David\\") singing during a synagogue service.Shandler, Jeffrey \\"Jews, God, and Videotape: Religion and Media in America, NYU Press, 2009. In one crucial scene in the movie, Leo imagines himself ascending the bimah of a ruined synagogue in Europe, singing the ancient Jewish prayer \\"El male rachamim\\" in memory of all the Jews who died in the Holocaust. By actually returning to the synagogue as a cantor, the film shows how he is restoring \\"the sacred music of a vanquished culture to a living Jewish community.\\" Cast Importance The National Center for Jewish Film notes that this \\"important and virtually unknown independent film\\" is one of the first American movies to focus on the Holocaust. It is one of the films featured in the 2004 documentary \\"Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust.\\" Academy Award-winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman filmed this movie in post-war Berlin, including the remains of the city's Neue Synagogue. The film also includes footage of New York's Rivington Street Synagogue. Response While the historical importance of this film is widely noted, reviews for the film itself were mixed. The 1956 New York Times review was generally favorable, calling it \\"light socko\\" and noting both \\"Runyonesque and Second Avenue overtones.\\" It ends with the description \\"Mr. Adams is no Sir Laurence Olivier but he's an expert at the wise-crack and the fast gag. Mr. Oysher, histrionically a bit heavy, can render a snappy tune or a Hebraic chant with richness. All in all, \\"Singing in the Dark\\" is light 'socko.'\\"New York Times Movie Review, March 8, 1956. Accessed January 16, 2011. The National Center for Jewish Film calls it \\"a quirky mix of 1950s American film genres--the musical, gangster and mystery movie--and the period's fascination with psychiatry. While Jews are not discussed directly, Jewish content is explicit, especially in the popular Yiddish songs (sung in English) and liturgical Hebrew songs.\\" Re-release A newly restored 2011 copy was scheduled for screenings at a number of film festivals in the U.S. and overseas, including the Kulture Festival, Florida State University (March, 2011), the New York Jewish Film Festival (2011), and the Jerusalem International Film Festival (July, 2010).

Selections flow freely into each other, much unison playing between the string instruments is prevalent, and Khalil takes the bulk of the lead ... There's pure wonder and revelation in this music. You'll have to see the film to get the full gist, but without the moving pictures, Khalil's unique music is indeed a moving experience in and of its own accord. Recommended\\".

It is set in Yorkshire, and stars Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Griffiths and James Thornton. The plot came about after Beaufoy was refused permission to make a documentary on electricity pylon painters in Pembrokeshire, and converted the idea into fiction. The script predates that of The Full Monty, but only found a producer in the wake of the earlier film's success. The practicalities of shooting atop electricity pylons, not to mention insurance difficulties, meant that a safer mock-up pylon was made for the actors. This proved unconvincing: Postlethwaite remarked that \\"I don't believe we are up there, and if you don't sell that shot you don't sell the rest of the pylons,\\" and so some material was re-shot on real pylons after training from Electricity Board climbing experts. Around the time of the film's release, the Bedford van converted for use as a camper van‚Äîdubbed \\"the shagging wagon\\" in the film‚Äîwas stolen and burnt out in Sheffield.  Plot  Ray (played by Pete Postlethwaite) is a middle-aged Sheffield father of two, down on his luck. Separated from his wife, his life revolves around his close friendship with his much younger flatmate Steve (James Thornton) and a passion for climbing. One summer, the pair and their loose gang of workers gain illicit, cash-in-hand employment painting the electricity pylons of the Yorkshire Moors. Their deadline is tight and their terms of employment precarious, but both are grateful for money and the opportunity to climb daily. The pattern of life is interrupted by the arrival of footloose Australian backpacker Gerry (Rachel Griffiths). Attractive, and a talented climber, she and Ray fall in love and become a couple despite Steve's apparent interest. Ray harbours some reluctance at Gerry's wild ways, but manages to overcome these to propose marriage. Gerry too is doubtful that her wandering days are over, and wonders if she can live the staid existence on offer, despite her love for Ray. Things come to a head when she and Steve, both clearly affected by the backpacking bug, are caught drinking vodka atop a tall pylon. Abseiling recklessly to face an angry Ray, she and Steve are fired on the spot. In a confrontation, Gerry tells Ray that she cannot commit to the relationship, nor be tied down. Meanwhile, Ray's friendship with an increasingly jealous Steve is also in trouble, and the younger man moves out of the flat, planning his own travels to India. He and Gerry have a brief sexual encounter, but back out when they recognise the wrongs of their actions. Gerry waits on Ray's doorstep, hoping for some form of reconciliation, but is rejected. Upset, and undertaking a solo rock climb, she falls and is hospitalised with serious injuries. As Ray is being told this by an emotional Steve, the pylons are electrified as Ray's gang are still at work, and the crew are lucky to escape without electrocution. This heralds the end of the summer's work, and their elusive paymaster Derek, the electricity company official, arrives on the scene. He is apologetic at the mistake, but cannot say when the workers will receive their pay. The film ends on an uncertain note, with Steve departing for India, a recovered Gerry deciding to return to Australia, and Ray left standing on the Moors contemplating his scant options.  Cast  *Pete Postlethwaite as Ray *Rachel Griffiths as Gerry *James Thornton as Steve *Lennie James as Shovel *Andy Serkis as Bob *Rob Jarvis as Weasel *Alan Williams as Frank  Reception  Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film with a positive review and three stars, particularly pleased by the performances of Postlethwaite and Griffiths‚Äî\\"when you look at them, you always know how their characters are feeling\\"‚Äîand writing that the film was \\"thick with atmosphere.\\" David Stratton of Variety was less complimentary, writing that the film was not \\"in the same league\\" as The Full Monty, was predictable, and despite the efforts of the cast, suffered from \\"less attractive characters, and a rather dull plot.\\" It has a 58% rating on Rottentomatoes.com.

Only one was constructed and flown. Design and development Design work on the Nu.D.38 twin engine light transport began about 1938 and the aircraft was largely completed by 1941, but the first flight was delayed until 1944. Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II, only entering the war in 1945, after the first flight. The Nu.D.38, manufactured by Nuri Demiraƒü in Istanbul, was a high cantilever wing aircraft. The wing, of tapered plan and all aluminium alloy stressed skin construction had a built up main spar and a secondary spar. There were pairs of split flaps inboard of the fabric covered ailerons. The fixed surfaces of the tail unit were also aluminium alloy structures with stressed metal skin. The tailplane, set at the top of the fuselage, was strut-braced from below. Control surfaces were fabric covered, with trim tabs. The fuselage of the Nu.D.38 was an oval cross-section aluminium alloy monocoque, with stressed skin over frames and longitudinal stringers. The crew sat side by side at dual controls in a cabin with side access doors. The passenger compartment seated four, each with their own window, and was accessed through a starboard side door. There was a compartment for luggage or mail in the nose. The Nu.D.38 was powered by two 160 hp (120 kW) Bramo Sh 14-A4 radial engines, mounted to the main wing spar on steel frames. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage. A main shock absorber leg was attached to each of the steel engine frames, braced rearwards by a short auxiliary strut. Legs and wheels were enclosed in fairings. Operational history The Nu.D.38 was first flown on 11 February 1944. No further aircraft were produced.

History Tent business in Palmetto, 1906 Palmetto was founded and established in 1866, when three prospecters discovered silver deposits north of the site. The miners named the camp Palmetto, mistakenly thinking that nearby Joshua trees were a relative of the palmetto tree. A 12-stamp mill was built at the settlement, but not enough silver ore was mined to keep the mill running. Although the town was abandoned at a year later, a revival occurred in 1906 when mines were reopened. People and businesses rushed back to town. Over 200 tents were put up on a town site one-half mile west of Palmetto. A commercial street was laid out with stores, markets, feed yards, restaurants, lumber companies, saloons and doctors' offices. The mines soon declined, and in the autumn of 1906, miners abandoned the town. In 1920, another revival occurred, and a mill was built. The town eventually declined. All that stands today are the remains of old buildings. The Palmetto post office was active from April 24, 1888 until June 7, 1894 and from December 16, 1905 until December 31, 1907.

Born July 16, 1956 in Lviv, Ukraine, Ukrainian sinologist, linguist, educator, journalist, polyglot. Biography Born in Lviv, Ukraine. Educated at the National Ivan Franko Lviv University, the foreign languages department. Also studied Chinese in Moscow and Beijing. Taught English, Italian, Chinese at schools, kindergartens, universities. Activity He developed an original method of teaching foreign languages \\"Language as Textual Gesture\\". This methodical trend was experimentally approbated at Cambridge University, GB, as the only natural method of teaching foreign languages. He is the founder of the first in the world unique multi language theatre \\"Fiesta\\", where children and grown-ups can study several foreign languages simultaneously, starting with Italian+English+Chinese, and adding thereafter other languages one by one: German, Spanish, French etc. He is the author of the first in Ukraine Chinese language textbook \\"Chinese for Grown- ups\\" (2006), which was awarded a laureate prize at the 13th Lviv Book Forum, the biggest international book fair in Ukraine (2006). It is a revolutionary textbook of a foreign language, which contains besides everyday topics and vocabulary, also topics on Chinese religion, Chinese philosophy and Chinese art of love. A separate chapter of the enormous 936 pages volume is dedicated to the Chinese obscene words and phrases used in today's everyday language. The textbook is richly illustrated with rare Chinese colour illustrations. The author believes that besides usual foreign language textbooks for schoolchildren, students and everybody, there also should be textbooks for adults in which all sides and aspects of the language should be represented. His next book was \\"Chinese for Everybody Aged from 9 to 209\\" (2009), a Chinese language textbook, which was nominated among the best books of the year 2009 at the all-Ukrainian competition (this textbook was created together with his son, Derega Roksolan, after a two years' long journey around China, and contains 395 photographs). In 2010 he published the first in the world textbook of the Chinese language for preschoolers \\"The Sacred Signs of Heaven\\", which was awarded a laureate prize at the 17th International Publishers' Lviv Book Forum, Ukraine (2010) and nominated among the best books of the year 2010 at the all-Ukrainian book competition (this textbook was created together with his son Derega Roksolan). In 2006 he published a monograph on educational system \\"The Gospel According to Childhood\\". In this book the author claims the urgent necessity for drastic changes in the schooling system not only in Ukraine, but also in other Western countries. His point is that the main goal of schooling should not be education but spiritual and physical training: first develop body and soul, brains go afterwards. Work (gardening etc.) and play (sports and theatre) must go foremost before reading books or studying special subjects. In 2007-2010 he, together with his son Derega Roksolan, created the first in Ukraine Internet course of the Chinese language on the site High-Way (h.ua). = Books = * ‚Äû–ö–∏—Ç–∞–π—Å—å–∫–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç–∞ –¥–ª—è –¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∏—Ö‚Äù (‚ÄúChinese for Grown-ups‚Äù).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets. College career Drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 18th round of 2004 Major League Baseball draft out of East Coweta High School in Sharpsburg, Georgia, Emaus instead elected to enroll at Tulane University. Playing for the Tulane Green Wave baseball team, he started every game his first two seasons, playing mostly third base and some first base. In 2005, his freshman season, he was named to the All-Conference USA Tournament Team. In 2006, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. In his junior season, he continued to play well -- albeit displaying less extra base power -- at second base, and re-entered the draft, this time being selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the eleventh round. Professional career =Toronto Blue Jays= In 2009, the Blue Jays had also assigned him to play in the Arizona Fall League. By 2010, Emaus has batted .276 in his minor league career, with a .364 on-base percentage, and a .426 slugging percentage, reaching as high 89 games with the Las Vegas 51s of the AAA Pacific Coast League. As a minor leaguer, he has mostly played second base, with a small amount of time also logged at third. A good performance in Arizona, along with his AAA statistics and a solid showing (.978 OPS) for the Blue Jays in spring training 2010, suggested he was a good candidate to become a major league player, but the Blue Jays did not include him on their 40-man roster, thus exposing him to the Rule 5 Draft. The Mets, thin at second base with the disappointing performance and questionable health of Luis Castillo at second base for them in 2011, chose Emaus in the first round of the draft. =New York Mets= Coming to the Mets in this manner, Emaus had to remain on their major league 25-man roster for the duration of 2011, or else be offered back to the Blue Jays. Emaus won the Mets second base competition during 2011 Spring Training. He was the Opening Day starter, making his major league debut on April 1. On April 19, the Mets designated Emaus for assignment. =Colorado Rockies= On April 21, 2011, after clearing waivers, Emaus was returned to the Toronto Blue Jays. However, the next day he was traded to the Colorado Rockies for RHP Chris Malone and a player to be named later. =Boston Red Sox= On January 11, 2012, Emaus was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Less than three months later, on April 4, he was released. =Laredo Lemurs= He subsequently signed with the Laredo Lemurs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball on April 18, 2012. =Return to New York Mets= On April 25, 2012 Emaus signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets to play for the Buffalo Bisons, their AAA affiliate.

It was powered by a Liberty L-12 engine buried within the fuselage which turned a large, four-bladed propeller attached to a ring around the center fuselage. Only two were constructed, with the second being accepted by the Navy for service as an observation aircraft. Development In response to a requirement by the U.S. Navy for light floatplanes capable of being launched off catapults by ships underway, the Gallaudet Aircraft company began development of the \\"D-4\\", based on the earlier Gallaudet D-1. The D-1 was powered by two Duesenberg engines of each and used a clutch mechanism to allow the use of one or both engines. The D-1 made its first flight on 17 July 1916 and despite numerous mechanical difficulties the Army bought four of the improved D-2 versions. In an effort to produce an aircraft with the best possible forward visibility for the observer, Gallaudet developed the D-2 into the unconventional D-4, which placed the observer in the nose, followed by the pilot, with the propeller attached to a ring that circled the fuselage behind the wings. The four blades spun around the fuselage just behind the pilot. Power for the D-4 was supplied by a Liberty engine buried within the fuselage just behind the pilot. A large pontoon was mounted below the fuselage, and small outboard floats were mounted near the tips of the swept-back wings. Operational history Two D-4s were built, serial numbers A:2653 and A:2654. The prototype crashed as result of a failed elevator control during flight testing on 19 July 1918, killing the pilot, Lt. Arthur Souther. The second D4 first flew in October 1918 and was accepted by the U.S. Navy in April 1919. This aircraft was entered in the Curtiss Marine Trophy Race during the National Air Races in Detroit Michigan on October 8, 1922, but had to leave the race after the fifth lap because of a broken propeller. No further aircraft were built, as Gallaudet turned their attention to constructing Curtiss HS-2L flying boats. the D-4 in flight Operators ; *United States Navy Specifications References External links *Photos of D-4 at airminded.net.

It was written by Andrew Green and Maria Brown-Gallenberg. It originally aired on November 7, 2010. The episode title is a reference to the Hannah Montana song \\"I'll Always Remember You\\". The one-hour episode is notable for being the first time Miley Stewart admits her secret to the world that she is Hannah Montana. The episode features three original songs: \\"Barefoot Cinderella\\", \\"I'll Always Remember You\\", and \\"Wherever I Go.\\" This episode is also notable for being the last time that Hannah Montana and Lola Luftnagle are featured in an episode, with Miley Stewart becoming the main focus of the show for the remaining episodes. Plot Miley's boyfriend, Jesse, comes to see Miley, and reveals that he knows Miley's secret, that she is the pop star Hannah Montana. After telling him that he can be her guitarist again, she tries to convince him to not show any affection while she is Hannah Montana, for fear that it is revealed he is cheating on one of them. While performing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jesse kisses Hannah, and Leno calls them America's new sweethearts. After Jesse gets recognized at the pier, he hugs Miley, and this picture is spread across the news, including Leno's show, where he announces Jesse cheated on Hannah. Via text messages from his family, Jesse learns that Hannah fans are growing upset with him, and says to Miley, that as long as there is two of her, he cannot be with her, so they separate. Miley and Lilly's college acceptance letters come in the mail, and Miley finds out she did not get accepted to Stanford University, when Lilly did. Miley drives the 200 miles to Stanford, to find out that though she has the right character and grades, she did not have as many extracurricular activities as Lilly. She becomes more upset when she realizes that she has done plenty of things, but cannot tell because of the Hannah secret. After driving back home, Lilly has the idea to tell the admissions woman that Miley was Hannah's assistant, and that she did do all those things. On the drive there, Dr. Phil appears as a visual manifestation of her overstressed subconscious. Upon arrival, Miley finds out that she needs some sort of proof of employment, and drives back home once more to change into Hannah Montana. When arriving as Hannah, she finds out that a celebrity like herself would be admitted, if she had Miley's grades. After a short consideration to take off the wig, she returns home disappointed. Lilly then opts to stay out of college for a year, until Miley gets in. Jesse then comes over, reconciling with Miley. While in her bedroom, Miley talks to her conscience, which appears as Hannah, about how much her friends and family have had to compromise for her secret. Then again in the house, she sees Jesse and Lilly telling her that they have had to compromise their lives for her. After a talk with her father, Miley looks back at all her Hannah outfits and remembers the great times she has had as Hannah from the beginning of the show. She has made up her mind; she sits down to talk with \\"Hannah\\" again, who bids her one final farewell as Miley thanks her, before finally leaving Hannah behind. She appears on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno again, with something to say. She goes on to say that the eleven-year girl wanting to be a rock star, and to have a normal life, no longer wants to pretend anymore, and takes off her Hannah wig and sings a song as Miley. In a show of support, Robby takes off his manager moustache, and Lilly takes off her Lola wig, and together they say good-bye to their alter egos as well. =Narration= This is the second episode where there is background commentary along with the storyline, the first being \\"He Could Be the One\\". Jason Earles, Moises Arias, and Tammin Sursok narrate the story as Jackson, Rico, and Siena (but do not appear in the actual episode, instead directly addressing the audience) in eight performances. * The episode is introduced with the three as singing mice, each with their traditional character's respective initial on their sweaters, singing to the tune of \\"Camptown Races\\", in an Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, on the kitchen counter. * After Hannah kisses Jesse on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the three perform an electronic song at the pier as silver living statues. * After Miley gets rejected from Stanford, the trio performs a show tune parody. * On Miley's drive back to Stanford, the three sing an old-time song as hillbillies on the car radio. * After Hannah gets rejected from Stanford, they perform another show tune, this time as cats. * After Jesse takes Miley back, the trio appear on a bag of horse feed, where they sing to the tune of the William Tell Overture as cowboys on a wagon. * After Miley realizes what the secret is doing, the three parody Lady Gaga's song \\"Poker Face\\" dressed as jesters. * At the end of the episode, the three sing a lullaby to the tune of \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" as babies, listing all of the people who knew Miley's secret prior to her telling the world: Lilly, Oliver, Jesse, Jake, Siena, and the town of Crowley Corners.

First installed for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the chapel was later moved to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, then re-acquired by Tiffany in 1916 and displayed in his own home. After the chapel was dismantled in 1949, parts of it were sold off; the remaining portions have been on display at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida since April 1999. Description Created in a Byzantine-Romanesque style, the Tiffany chapel consists of complementing interior elements that include a marble and white glass altar in front of six carved arches each supported by two double columns all on an elevated mosaic platform.The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art. The Tiffany Chapel at the Morse Museum. Visitors' Guide, 2011. A cross stands on the altar between two pairs of candles. The reredos displays a pair of peacocks - symbols of eternal life - under a crown in a Favrile glass mosaic. On the left front is the ambo flanked by two candlesticks. Off to the right is the baptistry its front bordered by four columns and its back showing the large colored glass \\"Field of Lilies\\" window repeating the columnar pattern. The globe-shaped baptismal font is sitting on a hexagonal columned base in the center of the baptistry. From the ceiling of the chapel hangs an electrified ten by eight foot emerald glass chandelier in the shape of a cross. Windows in the chapel show Tiffany glasswork built on the mosaic system displaying Christian themes including Christ Blessing the Evangelists and The Story of the Cross. Furnishings include wooden benches. In the museum, the chapel occupies an area. History In 1893 the then- chapel was installed as a showpiece in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building at the World Exhibition. Tiffany reportedly said that \\"his was a chapel in which to worship art.\\" Visited by 1.4 million people it was greatly admired, brought international attention to Tiffany, and won 54 awards. After the fair, it was disassembled and placed in storage. In 1898 Celia Whipple Wallace (1833-1916) bought the chapel for $50,000 for it to be installed in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, then under construction in Manhattan. It was installed in the basement crypt with the intent to be placed in the main church. However, when Ralph Adams Cram took over as architect, the style of the cathedral was changed to \\"gothic\\" and the Tiffany chapel stayed in the basement. It was in ecclesiastical use for about twelve years (1899‚Äì1911)‚Äîthe only time it served as a chapel‚Äîthen abandoned when the choir above was completed, and fell into disrepair. After 1916, Tiffany reacquired it, made repairs and replacements where necessary, and installed the work in its own building on his Long Island estate, Laurelton Hall. After his death in 1933, the estate changed. The Tiffany Foundation dismantled the chapel in 1949 and sold parts of it off. After a fire in 1957 that had destroyed the main building, the remnants of the chapel were in disrepair. They were headed for destruction when Jeannette G. and Hugh F. McKean came to Laurelton Hall to recover its windows and architectural elements for the Morse Museum in Winter Park. Other parts of the chapel that had been sold off were tracked down and bought back, so that the elements of the chapel could be reunited. After an extensive renovation the restored Tiffany Chapel became accessible to the public in 1999. Most of the items are original including the windows, columns, arches, decorative moldings, the altar floor, as well as most furnishings. Non-original parts such as the walls, ceilings, and the floor of the nave are redesigned following descriptions of the installation at Laurelton Hall.

Koppel was born and raised in New-York, where he received a traditional Jewish education. He received a B.A. from Yeshiva University and in 1979 completed his doctorate in mathematics under the supervision of Martin Davis at the Courant Institute of New York University. He spent a post-doctoral year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton before moving to Israel in 1980. He has been a member of the Department of Computer Science in Bar-Ilan University since then.  Computer Science  Koppel is best known for his research on authorship attribution. Together with Shlomo Engelson Argamon and Jonathan Schler, he has shown that statistical analysis of word usage in a document can be used to determine an author's gender, age, native language and personality type. The findings regarding gender generated considerable controversy. In a string of papers, Koppel and colleagues solved many of the main problems in authorship, including authorship verification and authorship attribution with huge open candidate sets. In recent years, Koppel has published several papers in social choice theory, offering (in joint work with Avraham Diskin) formal definitions of a number of concepts, including disproportionality, and voting power the definitions of which had been the subject of controversy. In related work, Koppel and colleagues have shown how the wisdom of crowds could be optimally exploited. Along with Nathan Netanyahu and Omid David, Koppel showed that, using only records of games played by grandmasters, a chess program could be trained essentially from scratch to play at grandmaster level. A program designed by Omid David based on these ideas placed second in the speed chess competition in the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship.  Talmud  Koppel has written two books on the Talmud. Meta-Halakhah showed how ideas formalized in mathematical logic could be used to explicate how the ancient Rabbis understood the unfolding of Jewish law. Seder Kinim is a mathematical commentary on Tractate Kinim, generally regarded as the most difficult tractate in the Mishna. Koppel wrote a monograph on the uses of concepts in probability theory for understanding Rabbinic decision methods. Together with Ely Merzbach, he founded and edited the journal Higayon that is devoted to related topics. Koppel‚Äôs interest in the Talmud is occasionally reflected in his computer science research. He has applied his authorship attribution methods to proving that the 19th century Baghdadi rabbi known as Ben Ish Chai was the actual author of a book for which he did not take credit. Koppel also showed that the Harson collection (), a trove of letters attributed to early Hassidic masters were in fact all forgeries. Koppel has also developed methods for automated authorship analysis of biblical texts.  Political Activism  Koppel has been active in efforts to write a constitution for the State of Israel. He participated in meetings of the Knesset's Constitution Committee under the chairmanship of MK Michael Eitan during the 16th Knesset and prepared the drafts for the committee's work on religion and state. Subsequently, he co-authored a draft of a complete constitution proposed by the Institute for Zionist Strategies. Later, he and Eitan co-authored another complete draft of a constitution. He also wrote legislation, passed by the Knesset in February 2011, requiring full disclosure by NGOs regarding funding received from foreign governments. In February 2012, Koppel founded the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem-based conservative-libertarian think tank.  Business  Koppel is listed as co-inventor of United States patent #7257766 which appears to be substantively identical to the first search patent assigned to Google (United States patent #6526440 and #6725259), but the filing date of which is prior to Google's filing date.  Pashkevilim  Koppel is reputed to be co-author of a series of anonymous parodic pashkevilim‚Äîposters hung in ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhoods.

It was designed by William Burges, who also designed Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. The building opened in 1868 and remains an active parish church. History The foundation stone of Holy Trinity Church was laid on 31 October 1866 by the Right Rev'd John Gregg, D.D., then Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. The town had been growing in popularity as a holiday resort and its original church (dedicated to St. Matthew) was deemed insufficient for the increasing population. William Burges was appointed architect for a new church with a budget of ¬£1,700, of which ¬£500 was subscribed by parishioners and ¬£1,200 given by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The site for the new church was given by Mr. Thomas Hayes of Crosshaven House, \\"who gave a carte blanche to the chairman the Rev'd M. Archall, to go over all his property and select whatever site he chose for the building, and the church would be erected on one of the best fields on his estate.\\" The church was consecrated on Trinity Sunday in 1868, being dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Architecture and description The original design for the church included a substantial tower, its inspiration drawn from the medieval campanile of northern Italy, and this can be seen in an illustration in The Irish Builder from 15 April 1873. The accompanying article spoke of the completion of the tower as fulfilling \\"one of the happiest of architectural compositions it has been our pleasure to describe for a very long time.\\" However, the tower was never built and the church comprises a more modest set of structures. It is however identified by architectural historians as recognisably Burges's work, with J. Mordaunt Crook noting that \\"the smooth plate tracery, the low-slung battered porch, the emphatic string courses: these are all Burgesian trademarks.\\" Mordaunt Crook also notes the interior as \\"measur(ing) up to the quality of the exterior - notably the pelican-dragon corbels of the chancel arch and the stained glass at the East end.\\" References Templebreedy Category:19th-century Church of Ireland church buildings Category:William Burges church buildings Category:Churches in County Cork Category:Church of Ireland church buildings in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Holy Trinity Church, Templebreedy"},{"id":"30499075","text":"Herbard VIII von Auersperg, Freiherr from 1550, Slovene name: Hervard Turja≈°ki (15 June 1528 in Vienna - 22 September 1575 near Budaƒçka on the Military Frontier) was a governor of Carniola supporting Protestantism, and an imperial Habsburg general in the wars against the Ottoman Empire. Life and career Herbard von Auersperg was born into one of the oldest Austrian families at the time when the spreading of Lutheranism was at its fastest, and the danger of the Turkish invasion into the Habsburg lands at its greatest. Herbard's father was Trojan von Auersperg, his mother Anna a Freiin (i.e. baroness) von Egck. After attending the municipal school in Vienna he was sent for several years to the court of Cleve which was among the many European relations of the Auerspergs.Peter von Radics, Herbard VIII., Freiherr zu Auersperg 1528-1575, Vienna, Wilhelm Braum√ºller, 1862, p. 10 1546 he started on his successful military career under Ivan Lenkoviƒá at the \\"Windic\\" border (Upper Slavonian Krajina) and after only two years, hardly 20 years old, was made Captain of the strategically important Uskok centre of Zengg/Senj on the coast of Dalmatia in 1548, and in March 1550 he was made a baron (‚ÄúFreiherr‚Äù). Herbard did have his failures. A major failure, resulting from a lack of courage, happened in 1565 after the new grand vizier Sokolovic ordered his nephew, the governor of Bosnia, Mustafa Sokolovic, to attack Croatia. Mustafa attacked Krupa but due to the heroic 16 day defense of Krupa by the Croatian garrison Mustafa ran out of gunpowder and lead. While Mustafa sent for resupply from Banja Luka, Ausperger with Croatian viceroy Erdody, prince Slunjksi and Peter Farkasic arrived on the west side of the Una with 7,000 soldiers. Only the Una River separated Auersperg's troop and Mustafa. Everyone knew that time was running out before resupply arrived but Auersperger did nothing because he was afraid of the superior numbers of the Turks. Slunjski and Farkasic saw that they had to act and asked Auersperger to give them 1,000 cavalry and 1,000 infantry soldiers with whom they would cross the Una and attack the enemy, Auersperger did not approve this because he was afraid his army would be lost to the superior numbers of the enemy. Another request was made and again denied. Farkasic and Slunjski then decided to go on their own with their own soldiers but even that Auersperg refused. Mustafa received new supplies and made one more assault, greater than any previous, took the fortress and slaughtered everyone. 200px Owing to his bravery and highly successful performance in a battle near Bosnian Novi (1566) on the Una river he was appointed \\"Landeshauptmann\\" (lit. \\"state captain\\", i.e. governor) of the Duchy of Carniola (1566‚Äì75), with his home at Auersperg Castle. Auersberg Castle, Valvasor 1689 As a fervent follower of Luther's teaching Auersperg as governor favoured Protestant teaching in Carniola, befriended and was host to the great reformer Primo≈æ TrubarTheodor Elze (ed), Primus Trubers Briefe, mit den dazu geh√∂rigen Schriftst√ºcken, Bibliothek des Literarischen Vereins vol. 215, Stuttgart, Litterarischer Verein in Stuttgart, 1897, p. 114 and, through his son Christoph von Auersperg, offered sanctuary at Auersperg/Turjak castle to the first translator of the bible into the local language, Jurij Dalmatin. As a renowned pillar of Protestantism Herbard von Auersperg thus opposed strongly the counter-reformatory measures of the Inner-Austrian Court in Graz and resisted the Catholic clerics in Carniola, who were mostly strangers to the land. 1560-63 Auersperg was charged with the responsibility for the defence of the Croat-Ottoman border and the Adriatic coastline, and 1565-69 for the Slovenian borderlands. Following the death of Lenkoviƒá (1569) he rose to general in charge of all the Austrian Military Frontier area in the south- east, but lost his life in September 1575 in a battle at the Croatian border near Budaƒçka fighting greatly superior Turkish forces. Auersperg was beheaded and his cut-off head was jubilantly exhibited on a spear during the triumphal march of the victor Ferhat Beg in Constantinople on 9 November 1575, but later was bought from the Turks by the Auersperg family. Tradition has itJ√°nos Asb√≥th (Johann von Asb√≥th), Bosnien und die Herzegowina: Reisebilder und Studien, Vienna, A.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England (NHLE) as a Grade I listed building, having been designated in 1967. The church is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is about to the southeast of the village on the north side of the B181 road. It stands on the top of a hill overlooking the Lea marshes. The description in the NHLE states it is \\"of outstanding interest as a medieval church with an unrestored 18th-century interior\\". In the Buildings of England series, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote \\"Inside there are few churches in the county which have so well preserved an 18th-century village character\\". History The nave probably dates from the 12th century, and the chancel from the following century. The tower and porch were built in the 15th century, and the northeast chapel was added in 1577. In 1881 a new church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, was built nearer to the village centre and this superseded St James'. Architecture =Exterior= The main building material used is flint rubble with stone dressings. There is brickwork in the northeast chapel and in the east wall of the chancel. Some Roman tiles have been incorporated in the flint walls. The roofs are tiled, and the porch is timber-framed. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel under one roof without any structural division, a northeast chapel, a south porch, and a west tower. The tower is in two stages with angle buttresses at the west corners. At the southeast angle is a projecting octagonal stair turret which rises higher than the tower. In the west wall is a doorway with a three-light window above it. There are two-light bell openings on each side. At the top of the tower is a battlemented parapet and a small lead-covered spire. In the north wall of the nave is a blocked doorway, but no windows. The chapel has a small west door, two two-light windows in the north wall, and a three-light window on the east side. The east window of the chancel also has three lights. There are two two- light windows in the south wall of both the chancel and the nave. All the windows are Perpendicular in style. The south porch is gabled with cusped bargeboards. The lower part of the sides is boarded, and the upper part is open. The south doorway dates from the 13th century. =Interior= The interior of the church is whitewashed. The tower arch dates from the early 15th century. The north arcade has four bays carried on octagonal piers. The circular font dates from the 13th century, and is carried on a 15th century pedestal. The 16th-century two-decker pulpit stands on the south wall. On the east walls of the chapel are Royal arms and commandment boards. In the chancel is a 13th-century double piscina. In the nave are three hatchments, a tortoise stove and box pews. Under the tower arch is a screen which has been made from the former canopy of the pulpit. Part of the former rood screen now forms part of a pew. The north chapel contains a monument to Sir Edward Baesh who died in 1587. It contains the effigies of Sir Edward and his wife, both of whom are kneeling, and carvings of their children, also kneeling. Over the monument is a canopy with a round arch supported on classical columns, with a cornice with his arms. In the north window of the chapel are fragments of stained glass, with parts of Sir Edward's arms, his motto, and other lettering. On the north and east walls are the remains of painted inscriptions. There are brasses in the chancel and nave from the 15th and 16th centuries. Also in the church are wall monuments from the 19th century. The single-manual organ was built in 1871 by Bevington and Sons. There is a ring of three bells. The oldest two are dated 1605 and 1617, and were cast by Robert Oldfield. The other, by John Briant, dates from 1790. External features In the churchyard are six monuments and a tomb, all of which are listed at Grade II. The tomb has three monuments on its top, one in red granite, the other two in white marble. It was possibly originally designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1881 for members of the Buxton family of Easneye. The Rowley Monument, dated 1746 is a limestone tombchest to the memory of James Rowley. Another stone monument dates from the 19th century and is surrounded by traceried cast iron railings. The Hankin Monuments are two limestone tombchests; one dates from the 18th century and the other is dated 1809. The Clarke Monument is also a limestone tombchest; it is to the memory of Joseph Clarke and is dated 1725. Another monument consists of weathered oak timbers dating from the 18th century, with an illegible inscription. The Allen Monument is another limestone tombchest; it is to the memory of William Allen and is dated 1827.

It was founded by Bernard Ashley, an engineer, and his wife Laura Ashley in 1953 then grew over the next 20 years to become an international retail chain. Sales totalled over ¬£276 million in 2000. Its products can be described as quintessentially English.Funding Universe. Company Histories & Profiles: Laura Ashley Holdings plc. On 17 March 2020, the company filed for administration.  History  = Origins = After World War II, Bernard Ashley met Welsh secretary Laura Mountney at a youth club in Wallington, London. While working as a secretary and raising her first two children, part-time she designed napkins, table mats, tea-towels which Bernard printed on a machine he had designed in an attic flat in Pimlico, London The couple had invested ¬£10 in wood for the screen frame, dyes and a few yards of linen. Laura's inspiration to start producing printed fabric came from a Women's Institute display of traditional handicrafts at the Victoria & Albert Museum. When Laura looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help her make patchworks, she found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and she started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953. Audrey Hepburn inadvertently sparked the growth of one of the world's most successful fashion and home furnishing companies. Hepburn appeared alongside Gregory Peck in the 1953 film Roman Holiday, wearing a headscarf. As such a fashion icon, she instantly created a style that became popular around the globe. The Ashleys' scarves quickly became successful with stores, retailing both via mail order and high street chains such as John Lewis. From 1953, Bernard left his city job and the couple began to expand the company, initially named Ashley Mountney Ltd incorporating Laura Ashley's maiden name. Laura designed the prints and Bernard built the printing equipment, so forging a complementary partnership that was to give the company its unique strength throughout the years. Laura remained in charge of design until shortly before her death, while Bernard handled the operational side. Employing staff to cope with the growth of sales, the company name was changed to Laura Ashley because Bernard felt a woman's name was more appropriate for the type of products. = Expansion = The new company moved to Kent in 1955, but the business was nearly wiped out in 1958, when the River Darent overflowed ‚Äì leaving equipment, dyes, and fabrics floating in three feet of water. Turnover rose from ¬£2,000 to ¬£8,000 in 1960, which left them looking for new premises. As the new M4 Motorway had just been built, Laura suggested Wales as there was lots of space, and driving up the new road one weekend, found a suitable house and shop available for a sum below their residual savings in Machynlleth, Powys. The family moved to Wales in 1961, just after the birth of their third child. The first shop opened at 35 Maengwyn Street, which still today trades as an interior design shop, and the Laura Ashley association is commemorated by a small plaque. The family lived above the shop for 6 years before moving to Carno, Montgomeryshire. The Ashleys' first Welsh factory was originally located in the social club in Carno; in 1967 the factory moved across to the village's former railway station. These were crucial times in the development of the company. Bernard had developed his flat-bed printing process to produce 5,000 metres of fabric per week, and in 1966 Laura produced her first dress for social rather than work attire. The long length silhouette became the Laura Ashley trademark. It also was to work successfully in the company's favour, as fashion switched from the mini to the maxi skirt at the end of the 1960s. A newspaper suggested that by donning a Laura Ashley number, women could look as beautiful as Katharine Ross in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 1970s Laura Ashley dresses on display in the Fashion Museum, Bath, in 2013. = Retail shops = The first shop under the Laura Ashley name opened in Pelham Street, South Kensington, in 1968, with additional shops opened in Shrewsbury and Bath in 1970. In one week alone, London's Fulham Road shop sold 4,000 dresses ‚Äì which resulted in the new factory in Newtown, Montgomeryshire. It was the opening of the Paris shop in 1974 which was the first to feature the distinctive green frontage and stripped wooden interior; and in the same year the first USA shop opened in San Francisco. A licensing operation led to the opening of department store concessions in Australia, Canada, and Japan from 1971 onwards. By 1975, turnover was ¬£5 million per year and the company employed 1,000 people worldwide. Laura turned down the offer of an OBE because her husband Bernard was not also offered the honour, but a Queen's Award for Export was accepted in 1977. Turnover reached ¬£25 million in 1979, and a range of perfume was launched. The addition of a home in France enabled Laura to go back to her roots of fabric design, and the company launched its home furnishings collections. By the time of Laura Ashley's death in 1985, the company had over 220 stores around the world, employed over 4,000 people and turned over US$130 million annually. = Public company = Two months after Laura Ashley's death in 1985, Laura Ashley Holdings plc went public in a flotation that was 34 times oversubscribed. That same year, the first store in Japan was opened in Tokyo. Chairman Bernard Ashley accepted a knighthood in 1987, the same year in which the company opened a new factory, called Texplan, for printing fabrics and wallpapers, and launched new child and home furnishings ranges. In the early 1990s, Laura Ashley plc was suffering from a combination of over expansion of its retail outlets and dependence on what had become an overly complex and costly outsourced network of manufacturers. In 1991, American James Maxmin became the CEO at Laura Ashley, aiming to refocus the company on its core business. Over the next two and a half years, Maxmin led a series of changes, addressing problems in manufacturing and logistics that foreshadowed principles of his later book, The Support Economy, co- authored with his wife, Harvard Business School Professor Shoshana Zuboff. One of the most significant initiatives at this time was a strategic alliance with FedEx, forming a sort of proto-federation, aimed at improving distribution for close to 500 Laura Ashley stores. The alliance was established as a 10-year partnership, but it was relatively open-ended, premised on trust. The objective was to be able to supply 99 percent of Laura Ashley's merchandise to customers anywhere in the world within 48 hours. The alliance replaced a legacy system that would route a T-shirt manufactured in Hong Kong to a warehouse in Newtown, Wales, before sending it to a retail store in Japan. In 1992, Maxmin led Laura Ashley to its first profits since 1989, and in 1993 profits were expected to reach ¬£12 million. Laura Ashley plc celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1993, the same year that Sir Bernard retired as chairman and became honorary life president. But in early April 1994 Maxmin abruptly resigned from Laura Ashley, citing major differences with Sir Bernard over strategy. Over the next five years, four individuals were given the Chief Executive role in quick succession in an attempt to find a solution to the growing financial difficulties of the company, during which time the company's bankers became increasingly concerned. A new source of finance was desperately needed, and this was found in 1998 in a new relationship with the Malaysian MUI Group. = MUI Asia management = In May 1998, MUI Asia Limited became a major shareholder in Laura Ashley Holdings plc and under the new management, this world famous international brand was back in profit. Rescued from the receivers in 1998, 58 per cent of the shares are believed to be controlled directly or indirectly by the company's chairman Dr Khoo Kay Peng.The Scotsman Part of the rescue of the parent company involved selling off the United States operations for the sum of $1, the buyer being a company also controlled by MUI. All retail stores were subsequently closed and the Laura Ashley brand is now represented in the USA through its e-commerce business. Laura Ashley experienced several setbacks in the early years of the new century. In October 2002 it launched a ¬£18m lawsuit against L'Or√©al, which manufactured the Laura Ashley perfumes; Laura Ashley was eventually awarded a reduced amount of damages, which however did not even cover the legal costs of the suit. A positive direction seemed to be underway early in 2004 with the establishment of a relationship with Scottish couture designer Alistair Blair, who had previously designed for Dior and Givenchy, and soon afterwards the company posted a profit compared with the loss of the previous year, especially on the back of an expansion of home furnishing sales although clothing sales continued to decline. However, by the end of the year the arrangement with Blair was terminated. Laura Ashley closed its flagship store on London's Regent Street in late 2005 because of rent increases. Despite these issues, profitability seemed to be returning to the company in the years immediately prior to the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Profits for 2005 stood at ¬£6.1 million, and this figure was doubled in 2006 to ¬£12.2 million, representing the strongest performance since the MUI buyout. Both fashion and home accessories were attributed as strong areas for the company at this time. There were some areas of concern emerging as the Global Financial Crisis took hold. The company was criticised in 2009 for price discrepancies, which meant Irish customers were charged more than their UK counterparts for the same items, a situation which Laura Ashley justified. The following year the company was involved in an acrimonious industrial dispute, again in the Republic of Ireland. In 2011 the company was found to be in breach of fair employment conditions in a case raised in Northern Ireland and was required to pay compensation to the aggrieved employee. In 2012 the company responded with complacency to a significant number of negative online consumer reviews, pointing to improving sales and profitability figures, but the Financial Times, perhaps somewhat prophetically, commented \\"Laura Ashley may be right to shrug off online criticism. However, no company can expect to do well for ever. Web reviews, particularly when many persistently repeat the same complaints, may indicate looming difficulties\\". Some signs of weakness in the company were seen when in early 2016 Laura Ashley's Australian operations entered voluntary administration, but they managed to trade out of the difficulties and in the event remained afloat for more than a further two years. There were some changes and pull-backs for Laura Ashley internationally in 2018. Early in the year, the long-standing relationship with Japanese company Aeon was terminated by Aeon due to reduced profitability of their Laura Ashley operations. All 120 stores in Japan closed in September that year. However, as the Aeon relationship was expiring in September 2018, it was announced that the Master Licence arrangement previously with Aeon had been taken up by the large Itochu Corporation which already had diverse interests in the textiles field. Itochu announced that they intended to \\"expand the offering at major department stores [and] specialty stores ... and showcase the appeal of the brand to new customer groups through an official e-commerce site and directly managed shops ... with target retail sales of 8.0 billion yen in three years\\". At the very end of the year, Laura Ashley Australia suddenly went into administration, and when no buyer for the operation was found, all stores across Australia, as well as the online business, ceased operating at the end of 2018. New chairman Andrew Khoo was upbeat at the year's end, looking to expand Laura Ashley's online sales and perhaps later a physical presence in the Chinese market. Setbacks were also experienced in the UK operation. In December 2018 it was announced that 40 stores would close due to poor trading conditions. In February 2019, anticipated poor performance for the financial year was flagged, though an expansion of online sales and hospitality ventures were identified as areas of growth. In August 2019 an expanded annual loss was announced, brought about by declining sales of traditional mainstay products even as new ventures in tearooms and hotels were expanding. In 2020, following the COVID-19 outbreak, Laura Ashley said it would file for administration, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. After struggling for several years, the company blamed its troubles on a \\"significant\\" drop in trade with no end of COVID-19 in sight. As of August 2020 no Laura Ashley store remains open in the United Kingdom with the future of the brand now becoming an online concern.

It was instrumental in setting up the National Youth Orchestra of Ireland and played a leading role in the long-running campaign to establish Ireland's National Concert Hall. In 2007, the association changed its name to Friends of Classical Music. Early years In May 1948 it was announced that a new body, to be known as the Music Association of Ireland, was being set up to promote classical music in Ireland.The Irish Times, \\"New Group To Promote Music\\", 21 May 1948Irish Independent, \\"New music association\\", 25 May 1948 The new association had six objectives: #to further musical education #to improve conditions for composers and musicians #to help establish a national concert hall #to lobby on matters of music policy #to encourage musical groups throughout the country #to organise concerts and lectures. A governing council of thirteen individuals was set up to oversee the running of the association. Among its members were composers, Brian Boydell, Aloys Fleischman, and Frederick May. A small management committee was also appointed comprising Olive Smith, honorary treasurer, and Michael McMullin, honorary secretary. Six months after its formation the MAI had gained only eighty three members. Nevertheless, it immediately began to lobby government for greater financial support for live performances, particularly those given by the Radio √âireann Symphony OrchestraSunday Independent, \\"Those symphony concerts\\", 7 November 1948 In 1950 the MAI undertook its greatest challenge to date when it organised a festival of concerts and lectures to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. For several months, members raised fundsThe Irish Times, \\"Backers for Bach wanted\\", 27 May 1950 and tried to source Baroque instruments, such as a harpsichord, not readily available in Ireland.The Irish Times, \\"An Irishman's Diary\\", 29 June 1950 The festival took place between September and November 1950 in various Dublin venues and featured local and international performers. For instance, English bass, Owen Brannigan, sang in the B Minor Mass, and the principal and second trumpeters of the London Symphony Orchestra were engaged to play the D trumpets in the same work.The Irish Times, \\"Bach bi-centenary commemoration\\", 27 September 1950 While individual aspects of performance were criticised, the initiative was generally welcomed.Irish Press, \\"Concert in memory of J.

It was first described in 2003. A study performed in 2005 found that the compound had specificity for metabolizing 2-AG over anandamide (another cannabinoid ligand) in rat brain presumably by inhibiting the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), which is the primary metabolic enzyme of 2-AG.

Early career during the Revolutionary Wars Born in Troyes on 23 April 1761, Songis des Courbons entered the Royal Artillery corps as a student on 1 August 1779 and became a Second Lieutenant in the 4th artillery regiment on 18 July 1780, and a Captain on 3 June 1787. He took part to the Wars of the French Revolution with the \\"Army of the North\\". When General Dumouriez was appointed commander of the army, Songis des Courbons was second-in-command of the army's 80 high-calibre artillery reserve.Mulli√©. Named interim chief of battalion in 1794, his promotion was made permanent in the 8th foot artillery regiment. Songis was transferred to the \\"Army of Italy\\" the same year,Fierro, Palluel-Guillard, Tulard, p. 1101. displaying exceptional talent and knowledge of his arm, which drew the attention of the army's commander-in-chief, General Napoleon Bonaparte. Songis des Courbons rendered invaluable services during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, at the battles of Salo, Lonato, Castiglione. Impressed by Songis's battlefield performances, Bonaparte obtained for him the rank of chef de brigade (colonel) from the French Directory. A commander of artillery in the French \\"Army of the Orient\\" artillery, Songis des Courbons campaigned in Egypt and Syria taking part to the numerous battles that the French had to give during this expedition. Named commander of the 1st horse artillery regiment in 1798, he displayed an extraordinary activity during the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre, in 1799. The bravery and intelligence he showed on this occasion deservedly earned him the rank of brigadier general. During this campaign, Songis des Courbons spent every minute he could spare studying his arm, earning the rank of general of division in January 1800. He took part to the battle of Heliopolis in 1800 and to the defense of Alexandria in 1801. Returned to France with the army, Songis des Courbons took command of the artillery of the Guard of the Consuls. He became First Inspector General of Artillery and Grand Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1804, then a Grand Aigle (Grand Eagle) of the L√©gion d'honneur the next year. Napoleonic Wars Between 1805 and 1807, General Songis des Courbons served as commander-in-chief of artillery in the Grande Arm√©e, taking part to the army's great victories during the War of the Third Coalition and War of the Fourth Coalition. In 1808, he resumed his duties as Inspector General of Artillery and was created a Count of the Empire, thus becoming a dignitary of the Empire. At the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, Songis retained his position as commander-in-chief of the artillery in the \\"Grand Army of Germany\\". In this capacity, on 11 May, just 10 days before the battle of Aspern-Essling, he was sent on a crucial mission to reconnoiter the Danube river line between Vienna and Pressburg, in search of a suitable crossing location. He then commanded the army's artillery during the bloody struggle at Aspern and Essling.Rothenberg, p. 111. After the battle, Songis was active in coordinating the set-up of numerous French artillery batteries, as Napoleon was preparing another crossing of the Danube and wanted to deploy his batteries in such a way as to deceive the Austrians into thinking that he would cross in the same location as at Aspern-Essling. However, the health of Songis severely declined before he could finish his assignmentHourtoulle, p. 13-15. and Napoleon allowed him to return to France, leaving his command to General Lariboisi√®re. General of Division count Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons died in Paris on 27 December 1810, following a long illness. Recognition During his lifetime, General Songis was rewarded for his military activity. He was created a Count of the Empire, a title for which the letters patent were issued on 1 April 1809, thus making him a dignitary of the Empire. He was also made a Knight of the Iron Crown, a military order in the Kingdom of Italy. On 30 June 1807, Songis had also received the Polish domain of Zelgniewo, in the Bromberg department, as well as an endowment of 30,000 Francs paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia and another of 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand Livre. Additionally, he received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the purchase of a H√¥tel particulier.Gotteri, p. 227. The name SONGIS inscribed on the Eastern Pillar of the Arc de Triomphe (fifth column from left to right, 16th name from top to bottom).

This entity can be seen as the regional equivalent of a clan or a tribe. Some successful ordas gave rise to khanates. While the East Slavic term ordo and later derived term horda/horde were in origin borrowings from the Turkic term ordo for \\"camp, headquarters\\", the original term did not carry the meaning of a large khanate such as the Golden Horde. These structures were contemporarily referred to as ulus (\\"nation\\" or \\"tribe\\"). Etymology Mongol ordo on the move Etymologically, the word \\"orda\\" comes from the Turkic \\"ordu\\" which could mean camp, palace, tent, \\"seat of power\\" or \\"royal court\\". Within the Liao Empire of the Khitans, the word ordo was used to refer to a nobleman's personal entourage or court, which included servants, retainers, and bodyguards. Emperors, empresses, and high ranking princes all had ordos of their own, which they were free to manage in practically any way they chose. The Kazakh language name for a division of an army was j√ºz \\"hundred\\". =East Slavic orda= The word via Tatar passed into East Slavic as orda (–æ—Ä–¥–∞), and by the 1550s into English as horde, probably via Polish and French or Spanish. The unetymological initial h- is found in all western European forms and was likely first attached in the Polish form horda. 'Urdu', the name of a language spoken in the Indian subcontinent, is also derived from this Turkic word.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition 1989th s.v. horde Mongol Empire and Mongolia Ordu or Ordo also means the Mongolian court.Ed. Kate Fleet - The Cambridge History of Turkey Volume 1: Byzantium to Turkey 1071‚Äì1453 (2009), p. 52 In Mongolian, the Government Palace is called \\"Zasgiin gazriin ordon\\". Genghis Khan's encampment. William of Rubruck described the Mongol mobile tent as follows: Ibn Battuta writes: The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia (1911) defined orda as \\"a tribe or troop of Asiatic nomads dwelling in tents or wagons, and migrating from place to place to procure pasturage for their cattle, or for war or plunder.\\" Merriam‚ÄìWebster defined horde in this context as \\"a political subdivision of central Asian people\\" or \\"a people or tribe of nomadic life\\". Ordas would form when families settled in auls would find it impossible to survive in that area and were forced to move. Often, periods of drought would coincide with the rise in the number of ordas. Ordas were patriarchal, with its male members constituting a military. While some ordas were able to sustain themselves from their herds; others turned to pillaging their neighbors. In subsequent fighting, some ordas were destroyed, others assimilated. The most successful ones would, for a time, assimilate most or all other ordas of the Eurasian Steppe and turn to raiding neighboring political entities; those ordas often left their mark on history, the most famous of which is the Golden Horde of the later Mongol Empire. Famous ordas (hordes) include: * the White Horde, formed 1226 * the Blue Horde, formed 1227 * the Golden Horde, a Tatar-Mongol state established in the 1240s * the Great Horde, remnant of the Golden Horde from about 1466 until 1502 * the Nogai Horde, a Tatar clan situated in the Caucasus Mountain region, formed in the 1390s In modern Mongolian language, the form of the word, Ordon is more commonly used throughout Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. Modern Kazakh tribes The term is also used to denote separate Kazakh tribes (or grouping of tribes). In modern day, three different groupings are differentiated: the Younger Horde (junior zhuz) in western Kazakhstan, the Middle Horde (middle zhuz) in central Kazakhstan and the Older Horde (senior zhuz) in southeastern Kazakhstan.

Biography He was born in Stockholm as the son of Gillis Coyet and the brother of Otto and Frederick Coyett; the family was of Flemish origin. He grew up in Falun, but in 1629 his father moved to Moscow and settled there as a goldsmith and master of the Mint. In 1634 his father died. Peter was sent to Amsterdam, attended lessons at the Athenaeum Illustre and moved to Leiden in 1637 to study at the university. He returned to Sweden in 1642 and was appointed as secretary in the chancellery. In 1647 he was sent to Moscow in an embassy. He probably assisted Queen Christina where to bind or buy books from Dutch booksellers.J. R√∂melingh (1986) Een rondgang langs Zweedse archieven, p. 117 Like his brother - the first Swede to travel to Japan and China - Coyet was knighted in 1649, and in December 1654‚ÄìMay 1656 he was sent as an envoy in England. In July 1655 Crister Bonde arrived as ambassador to England and both dealt with Bulstrode Whitelocke on using Swedish ports, but their negotiations during the Second Northern War about the English trade in the Baltic and with Russia seems to have been unsuccessful, although he was knighted by Oliver Cromwell the Lord Protector in 1656. In 1657 he was appointed State Secretary of Sweden and reassigned to Holland to deal with Coenraad van Beuningen and Johan de Witt. He was involved in the Treaty of Roskilde. He also negotiated the breach of the peace with Denmark in the summer of 1658..J. R√∂melingh (1986) Een rondgang langs Zweedse archieven, p. 117 Shortly afterwards he was sent again to the Dutch Republic to persuade the Dutch not to supply weapons to the Swedish enemy, Denmark. In 1660 he met in the Hague with Charles II of England. In 1667 he was involved in the Treaty of Breda between the English and the Dutch, where he died within a few weeks. His remains were sent to Stockholm. Family Coyet was married twice, in 1645 and in 1649; he was wealthy and left behind many estates, farms, books, letters and nine children. One of them was Wilhelm Julius Coyet (1647‚Äì1709).

He also lectured in the Department of Mining at Glasgow Technical College (becoming the University of Strathclyde in 1964.) John Samuel Forrest attended the famous Hamilton Academy schoolScottish Secondary Teachers' Association Magazine, February 1950, feature on Hamilton Academy in the article series 'Famous Scottish Schools' where he won the Dux Medal, Mathematics Medal and the Science Medal, and coming third in the University of Glasgow Bursary Examination of 1925 was awarded the John Clerk (Mile End) Bursary to study Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the university. In 1929 while still an under-graduate Forrest was admitted as a research student in the Science Faculty and awarded the Thomson Experimental Scholarship followed by the Mackay-Smith Scholarship. He also won the Thomson Prize in Astronomy and graduated in 1930 with a double degree, BSc in pure science, with a second class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Career Following graduation Forrest took up his first appointment, as a physicist with the Central Electricity Board, Glasgow, followed the next year (1931) with that of physicist with the Central Electricity Board at London, working on the new National Electricity Grid. His first published paper on the Grid was submitted to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in June 1931, in which month he also attended the Conference Internationale des Grands Reseau Electrique at Paris, with Thomas Allibone. Forrest's third Paper, The electrical characteristics of 132 kV line insulators under various weather conditions was submitted to the IEE in March 1935, and a further Paper, written in 1940, was sent in February 1941, winning the Coopers Hill War Memorial Prize. In 1942 Forrest was elected a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, later becoming one of the founder-editors of the publication, Weather, one of his own Papers appearing in the publication's first volume, 1946. Forrest organized a joint meeting, October 1945, of the IEE and the RMS on the effects of weather on power systems. He continued to write scientific Papers and in 1948 was awarded D.Sc. by Glasgow University. Rising to Directorship of the new Central Electricity Research Laboratory with some 800 staff, in 1960 Forrest was invited to give the Hunter Memorial Lecture and was nominated Chairman of the Supply Section (1961‚Äì62) of the IEE, and in 1963 he gave the third John Logie Baird Memorial Lecture in the Royal College of Science and Technology and was elected President, Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Aberdeen. From November 1963 through to April 1964, Forrest gave a series of thirteen deliveries of the Faraday Lectures, plus repeats for sixth form school pupils, to a total audience of some 35,000. Also in 1964, Forrest was invited to become Visiting Professor at the new University of Strathclyde. By 1966, Forrest had become a member of three of the study committees of the Conference Internationale des Grands Reseau Electrique (and became Chairman of the British National Committee in 1972) and in that year, as President of Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he was invited to attend the meeting of the Indian Association (which became the Indian Science Congress) meeting in Hyderabad in 1967 where he delivered a lecture on the British electricity supply industry. In 1966, Forrest was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1972 elected to its Council. Also in 1972, he was awarded an Hon. D.Sc. by Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. Post retirement Retiring in 1973, Forrest visited Czechoslovakia and in 1975, Bulgaria, and was received by the respective academies and delivered lectures. Also in 1975, Forrest was invited by the Accademia dei Lincei, Italy, to attend an international congress on geothermal energy at which he was invited to chair the conference's final session. In 1976, with another Fellow of the Royal Society, Forrest visited the Japan Academy of Science and touring power stations and research facilities, this followed by a visit to the Egyptian Academy. Forrest was one of the Founder Fellows of the Fellowship of Engineering created in 1976 at the Royal Society and in 1977 he was awarded the Honorary Fellowship of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (which, through amalgamation, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the IEE, had become.)

The region of Northern Epirus, which corresponds to modern-day southern Albania, came under the control of the Greek forces during the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13. However, the subsequent Protocol of Florence assigned it to the newly established Albanian state, a decision that was rejected by the local Greek population. As the Greek army withdrew to the new border, a Panepirotic Assembly was organized by the representatives of Northern Epirus in Gjirokast√´r (Greek: Argyrokastro). Given the fact that union of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the European Great Powers, they decided that only autonomy or alternatively an international occupation would be appropriate for the region. Finally, Georgios Christakis-Zografos, the head of the assembly, declared the independence of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations were ignored, since the Great Powers had rejected self-government within the Albanian state. Following negotiations between Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives in early May, and with the intervention of the Great Powers, the Protocol of Corfu was signed. According to this agreement, Northern Epirus would be an autonomous, fully self-governing part of Albania under the suzerainty of the Albanian prince. However, the Protocol, which recognized the Greek character of the region, was never implemented due to political instability in Albania at that time. Background During the First Balkan War (1912-1913), the Greek Army breached the Ottoman defences in the Epirus front and advanced further north. Thus, after the end of the war Greece controlled the historical region of Epirus.Boeckh 1996: p. 112 However the Treaty of London (May 1913) and the Protocol of Florence (December 1913) awarded the northern part to the newly established Principality of Albania. This area which roughly coincided to the former Ottoman provinces (sanjaks) of Ergiri and G√∂rice, became then known by the Greeks as Northern Epirus ( Voreios Ipiros'). This decision by the European Great Powers was unpopular among the local Greek population. By the terms of the Protocol of Florence, the Greek government was obliged to evacuate its forces from the area to the new Greco-Albanian border line. The Greek government however raised concerns about the evacuation process of the Greek forces, pointing out to the Great Powers that the newly established Albanian state was unable to secure the region immediately.Stickney, 1926: p. 45 In particular the Greek government and the local population feared the possibility of reprisals and atrocities at the hands of Albanian irregular groups. In order to arrange the details of the evacuation with the International Commission of Control, an organization set up by the Great Powers to secure peace and stability in the region, the Greek prefect of Corfu moved to Vlor√´, where the provisional government of Albania was based.Kondis, 1976: p. 123 Meanwhile, the Greek authorities reassured the local Greek population that the Greek government would undertake initiatives to secure for them recognition of minority status and rights in Albanian legislation. The Greek authorities also warned the population of the town of Kor√ß√´ (Greek: Korytsa) that any action against incorporation into Albania would be fruitless. They also insisted that the Greek army would only hand over control of the region to regular Albanian units led by Dutch officers from the International Commission, whereas the Greek forces would fire upon any irregular Albanian bands who attempted to enter the region. Panepirotic Assembly Before the evacuation of the Greek Army began, an assembly of representatives of Northern Epirus, the \\"Panepirotic Assembly of Argyrokastro\\" (), took place on 13 February 1914 at Gjirokaster (Greek: Argyrokastro). Given the fact that unification of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the Great Powers, the assembly decided that they would only accept local autonomy, or failing that, an international occupation. They also declared that the population of Northern Epirus felt betrayed by the official Greek government, which not only refused to provide arms, but also agreed to withdraw gradually in order to allow the Albanian forces to proceed with the occupation of Northern Epirus.Kondis, 1976: p. 124 The Assembly triggered a series of events. Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a former Greek foreign minister and native of the region, arrived at Gjirokaster and discussed the situation with the local representatives. In order to ensure the protection of the local population, Zografos proposed three options to the European Powers for Northern Epirus: full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Prince of Albania, extensive administrative or cantonal-type autonomy with a gendarmerie recruited exclusively among locals, or a period of direct control by the Great Powers for such time until foreign troops could be withdrawn without endangering the local populace.Stickney, 1926: p. 43 The Northern Epirote representatives also demanded formal recognition of the particular educational and religious rights of the local Greek Orthodox population.Stickney, 1926: p. 47 Moreover, for the coastal region of Himara, the Assembly claimed the same privileges and autonomous status it had enjoyed during the Ottoman era.Kondis, 1976: p. 93: \\"Chimara was the center of an autonomous district consisting of seven villages and its inhabitants had often revolted against the Turks\\" On February 22, Zografos sent a note to the representatives of the Great Powers where he addressed the present situation:Pyrrhus J. Ruches. Albanian historical folksongs, 1716-1943: a survey of oral epic poetry from southern Albania, with original texts. Argonaut, 1967, p. 104. The following week a number of cities declared their autonomy: Himara, Gjirokaster, Sarand√´ (Agioi Saranta) and Delvin√´ (Delvino).Stickney, 1926: p. 42 Declaration Picture of the official ceremony of the declaration in Gjirokast√´r, March 1, 1914. Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomousin Greek the term autonomos has a dual meaning, it can mean either independent or autonomous. Republic of Northern Epirus was declared and a provisional government was formed to support the state's objectives. Christakis-Zografos himself became president of the provisional government.Kondis, 1976: p. 125 In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations had been ignored, that the Great Powers had even denied them self-government within the Albanian state, as well as guarantees for the protection of life, property, religious freedom and of their national existence. The proclamation also called upon the Epirotes to make every sacrifice defending the integrity of Northern Epirus and its liberties from any attack whatsoever. The declaration was also signed by the heads of the local Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishoprics: Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, Spyridon of Vela and Konitsa and Germanos of Korytsa. On the day of the declaration, Zografos notified the International Control Commission of his appointment as president of the provisional government and announced that the Epirotes would regard any attempt by the newly founded Albanian Gendarmerie to cross their border as an act of hostility and would resist it. The Autonomous Northern Epirus also included Himara, Delvino, Sarand√´, and P√´rmet (Premeti). On the same day, Zografos sent a telegram to Kor√ß√´ urging the people to follow the example of the rest of the Northern Epirotes.Sakellariou 1997: p. 380 However, on March 1, under the terms of the Protocol of Florence the town surrendered to the Albanian Gendarmerie. The Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, immediately ordered the withdrawal and handover of the nearby region of Kolonj√´ to the Albanian units, before the population could join the uprising too. As a result, bishop Spyridon, who planned to become the head of the autonomy movement in this region, was arrested and expelled by the Greek authorities.Kondis, 1976: p. 127 In his speech on 2 March, Zografos concluded that the Northern Epirotes, after five centuries of Ottoman occupation, would not accept the destiny which the Powers had imposed upon them.Boeckh 1996: 114 The following days Alexandros Karapanos became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Dimitrios Doulis Minister of War of the provisional government. Doulis, a native of Northern Epirus, had earlier resigned from his post as a Colonel of the Greek Army and joined the revolutionary forces of Northern Epirus.Stickney, 1926: p. 44 The Northern Epirote army reached the number of 5,000 men from the first days of its formation. The army's core consisted mainly of former members of the Greek Army, some of whom were of local Epirote ancestry. With the support of irregular volunteer units it reached a total manpower of approximately 10,000. Reactions =In Greece= Paris Peace Conference of 1919, by the exiled provisional government of Northern Epirus The Greek Army continued with the evacuation of the region, but the process slowed down out of fear that a hasty withdrawal might offer the opportunity to irregular bands to carry out atrocities against the civilian population.Kondis, 1976: p. 129 As the official position of the Greek government towards the uprising was that of strict neutrality, Prime Minister Venizelos ordered the blockade of the port of Sarand√´ and prohibited a demonstration in Athens in favor of the uprising. However, it cannot be doubted that the Greek government sympathized with the demands of the Northern Epirotes. In fact, the only way for Venizelos to stop the uprising would have been to declare martial law in the region, but this action would have caused major political instability and the possible resignation of his government.Kondis, 1976: p. 126 The opposition parties in Greece even accused Venizelos of going beyond what was required of him to comply with the decision of the Great Powers, and instead of simply evacuating the districts, he was handing them over to the Albanians and depriving the Epirotes of any means of resistance.Kondis, 1976: p. 128 =Diplomatic and military developments= On the other hand, the Albanian government, unable to deal with the Northern Epirus movement, requested that the Great Powers take measures. The Albanian government claimed that although the Greek Army was evacuating the region, it was being replaced by guerrilla fighters organized by the Greek authorities. Meanwhile, on March 7, 1914, Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania and immediately ordered the Dutch colonel Lodewijk Thomson to negotiate with the Northern Epirote representatives. Thompson met with Karapanos on March 10, and proposed a limited local administration for Northern Epirus under a Christian governor in addition to guarantees of religious and educational rights. Thompson's initiative was dismissed by the Northern Epirote side. On April 11, Epirote revolutionaries took control of Kor√ß√´, but four days later the Albanian Gendarmerie, led by Dutch officers, recaptured the city. As a result, the Dutch arrested and expelled the Greek Orthodox bishop Germanos, since they had proof that he was the chief instigator of the uprising, as well as other members of the town council.Kondis Basil, 1976, Greece and Albania, 1908-1914 p. 129-130: \\"Albanian gendarmerie under the command of Dutch Major Shneller managed to crush the revolt and to restore order. The Dutch, having proof that Metropolitan Germanos was chief instigator of the rising, arrested him and other members of the town council and sent them to Elbasan.\\" After the complete withdrawal of the Greek Army from the region on April 28, conflicts between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmes broke out in several locations.Boeckh, 1996, p. 115Stickney, 1926: p. 46 Intense fighting occurred in the region of Cepo, north of Gjirokast√´r, where Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Northern Epirote forces.Miller, 1966, p. 519 On the other hand, the Epirotes managed to advance and gain control of Erseka and further advanced on Frash√´r and Kor√ß√´.Kondis, 1976: p. 130 By early May, the Albanian authorities, being unable to suppress the movement in Northern Epirus, became willing to start discussions with the intervention of the International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations.Stickney, 1926: p. 49 The latter, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 7, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis and accepted the proposal. Thus, an armistice was ordered the next day.Kondis, 1976: p. 131 Aftermath Picture of the negotiations that led to the Protocol of Corfu. The representatives of both sides met for negotiations in Sarand√´, but the final negotiations took place in the nearby island of Corfu, Greece.Stickney, 1926, p. 48 Finally, on May 17, 1914, the representatives of Northern Epirus and Albania signed an agreement that granted the chief demands of the Epirotes and became known as the Protocol of Corfu.Stickney, 1926, p. 50 According to this agreement, Northern Epirus, which consisted of the regions surrounding the cities of Gjirokast√´r and Kor√ß√´ would be an autonomous, fully self- governing part of Albania under the suzerainty of the Albanian prince.O' Brien, 2008: p. 65-66 In general the Protocol recognized the Greek character of the region and the Greek language acquired an official status there, next to the Albanian one. The main demands of the Northern Epirote government were accepted. However, a number of issues were not granted, in particular the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language in the regions around Vlor√´ and Durr√´s (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of the autonomous area and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war. However, the Protocol was never implemented due to political instability in Albania.Sakellariou, 1997: p. 387 On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus. \\"Greek troops crossed the southern Albanian border at the end of October 1914, officially reoccupying all of southern Albania, exclusive of Vlora, and establishing a military administration by 27 October 1914.\\" The Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it accomplished its mission.Miller, 1966, p. 522 In 1916 due to the developments of World War I Italian and French troops evicted the Greek army from the area.Stickney, 1926, pp. 57-64Miller, 1966, p. 537 In 1921 it was finally ceded to Albania, while the Albanian Prime Minister recognized a number of the Greek minority's rights, which were soon ignored. As a result, most of the Greek schools were forced to close and Greek education was allowed only in certain areas. References Sources * *Tara Ashley O' Brien.

National Families in Action co-founded the Addiction Studies Program for Journalists with Wake Forest University School of Medicine in 1999. This effort is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as is the Addiction Studies Program for the States, which began in 2005. The Treatment Research Institute and the National Conference of State Legislatures became two additional partners for the states program. Both programs seek to provide a basic understanding of the science that underlies drug abuse and addiction to help journalists write more scientifically accurate stories about drugs and to help lawmakers and executive branch administrators implement more effective drug policies in their states. To further educate the public about the impact of addictive drugs on the brain and behavior, the program's directors wrote False Messengers: How Addictive Drugs Change the Brain.David Friedman and Sue Rusche, False Messengers: How Addictive Drugs Change the Brain, Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1999. In 2003, with a $4.2 million grant from Congress and the Corporation for National and Community Service, National Families in Action created the Parent Corps via a pilot program conducted in 19 schools in nine states. The program received a no-cost extension to operate for a fourth year through 2007. Principals report that with Parent Corps in their schools, positive communications with parents doubled, student attendance and grades increased, and student discipline problems and drop-out rates decreased.Comments reported by six Parent Corps principals at the Annual Parent Corps Conference, Washington, D.C., June, 2006. U.S. Representative John Lewis introduced the National Parents Corps Act in the 111th Congress.H.R. 3075, 111th Congress. The bill would make the Parent Corps a permanent institution in the effort to protect adolescents from high-risk behaviors that endanger their health, safety, and well-being. In 2010, National Families in Action launched But What about the Children, a public policy campaign to educate citizens about 12 provisions that must be contained in any law that legalizes marijuana to ensure that, if legalized, marijuana will not be marketed or sold to anyone under age 21. In 2014, Marijuana Studies Program, a project of National Families in Action and its partners, introduced The Marijuana Report.Org that links browsers to daily news coverage of the marijuana issue.

It originally appeared on the solo album The Paul Simon Songbook. It is the B-side to the hit single \\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\\".Eliot 2010, p. 289. It is included in the The Graduate (soundtrack) album and was additionally released on the \\"Mrs. Robinson 'EP'\\" in 1968, together with three other songs from the The Graduate film: Mrs. Robinson, Scarborough Fair/Canticle, and The Sound of Silence. Background and composition The song was written in 1964 while Paul Simon was in England. Its lyrics use the changing nature of the seasons as a metaphor for a girl's changing moods. The inspiration for the song was a girl that Simon met and the nursery rhyme she used to recite. It is the shortest song on the album. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G Major with Paul Simon's vocal range spanning from D3 to D4. On the duo's recording, Art Garfunkel sings the lead vocals. Release and reception In the February 1968 release of the soundtrack for the movie The Graduate, the song appeared (in a different version) as the seventh track. It is featured in a pool scene in the movie, and was used as a rhythmic guide for the editing of the film.Eliot 2010, p. 91. Reviews for the song were generally positive. Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic wrote: \\"The sense of yearning in this song would later be beautifully echoed in one of the Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme masterpieces, \\"For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her.\\" Like that song, it is very brief, yet the shortness of the song adds to the effectiveness and economy of both the lyric and melody.\\" Other Uses The song was used in an episode of Parks and Recreation (season three, episode 9), during the wedding between April Ludgate and Andy Dwyer. It is played in The Simpsons episode 18 of the twenty-third season while Bart and Shauna are hanging out together.

The warrant enables the supplier to advertise the fact that they supply to the royal family, thereby lending prestige to the brand and/or supplier. In the United Kingdom, grants are currently made by the three most senior members of the British royal family to companies or tradespeople who supply goods and services to individuals in the family. Suppliers continue to charge for their goods and services ‚Äì a warrant does not imply that they provide goods and services free of charge. The warrant is typically advertised on billboards or company hoardings in British English, letter-heads and products by displaying the coat of arms or the heraldic badge of the royal personage as appropriate. Underneath the coat of arms will usually appear the phrase \\"By Appointment to...\\" followed by the title and name of the royal customer, and then what goods are provided. No other details of what is supplied may be given.  History  Twinings of London is one of the many well-known suppliers granted a Royal warrant. Pictured: Twinings' Ceylon Orange Pekoe Tea with details of a Royal Warrant included on packaging The granting of royal patronage or royal charter was practised across Europe from the early Medieval period. Initially, however, royal patronage was mainly granted to those working in the arts. Royal charters began to replace royal patronage in around the 12th century. The earliest charters were granted to the trade guilds, with the first recorded British royal charter being granted to the Weavers' Company in 1155 by Henry II of England.

Under a Royal Warrant, the Lord Chamberlain appointed tradespeople as suppliers to the Royal household.

Palliser, D., \\"The Trade Gilds of Tudor York\\", in Crisis and Order in English Towns 1500-1700, Peter Clark and Paul Slack (eds), Oxford, Routledge, 2013, p. 92 A royal warrant sent a strong public signal that the holder supplied goods of a quality acceptable for use in the Royal household, and by inference, inspired the confidence of the general public. At a time when product quality was a public issue, a royal warrant imbued suppliers with an independent sign of value. By the 18th century, mass market manufacturers such as Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton, recognised the value of supplying royalty, often at prices well below cost, for the sake of the publicity and kudos it generated.Applbaum, K., The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning, Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127 Royal warrants became keenly sought after and manufacturers began actively displaying the royal arms on their premises, packaging and labelling. By 1840, the rules surrounding the display of royal arms were tightened to prevent fraudulent claims. By the early 19th century, during the reign of Queen Victoria, the number of royal warrants granted rose rapidly with the granting of 2,000 warrants.Heald, T., A Peerage for Trade: A History of the Royal Warrant, Royal Warrant Holders Association, 2001 Since 1885, an annual list of warrant holders has been published in the London Gazette.

High profile food and beverage suppliers with a royal warrant include Cadbury; Twinings of London; Bollinger; Fortnum & Mason; Heinz; Tanqueray Gordon & Co and Schweppes. Non-food suppliers with royal warrants include: Aston Martin; Land Rover; Jaguar cars; Boots; Axminster Carpets; Paragon China; The Irish Linen Company and Yardley of London.  Organisation  Queen Elizabeth II to Jenners, a department store in Edinburgh The Royal Warrant Holders Association, in Buckingham Place, London (2011) Warrants are currently granted by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales. Warrants issued by the Queen Mother automatically expired no later than 2007, five years after her death. Royal Warrants are only awarded to tradesmen, such as carpenters, engravers, cabinet makers, dry-cleaners, even chimney sweeps. Some are well-known companies; many are not. The professions, employment agencies, party planners, the media, government departments, and \\"places of refreshment or entertainment\\" (such as pubs and theatres) do not qualify. Today, some 850 individuals and companies, including a few non-UK companies, hold more than 1,100 warrants to the British Royal Family. The Royal Warrant signifies there is a satisfactory trade relation in place between the grantor and the company and that the goods nominated are suitable for supply to the Royal household. Within the company, there is a nominated person called the grantee. That person is in all respects responsible for all aspects of the Royal Warrant. It takes at least five years of supplying goods or services to the member of the Royal Family before a company is eligible to have its application considered for recommendation. That application is then presented to the Royal Household and goes to the buyer who makes its recommendation for inclusion. It then goes in front of the Royal Household Warrants Committee, which is chaired by the Lord Chamberlain, which decides whether to accept the recommendation. It then goes to the grantor, who personally signs it. The grantor is empowered to reverse the Committee's decision, and therefore the final decision to accept or withhold a grant is a very personal one. Some Royal Warrants have been held for more than a hundred years. Goods need not be for the use of the grantor. For example, cigarettes were only bought for the use of guests of the Royal Family, but these warrants were cancelled in 1999 as a matter of public policy.BBC News, \\"Royal Warrant Stubbed Out,\\" 7 February, 1999, Online: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/274100.stm For business, the granting of a Royal Warrant is a huge boost, because royal approval may be displayed in public with the coat of royal arms of the grantor, implying that their services or products are of high quality. Applbaum, K., The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning, Routledge, 2004, pp 126-127 Most warrant holders are members of the Royal Warrant Holders Association, which liaises closely with the palace.

Early life Born in Buxton, Derbyshire, he was brought up on the family farm in Buxworth. He passed his motorcycle test at the age of 16, having learned to ride his father's 1914 Bradbury motorcycle and sidecar combination. He attended New Mills Grammar School. He gained his bachelor's degree, master's and D.Phil. at Brasenose College, Oxford. Association with Walter Hooper While at Oxford, Marchington befriended and later lodged with American Walter Hooper, the last personal secretary of the writer C.S. Lewis. Through this relationship Marchington shared a lectern with Hooper in 1975 in North Carolina, co-wrote the script of Through Joy and Beyond (the 1977 documentary life of Lewis), and created the Lewis bonfire hoax letter, sent to Christianity and Literature in 1978. Career Marchington began his career as a product manager with ICI Agrochemicals in 1983, becoming marketing manager for South America in 1986. In 1988, he started several companies in the areas of intellectual property, drug discovery and biotechnology. As these expanded, in the same year, under his tutor Professor Graham Richards, Marchington co-founded Oxford Molecular Ltd. (later to become Oxford Molecular Plc.). Worth ¬£450 million at its peak, it was eventually sold for ¬£70million. A former member of the Department of Trade and Industry's Competitiveness Advisory Group, from 2000 Marchington's entrepreneurial activities included: running Marchington Consulting, based at the Sheffield Bioincubator; CEO at Savyon Diagnostics; and co-founded, as chairman and director, Venture Hothouse Ltd. From 2010, Marchington was CEO at Oxford Medical Diagnostics; leading the development and application of advanced proprietary methods of gas analysis; and in particular, the development of breath analysis for the screening of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Marchington was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1997 and was an honorary fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Steam preservation =Buxworth Steam Collection= The Iron Maiden at the Great Dorset Steam Fair, 2007 A steam fan from a young age, aged 22 Marchington bought his first steamroller from haulage contractor and scrap dealer Ted Eansworth in Chesterfield. The collection that he started with his father eventually became the Buxworth Steam Group, which comprised a full working Victorian fair, and raised revenue through offering them for hire: *25 traction engines, including the famous showman's engine The Iron Maiden, which starred in the film of the same name. *Two matched pairs of ploughing engines *Two steam wagons *Six steamrollers *Road locomotive, built in 1900, which was the first armour-plated vehicle in the world *Steam fire engine *Seagoing steam tug *Victorian fairground rides: 1893 Steam Galloping Horses, a Helter skelter, a Ferris wheel, cakewalk, a 1925 set of German-built Chair-O-Planes *Wall of Death, with 1930s Indian motorcycle Marchington's Buxworth Steam Group was the star of the 1985 BBC documentary 'A Gambol on Steam', which featured his first steam rally in the group, hosted at Lyme Park, and featured exhibits from names such as Fred Dibnah in addition to his current collection of a 1904 Fowler D2 steamroller and his pair of Fowler BB1 ploughing engines ('Fame' and 'Fortune') and was one of the largest rallies of its time. =LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman= Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman at Doncaster, while under the ownership of Dr Tony Marchington In 1996, Marchington bought the famous LNER steam locomotive Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman at a cost of ¬£1.5M. After a three-year restoration which cost an additional ¬£1M, she returned to steam in 1999. She made an appearance on Peak Rail in summer 2000, together with most of the Buxworth Steam Group collection. In 1997, Marchington purchased LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern from the family of Geoff Drury, which he also based at the Southall Railway Centre. However, after the completion of the ¬£1 million over-budget restoration of Flying Scotsman was complete, he sold Bittern in 2000 to Jeremy Hosking, who moved her to the Mid- Hants Railway in Hampshire in January 2001, for a major restoration. Despite this, the ownership of both Bittern and Flying Scotsman meant that he is still the only ever private owner to own two Gresley Pacific class locomotives. With Flying Scotsman's regular use on the VSOE Pullman, in 2002, Marchington proposed a business plan, which included the construction of a 'Flying Scotsman Village' in Edinburgh, to create revenue from associated branding. After floating on OFEX as 'Flying Scotsman Plc.' in the same year, in 2003 Edinburgh City Council turned down the village plans, and in September 2003 Marchington was declared bankrupt. This resulted in the sale of most of the assets of the Buxworth Steam Group, including The Iron Maiden to Graeme Atkinson, who displays the engine alongside a collection of other engines and fair organs as part of the Scarborough Fair Collection, at his holiday park in Lebberston, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. At the company's AGM in October 2003, CEO Peter Butler announced losses of ¬£474,619, and with a ¬£1.5M overdraft at Barclays Bank, stated that the company only had enough cash to trade until April 2004. The company's shares were suspended from OFEX on 3 November 2003, after it failed to declare interim results. With the locomotive effectively placed up for sale, after a high-profile national campaign it was bought in April 2004 by the National Railway Museum in York, and it is now part of the National Collection. Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in the Channel 4 documentaries A Steamy Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman, directed by former Blue Peter presenter Simon Groom. Personal life Marchington met his second wife Caroline after he and his father offered her a lift on their steam engine to the Devonshire Arms, Peak Forest, the local public house on the A6 road, where they were staying that night. The couple had two children, and family homes in Buxton, Derbyshire and Oxfordshire. He also had two children from a previous marriage. His passion for vintage restoration continued with his family for the rest of his life, even post the sagas of Buxworth Steam Group and Flying Scotsman. After meeting Jim Daniel, the Grand Secretary of the United Grand Lodge of England, at a dinner of Brasenose College members, Marchington was initiated as a Freemason at Oxford-based Apollo University Lodge number 357 in January 1991. He was passed and raised the following year, and went into the chair in November 1996. Marchington celebrated his installation as Worshipful Master of the Lodge with the commissioning of a set of limited edition glass tankards, engraved with the square and compasses on one side and the Flying Scotsman on the other. Marchington joined a number of other Masonic Orders, including the Holy Royal Arch, the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine, the Order of Mark Master Masons, and the Royal Ark Mariners. He was appointed a Provincial Grand Steward for Oxfordshire in 1997, and became Oxfordshire's Assistant Provincial Grand Master in 1998. After a long period of treatment, Marchington died of cancer at Buxton's Cottage Hospital on 16 October 2011.

The regular line-up of Sascha Konietzko, Lucia Cifarelli, Jules Hodgson, Andy Selway, and Steve White was joined by a handful of musicians from other industrial and alternative metal acts. The album took about twice as long as usual for the band to produce, and underwent a significant amount of modification during its recording. WTF?! reached No. 8 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Its first single, \\"Krank\\", hit No. 15 on the Billboard Singles chart, while its second, \\"Amnesia\\", hit No. 3 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Critics were generally very positive about the album, and while some felt the album was relatively creative, most felt it stayed close to the same formula the band had used for years. Background Band leader Sascha Konietzko first mentioned a new album that would feature \\"a slew of guest musicians\\" in March 2010. Former collaborator Bill Rieflin returned to help with WTF?!, and Koichi Fukuda also added guitar work. William Wilson, who had previously performed vocals on \\"Day of Light\\", and Free Dominguez, of the group Kidneythieves, were brought in as guest vocalists for one song apiece. In an interview in September 2010, Konietzko said the new album would be named Zilch. A remixed version of \\"Rebels in Control\\" was made available on the band's website in December 2010 as a show of support for WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange, and was streamed more than 75,000 times in two days. The name of the forthcoming album was also revealed to have been changed to WTF?! around the same time. Production Konietzko explained in an April 2011 interview that the album had taken fourteen months to complete, about twice as long as usual. He said that everything on the album \\"went through a grinder, was then re-constituted and went through a whole process of re-birthing yet once again\\", adding that every single component of the album was redone at least once. Konietzko also commented before the album's release that due to the significant time difference between his location (Hamburg, Germany) and the rest of the band (on the United States west coast), \\"I take my rest and they work, so it's like we get two full work days in a 24 hour frame.\\" The song \\"Panzerfaust\\" marks the first time the band has written a song with Italian lyrics, and is a translation of \\"Liebeslied\\" from the band's 1990 album Na√Øve. The song \\"Death and Burial of C.R.\\" is lyrically based on the English nursery rhyme \\"Who Killed Cock Robin\\". The song \\"Vive La Mort!\\" includes the lyrics \\"aces and eights\\", a reference to Wild Bill Hickok's last hand. Release The concept for the album cover was conceived jointly by Konietzko and longtime band associate and cover artist Aidan \\"Brute!\\" Hughes. Hughes stated that he achieved an appearance similar to the angelic look of Renaissance paintings of the Madonna with the artwork. The album's first single, \\"Krank\\", was released March 8, 2011, and debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Singles Chart. WTF?! was released on April 26, 2012, and reached No. 8 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart on May 14, 2011. It also debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic Album chart. The song \\"Amnesia\\" was released as a single on May 22, 2012. It peaked at No. 3 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts in mid-July. The band toured North America in support of the album in August 2011, with Wilson accompanying the band as a guest vocalist. A longer tour of Europe took place in October and November. Reception WTF?! received very positive reviews, with critics split over whether the album broke new ground compared to previous releases. Some felt the album explored new musical territory. Trey Spencer of Sputnikmusic praised the album and the band's creativity, saying KMFDM had \\"stepped outside of their comfort zone by ... opening up to a little experimentation.\\" William Dashiell Hammett of COMA Music Magazine was strongly complimentary, saying, \\"The level of musicianship and creativity shown on this album is breathtaking.\\" Most critics felt KMFDM stayed close to its usual sound on WTF?!. David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, \\"The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF?!\\" He went on to say the album was \\"an outstanding blast of dark dancefloor destruction\\" and saying the album should be on \\"the top shelf\\". Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't \\"break new creative ground\\" on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the \\"heaviest, fastest or most experimental album\\", it was \\"still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments\\". Ilker Y√ºcel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a \\"hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual\\". He concluded his review by saying, \\"In short, it‚Äôs KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all.\\" Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, \\"WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person\\". He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, \\"This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist.\\" Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! \\"a solid release bursting with power and determination\\". She also said of KMFDM, \\"musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is not a bad thing\\".

Towers was in charge of radio broadcasting at the USDA from 1952 to 1974, where he developed agriculture- related programs for broadcast on American radio networks. He retired from the USDA in 1974 and what had been a hobby of remastering rare recordings, primarily of jazz groups, became a second career. He used techniques such as manually scraping imperfections such as pops and hisses from reel-to-reel tapes with an X-Acto knife. He lived in Hyattsville, Maryland and, from 1991, in Ashton until he died at age 96 in 2010 in nearby Rockville from Parkinson's disease. He was survived by his wife of 70 years, Rhoda Sime Towers, and two daughters and was predeceased by a son.

His first notable work was when, as young extension service employee, he and fellow jazz aficionado Richard Burris made an amateur live recording of Duke Ellington and His Orchestra at a concert in Fargo, North Dakota in 1940. Towers saw Ellington live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and, when Burris learned Ellington would be in Fargo in 1940, he asked the William Morris Agency, Ellington's agent, for permission to record the session. Permission was granted to the two provided they receive permission from Ellington and the venue's manager before the show. Towers recounted to the Washington Post that, \\"We had a disc recorder that the extension service used for recording farm programs for agricultural colleges. It was advanced equipment ‚Äî up to snuff\\". The recording was not officially released but circulated in bootleg form from the 1960s. In the 1970s, Towers made a reproduction of the recording from areas of the groove that were less worn. In 1978, Towers' master of Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live was finally officially released by Book-of-the-Month Records as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Towers later said, \\"When Dick and I recorded this Fargo performance, we did it just for the excitement and pleasure of it all.

Thomas (1918‚Äì1998) was a professor of English at Brigham Young University (BYU) as well as the founder of BYU's honors program and later the academic vice president of BYU. Thomas studied at Reed College in Oregon. It was here he saw the benefits of a small college with close interaction between students and faculty. Thomas went on to receive an M.A. from the University of Oregon and a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University. He joined the BYU faculty in 1951. After joining the BYU faculty Thomas convinced Ernest L. Wilkinson and other administrators to form the honors program. When the honors program was formed in 1959 he was appointed its director. In 1963 Richard D. Poll was appointed the associate director to assist Thomas. In 1965 Richard L. Bushman became a second associate director. Thomas ended his term as head of BYU's honors program in 1967 when he became academic vice president. Thomas retired from BYU in 1983. Among students who Thomas had a significant influence on while at BYU were John W. Welch, Allen E. Bergin, and Madison U. Sowell. The story of the BYU honors program and the role of Robert Thomas in founding it is recounted in detail by Kristine Hansen in A History of the Brigham Young University Honors Program: The First Fifty Years (BYU Press, 2012). Thomas was a literary critic. His article, published in 1972, A Literary Analysis of the Book of Mormon (published in a book edited by Charles D. Tate and Truman G. Madsen) was the first significant published work to engage in literary analysis of the Book of Mormon instead of debating its origins.Micahel Austin, \\"The Brief History and Perpetually Exciting Future of Mormon Literary Studies\\", Mormon Studies Review, Vol. 2 (2015), p. 67 Along with Bruce B. Clark Thomas co-authored the five-volume series, Out of the Best Books. He also wrote multiple articles that examined the literary qualities of the Book of Mormon. Thomas was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served in various calling in the Church including as a bishop, stake president and president of the Australia Melbourne Mission. The BYU Honors program offers a scholarship named for Thomas. A collection of Thomas' speeches, edited by Daryl R. Hague was scheduled to be published by BYU Studies in 2011. BYU also has a Robert K. Thomas professorship in the J. Reuben Clark Law School which was held by John W. Welch beginning in 1996. Notes Sources * *Wilkinson, Ernest L. and Leonard J. Arrington, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years.

As a child, only 5 years old, Alfonso Noel Lovo, saw a 48 bass red HOHNER accordion in the window of Libreria Lehman, in San Jose, Costa Rica, while on Christmas shopping, and he asked his father, to buy it. They went inside, and the salesman showed him the notes of Silent Night. Another salesman suggested to sell a smaller size accordion for children, but Lovo, wanted the one in the window. A couple of days later, on Christmas Day, it mysteriously appeared under the Christmas tree. He surprised his parents, by playing the notes of Silent Night, that the salesman had showed him, only two days before. Professor Julio Max Blanco, started trying to teach him music theory, back in his native Nicaragua, in January, 1957. Lovo learned to play songs before he could read the notes. And Professor Blanco said, \\"He can play by ear alone, I give up.\\" Lovo started playing accordion at the Colegio Calazanz, grammar school, at church functions. He learned to play harmonica with Father Caudelli, with the Cub Scouts, an instrument he still plays, in blues style. At school he also sang at the Calasanz Choir, later at the Colegio Centroamerica, boarding school in Granada, Nicaragua, with the Jesuits, he self-taught Hammond B2 organ, and Piano, during long punishment hours in solitary confinement at the music room, since Lovo had become rebellious, and hard to manage. There he created his first Piano composition: 'In the Woods of the Moon', that is recorded in his first 'Terremoto' album later in New Orleans, at Knight Recording Studios. The accordion was left alone when he picked up the guitar, that he learned from his home gardener, and guitar player, Adan 'Bienvenido' Jaime, then called the Nicaraguan Elvis, who showed him how to play Elvis Presley songs, Nicaraguan and Mexican rock ballads, popular in the early 1960s. He got his first guitar from his uncle 'Chalito', in his native town of Leon, and he learned songs from Enrique Guzman, and The Teen Tops, and from Polidecto Correa, and Los Polimusic, one of the first Nicaraguan Rock Bands. This band featured as drummer, Jose 'Chepito' Areas, future founding member of the Santana Band, famous for opening the Woodstock Rock Festival. Lovo met Chepito Areas playing in the Half Time of a high school basketball game, and it was to be a lifelong musical friendship. He started playing in a rock band, with Ricardo Palma, and Adan Torres, as co-founders of Los Rockets in 1963 and then co-founded Los Juniors, with Emilio Ortega, in 1965. Both Palma and Ortega, were the top lead guitar players of the Nicaragua rock movement in the 1960s. He also played with Edmundo Guerrero, a local guitar master of the Bossa Nova Brazilian jazz style. Lovo was hijacked on a LANICA airline flight out of Miami, where he almost lost his left hand due to bullet wounds. Lovo survived and later regained the use of his hand.La Nacion, Costa Rica, December 13, 1971Miami Herald December 13, 1971 In Managua, he produced the first Rock Concert, Concierto Idolo, at the Teatro Nacional Ruben Dario, in 1972, with an all star band, the members of the best known rock and jazz groups, in Nicaragua. The photo taken at the opening act, playing Mazurka in guitar, appears, as front cover of his album La Gigantona, widely acclaimed, in the tropical jazz category, in Billboard, on November 2012. He is one of the original exponents of Nicaraguan Latin Rock. He recorded an album, Terremoto Richter 6.3 in 1973, in New Orleans, while going to school at L.S.U., Baton Rouge, LA. It is a fusion of Nicaraguan-style classic Spanish guitar with New Orleans Jazz and Gospel. His main instrument is guitar, but also plays bass, and keyboards, as well as harmonica. He collaborated in his home town with Chepito Areas, the original percussionist with Santana Band. This connected him with that band. Together they produced the Managua Earthquake Relief concert featuring Mario Moreno AKA 'Cantinflas' in October 1972. After the Nicaraguan Revolution, Lovo moved to the USA. In New Orleans, he got deeper into the blues guitar, influenced by New Orleans musicians and Louisiana blues-men. In Miami, in the late '80s he recorded the song Freedom Fighters with his band \\"Wolf and The Pack\\". This song, is a mixture of rock and politics, earned him an invitation to perform at the White House.Miami Herald, August 10, 1987 The Miami Herald front-paged the band, then known as Alfonso Lobo and Wolf and The Pack, which led to TV interviews with CBS, NBC, ABC and Univision. The Miami PBS Channel 17, WDNA, dedicated a documentary program directed by Don Webb, to a Lovo interview and featured clips from the network coverage. In Patrick Carr's book Sunshine States, the author titled chapter 7 \\"The King of Contra Rock\\" and dedicated it to Lovo. Lovo released La Gigantona, privately, in 2010, featuring acid Latin jazz music, with an all-star Nicaraguan band, including percussion by Areas. The Chicago-based record label The Numero Group released Lovo's La Gigantona album to the public, in the fall of 2012. The reissue was sourced from a rare acetate and includes extensive liner notes on Alfonso Lovo, including historical photos of his musical background. Since its re- release, La Gigantona has been a success and Lovo has been the subject of many reviews and interviews worldwide, including praises from BBC music critic Gilles Peterson radio personality in London, Relix Magazine, Dusted Magazine, Radio Nacional de Colombia, and many more international stations, and several TV shows. La Gigantona has become a well-known name, and in November 14, it reached # 4 in Billboard, Tropical music category. A new version of Wolf and The Pack has been formed in Miami, with Latin jazz players, and new performances have been seen up to the end of 2012, of La Gigantona, considered a dormant hit record, that has been awakened by Numero Group, the reissue label from Chicago. On June 14, 2014, Lovo was invited to perform at the Rio Loco Festival, in Toulouse, and drew 28,000 fans, performing an updated version of his La Gigantona, his well-known album, with Jose 'Chepito' Areas of Santana Band fame, and a group of Cuban and Venezuelan musicians, and appeared in the French press, as his style, considered a fusion of psychedelic rock and Latin Jazz, is gaining popularity in Europe, Asia, and also in the USA. Lovo, was also featured in Relix Magazine, in 2 occasions, on 2015 and 2016, in the magazine's CD sampler. On May 20, 2016, Lovo performed at the Teatro Nacional Ruben Dario with an all star Nicaraguan Band, Alfonso Lovo Band, which included Chepito Areas, and a 12 piece band. An anthology of all his music was presented, and there was a documentary made of the event. Later on June 3, Lovo and his band on a smaller sextet format, performed in Madrid, Spain, and the iconic club Sala El Sol, and later on June 5, at the Auditorium, of the Escuela de Abogados de Bilbao, in Bilbao Spain. Several interviews, including one by Gladys Palmera Radio, with a Video of performing a live version of Flamenco Immigration Blues, at the Duque de Alba Palacete in Madrid. Lately, Lovo, gained more notoriety by his Flamenco Immigration Blues, that has really become an important to denounce the immigration situation in the border in the USA. KIQI 1010 AM Radio in San Francisco one of the most heard Latin stations in California interviewed Lovo in December 2016. Lovo just released a new song called Buckingham Palace Dreams, in the US, already in the air. He is active and creating up to this moment. At the present time, December 26, 2016, Alfonso Lovo Band is # 1 in the Blues Category in the Miami FL Reverb Nation.

Construction and service  Louise No. 2 was built as a civilian schooner- rigged pilot boat of the same name in 1900 by Ambrose Martin at East Boston, Massachusetts. She was a replacement for the ill-fated Columbia No. 8, that washed ashore at Sand Hills in Scituate, Massachusetts in the great 1898 Portland Gale. On 10 September 1917 the U.S. Navy acquired her under a free lease from her owner, the Boston Pilots Relief Society, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was enrolled in the Naval Coast Defense Reserve on 15 September 1917, delivered to the Navy on 19 September 1917, and commissioned on 20 September 1917 as USS Louise No. 2 (SP-1230) with Ensign John M. Watson, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the 1st Naval District in northern New England and based at Boston, Massachusetts, Liberty III served for the rest of World War I as a pilot boat in Boston Harbor as she had in civilian use, guiding inbound and outbound ships through the defensive sea area of the Port of Boston. The Navy decommissioned Louise No. 2 on 14 January 1919 and returned her to the Boston Pilots Relief Society the same day. On December 9, 1924, the pilot boat Louise, No. 2, was withdrawn from service and replaced with the pilot boat Pilot. On July 15, 1925, the pilot boat Louise was sold to W. R.

He became Commissioner-General of the Adelsverein after the resignation of John O. Meusebach. Early life Hermann was born around 1818 in Offenbach am Main, Hesse-Darmstadt, to Johann Balthasar Spiess and his wife Luise Werner Spiess. The multi-lingual elder Spiess had been instrumental in founding the Offenbach public school system, and was a musician, pastor and writer. The family was well-connected. Hermann's brother Adolph was a tutor to Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels. Adolph was involved with the 1833 Frankfurter Wachensturm attempt to overthrow the government. When events caused Adolph to flee to Burgdorf, Switzerland, he took young Hermann along. Hermann returned in 1835 and enrolled in the Gymnasium in Darmstadt, where he met Ferdinand Ludwig Herff. The same year, he enrolled in the University of Giessen but was expelled for 2¬Ω years because of student political activity opposing the university's administration. He spent the expulsion period enrolled at Polytechnic Institute in Karlsruhe. In 1842, he returned to the University of Giessen and passed his exams. From 1842‚Äì1845, Spiess worked for the Woods and Forests Commission in Darmstadt. He then took a two-year leave of absence. Texas =Bettina= Spiess, Ferdinand Ludwig Herff and Gustav Schleicher founded the Socialistic Colony and Society, or Die Vierziger (the Society of Forty), which originally had plans to establish socialistic communes in Wisconsin. Spiess and Herff were approached in Wiesbaden by Adelsverein Vice President and Executive Secretary-Business Director Count Carl Frederick Christian of Castell-Castell, who made a deal with them to colonize two hundred families on the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant territory in Texas. In return, they were to receive $12,000 in money, livestock, equipment and provisions for a year. After the first year, the colony was expected to support itself.King (1967) p.122 In 1846, Herff and Spiess emigrated together to the United States via New York City. From there, they traveled by railroad to Wheeling, West Virginia, and by stage coach to New Orleans. They then boarded a ship to Galveston. Spiess went to New Braunfels, and Herff went to Indianola at the end of April 1847 to await the arrival of the other colony members. John O. Meusebach and Spiess chose the location for Bettina in 1847 on the banks of the Llano River. The commune was named in honor of Bettina von Arnim, an early feminist activist and a personal friend of the Meusebach family.King (1967) p.121 The majority of the Bettina settlers arrived in August 1847. Jacob Kuechler was one of the notables at the commune. Bettina failed after the Adelsverein funding expired, and due to conflict of structure and authorities. Some members moved to other Adelsverein settlements in Texas. Others moved elsewhere, or returned to Germany. =Commissioner-General of Adelsverein= In 1846, John O. Meusebach designated Dr. Friedrich A. Schubbert the director of the colony at Fredericksburg, recommended by Henry Francis Fisher.Morgenthaler (2007) p.55 Unknown to Meusebach at the time, Schubbert's real name was Friedrich Armand Strubberg. He changed his name after fleeing two duels, one in Germany and one in New York City.King (1967) p.126 On arrival in Texas in 1844, he used the alias Dr. Friedrich A. Schubbert. He and Henry Francis Fisher worked in tandem to entice immigrants away from the Verein settlements to the St. Gabriel colony he had established in Milam County.Solms (2000) p.131 In Fredericksburg, Schubbert instigated a failed coup d'√©tat against Meusebach.King (1967) pp.106,107 On July 12, 1847, Meusebach sent Schubbert a letter of dismissal from his position as director of Fredericksburg, appointing Jean Jacques von Coll as his successor. After a duel with Schubbert (Strubberg) trying to oust him from the Nassau Plantation, two men were shot. The State of Texas tried Spiess, and he was acquitted on September 27, 1848, on grounds of self-defense. With the finances of the Adelsverein on the verge of collapse, the administration of Fredericksburg and Indianola was ended. Spiess continued the Verein activities of New Braunfels. In 1848, Spiess, Ludwig Bene and Louis Cachand Ervendberg established the Western Texas Orphan Asylum. In 1850, Spiess joined others to construct a toll bridge across the river in New Braunfels. Personal life and death In 1851 Spiess married to Lena Spiess. The couple had ten children. Spiess owned property at Waco Springs, four miles north of New Braunfels, where he built a sawmill and a shingle mill. In 1867, the Spiess family moved to Warrensburg, Missouri where Hermann Spiess spent his final years. His date of death and final resting place are unknown. Lena Spiess died in Glendale, California on January 3, 1914.

It is popular in the summer for picnics and boating, and in winter for ice skating on the lagoon and the canal which feeds it. The park was closed to the public for safety reasons after the major flood which hit Calgary in June 2013. The west half of the park reopened in November 2014, and the east half of the park reopened in 2016.City of Calgary Bowness Park Page Among other attractions, a ridable miniature railway operates seasonally in the park. History Land for the park was donated to the City of Calgary in 1911 by John Hextall, as part of a deal to secure the extension of streetcar service into Bowness Estates, which he was developing as an exclusive suburb. Bowness Park Calgary' The land consisted of two islands in the Bow River, separated from the south bank by a narrow channel, now dammed off to create a lagoon and small canal.Much of the information in this article is taken from Bowness Our Village in the Valley, Bowness Historical Society, 2005. Although hardly any development took place in Bowness before the end of the second world war, Bowness Park itself was extremely popular, thanks in part to the streetcar service which took Calgarians right to the door at a time when automobiles were rare. In the 1920s and 30s service on summer weekends was every 15 minutes and it was estimated that on a fine weekend up to 25,000 people would visit the park, with 28 streetcars being assigned to handle the traffic. Streetcar service was maintained from 1913 through 1950.Bowness Our Village in the Valley, p. 57. Facilities in the park in the early days were extensive. There was a swimming pool, the lagoon for canoeing and boating (with a fountain and central phonograph ‚Äúplaying gentle music‚Äù), a large dancing pavilion, a merry-go-round (now in Calgary's Heritage Park), picnic tables and shelters, swings and teeter-totters, camping sites and cabins which could be rented by the week or month and later a scenic railway. The following extract from a 1919 newspaper article gives some idea of the atmosphere at the time: > ‚ÄúThe new ferry, which will cross the original boating lake just west of the > swimming pool, will supply a want which was badly felt last season. It is > expected ‚Ä¶ that the boys and girls will have a great time on this ferry. It > will enable the young people as well as the older ones to shoot across the > lake from the grand stand to the refreshment cottage and merry-go-round, > without having to tramp around by the lovers' walk or the path at the foot > of the lake.‚ÄùCalgary Herald, May 17, 1919, quoted in Bowness Our Village in > the Valley, p.71 The summer cottages at the park were often rented by families as a summer retreat, beginning in the early 1920s until they were removed in 1946. Many of the former attractions are gone today: the swimming pool was closed in 1959, dancing ceased in 1960, and the Orthophonic, as the phonograph was called, stopped beaming out its music in 1961. =Bowness Park today= The ridable miniature railway operates in summer months. Boats are still available for rent on the lagoon, the fountain has been reinstalled, and the lagoon is used extensively for skating in the winter. In summer, the picnic sites and open spaces for ball games are popular, as is a mini-golf. The modest redevelopment proposed in a 2008 plan began in June 2012.Bowness Park Redevelopment Project However, the redevelopment was dealt a major setback with the June 2013 flood. Parts of the park were covered by as much as 1.5 meters of silt, as well as other debris. As a result, the redevelopment work that had been done so far was largely erased, and the work plan was modified in order to keep the reduce the impact of future floods. The park was closed for summer 2014. The west half reopened in November 2014, and the east half of the park is expected to reopen in summer 2016. A playground is built in the east side of the park, and the Bow River pathway crosses the park's length. The park is used for launching boats on the Bow River. A ridable miniature railway operates seasonally in the park. The line opened in the early 1950s, but shut down in 2013 as a result of heavy damage from flooding. The track was subsequently repaired, and a new train set was acquired, and operation restarted in July 2016.

Of the House of Dadiani, one of the leading Georgian noble families, he succeeded on the death of his father, David Dadiani, but he never ruled in his own right; during his minority, the government was run by regency presided by his mother, Princess Ekaterina, and in 1857, Mingrelia was placed under a provisional Russian administration. In 1867, Dadiani formally abdicated the throne and Mingrelia was directly incorporated into the Russian Empire. Dadiani mostly lived in Saint Petersburg, being close to the court. He was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, distinguished himself in the Russo- Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), and retired with the rank of major-general.  Early life  Niko Dadiani was born in Zugdidi, Mingrelia's capital, in 1847. Niko was six years old in August 1853 when his father died, and he became Prince of Mingrelia as an autonomous subject of the Russian Empire. With the approval of Tsar Nicholas I, Niko was placed under the regency of his mother, Princess Ekaterina; the Russian bureaucrat Kornely Borozdin was assigned to him as a tutor. The regency council also included Niko's paternal uncles, Grigol and Konstantin. The Dadiani family's luxurious life in Zugdidi was interrupted by the Crimean War, during the course of which, in 1854, the Ottoman troops advanced into Mingrelia. The Russian forces temporarily withdrew from the principality; Princess Ekaterina and Prince Niko took refuge in the mountains of Lechkhumi, at the monastery of Tsageri. After the war, in 1856, the mother and the son repaired to Moscow to attend the coronation of Tsar Alexander II and then followed the imperial family to St. Petersburg. On this occasion, Niko‚Äîenlisted at his birth as a cornet in the Life Guards Cossack regiment‚Äîwas made aide-de-camp to the Tsar and commissioned as a poruchik in the Life Guards Caucasian Squadron of His Imperial Majesty's Personal Escort.  End of the principality  Niko remained in St. Petersburg, enjoying the favor of the imperial family even after his mother hurried home due to a peasant revolt in Mingrelia in May 1857. The revolt was exploited by the Russian government as a pretext to recall Princess Ekaterina back to St. Petersburg and to place the hitherto autonomous principality under a provisional Russian administration. Niko Dadiani was then sent for further education in Paris. On his return, Niko, persuaded to accept a fait accompli, renounced his hereditary title of Prince Regnant of Mingrelia on 4 January 1867. With this, Mingrelia was formally annexed directly into the Russian Empire; Dadiani retained his palaces in Zugdidi and Gordi as his personal property. On his abdication, Niko was recompensed with the title of prince (knyaz), one million roubles, and a major's commission. His mother, brother, and sister were granted a lifetime pension. On 34 August 1874, he received the style and surname of Prince Dadian-Mingrelsky (\\"Dadiani of Mingrelia\\").  Army service  In 1875, Prince Dadian-Mingrelsky was transferred to the Chevalier Guard Regiment and saw action as part of the detachment of General Iosif Gurko in Bulgaria during the 1877‚Äì1878 war with the Ottoman Empire. Notably, he was present at storming Tarnovo, Kazanlak, and Shipka Pass in 1877. For his conduct, Dadiani was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th Class, with band and a gold sword with the inscription \\"for courage\\". He was promoted to colonel on 30 August 1877. After the war, he withdrew to reserves with the promotion to major-general in August 1878 and finally retired from service with a privilege of wearing a uniform in October 1878.  Later years  On the death of Princess Ekaterina in 1882, Niko Dadiani inherited her estates in Mingrelia and became the richest landowner in the Caucasus. He took an interest in the cultural enterprises of his contemporary Georgian intellectuals. In 1885, Dadiani donated his father's rich personal library collection, including old Georgian manuscripts, to the charity Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians (now in possession of the National Parliamentary Library of Georgia). He helped open schools and hospitals to serve the poor in Mingrelia, and supported efforts to promote the Georgian language. In 1887, Dadiani was nominated by Tsar Alexander III as a candidate for the vacant princely throne of Bulgaria after Alexander of Battenberg had been forced to abdicate in September 1886. The Russian nominee was rejected by the Grand Assembly of Bulgaria, and the crown eventually went to the German prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in July 1887. Niko Dadiani died in St. Petersburg in 1903. He was buried at the Dadiani burial ground at the Martvili Monastery.  Family  Niko Dadiani married, in St. Petersburg, on 14 April 1874, Countess Maria Alexandrovna von Adlerberg (29 May 1849 ‚Äì 27 February 1926), daughter of Count Aleksandr von Adlerberg, who was Minister of the Imperial Court. They had three children: * Princess Ekaterina (27 March 1875 ‚Äì 10 December 1875); * Prince Nikolay (30 December 1876 ‚Äì March 1919), Gentleman of the Imperial Bedchamber; he died in a Bolshevik prison hospital at St. Petersburg without issue; * Princess Salomea (1 December 1878 ‚Äì 3 December 1961), Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia; she was married to Major-General Prince Aleksandr Nikolayevich Obolensky (1872‚Äì1924) and died as an emigr√©e at Asni√®res-sur-Seine, France. Niko Dadiani also had an extramarital daughter, Menik (1880‚Äì1954), with his distant relative Princess Kesaria Chikovani.

The polemic is primarily directed at what, Ibn al-Jawzi held to be, growing anthropomorphic beliefs within the Hanbali school of jurisprudential thought. It singles out three prominent teachers within the Hanbali school: Al Hasan ibn Hamid (d. 1013), or Ibn Hamid, Muhammad ibn al-Husayn (d.1066), or al-Qadi Abu Ya'la, and Ibn al- Jawzi's own teacher, Ali ibn Ubayd Allah, or Ibn az-Zaghuni (d. 1132), contending that they shirked from the beliefs of the school's founder, Ahmad ibn Hanbal.Swartz, Merlin.

Craig, attempting to unify the academic field of communication theory. Craig argues that communication theorists can become unified in dialogue by charting what he calls the \\"dialogical dialectical tension\\", or the similarities and differences in their understanding of \\"communication\\" and demonstrating how those elements create tension within the field. Craig mapped these similarities and differences into seven suggested traditions of communication theory and showed how each of these traditions understand communication, as well as how each tradition's understanding creates tension with the other traditions. The article has received multiple awards, has become the foundation for many communication theory textbooks, and has been translated into several different languages. \\"Communication theory as a field\\" has created two main dialogues between Craig and other theorists. Myers argued that Craig misrepresented the theoretical assumptions of his theory, and that the theory itself does not distinguish between good and bad theories. Craig responded that Myers misunderstood not only the basic argument of the article, but also misrepresented his own case study. Russill proposed pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication theory, Craig responded by expanding this idea and placing Russill's proposition in conversation with the other seven traditions. Recognition and awards \\"Communication Theory as a Field\\" has been recognized by multiple associations for its influence upon the field of communication. These awards include the Best Article Award from the International Communication Association as well as the Golden Anniversary Monograph Award from the National Communication Association. That work has since been translated into French and Russian. The theory presented in \\"Communication Theory as a Field\\" has become the basis of the book \\"Theorizing Communication\\" which Craig co-edited with Heidi Muller, as well as being adopted by several other communication theory textbooks as a new framework for understanding the field of communication theory. Metamodel Sparked by the \\"Third Debate\\" within the field of International Relations Theory in the 1980s, \\"Communication Theory as a Field\\" expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication. At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or which theories to include in their textbooks. This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication. In this article Craig \\"proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities.\\" To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on communication theory as a practical discipline and shows how \\"various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication.\\" In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the \\"practical implications of communication theories.\\" In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of communication theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue. Craig argues that while the study of communication and communication theory has become a rich and flourishing field \\"Communication theory as an identifiable field of study does not yet exist\\" and the field of communication theory has become fragmented into separate domains which simply ignore each other. This inability to engage in dialog with one another causes theorists to view communication from isolated viewpoints, and denies them the richness that is available when engaging different perspectives. Craig argues that communication theorists are all engaging in the study of practical communication. By doing so different traditions are able to have a common ground from which a dialog can form, albeit each taking a different perspective of communication. Through this process of forming a dialog between theorists with different viewpoints on communication \\"communication theory can fully engage with the ongoing practical discourse (or metadiscourse) about communication in society.\\" The communication discipline began not as a single discipline, but through many different disciplines independently researching communication. This interdisciplinary beginning has separated theorists through their different conceptions of communication, rather than unifying them in the common topic of communication. Craig argues that the solution to this incoherence in the field of communication is not a unified theory of communication, but to create a dialogue between these theorists which engages these differences with one another to create new understandings of communication. To achieve this dialog Craig proposes what he calls \\"Dialogical-Dialectical coherence,\\" or a \\"common awareness of certain complementaries and tensions among different types of communication theory.\\" Craig believes that the different theories cannot develop in total isolation from one another, therefore this dialogical-dialectical coherence will provide a set of background assumptions from which different theories can engage each other in productive argumentation. Craig argues for a metatheory, or \\"second level\\" theory which deals with \\"first level\\" theories about communication. This second level metamodel of communication theory would help to understand the differences between first level communication traditions. With this thesis in place, Craig proposes seven suggested traditions of communication that have emerged and each of which have their own way of understanding communication. #Rhetorical: views communication as the practical art of discourse. #Semiotic: views communication as the mediation by signs. #Phenomenological: communication is the experience of dialogue with others. #Cybernetic: communication is the flow of information. #Socio-psychological: communication is the interaction of individuals. #Socio-cultural: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order. #Critical: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged. These proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed on two separate tables first to show how each traditions different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces, and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like. Craig then outlines the specifics of each tradition. =Conclusion= Craig concluded with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse. Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel. A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as \\"connectedness to others\\", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as \\"embodied performance\\", an economic tradition theorizing communication as \\"exchange\\", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a \\"nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence.\\" Response =Myers, constitutive metamodel, and truth= In 2001 Myers, a computer- mediated communication scholar from Loyola University New Orleans, criticizes Craig's ideas in \\"A Pox on All Compromises: A reply to Craig (1999).\\" Myers makes two main arguments against Craig's article. Myers argues that Craig misrepresents the metamodel, and that the lack of any critical truth within Craigs construction is problematic for the field of communication theory. The metamodel is misrepresented by unjustly arguing that there is a separation between first and second level constitutive models while hiding the paradox within this statement, and that it privileges the constitutive model rather than another theoretical conception. Next Myers argues that Craig fails to draw any way to discern truth within the theories. Using a case study regarding the rise and fall of technological determinism among computer- mediated communication scholars, Myers argues that a metamodel needs to provide some mechanism that will \\"reduce misrepresentation and mistake\\" in evaluating theory. Myers frames Craig's ideas of collective discourse without an evaluative criteria of what is good theory and bad theory as \\"a Mad Hatter's tea party\\" which will \\"allow all to participate in this party of discourse\\" but will not be able to \\"inform any of the participants when it is time to leave.\\" Craig's response to Myers Craig responded, in \\"an almost Jamesian reply\\", that Myers criticisms were not founded in actual inconsistencies within Craigs argument. Rather they were founded in the difference between Myers and Craig's \\"respective notions of truth and the proper role of empirical truth as a criterion for adjudicating among theories.\\" In regard to Myers first claim that the separation between first level theories and second level metatheory is paradoxical and therefore an inaccurate or misguided distinction, Craig admits that there is a paradox inherent within a separation between first order theories and metatheory but \\"slippage between logical levels is an inherent feature (or bug) of communication, and we should not forget that theory is, among other things, communication. \\" Craig cites Gregory Bateson as pointing out that while the theory of logical types forbids the mixing of different \\"levels\\" to avoid paradox, \\"practical communication necessarily does exactly that.\\" Actual communication is fraught with paradox, and while a logicians ideal would have us try and resolve these paradoxes, in actual practice we don't because there is no way to do so. In actually occurring communication people employ different means of dealing with this paradox, but resolving the paradox is not a possible solution. Craig argues that Myers has been unable to prove any inconsistency or misrepresentation when it came to using the constitutive model for his metamodel. Rather than trying to subvert every other theory to a constitutional model, Craig used the constitutive model not for some theory of truth or logical necessity, but because the constitutive model pragmatically will accomplish the goal of the project, that of opening up a space from which competing theories of communication can interact. With this the constitutional model will be able to maintain a theoretical cosmopolitanism. On the second argument that the metamodel lacks any empirical truth criteria, Craig argues that not only did Myers miss the point of the metamodel by claiming it should evaluate the truth of theories but that Myers own case study fails to back up his point. The metamodel itself does not distinguish the falseness of other models. However, contrary to Myers claim, the metamodel does allow theorists engaged in discussion to judge the validity of theories \\"on the basis of empirical evidence in ordinary reasonable ways.\\" What the metamodel does deny is a universally established absolute truth in the field of communication theory. Craig points out that Myers was correct in that the metamodel is ill- equipped to judge theories as valid or invalid, it also doesn't do a good job of closing \\"the Antarctic ozone hole or solve other problems for which it was not designed.\\" The case study that Myers presents is the debate about technological determinism in the realm of Computer Mediated Communication. Craig points out that this debate occurred between social scientific researchers. This type of research has a shared commitment to empirical research methods. So in spite of already possessing a shared truth criteria, these researchers failed to prevent errors Myers hopes would be avoided by holding onto a form of absolute truth. This case study would be a good critique of empirical truth but \\"how it supports a critique of the constitutive metamodel is less than apparent.\\" By relying upon this case study Myers sabotages his argument for establishing an absolute truth criteria, demonstrating that \\"we would gain little by holding on to such a criterion.\\" = Russill, pragmatism as an eighth tradition = After this exchange between Myers and Craig, there was no real disciplinary discussion of the metamodel besides textbooks which used the metamodel as a framework for introducing the field. Then in 2004 in an unpublished dissertation, which was mentioned in a footnote in his 2005 \\"The road not Taken: William James's Radical Empiricism and Communication Theory,\\" Russill proposed the possibly of pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication studies. This was attempted by using \\"Craig's rules\\" for the requirements of a tradition in communication theory which Russill formulates as \\"a problem formulation..., an initial vocabulary..., and arguments for the plausibility of this viewpoint in relation to prevailing traditions of theory.\\" Russill did not write his dissertation with the goal of constructing a tradition of communication theory, rather he was attempting to \\"resuscitate and reconstruct Dewey's theory of the public as a pragmatist theory of democratic communication.\\" To accomplish this goal Russill places Dewey in conversation with a variety of theorists including William James, John Locke, James Carey, Michel Foucault, J√ºrgen Habermas, and Walter Lippmann among others. Russill makes the argument that the pragmatist tradition \\"conceptualizes communication in response to the problem of incommensurability.\\" Incommensurability being how a pluralistic society can engage in cooperation when there is an absence \\"of common, absolute standards for resolving differences.\\" Russill briefly attempted to construct a pragmatist tradition of communication only to establish Dewey's theory of the public within that tradition. To do this he outlines pragmatism as a tradition that identifies the problem formulation as \\"incommensurability\\", and the vocabulary as \\"democracy, publics, power, criticism, response-ability, triple contingency.\\" Craig's response to Russill Craig responds to this in \\"Pragmatism in the Field of Communication Theory\\" and mentions that while Russill \\"does not entirely follow 'Craig's Rules'\\" for a new tradition of communication theory, Russill \\"does define a pragmatist tradition in terms of a distinct way of framing the problem of communication and articulates premises that make the tradition theoretically and practically plausible.\\" Craig points out that Russill is not the first communication theorists who writes on pragmatism, however he is the first to use the constitutive metamodel to define it as a tradition of communication. This conception of pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication studies allows a new space for theories, which Craig identified as either ambiguously placed or neglected, to \\"immediately snap into focus as contributors to a distinct [pragmatic] tradition.\\" To fully outline a new tradition of communication theory, Russill would have had to fully incorporate that tradition within the dialogical-dialectical matrix. Russill failed to fully consider the full range of criticism which would occur between the Pragmatist tradition and the other traditions of communication. Craig uses the dialogical-dialectical matrix to outline how pragmatism could be incorporated into the metamodel.

Of particular concern is the security of personal and business information now stored on smartphones. More and more users and businesses use smartphones to communicate, but also to plan and organize their users' work and also private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company. All smartphones, as computers, are preferred targets of attacks. These attacks exploit weaknesses inherent in smartphones that can come from the communication mode‚Äîlike Short Message Service (SMS, aka text messaging), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), WiFi, Bluetooth and GSM, the de facto global standard for mobile communications. There are also exploits that target software vulnerabilities in the browser or operating system. And some malicious software relies on the weak knowledge of an average user. Security countermeasures are being developed and applied to smartphones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users. There are good practices to be observed at all levels, from design to use, through the development of operating systems, software layers, and downloadable apps.  Challenges of smartphone mobile security  = Threats = A smartphone user is exposed to various threats when they use their phone. In just the last two-quarters of 2012, the number of unique mobile threats grew by 261%, according to ABI Research. These threats can disrupt the operation of the smartphone, and transmit or modify user data. So applications must guarantee privacy and integrity of the information they handle. In addition, since some apps could themselves be malware, their functionality and activities should be limited (for example, restricting the apps from accessing location information via GPS, blocking access to the user's address book, preventing the transmission of data on the network, sending SMS messages that are billed to the user, etc.). There are three prime targets for attackers: *Data: smartphones are devices for data management, and may contain sensitive data like credit card numbers, authentication information, private information, activity logs (calendar, call logs); *Identity: smartphones are highly customizable, so the device or its contents can easily be associated with a specific person. For example, every mobile device can transmit information related to the owner of the mobile phone contract, and an attacker may want to steal the identity of the owner of a smartphone to commit other offenses; *Availability: attacking a smartphone can limit access to it and deprive the owner of its use. There are a number of threats to mobile devices, including annoyance, stealing money, invading privacy, propagation, and malicious tools. *Botnets: attackers infect multiple machines with malware that victims generally acquire via e-mail attachments or from compromised applications or websites. The malware then gives hackers remote control of \\"zombie\\" devices, which can then be instructed to perform harmful acts. *Malicious applications: hackers upload malicious programs or games to third-party smartphone application marketplaces. The programs steal personal information and open backdoor communication channels to install additional applications and cause other problems. *Malicious links on social networks: an effective way to spread malware where hackers can place Trojans, spyware, and backdoors. *Spyware: hackers use this to hijack phones, allowing them to hear calls, see text messages and e-mails as well as track someone's location through GPS updates. The source of these attacks are the same actors found in the non-mobile computing space: *Professionals, whether commercial or military, who focus on the three targets mentioned above. They steal sensitive data from the general public, as well as undertake industrial espionage. They will also use the identity of those attacked to achieve other attacks; *Thieves who want to gain income through data or identities they have stolen. The thieves will attack many people to increase their potential income; *Black hat hackers who specifically attack availability. Their goal is to develop viruses, and cause damage to the device. In some cases, hackers have an interest in stealing data on devices. *Grey hat hackers who reveal vulnerabilities. Their goal is to expose vulnerabilities of the device. Grey hat hackers do not intend on damaging the device or stealing data. = Consequences = When a smartphone is infected by an attacker, the attacker can attempt several things: * The attacker can manipulate the smartphone as a zombie machine, that is to say, a machine with which the attacker can communicate and send commands which will be used to send unsolicited messages (spam) via sms or email; * The attacker can easily force the smartphone to make phone calls. For example, one can use the API (library that contains the basic functions not present in the smartphone) PhoneMakeCall by Microsoft, which collects telephone numbers from any source such as yellow pages, and then call them. But the attacker can also use this method to call paid services, resulting in a charge to the owner of the smartphone. It is also very dangerous because the smartphone could call emergency services and thus disrupt those services; * A compromised smartphone can record conversations between the user and others and send them to a third party. This can cause user privacy and industrial security problems; * An attacker can also steal a user's identity, usurp their identity (with a copy of the user's sim card or even the telephone itself), and thus impersonate the owner. This raises security concerns in countries where smartphones can be used to place orders, view bank accounts or are used as an identity card; * The attacker can reduce the utility of the smartphone, by discharging the battery. For example, they can launch an application that will run continuously on the smartphone processor, requiring a lot of energy and draining the battery. One factor that distinguishes mobile computing from traditional desktop PCs is their limited performance. Frank Stajano and Ross Anderson first described this form of attack, calling it an attack of \\"battery exhaustion\\" or \\"sleep deprivation torture\\"; * The attacker can prevent the operation and/or be starting of the smartphone by making it unusable. This attack can either delete the boot scripts, resulting in a phone without a functioning OS, or modify certain files to make it unusable (e.g. a script that launches at startup that forces the smartphone to restart) or even embed a startup application that would empty the battery; * The attacker can remove the personal (photos, music, videos, etc.) or professional data (contacts, calendars, notes) of the user.  Attacks based on communication  = Attack based on SMS and MMS = Some attacks derive from flaws in the management of SMS and MMS. Some mobile phone models have problems in managing binary SMS messages. It is possible, by sending an ill-formed block, to cause the phone to restart, leading to the denial of service attacks. If a user with a Siemens S55 received a text message containing a Chinese character, it would lead to a denial of service. In another case, while the standard requires that the maximum size of a Nokia Mail address is 32 characters, some Nokia phones did not verify this standard, so if a user enters an email address over 32 characters, that leads to complete dysfunction of the e-mail handler and puts it out of commission. This attack is called \\"curse of silence\\". A study on the safety of the SMS infrastructure revealed that SMS messages sent from the Internet can be used to perform a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against the mobile telecommunications infrastructure of a big city. The attack exploits the delays in the delivery of messages to overload the network. Another potential attack could begin with a phone that sends an MMS to other phones, with an attachment. This attachment is infected with a virus. Upon receipt of the MMS, the user can choose to open the attachment. If it is opened, the phone is infected, and the virus sends an MMS with an infected attachment to all the contacts in the address book. There is a real-world example of this attack: the virus Commwarrior uses the address book and sends MMS messages including an infected file to recipients. A user installs the software, as received via MMS message. Then, the virus began to send messages to recipients taken from the address book. = Attacks based on communication networks = Attacks based on the GSM networks The attacker may try to break the encryption of the mobile network. The GSM network encryption algorithms belong to the family of algorithms called A5. Due to the policy of security through obscurity it has not been possible to openly test the robustness of these algorithms. There were originally two variants of the algorithm: A5/1 and A5/2 (stream ciphers), where the former was designed to be relatively strong, and the latter was designed to be weak on purpose to allow easy cryptanalysis and eavesdropping. ETSI forced some countries (typically outside Europe) to use A5/2. Since the encryption algorithm was made public, it was proved it was possible to break the encryption: A5/2 could be broken on the fly, and A5/1 in about 6 hours . In July 2007, the 3GPP approved a change request to prohibit the implementation of A5/2 in any new mobile phones, which means that it has been decommissioned and is no longer implemented in mobile phones. Stronger public algorithms have been added to the GSM standard, the A5/3 and A5/4 (Block ciphers), otherwise known as KASUMI or UEA1 published by the ETSI. If the network does not support A5/1, or any other A5 algorithm implemented by the phone, then the base station can specify A5/0 which is the null-algorithm, whereby the radio traffic is sent unencrypted. Even in case mobile phones are able to use 3G or 4G which have much stronger encryption than 2G GSM, the base station can downgrade the radio communication to 2G GSM and specify A5/0 (no encryption) . This is the basis for eavesdropping attacks on mobile radio networks using a fake base station commonly called an IMSI catcher. In addition, tracing of mobile terminals is difficult since each time the mobile terminal is accessing or being accessed by the network, a new temporary identity (TMSI) is allocated to the mobile terminal. The TMSI is used as the identity of the mobile terminal the next time it accesses the network. The TMSI is sent to the mobile terminal in encrypted messages. Once the encryption algorithm of GSM is broken, the attacker can intercept all unencrypted communications made by the victim's smartphone. Attacks based on Wi-Fi Access Point spoofing An attacker can try to eavesdrop on Wi-Fi communications to derive information (e.g. username, password). This type of attack is not unique to smartphones, but they are very vulnerable to these attacks because very often the Wi-Fi is the only means of communication they have to access the internet. The security of wireless networks (WLAN) is thus an important subject. Initially, wireless networks were secured by WEP keys. The weakness of WEP is a short encryption key which is the same for all connected clients. In addition, several reductions in the search space of the keys have been found by researchers. Now, most wireless networks are protected by the WPA security protocol. WPA is based on the \\"Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)\\" which was designed to allow migration from WEP to WPA on the equipment already deployed. The major improvements in security are the dynamic encryption keys. For small networks, the WPA is a \\"pre-shared key\\" which is based on a shared key. Encryption can be vulnerable if the length of the shared key is short. With limited opportunities for input (i.e. only the numeric keypad), mobile phone users might define short encryption keys that contain only numbers. This increases the likelihood that an attacker succeeds with a brute-force attack. The successor to WPA, called WPA2, is supposed to be safe enough to withstand a brute force attack. As with GSM, if the attacker succeeds in breaking the identification key, it will be possible to attack not only the phone but also the entire network it is connected to. Many smartphones for wireless LANs remember they are already connected, and this mechanism prevents the user from having to re-identify with each connection. However, an attacker could create a WIFI access point twin with the same parameters and characteristics as the real network. Using the fact that some smartphones remember the networks, they could confuse the two networks and connect to the network of the attacker who can intercept data if it does not transmit its data in encrypted form.Gittleson, Kim (28 March 2014) Data- stealing Snoopy drone unveiled at Black Hat BBC News, Technology, Retrieved 29 March 2014Wilkinson, Glenn (25 September 2012) Snoopy: A distributed tracking and profiling framework Sensepost, Retrieved 29 March 2014 Lasco is a worm that initially infects a remote device using the SIS file format. SIS file format (Software Installation Script) is a script file that can be executed by the system without user interaction. The smartphone thus believes the file to come from a trusted source and downloads it, infecting the machine. Principle of Bluetooth-based attacks Security issues related to Bluetooth on mobile devices have been studied and have shown numerous problems on different phones. One easy to exploit vulnerability: unregistered services do not require authentication, and vulnerable applications have a virtual serial port used to control the phone. An attacker only needed to connect to the port to take full control of the device. Another example: a phone must be within reach and Bluetooth in discovery mode. The attacker sends a file via Bluetooth. If the recipient accepts, a virus is transmitted. For example: Cabir is a worm that spreads via Bluetooth connection. The worm searches for nearby phones with Bluetooth in discoverable mode and sends itself to the target device. The user must accept the incoming file and install the program. After installing, the worm infects the machine.  Attacks based on vulnerabilities in software applications  Other attacks are based on flaws in the OS or applications on the phone. = Web browser = The mobile web browser is an emerging attack vector for mobile devices. Just as common Web browsers, mobile web browsers are extended from pure web navigation with widgets and plug-ins, or are completely native mobile browsers. Jailbreaking the iPhone with firmware 1.1.1 was based entirely on vulnerabilities on the web browser. As a result, the exploitation of the vulnerability described here underlines the importance of the Web browser as an attack vector for mobile devices. In this case, there was a vulnerability based on a stack-based buffer overflow in a library used by the web browser (Libtiff). A vulnerability in the web browser for Android was discovered in October 2008. As the iPhone vulnerability above, it was due to an obsolete and vulnerable library. A significant difference with the iPhone vulnerability was Android's sandboxing architecture which limited the effects of this vulnerability to the Web browser process. Smartphones are also victims of classic piracy related to the web: phishing, malicious websites, software that run in the background, etc. The big difference is that smartphones do not yet have strong antivirus software available. = Operating system = Sometimes it is possible to overcome the security safeguards by modifying the operating system itself. As real-world examples, this section covers the manipulation of firmware and malicious signature certificates. These attacks are difficult. In 2004, vulnerabilities in virtual machines running on certain devices were revealed. It was possible to bypass the bytecode verifier and access the native underlying operating system. The results of this research were not published in detail. The firmware security of Nokia's Symbian Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is based on a central configuration file called SWIPolicy. In 2008 it was possible to manipulate the Nokia firmware before it is installed, and in fact in some downloadable versions of it, this file was human readable, so it was possible to modify and change the image of the firmware. This vulnerability has been solved by an update from Nokia. In theory smartphones have an advantage over hard drives since the OS files are in ROM, and cannot be changed by malware. However, in some systems it was possible to circumvent this: in the Symbian OS it was possible to overwrite a file with a file of the same name. On the Windows OS, it was possible to change a pointer from a general configuration file to an editable file. When an application is installed, the signing of this application is verified by a series of certificates. One can create a valid signature without using a valid certificate and add it to the list. In the Symbian OS all certificates are in the directory: . With firmware changes explained above it is very easy to insert a seemingly valid but malicious certificate.  Attacks based on hardware vulnerabilities  = Electromagnetic Waveforms = In 2015, researchers at the French government agency Agence nationale de la s√©curit√© des syst√®mes d'information (ANSSI) demonstrated the capability to trigger the voice interface of certain smartphones remotely by using \\"specific electromagnetic waveforms\\". The exploit took advantage of antenna-properties of headphone wires while plugged into the audio-output jacks of the vulnerable smartphones and effectively spoofed audio input to inject commands via the audio interface. = Juice Jacking = Juice Jacking is a physical or hardware vulnerability specific to mobile platforms. Utilizing the dual purpose of the USB charge port, many devices have been susceptible to having data exfiltrated from, or malware installed onto a mobile device by utilizing malicious charging kiosks set up in public places or hidden in normal charge adapters. = Jail-breaking and rooting = Jail-breaking is also a physical access vulnerability, in which mobile device users initiate to hack into the devices to unlock it, and exploit weaknesses in the operating system. Mobile device users take control of their own device by jail-breaking it, and customize the interface by installing applications, change system settings that are not allowed on the devices. Thus, allowing to tweak the mobile devices operating systems processes, run programs in the background, thus devices are being expose to variety of malicious attack that can lead to compromise important private data .  Password cracking  In 2010, researcher from the University of Pennsylvania investigated the possibility of cracking a device's password through a smudge attack (literally imaging the finger smudges on the screen to discern the user's password). The researchers were able to discern the device password up to 68% of the time under certain conditions. Outsiders may perform over-the-shoulder on victims, such as watching specific keystrokes or pattern gestures, to unlock device password or passcode.  Malicious software (malware)  As smartphones are a permanent point of access to the internet (mostly on), they can be compromised as easily as computers with malware. A malware is a computer program that aims to harm the system in which it resides. mobile malware variants have increased by 54% in the year 2017.http://images.mktgassets.symantec.com/Web/Symantec/%7B3a70beb8-c55d-4516-98ed-1d0818a42661%7D_ISTR23_Main- FINAL-APR10.pdf?aid=elq_ Trojans, worms and viruses are all considered malware. A Trojan is a program that is on the smartphone and allows external users to connect discreetly. A worm is a program that reproduces on multiple computers across a network. A virus is malicious software designed to spread to other computers by inserting itself into legitimate programs and running programs in parallel. However, it must be said that the malware are far less numerous and important to smartphones as they are to computers. Types of malware based on their number of smartphones in 2009 Nonetheless, recent studies show that the evolution of malware in smartphones have rocketed in the last few years posing a threat to analysis and detection. = The three phases of malware attacks = Typically an attack on a smartphone made by malware takes place in 3 phases: the infection of a host, the accomplishment of its goal, and the spread of the malware to other systems. Malware often uses the resources offered by the infected smartphones. It will use the output devices such as Bluetooth or infrared, but it may also use the address book or email address of the person to infect the user's acquaintances. The malware exploits the trust that is given to data sent by an acquaintance. Infection Infection is the means used by the malware to get into the smartphone, it can either use one of the faults previously presented or may use the gullibility of the user. Infections are classified into four classes according to their degree of user interaction: ; Explicit permission:The most benign interaction is to ask the user if it is allowed to infect the machine, clearly indicating its potential malicious behavior. This is typical behavior of a proof of concept malware. ; Implied permission:This infection is based on the fact that the user has a habit of installing software. Most trojans try to seduce the user into installing attractive applications (games, useful applications etc.) that actually contain malware. ; Common interaction:This infection is related to a common behavior, such as opening an MMS or email. ; No interaction:The last class of infection is the most dangerous. Indeed, a worm that could infect a smartphone and could infect other smartphones without any interaction would be catastrophic.  Accomplishment of its goal  Once the malware has infected a phone it will also seek to accomplish its goal, which is usually one of the following: monetary damage, damage data and/or device, and concealed damage: ; Monetary damages:The attacker can steal user data and either sell them to the same user or sell to a third party. ; Damage:Malware can partially damage the device, or delete or modify data on the device. ; Concealed damage:The two aforementioned types of damage are detectable, but the malware can also leave a backdoor for future attacks or even conduct wiretaps.  Spread to other systems  Once the malware has infected a smartphone, it always aims to spread one way or another: * It can spread through proximate devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and infrared; * It can also spread using remote networks such as telephone calls or SMS or emails. = Examples of malware = Here are various malware that exist in the world of smartphones with a short description of each.  Viruses and trojans  *Cabir (also known as Caribe, SybmOS/Cabir, Symbian/Cabir and EPOC.cabir) is the name of a computer worm developed in 2004, designed to infect mobile phones running Symbian OS. It is believed to have been the first computer worm that can infect mobile phones *Commwarrior, found March 7, 2005, was the first worm that can infect many machines from MMS. It is sent as COMMWARRIOR.ZIP containing the file COMMWARRIOR.SIS. When this file is executed, Commwarrior attempts to connect to nearby devices by Bluetooth or infrared under a random name. It then attempts to send MMS message to the contacts in the smartphone with different header messages for each person, who receive the MMS and often open them without further verification. *Phage is the first Palm OS virus discovered. It transfers to the Palm from a PC via synchronization. It infects all applications in the smartphone and embeds its own code to function without the user and the system detecting it. All that the system will detect is that its usual applications are functioning. *RedBrowser is a Trojan based on java. The Trojan masquerades as a program called \\"RedBrowser\\" which allows the user to visit WAP sites without a WAP connection. During application installation, the user sees a request on their phone that the application needs permission to send messages. If the user accepts, RedBrowser can send SMS to paid call centers. This program uses the smartphone's connection to social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to get the contact information for the user's acquaintances (provided the required permissions have been given) and will send them messages. *WinCE.PmCryptic.A is malicious software on Windows Mobile which aims to earn money for its authors. It uses the infestation of memory cards that are inserted in the smartphone to spread more effectively. *CardTrap is a virus that is available on different types of smartphone, which aims to deactivate the system and third party applications. It works by replacing the files used to start the smartphone and applications to prevent them from executing. There are different variants of this virus such as Cardtrap.A for SymbOS devices. It also infects the memory card with malware capable of infecting Windows. *Ghost Push is malicious software on Android OS which automatically roots the android device and installs malicious applications directly to system partition then unroots the device to prevent users from removing the threat by master reset (The threat can be removed only by reflashing). It cripples the system resources, executes quickly, and is hard to detect.  Ransomware  Mobile ransomware is a type of malware that locks users out of their mobile devices in a pay-to-unlock-your-device ploy, it has grown by leaps and bounds as a threat category since 2014. Specific to mobile computing platforms, users are often less security- conscious, particularly as it pertains to scrutinizing applications and web links trusting the native protection capability of the mobile device operating system. Mobile ransomware poses a significant threat to businesses reliant on instant access and availability of their proprietary information and contacts. The likelihood of a traveling businessman paying a ransom to unlock their device is significantly higher since they are at a disadvantage given inconveniences such as timeliness and less likely direct access to IT staff. Recent ransomware attack has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.  Spyware  *Flexispy is an application that can be considered as a trojan, based on Symbian. The program sends all information received and sent from the smartphone to a Flexispy server. It was originally created to protect children and spy on adulterous spouses.  Number of malware  Below is a diagram which loads the different behaviors of smartphone malware in terms of their effects on smartphones: Effects of Malware We can see from the graph that at least 50 malware varieties exhibit no negative behavior, except their ability to spread. = Portability of malware across platforms = There is a multitude of malware. This is partly due to the variety of operating systems on smartphones. However attackers can also choose to make their malware target multiple platforms, and malware can be found which attacks an OS but is able to spread to different systems. To begin with, malware can use runtime environments like Java virtual machine or the .NET Framework. They can also use other libraries present in many operating systems. Other malware carry several executable files in order to run in multiple environments and they utilize these during the propagation process. In practice, this type of malware requires a connection between the two operating systems to use as an attack vector. Memory cards can be used for this purpose, or synchronization software can be used to propagate the virus.  Countermeasures  The security mechanisms in place to counter the threats described above are presented in this section. They are divided into different categories, as all do not act at the same level, and they range from the management of security by the operating system to the behavioral education of the user. The threats prevented by the various measures are not the same depending on the case. Considering the two cases mentioned above, in the first case one would protect the system from corruption by an application, and in the second case the installation of a suspicious software would be prevented. = Security in operating systems = The first layer of security in a smartphone is the operating system (OS). Beyond needing to handle the usual roles of an operating system (e.g. resource management, scheduling processes) on the device, it must also establish the protocols for introducing external applications and data without introducing risk. A central paradigm in mobile operating systems is the idea of a sandbox. Since smartphones are currently designed to accommodate many applications, they must have mechanisms to ensure these applications are safe for the phone itself, for other applications and data on the system, and for the user. If a malicious program reaches a mobile device, the vulnerable area presented by the system must be as small as possible. Sandboxing extends this idea to compartmentalize different processes, preventing them from interacting and damaging each other. Based on the history of operating systems, sandboxing has different implementations. For example, where iOS will focus on limiting access to its public API for applications from the App Store by default, Managed Open In allows you to restrict which apps can access which types of data. Android bases its sandboxing on its legacy of Linux and TrustedBSD. The following points highlight mechanisms implemented in operating systems, especially Android. ; Rootkit Detectors : The intrusion of a rootkit in the system is a great danger in the same way as on a computer. It is important to prevent such intrusions, and to be able to detect them as often as possible. Indeed, there is concern that with this type of malicious program, the result could be a partial or complete bypass of the device security, and the acquisition of administrator rights by the attacker. If this happens, then nothing prevents the attacker from studying or disabling the safety features that were circumvented, deploying the applications they want, or disseminating a method of intrusion by a rootkit to a wider audience. We can cite, as a defense mechanism, the Chain of trust in iOS. This mechanism relies on the signature of the different applications required to start the operating system, and a certificate signed by Apple. In the event that the signature checks are inconclusive, the device detects this and stops the boot-up. If the Operating System is compromised due to Jailbreaking, root kit detection may not work if it is disabled by the Jailbreak method or software is loaded after Jailbreak disables Rootkit Detection. ; Process isolation : Android uses mechanisms of user process isolation inherited from Linux. Each application has a user associated with it, and a tuple (UID, GID). This approach serves as a sandbox: while applications can be malicious, they can not get out of the sandbox reserved for them by their identifiers, and thus cannot interfere with the proper functioning of the system. For example, since it is impossible for a process to end the process of another user, an application can thus not stop the execution of another. ; File permissions : From the legacy of Linux, there are also filesystem permissions mechanisms. They help with sandboxing: a process can not edit any files it wants. It is therefore not possible to freely corrupt files necessary for the operation of another application or system. Furthermore, in Android there is the method of locking memory permissions. It is not possible to change the permissions of files installed on the SD card from the phone, and consequently it is impossible to install applications. ; Memory Protection : In the same way as on a computer, memory protection prevents privilege escalation. Indeed, if a process managed to reach the area allocated to other processes, it could write in the memory of a process with rights superior to their own, with root in the worst case, and perform actions which are beyond its permissions on the system. It would suffice to insert function calls are authorized by the privileges of the malicious application. ; Development through runtime environments : Software is often developed in high-level languages, which can control what is being done by a running program. For example, Java Virtual Machines continuously monitor the actions of the execution threads they manage, monitor and assign resources, and prevent malicious actions. Buffer overflows can be prevented by these controls. =Security software= Above the operating system security, there is a layer of security software. This layer is composed of individual components to strengthen various vulnerabilities: prevent malware, intrusions, the identification of a user as a human, and user authentication. It contains software components that have learned from their experience with computer security; however, on smartphones, this software must deal with greater constraints (see limitations). ; Antivirus and firewall : An antivirus software can be deployed on a device to verify that it is not infected by a known threat, usually by signature detection software that detects malicious executable files. A firewall, meanwhile, can watch over the existing traffic on the network and ensure that a malicious application does not seek to communicate through it. It may equally verify that an installed application does not seek to establish suspicious communication, which may prevent an intrusion attempt. A mobile antivirus product would scan files and compare them against a database of known mobile malware code signatures. ; Visual Notifications : In order to make the user aware of any abnormal actions, such as a call they did not initiate, one can link some functions to a visual notification that is impossible to circumvent. For example, when a call is triggered, the called number should always be displayed. Thus, if a call is triggered by a malicious application, the user can see, and take appropriate action. ; Turing test : In the same vein as above, it is important to confirm certain actions by a user decision. The Turing test is used to distinguish between a human and a virtual user, and it often comes as a captcha. ; Biometric identification : Another method to use is biometrics. Biometrics is a technique of identifying a person by means of their morphology(by recognition of the eye or face, for example) or their behavior (their signature or way of writing for example). One advantage of using biometric security is that users can avoid having to remember a password or other secret combination to authenticate and prevent malicious users from accessing their device. In a system with strong biometric security, only the primary user can access the smartphone. = Resource monitoring in the smartphone = When an application passes the various security barriers, it can take the actions for which it was designed. When such actions are triggered, the activity of a malicious application can be sometimes detected if one monitors the various resources used on the phone. Depending on the goals of the malware, the consequences of infection are not always the same; all malicious applications are not intended to harm the devices on which they are deployed. The following sections describe different ways to detect suspicious activity. ; Battery : Some malware is aimed at exhausting the energy resources of the phone. Monitoring the energy consumption of the phone can be a way to detect certain malware applications. ; Memory usage : Memory usage is inherent in any application. However, if one finds that a substantial proportion of memory is used by an application, it may be flagged as suspicious. ; Network traffic : On a smartphone, many applications are bound to connect via the network, as part of their normal operation. However, an application using a lot of bandwidth can be strongly suspected of attempting to communicate a lot of information, and disseminate data to many other devices. This observation only allows a suspicion, because some legitimate applications can be very resource- intensive in terms of network communications, the best example being streaming video. ; Services : One can monitor the activity of various services of a smartphone. During certain moments, some services should not be active, and if one is detected, the application should be suspected. For example, the sending of an SMS when the user is filming video: this communication does not make sense and is suspicious; malware may attempt to send SMS while its activity is masked. The various points mentioned above are only indications and do not provide certainty about the legitimacy of the activity of an application. However, these criteria can help target suspicious applications, especially if several criteria are combined. = Network surveillance = Network traffic exchanged by phones can be monitored. One can place safeguards in network routing points in order to detect abnormal behavior. As the mobile's use of network protocols is much more constrained than that of a computer, expected network data streams can be predicted (e.g. the protocol for sending an SMS), which permits detection of anomalies in mobile networks. ; Spam filters : As is the case with email exchanges, we can detect a spam campaign through means of mobile communications (SMS, MMS). It is therefore possible to detect and minimize this kind of attempt by filters deployed on network infrastructure that is relaying these messages. ; Encryption of stored or transmitted information : Because it is always possible that data exchanged can be intercepted, communications, or even information storage, can rely on encryption to prevent a malicious entity from using any data obtained during communications. However, this poses the problem of key exchange for encryption algorithms, which requires a secure channel. ; Telecom network monitoring : The networks for SMS and MMS exhibit predictable behavior, and there is not as much liberty compared with what one can do with protocols such as TCP or UDP. This implies that one cannot predict the use made of the common protocols of the web; one might generate very little traffic by consulting simple pages, rarely, or generate heavy traffic by using video streaming. On the other hand, messages exchanged via mobile phone have a framework and a specific model, and the user does not, in a normal case, have the freedom to intervene in the details of these communications. Therefore, if an abnormality is found in the flux of network data in the mobile networks, the potential threat can be quickly detected. = Manufacturer surveillance = In the production and distribution chain for mobile devices, it is the responsibility of manufacturers to ensure that devices are delivered in a basic configuration without vulnerabilities. Most users are not experts and many of them are not aware of the existence of security vulnerabilities, so the device configuration as provided by manufacturers will be retained by many users. Below are listed several points which manufacturers should consider. ; Remove debug mode : Phones are sometimes set in a debug mode during manufacturing, but this mode must be disabled before the phone is sold. This mode allows access to different features, not intended for routine use by a user. Due to the speed of development and production, distractions occur and some devices are sold in debug mode. This kind of deployment exposes mobile devices to exploits that utilize this oversight. ; Default settings : When a smartphone is sold, its default settings must be correct, and not leave security gaps. The default configuration is not always changed, so a good initial setup is essential for users. There are, for example, default configurations that are vulnerable to denial of service attacks. ; Security audit of apps : Along with smart phones, appstores have emerged. A user finds themselves facing a huge range of applications. This is especially true for providers who manage appstores because they are tasked with examining the apps provided, from different points of view (e.g. security, content). The security audit should be particularly cautious, because if a fault is not detected, the application can spread very quickly within a few days, and infect a significant number of devices. ; Detect suspicious applications demanding rights : When installing applications, it is good to warn the user against sets of permissions that, grouped together, seem potentially dangerous, or at least suspicious. Frameworks like such as Kirin, on Android, attempt to detect and prohibit certain sets of permissions. ; Revocation procedures : Along with appstores appeared a new feature for mobile apps: remote revocation. First developed by Android, this procedure can remotely and globally uninstall an application, on any device that has it. This means the spread of a malicious application that managed to evade security checks can be immediately stopped when the threat is discovered. ; Avoid heavily customized systems : Manufacturers are tempted to overlay custom layers on existing operating systems, with the dual purpose of offering customized options and disabling or charging for certain features. This has the dual effect of risking the introduction of new bugs in the system, coupled with an incentive for users to modify the systems to circumvent the manufacturer's restrictions. These systems are rarely as stable and reliable as the original, and may suffer from phishing attempts or other exploits. ; Improve software patch processes : New versions of various software components of a smartphone, including operating systems, are regularly published. They correct many flaws over time. Nevertheless, manufacturers often do not deploy these updates to their devices in a timely fashion, and sometimes not at all. Thus, vulnerabilities persist when they could be corrected, and if they are not, since they are known, they are easily exploitable. = User awareness = Much malicious behavior is allowed by the carelessness of the user. Smartphone users were found to ignore security messages during application installation, especially during application selection, checking application reputation, reviews and security and agreement messages. From simply not leaving the device without a password, to precise control of permissions granted to applications added to the smartphone, the user has a large responsibility in the cycle of security: to not be the vector of intrusion. This precaution is especially important if the user is an employee of a company that stores business data on the device. Detailed below are some precautions that a user can take to manage security on a smartphone. A recent survey by internet security experts BullGuard showed a lack of insight into the rising number of malicious threats affecting mobile phones, with 53% of users claiming that they are unaware of security software for Smartphones. A further 21% argued that such protection was unnecessary, and 42% admitted it hadn't crossed their mind (\\"Using APA,\\" 2011). These statistics show consumers are not concerned about security risks because they believe it is not a serious problem. The key here is to always remember smartphones are effectively handheld computers and are just as vulnerable. ; Being skeptical : A user should not believe everything that may be presented, as some information may be phishing or attempting to distribute a malicious application. It is therefore advisable to check the reputation of the application that they want to buy before actually installing it. ; Permissions given to applications : The mass distribution of applications is accompanied by the establishment of different permissions mechanisms for each operating system. It is necessary to clarify these permissions mechanisms to users, as they differ from one system to another, and are not always easy to understand. In addition, it is rarely possible to modify a set of permissions requested by an application if the number of permissions is too great. But this last point is a source of risk because a user can grant rights to an application, far beyond the rights it needs. For example, a note taking application does not require access to the geolocation service. The user must ensure the privileges required by an application during installation and should not accept the installation if requested rights are inconsistent. ; Be careful : Protection of a user's phone through simple gestures and precautions, such as locking the smartphone when it is not in use, not leaving their device unattended, not trusting applications, not storing sensitive data, or encrypting sensitive data that cannot be separated from the device. : ;Disconnect peripheral devices, that are not in use :NIST Guidelines for Managing the Security of Mobile Devices 2013, recommends : Restrict user and application access to hardware, such as the digital camera, GPS, Bluetooth interface, USB interface, and removable storage. :  Enable Android Device Encryption  Latest Android Smartphones come with an inbuilt encryption setting for securing all the information saved on your device. It makes it difficult for a hacker to extract and decipher the information in case your device is compromised. Here is how to do it, Settings ‚Äì Security ‚Äì Encrypt Phone + Encrypt SD Card : ; Ensure data : Smartphones have a significant memory and can carry several gigabytes of data. The user must be careful about what data it carries and whether they should be protected. While it is usually not dramatic if a song is copied, a file containing bank information or business data can be more risky. The user must have the prudence to avoid the transmission of sensitive data on a smartphone, which can be easily stolen. Furthermore, when a user gets rid of a device, they must be sure to remove all personal data first. These precautions are measures that leave no easy solution to the intrusion of people or malicious applications in a smartphone. If users are careful, many attacks can be defeated, especially phishing and applications seeking only to obtain rights on a device. =Centralized storage of text messages= One form of mobile protection allows companies to control the delivery and storage of text messages, by hosting the messages on a company server, rather than on the sender or receiver's phone. When certain conditions are met, such as an expiration date, the messages are deleted. = Limitations of certain security measures = The security mechanisms mentioned in this article are to a large extent inherited from knowledge and experience with computer security. The elements composing the two device types are similar, and there are common measures that can be used, such as antivirus software and firewalls. However, the implementation of these solutions is not necessarily possible or at least highly constrained within a mobile device. The reason for this difference is the technical resources offered by computers and mobile devices: even though the computing power of smartphones is becoming faster, they have other limitations than their computing power. *Single-task system: Some operating systems, including some still commonly used, are single-tasking. Only the foreground task is executed. It is difficult to introduce applications such as antivirus and firewall on such systems, because they could not perform their monitoring while the user is operating the device, when there would be most need of such monitoring. *Energy autonomy: A critical one for the use of a smartphone is energy autonomy. It is important that the security mechanisms not consume battery resources, without which the autonomy of devices will be affected dramatically, undermining the effective use of the smartphone. *Network Directly related to battery life, network utilization should not be too high. It is indeed one of the most expensive resources, from the point of view of energy consumption. Nonetheless, some calculations may need to be relocated to remote servers in order to preserve the battery. This balance can make implementation of certain intensive computation mechanisms a delicate proposition. Furthermore, it is common to find that updates exist, or can be developed or deployed, but this is not always done. One can, for example, find a user who does not know that there is a newer version of the operating system compatible with the smartphone, or a user may discover known vulnerabilities that are not corrected until the end of a long development cycle, which allows time to exploit the loopholes. = Next Generation of mobile security = There is expected to be four mobile environments that will make up the security framework: ; Rich operating system: In this category will fall traditional Mobile OS like Android, iOS, Symbian OS or Windows Phone. They will provide the traditional functionality and security of an OS to the applications. ;Secure Operating System (Secure OS): A secure kernel which will run in parallel with a fully featured Rich OS, on the same processor core. It will include drivers for the Rich OS (\\"normal world\\") to communicate with the secure kernel (\\"secure world\\"). The trusted infrastructure could include interfaces like the display or keypad to regions of PCI-E address space and memories. ;Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): Made up of hardware and software. It helps in the control of access rights and houses sensitive applications, which need to be isolated from the Rich OS. It effectively acts as a firewall between the \\"normal world\\" and \\"secure world\\". ; Secure Element (SE): The SE consists of tamper resistant hardware and associated software or separate isolated hardware. It can provide high levels of security and work in tandem with the TEE. The SE will be mandatory for hosting proximity payment applications or official electronic signatures. SE may connect, disconnect, block peripheral devices and operate separate set of hardware. ; Security Applications (SA): Numerous security applications are available on App Stores providing services of protection from viruses and performing vulnerability assessment.

It is held annually in the spring, April 1 to April 30. History Roozengaarde is a popular location for tulip viewing during the festival. Around 1883, George Gibbs, an immigrant from England, moved to Orcas Island, where he began to grow apples and hazelnuts. Nine years later, he purchased five dollars' worth of flower bulbs to grow, and when he dug them up a couple years later and saw how they had multiplied, realized the potential for bulb-growing in the Puget Sound region. He contacted Dutch growers in Holland to learn about the business, only to find the Dutch to be highly secretive about their commercial practices. However, when he shipped off a few a bulbs to Holland, the impressed Dutch growers traveled to Orcas Island to see for themselves how tulips could grow outside Holland. In 1899, Gibbs wrote to the United States Department of Agriculture regarding the commercial prospects of bulb-growing in the region, and they took interest. In 1905, they sent Gibbs 15,000 imported bulbs from Holland to grow as an experiment, under a contract. The experiment was so successful that the United States Department of Agriculture established its own 10-acre test garden in 1908 around Bellingham, which proved successful enough for the Bellingham Tulip Festival to begin in 1920 to showcase and celebrate the success of the bulb industry. The Bellingham Tulip Festival was discontinued in 1930, due to the Great Depression and bulb freezes in 1916, 1925, and 1929 that brought heavy losses to the growers. Subsequently, the growers moved south into Skagit County. In 1946, William Roozen arrived in the United States, leaving behind a successful bulb-growing business spanning six generations in Holland. After working on several different farms, Roozen started his own in Skagit County in 1950. In 1955, he purchased the Washington Bulb Company, making him the leader among the four flower-growing families in the area, and making the Washington Bulb Company the leading grower of tulip, daffodil, and iris bulbs in North America. The farm operates a public display garden and gift shop called Roozengaarde, which, alongside the DeGoede family's Tulip Town, is a major attraction during the Tulip Festival. Local tulip growers showcased their bulbs through display gardens for decades prior to the formation of an official festival. The Mount Vernon Chamber of Commerce established the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival as a three-day event in 1984 to add festivities during the bloom month. The event has since grown to a month-long event and coincides with street fairs, art shows and sporting events. The 2020 festival was cancelled on March 25 due to the coronavirus pandemic, which had affected Skagit County. Festival organizers had initially planned for a smaller event with limited numbers of people allowed at display gardens and later car-only tours, but cancelled after the state government issued a stay-at-home order. Tulip Town, a major festival venue, announced plans to use virtual tours and flower donations for hospital workers to recoup their lost revenue. Several tulip fields were prematurely cut to prevent people from visiting the area. Attendance The festival claims to be Washington's largest, with over one million visitors; at least one news source stated attendance was 350,000 for 2008. Travel + Leisure put the figure at 500,000 in 2003. Awards The festival was selected as the best street fair in KING-TV's \\"Best of the Northwest\\" awards in 2010.

There, he co-authored reports on e-commerce and smart card technology and edited material related to CASE (computer-aided software engineering). After leaving Ovum, Stevenson worked as a freelancer, consulting primarily in the field of cryptography. Throughout this period, Stevenson was also a semi-professional musician. As a founding member of the band Clear, he co-wrote both music and lyrics, sang and played bass. The band's sole album, Coming Around, had the unique distinction of being funded by a company founded by the members but owned in part by the band's fans. The album, recorded in 2003, was produced by Andy Metcalfe at the studios of Glenn Tilbrook; it was mastered at Abbey Road. Comedy After leaving Clear, Stevenson took to comedy. His stand-up material was primarily focused on science. He has appeared at many comedy clubs, festivals and other venues. And although his current duties as businessman and author preclude a full-time career in comedy, he still occasionally makes appearances at clubs and on programs. He continues to write comedy.

It is in the southern part of the old city center, opposite St. Godehard and behind St. Nicolai's Chapel.  History  In 1770, a large half-timbered house was built in Hildesheim to house two different hospitals which had already been founded several centuries before. The ground floor was given to the Hospital zu den F√ºnf Wunden (Hospital of the Five Wounds) and the upper floors to the Hospital Sankt Nicolai (Hospital St. Nicolai). Later, both hospitals were united to form the Vereinigte Hospit√§ler (United Hospitals). The building, however, kept the name Hospital zu den F√ºnf Wunden.Anke Twachtmann-Schlichter: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, p. 155. Hameln 2007. The name derives from devotion to the holy wounds inflicted on Jesus during the crucifixion, a pious practice traditionally associated with works of mercy and social justice (in reformation England the Pilgrimage of Grace was undertaken by Catholics protesting their loss of charitable institutions and religious freedoms, under a similar patronage). From the 19th century on, the building was used by a nearby Catholic hospital which still exists today. During World War II, the Hospital of the Five Wounds was only slightly damaged by bombs on 22 February 1945 and on 22 March 1945,Hermann Seeland: Zerst√∂rung und Untergang Alt- Hildesheims, p. 10. Hildesheim 1947. and the damage could be repaired very soon. The building was renovated in 1981. Today it is used as a training college for nurses.  Architecture  The Hospital of the Five Wounds is one of the largest half-timbered houses in Hildesheim. The address is Godehardsplatz 9‚Äì11 which is a large square in front of the Romanesque St. Godehard, but actually it is in a small and rather steep side lane. The building has four floors and a half-hip roof. The ground floor which was built of rubblestones has a representative baroque portal above which the year of construction (1770) is indicated in Latin in a noteworthy chronogram: CVra BonIfaCII, prIMo, qVo praefVIt Anno Abbas SpeCtatos CoLLoCat HosCe Lares.

Lipski is an American linguist who is most widely known for his work on Spanish and Portuguese dialectology and language variation. His research also focuses on Spanish phonology, the linguistic aspects of bilingualism and code-switching, African influences on Spanish and Portuguese, and pidgin and creole studies. He is currently the Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Spanish Linguistics in the Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese at the Pennsylvania State University. He previously served as the head of the same department from 2001 to 2005.  Biography  Lipski studied Spanish and mathematics as an undergraduate at Rice University (1971). He has stated, however, in casual conversation during his tenure at the University of Houston in the 1980s that he never took a Spanish class, and that he was self-taught in the language. This appears to be the case with Portuguese as well, which Lipski has personally referred to as a \\"free\\" language of sorts if one already knows Spanish. So his Spanish studies as an undergraduate must have been rather advanced, or independent studies, as opposed to Spanish I or II and the like. He earned both his MA (1972) and his PhD (1974) in Romance linguistics at the University of Alberta, with extensive training in classic Romance philology and European structuralism. His doctoral dissertation was a comparative historical phonology of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. Following the completion of his PhD, Lipski worked as a Spanish instructor at Kean College of New Jersey (1973‚Äì1975), where his interactions with Cuban and Puerto Rican Spanish speakers would eventually lead him to study Spanish dialectal variation and sociolinguistics.

In chowtal, two rows of singers face each other (semi-circle), with a \\"dholak\\" drummer at one end, and sing lines of Hindi text antiphonally. While the melodies are relatively simple, the song undergoes various modulations of rhythm and tempo, alternating between subdued passages and exciting climaxes.

Chowtal is performed today in various parts of the Bhojpuri region, but is in decline. During 1838‚Äì1917, chowtal was one of the Bhojpuri folk music genres transmitted by indentured workers to the Caribbean (primarily Trinidad, Guyana, Jamaica and Suriname), and also the Fiji Islands. In these sites it has flourished vigorously‚Äîin spite of the decline of the Bhojpuri language in Trinidad and Guyana.

Background The Forest of Dean, with its huge iron-ore reserves and ready supply of timber, had been an area of national importance in the production of iron, using charcoal, for hundreds of years. Even the name Cinderford is thought to have derived from the term ' meaning clinker, that was left behind by early Roman ironworks (ford probably refers to the crossing over the Cinderford Brook). The first coke-fired blast furnace was constructed in 1709 at Coalbrookdale, in Shropshire. However, despite there also being extensive coal measures in the Forest of Dean, local coal did not produce coke that was ideal for smelting and the ironmasters were reluctant to invest in the new technology. It was not until the last decade of the 18th century that coke-fired furnaces began to make an appearance, with Cinderford, Whitecliff and Parkend Ironworks being built almost simultaneously.The Whitecliff Ironworks in the Forest of Dean, Part one, page 19 History Work began on the ironworks in ; it was the first coke-fired blast furnace to be built in the Forest of Dean and probably came into blast in 1797, or possibly as late as 1798.Richard Newman, The Origins of the Cinderford Coke Iron Furnace, page 15 It was built principally at the instigation of Thomas Teague,British History Online although it is unknown who the financial backers were.Richard Newman, The Origins of the Cinderford Coke Iron Furnace, page 15 Coal was brought in by boat, along the Cinderford Canal from Broadmoor, just to the north. Iron-ore was brought in by mule, from Edge Hill and other mines.Richard Newman, The Origins of the Cinderford Coke Iron Furnace, page 13 It was working in 1806, but like Parkend Ironworks, probably ceased production around 1807. The reasons are not certain, but output had not reached 20 tons a week,Richard Newman, The Origins of the Cinderford Coke Iron Furnace, page 13 which was exceptionally low. The difficulties may have been due to poor technical expertise, the unsuitability of the local coke, or perhaps both. A large amount of clinker still exists at the site, but no other surface remains are visible. Around 1820, Moses Teague, working at Darkhill Ironworks, discovered a way to make good iron from local coke. To exploit his discovery he re-opened Parkend Ironworks in 1824British History Online and Cinderford Ironworks in 1829. Activity ceased again in 1832, during an economic slump, but resumed in 1835 with financial help from William Crawshay, a Welsh ironmaster, of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil. The Ironworks prospered for the next forty years; A second furnace was added around 1835 and in 1841 there were three furnaces producing 12,000 tons of iron a year. A fourth furnace was added sometime before 1855. Crawshay's son Henry, who ran the works from 1847, bought out the only other partner, Stephen Allaway, in 1862. By the late 1870s, however, the iron trade went into recession and only two furnaces were in production at that time. Two new furnaces were built in 1880, but by 1890 only one was in blast. Cinderford Ironworks closed in 1894 and demolition was completed by 1901.British History OnlineGloucestershire Archives, D8729 Today, very little remains are visible above ground.

It was formed in May 1942, and controlled units located in New South Wales and southern Queensland. Headquartered in Sydney, Eastern Area Command's responsibilities included air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. Its flying units operated fighters, reconnaissance bombers, and dive bombers, and concentrated on convoy escort, maritime patrol and anti- submarine warfare. The size of the area was such that the RAAF twice considered splitting it, but nothing came of this. The area command continued to function after the war, its headquarters transferring from Sydney to Glenbrook, in the Blue Mountains, in 1949. By this time most of the RAAF's operational units‚Äîincluding fighter, bomber, and transport wings‚Äîwere based within Eastern Area's boundaries, and the officer in command was responsible for air defence across all of Australia. In October 1953, the RAAF began reorganising its command-and-control system from one based on geography to one based on function; Eastern Area was re-formed as Home Command, which was renamed Operational Command in 1959, and Air Command in 1987. History =World War II= Area commands as planned in February 1940 Prior to World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. When war broke out, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 111‚Äì112 Between March 1940 and May 1941, Australia and Papua were divided into four geographically based command-and-control zones: Central Area, Southern Area, Western Area, and Northern Area.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 91‚Äì92 The roles of the area commands were air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) who controlled the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary. Central Area was disbanded in August 1941, and its responsibilities were divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, and the newly formed No. 2 (Training) Group.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 112 The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 311 Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North- Eastern Area.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One, pp. xxi, 134‚Äì135 Headquartered in the Sydney suburb of Edgecliff, Eastern Area Command was formed on 15 May 1942 under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal Bill Anderson. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers.Eastern Area Headquarters, Operations Record Book, p. 1 Training units in New South Wales remained part of No. 2 (Training) Group. No. 5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1 June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern Area Command.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume Two, p. 212 In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, formed the majority of his US flying units into the Fifth Air Force, and most of their Australian counterparts into RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 585‚Äì588Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 4‚Äì6 Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, for supplies and equipment.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 144‚Äì145 alt=Head-and-shoulders portrait of moustachioed man in light- coloured military uniform with ribbons and pilot's wings on chest Of geographical necessity, the RAAF's two northerly area commands were mainly responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare. In response to an increase in the number of Japanese submarines operating in Australian waters, the RAAF conducted intensive patrols along the east coast during January and February 1943. This included more than 400 patrol, anti-submarine, and convoy escort missions by Eastern Area aircraft in January.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 221‚Äì222 The submarine threat against Allied shipping was considered serious enough to warrant basing more RAAF squadrons in southern commands than in the north, diverting resources from forward areas like New Guinea. By April, Eastern Area was operating seven combat units: No. 5 Squadron, flying army cooperation missions with CAC Wirraways out of Kingaroy, Queensland; No. 23 Squadron, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from Lowood, Queensland; No. 24 Squadron, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from Bankstown, New South Wales; No. 32 Squadron, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with Lockheed Hudsons from Camden, New South Wales; No. 71 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti- submarine missions with Avro Ansons from Lowood; No. 73 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Ansons from Nowra, New South Wales; and No. 83 Squadron, flying fighter missions with Wirraways from Strathpine, Queensland.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 141 Nos. 71 and 73 Squadrons were reserve formations hastily raised to augment the anti- submarine effort, crewed by staff and students from operational training units.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 140Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, pp. 73‚Äì74 Japanese submarine activity off the east coast peaked during April and May 1943, leading to a further expansion of the RAAF's convoy escort and patrol efforts.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 237 As part of the measures undertaken to increase air coverage during this period, transit flights were ordered to overfly shipping lanes whenever possible.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 148 At the end of April, Eastern Area headquarters staff numbered 630, including 105 officers.Eastern Area Headquarters, Operations Record Book, p. 319 Bristol Beauforts of No. 32 Squadron were credited with damaging a Japanese submarine on 19 June, but neither the RAAF nor the Royal Australian Navy was able to destroy any enemy submarines in coastal waters during 1943.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 152‚Äì153 The efforts of the two services within the region Eastern Area covered were hampered by poor liaison and command arrangements, as well as the RAAF placing a relatively low priority on protecting merchant shipping.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 241 Anderson handed over command of Eastern Area to Air Commodore John Summers in July 1943.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One, p. 303 Group Captain Alister Murdoch became senior air staff officer (SASO).Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 412 On 22 October, Avro Lancaster Q-for-Queenie, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Peter Isaacson, \\"buzzed\\" the Eastern Area headquarters building in Edgecliff before flying under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, flouting regulations and becoming the largest aircraft to pull such a stunt. The same month, the Air Board proposed carving a new area command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for division. The new command, to be known as Central Area, would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland; the War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland; again, nothing came of the proposal.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One, pp. 214‚Äì217, 227‚Äì228 Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth was appointed AOC Eastern Area in December 1943. Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed \\"a general slackening off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft\\". The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that an observant submarine captain could easily avoid.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 349Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 258 Charlesworth relinquished command in September 1944 to take over North- Western Area.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One, p. 304 In December, aircraft from Eastern Area took part in the search for the German submarine U-862, but could not prevent it sinking the Liberty ship Robert J. Walker on Christmas; a Beaufort of No. 15 Squadron, based at Camden, located the wreck. No. 32 Squadron lost a Beaufort with its crew shortly after takeoff from Lowood during the search for U-862, which was called off in January 1945.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 269‚Äì272Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 350‚Äì351 That month, Air Commodore Leon Lachal became AOC Eastern Area, and held command for the duration of the Pacific War. Leon Lachal (pictured in 1940), AOC Eastern Area twice in 1945‚Äì47 =Post-war activity and reorganisation= On 2 September 1945, following the end of the Pacific War, South West Pacific Area was dissolved and the Air Board again assumed full control of all its operational elements.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force! Volume One, p. 262 According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, the AOC Eastern Area was considered \\"Australia's senior operational airman\\" and delegated by the Chief of the Air Staff with day-to-day responsibility for the nation's air defence.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 344 Most of the RAAF's bases and aircraft employed in operations were situated within Eastern Area's sphere of control in New South Wales and southern Queensland.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 72‚Äì73 Air Commodore Frank Lukis succeeded Lachal as AOC in December 1945. By the end of the month, headquarters staff numbered 1,122, including 104 officers.Eastern Area Headquarters, Operations Record Book, pp. 1101, 1105 No. 82 (Bomber) Wing came under the control of Eastern Area Command in April 1946, when it moved to RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland; initially operating B-24 Liberators, the wing re-equipped with Avro Lincolns soon after.Bennett, Highest Traditions, pp. 250‚Äì251 By this time Eastern Area headquarters occupied seven mansions in Point Piper, Sydney; it subsequently relocated to Bradfield Park. Lukis retired from the Air Force in May, and Charlesworth took over command. In July‚ÄìAugust 1946, Eastern Area Command oversaw the establishment of No. 86 (Transport) Wing, operating C-47 Dakotas, at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, displacing No. 78 (Fighter) Wing, which moved to RAAF Station Williamtown, and began operating P-51 Mustangs. The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal was part of a much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries largely remained in place.Helson, The Private Air Marshal, pp. 321‚Äì325Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 68, 462 Lachal succeeded Charlesworth as AOC Eastern Area in October, and held command until his retirement from the Air Force in July 1947. Air Vice Marshal McCauley, the last AOC Eastern Area, c. October 1953 Lachal's successor as AOC Eastern Area, Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin, was responsible for preparing the transfer of its headquarters from Bradfield Park to the former Lapstone Hotel at Glenbrook in the Lower Blue Mountains, a process that was completed in 1949.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 69‚Äì71 As well as commanding a view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within of the City of Penrith and of RAAF Station Richmond, and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered, according to government correspondence, \\"complete protection from Atom Bomb attack\\". An adjoining property, \\"Briarcliffe\\", was purchased soon afterwards to augment the new headquarters' accommodation facilities. Bladin completed his term as AOC Eastern Area in October 1948. Air Vice Marshal John McCauley was appointed AOC in March the following year. McCauley commanded Eastern Area during the early years of the Malayan Emergency, and oversaw the deployment of to administer RAAF units stationed there‚Äîa Lincoln squadron detached from No. 82 Wing and a Dakota squadron from No. 86 Wing.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 246‚Äì247 Having re- equipped with de Havilland Vampire jets, No. 78 Wing departed Williamtown for garrison duties with the RAF on Malta in July 1952.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 202‚Äì203 In May 1953, Eastern Area's SASO, Group Captain Frank Headlam, announced that the Air Force was planning to re-equip No. 82 Wing with English Electric Canberra jet bombers, and also procure CAC Sabre swept-wing jet fighters. The Federal government retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 and replaced him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re- organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command as it was considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 73‚Äì76, 462‚Äì463 Aftermath The functional commands established in 1953‚Äì54 were revised in 1959. Home Command was renamed Operational Command, and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become Support Command.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 76‚Äì77 Operational Command was renamed Air Command in 1987, and three years later Support Command split into Logistics Command and Training Command.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 150‚Äì151 Throughout the evolution from Home to Operational to Air Command, the headquarters remained at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains. In 1997, logistics management became the responsibility of Support Command (Air Force), the RAAF component of the Defence-wide Support Command Australia (later subsumed by the Defence Materiel Organisation).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 307Horner, Making the Australian Defence Force, pp. 278‚Äì279 Training Command was re-formed as Air Force Training Group, a force element group under Air Command, in 2006. Air Command was then the sole command-level organisation in the RAAF.

He attended Sadiki College from 1950‚Äì1956, then studied medicine in France to become a radiologist. In 1970 he returned to Tunisia, joined the University of Tunis's medical faculty and worked also at the university hospital. In 1976 he was one of the founders of a weekly opinion magazine and an organization that evolved into the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH). In 1978 he joined others to start a political party, the Movement of Socialist Democrats (MDS). The MDS was the largest opposition party as of 1991 and the ruling party made an apparent attempt to work with the MDS as a \\"participatory opposition.\\" Ben Jafar was the secretary-general of the MDS in 1992, and ran for the top MDS office, but lost to Mohamed Moadda, and resigned from the party because it seemed to have cooperated with the ruling party so much (receiving a government subsidy and accommodations) and achieved so little.Murphy, Emma.

They ranged in size from the 50-centimeter-long Pumiliopareia to the 3-meter-long Scutosaurus. Velosaurs were some of the largest reptiles of their time. Description Velosaurs were large reptiles that were characterized by their short tails, small heads, broad feet, and their legs, which were directly in between sprawling and semi-erect. Velosaurs' bodies were covered in osteoderms and smaller scales all over. Their heads came in all sorts of different shapes; from the cheek-frilled Scutosaurus to the spiky-headed Elginia to the nose-horned Arganaceras. They were herbivorous, and it is believed that their large bodies housed a complex gut. Classification Some paleontologists believe velosaurs to be the direct ancestors to turtles. They argue that the smaller pumiliopareiasaurs evolved large, plate-like scutes that laid flat on their backs and eventually evolved into shells. This is highly disputed, though. Most scientists currently believe turtles to be more closely related to sauropterygians. Below is a cladogram by Tsuji et al. (2013): Paleobiology Velosaurs were definitely herbivorous. They are generally thought to be slow-moving terrestrial animals, although some believe that they are semi-aquatic. References * Lee, M.S.Y.

History The Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was founded by Hern√°n Siles Zuazo, a leader of the leftist sector of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement. He had earlier been Vice-President (1951), had led a revolution (1952) and had been President (1956‚Äì1960); he had been in exile in 1946‚Äì1951 and 1964‚Äì1978. In 1971, a leader of MNR V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro supported the far-Right coup triggered by Colonel Hugo Banzer Su√°rez, and the MNR became officially a member of the regime, along with the party's traditional enemy, the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB). V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro's entry into the pro-Hugo Banzer Popular Nationalist Front with the FSB provoked Hern√°n Siles Zuazo's formal exit from the party, to form the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement of the Left. Political parties of the Americas: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies. Greenwood Press, 1982. P. 138. Values The MNRI sought the establishment of a government \\"truly representative of workers and peasants\\"; an end to \\"fratricidal struggles\\"; the suppression of the drug trade, and the renegotiation of foreign debt. Political parties of the world. Longman, 1988. P. 68. Actions The Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was the leading force in the Democratic and Popular Union, formed in April 1978 and including the Revolutionary Left Movement and the Communist Party of Bolivia (PCB), and in mid-1979. In the presidential elections of 1978 Hern√°n Siles Zuazo, as the UDP candidate, came second with 25.00%, and of 1979 and 1980 he came first with 35.97 and 38.74 per cent, and only the 1980 military coup prevented his inauguration as President. He returned from exile (in Peru) on 8 October 1982, and two days later was confirmed as President by the reconvened Congress. Elections in the Americas : a data handbook / ed. by Dieter Nohlen, Vol. 2. [Oxford] [u.a.]: Oxford Univ. Press, 2005. P.151. Politics The Democratic and Popular Union coalition government was increasingly dominated by the MNRI, with the Revolutionary Left Movement withdrawing its support from January 1983 to April 1984, and again from December 1984; the Communist Party of Bolivia withdrew its backing in November 1984. By 1985 the Hern√°n Siles Zuazo regime was opposed by the left, the army, the unions and the peasantry, and early elections (in June) revealed the extent of its unpopularity: the MNRI won only 8 seats, as against 57 won by the UDP in 1980, and the MNRI presidential candidate, Roberto Jordan Pando, won only 05.48% votes, coming fourth.

Scott Mainwaring, Timothy Scully. Building democratic institutions: party systems in Latin America. Stanford University Press, 1995. P.426. When Hern√°n Siles Zuazo became President, splits in the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement of the Left were already very visible. At least three factions were identifiable: the ‚ÄúPalaciego‚Äù, which surrounded Hern√°n Siles Zuazo; the MNRI-Legalista, which in 1983 joined the opposition in National Congress; and the Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement - 20th Century, a group of technocrats. In the long run the Palaciego and Siglo XX factions prevailed. Scott Mainwaring, Timothy Scully. Building democratic institutions: party systems in Latin America. Stanford University Press, 1995. P.426. Dispersal Owing to Hern√°n Siles Zuazo's deteriorating health, the Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement gradually disappeared.

Although he retired in 1983 without flying in space, Kolodin served non-flying assignments on several spaceflights. Biography Kolodin was born in Novovasilyevka, Soviet Union (now in Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine). In 1959, he graduated from Military Academy of Engineering and Radioengineering with gold medal. Kolodin then became an engineer-officer in the Soviet Armed Forces until his selection as a cosmonaut. He was selected as a Soviet cosmonaut as part of the TsPK Group 2 in 1963. He entered cosmonaut training in January 1963 and completed training in January 1966. After completing his training, Kolodin served non-flight (backup) roles on the Voskhod 2, Soyuz 5, Soyuz 7, Soyuz 11, and Soyuz 12 spaceflights. He trained as test engineer of the 1st crew to fly on Soyuz 11 to 1st visit the Salyut 1 space station, but the entire crew was bumped when it was suspected that flight engineer Valeri Kubasov had contracted tuberculosis. The crew that replaced them perished during their mission when their capsule depressurized during preparations for re-entry. Then he was in the 1st crew of the 1st visitation mission to Salyut 6 space station with Vladimir Dzhanibekov as a commander (future Soyuz 27). But after the unsuccessful mission of Soyuz 25 it was decided to include in the crews cosmonauts with the flight experience, so he was replaced by Oleg Makarov. Kolodin later worked as a flight controller until his retirement on 20 April 1983. He is married and has one son.

The Border Line was planned to slow or hold an invading force at the border. It consisted of a series of bunkers spaced at short intervals along the French, German and Austrian borders. The bunkers were reinforced by larger multi-blockhouse forts at key points. Most of the positions were within two or three kilometers of the frontier. Major positions Major forts on the Border Line included, from west to east: * Fort de Pr√©-Giroud near Vallorbe on the French border * Fort de Plainbois about west of Basel * Fort Reuenthal about northwest of Zurich * Fort Ebersberg halfway between Schaffhausen and Zurich, where German and Swiss territory interlock with each other * Fort Heldsberg at St. Margrethen on the Austrian borderKauffmann, pp. 157-158 Description The Border Line bunkers were spaced between and along the northern border of Switzerland.Kauffmann, pp. 155-156 A number were integrated into bridge crossings of the Rhine and other rivers. The large forts were armed with 75mm artillery and anti-tank weapons, and were usually built into the forward slope of a hill. The blockhouses were connected and supported by an underground gallery system giving access and shelter to underground barracks, ammunition magazines, command posts and utility services. Compared with the Maginot Line, whose function was similar, the positions were less well-protected and lacked the ability to fire laterally along the line of attack from a sheltered location. The Border Line forts did not deploy a defense in depth. History Work on the Border Line began in 1937 and was generally complete by 1940. However, with the German invasion of France in 1940, it became clear to the Swiss Armed Forces that the Border Line could not deter or withstand a direct German attack. Swiss priorities shifted to a policy of quick withdrawal to the National Redoubt in the Alps, there to maintain a government-in-being and to control the strategic crossings of the Alps for an extended time. While the German Operation Tannenbaum set forth a plan to invade Switzerland, the operation was never carried out.Kauffmann, p. 152-153 The Swiss war plan, devised by General Henri Guisan, envisioned the use of the Border Line as a delaying position, backed by a further hold line, the so-called Army Line, to give the bulk of Swiss forces time to retreat to the Redoubt destroying access points once Swiss forces were safely inside.Kauffmann, p.159 Following World War II the main border positions remained manned. However, by the 1980s it became apparent that the positions were obsolete, and were gradually decommissioned, even before the Army 95 stand-down of many Swiss fortifications. A number of the positions have become museums and may be toured. See also * Toblerone line, a related line between Lausanne and Geneva, facing France.

Soffer is one of the founders of the University of Haifa. He is known for his research into demographic, water, environmental, political, and strategy issues of the state of Israel. Soffer has been vocal about the very existence of Palestinians as posing a \\"demographic threat\\" in that they may not be a minority population and thus they are a threat by the ability to vote. His alleged obsession with the demographic threat posed by Arabs led to some of his colleagues at the University of Haifa nicknaming him \\"Arnon the Arab-counter\\", a joking reference to the fact that the Hebrew surname Soffer literally means \\"one who counts\\". As such he has been credited with working to implement the \\"separation policy\\" of Israel. This has been labeled by some as modeling an apartheid protocol.Apartheid  Biography  Soffer was born in Tel Aviv and grew up in Rishon LeZion, which was originally a moshava and became a city when he turned 15 (in 1950). He and his classmates from the Gymnasia Realit formed the first handball team of the city, which operated under the auspices of \\"Maccabi\\". In the 1950s Soffer played in Israel's handball national team. During his military service in the IDF, he served in the Nahal Brigade. Soffer has three academic degrees from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1965, he was granted a position as a lecturer at the University of Haifa.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 river in central Kentucky. The river flows through Marion and Hardin counties, as well as being the border between LaRue and Nelson counties. The Rolling Fork drains much of the land in these counties, and is a key part of life in this area of the Knob Region. The Rolling Fork is a part of the Salt River Basin, and the larger Ohio River Basin.  Geography  The Rolling Fork begins in southern Boyle County. It winds through the county, gradually increasing in size. After passing through Marion County, the Rolling Fork moves to be the border of LaRue County and Nelson County, starting near the High View area. The river snakes along Nelson and LaRue Counties, making a u-shaped bend along the Knobs. The rivers goes on and gains size when the Beech Fork joins it near Youngers Creek, a community in Hardin County that borders Nelson County. Eventually, the Rolling Fork joins the Salt River at the Hardin County - Bullitt County line. The Salt River empties into the Ohio River about later, at West Point, Kentucky. The Rolling Fork has a mean annual discharge of 1,828 cubic feet per second at Boston, per data collected during the period 1939-2015.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ky/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=03301500&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw The Rolling Fork winds through the Knobs of the region. These knobs shape the river and add to it the various \\"hallows\\" and bends that characterize the terrain. The river lies in beautiful valleys, and sets alongside many rich river bottoms. These bottoms provide excellent growing opportunities for grain farms, and surrounding pasture for cattle. The river valley is somewhat prone to flooding. Major flooding occurred most recently on the week after May 1, 2010. This flooding deeply impacted the communities, spilling water in New Haven, Howardstown and elsewhere. The raging waters scoured river bottoms and deposited brush and gravel there. In New Haven, the flood waters damaged the Kentucky Railway Museum.K R M suffered serious damage from heavy rain on May 1 and 2. Water was over 3 ft in the Model Train center / crew room area. Multiple washouts on the main line totaled over .  Wildlife  The Rolling Fork and its valleys are home to a wonderful wildlife variety. There is a healthy population of white-tailed deer, squirrels, opossums, beavers, skunks, and rabbits. Birds such as the great blue heron and kingfisher call the river valley home. Canada geese and sandhill cranes also pass through on migrating patterns. The waters of the river host catfish, some bluegill and sunfish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and even gar. Also residing in the area are a variety of turtles, snakes - some rattlesnakes - and skinks and salamanders.  People  The Rolling Fork is an essential part of the communities on or by it. The river valleys provide crop ground for farming operations and help provide in the local economy. The river is used for fishing, and the area around it is hunted for recreation. = Communities on the Rolling Fork = Holy Name of Mary Church (Calvary, Kentucky) * Calvary, Kentucky (in Marion County) * High View, Kentucky (Marion County) * Gleanings, Kentucky (LaRue County) * Howardstown, Kentucky (Nelson County) * New Haven, Kentucky (Nelson County) * Boston, Kentucky (Nelson County) * Lebanon Junction, Kentucky (Bullitt County) * Lyon Station, Kentucky (LaRue County) * Youngers Creek, Kentucky (Hardin County) * Bradfordsville, Kentucky (Marion County) * Gravel Switch, Kentucky (Marion County) * Forkland, Kentucky (Boyle County) See also * List of rivers of Kentucky  References Category:Rivers of Kentucky Category:Bodies of water of Marion County, Kentucky Category:Bodies of water of LaRue County, Kentucky Category:Bodies of water of Nelson County, Kentucky Category:Bodies of water of Bullitt County, Kentucky Category:Rivers of Hardin County, Kentucky ","title":"Rolling Fork (Kentucky)"},{"id":"30501652","text":"The constituency Grevenmacher elected members to Luxembourg's national legislature, the Chamber of Deputies, from 1848 until its abolition in 1919.

It is located north of Omaha, Nebraska. It was closed in 1968. History Omaha Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 789th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at the station on 1 May 1951. The squadron first operated an AN/CPS-4 and AN/FPS-3 radar at Omaha in April 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar. Eventually the Air Force replaced the height-finder radar with an AN/FPS-6, and replaced the AN/FPS-3 search radar with an AN/FPS-20. In late 1959 this station was also performing air traffic control duties for the FAA. An Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) was established at Omaha AFS in 1959 for Nike missile command-and-control functions as part of the Offutt AFB Defense Area. The site was equipped with the AN/GSG-5(V) BIRDIE solid-state computer system. The Army Nike radars were fully integrated with the Air Force sets. Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) operations began in 1961, initially feeding data to DC-08 at Richards-Gebaur AFB, Missouri. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 789th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 January 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24x7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. A second height- finder radar (AN/FPS-6A) was installed in 1962. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-71. In addition to the main facility, Omaha AFS operated one AN/FPS-18 \\"Gap Filler\\" site: * Dallas Center AFS, IA (P-71D) Dallas Center was taken over in 1957 after its closure as M-122. It was operated until its final closure in December 1967. In 1964 the AN/FPS-20A radar was upgraded to become an AN/FPS-66, then updated again to an AN/FPS-66A in 1967. The 789th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated 8 September 1968, and the search radar was transferred to the FAA. Omaha AFS is an FAA site, using the Air Force AN/FPS-66A radar as part of the NAS Defense Program until February 2014.

It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it as a member of the tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A. vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow on conifer litter or on conifer cones that may be partially or completely buried in soil. The dark brown cap of the small, spoon-shaped mushroom is covered with fine brown hairs, and reaches a diameter of up to . On the underside of the cap are a crowded array of tiny tooth-shaped protrusions (\\"teeth\\") up to 3 mm long; they are initially whitish to purplish- pink before turning brown in age. The dark brown and hairy stem, up to long and 2 mm thick, attaches to one edge of the cap. The mushroom produces a white spore print out of roughly spherical spores. High levels of humidity are essential for optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either too much or too little light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A. vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions. History, taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other tooth fungi in the genus Hydnum: H. imbricatum, H. repandum, and H. tomentosum. In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H. auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant the creation of a new genus, Auriscalpium, to contain it. In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare. Otto Kuntze and Howard James Banker later independently sought to restore Linnaeus' species name, but the resulting combination (Auriscalpium auriscalpium) is a tautonym and disallowed under the rules for botanical nomenclature (ICBN 2005 rule 23.4), and these combinations are therefore no longer validly published. Other names given to the fungus and now considered synonyms include Hydnum fechtneri, named by Josef Velenovsk√Ω in 1922, and later combinations based on this name. A. vulgare is the type species of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to. Despite vast differences in appearance and morphology, A. vulgare is related to such varied taxa as the gilled fungi of Lentinus, the poroid genus Albatrellus, the coral-like Clavicorona, and fellow tooth fungus Hericium. The relationship of all of these taxa‚Äîmembers of the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales‚Äîhas been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics. Auriscalpium vulgare is commonly known as the \\"pinecone mushroom\\", the \\"cone tooth\\", \\"pine cone tooth\\", or the \\"ear-pick fungus\\". Gray called it the \\"common earpick-stool\\"; it was also referred to as the \\"fir-cone Hydnum\\", when it was still considered to be a member of that genus. The specific epithet vulgare means \\"common\\". The generic name Auriscalpium is Latin for \\"ear pick\\" and refers to a small, scoop-shaped instrument used to remove foreign matter from the ear. Description The fruit body of A. vulgare is fibrous when fresh and becomes stiff when dry. It is a small species rarely exceeding in height, with a cap usually smaller than an adult's fingernails: ‚Äîalthough it has been known to reach up to . Auriscalpium vulgare usually has a single stem, but occasionally several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches to the side of the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown‚Äìroughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely. The cap flesh is composed of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied to the surface of the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black. The mushroom, which has no distinct taste or odor, is generally considered inedible because of its toughness and diminutive size. An 1887 textbook noted, however, that it was \\"commonly eaten in France and Italy\\". =Microscopic characteristics= Microscopy image of a tooth at 100x magnification, stained with Melzer's reagent Spore deposits are white. Viewed under a light microscope, the spores appear hyaline (translucent), covered with minute wart-like bumps, and are spherical or nearly so, with dimensions of 4.6‚Äì5.5 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. They are amyloid (reacting to Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilous (staining in methyl blue). The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are four-spored with basal clamps, and measure 15‚Äì24 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm, and sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that bear the spores) are swollen at the base and roughly 3 ¬µm long. The hyphal system is dimitic, comprising both generative (undifferentiated) and skeletal (structural) hyphae. The thin- walled generative hyphae are hyaline, and have clamp connections; the thick- walled skeletal hyphae are thicker overall and lack such connections. The cortex (the tougher outer layer of flesh) is made of parallel unbranched generative hyphae that are brown, thick-walled, clumped together, and frequently clamped. The internal flesh is made of interwoven generative and skeletal hyphae. Gloeoplerous hyphae (containing oily or granular contents) are also present, protruding into the hymenium as club-like or sharp-pointed gloeocystidia. The hyphae of basidiomycetous fungi are partitioned by cross- walls called septa, and these septa have pores that permit the passage of cytoplasm or protoplasm between adjacent hyphal compartments. In an effort to determine ultrastructural characters useful for systematic and phylogenetic analyses of the Agaricomycotina, Gail Celio and colleagues used electron microscopy to examine both the structure of the septal pore, and nuclear division in A. vulgare. They determined that septa found in hyphae of the hymenium have bell-shaped pore \\"caps\\" with multiple perforations. Each cap extends along the length of the septum, along with a zone surrounding the pore that is free of organelles. Due to the scarcity of similar data from other Agaricomycotina species, it is unknown whether the extended septal pore cap margins of A. vulgare are phylogenetically informative. Regarding nuclear division, the process of metaphase I of meiosis is similar to the metaphase of mitosis. Spherical spindle pole bodies containing electron-opaque inclusions are set within gaps on opposite ends of the nuclear membrane. This membrane has occasional gaps but is largely continuous. Fragments of endoplasmic reticulum occur near the spindle pole bodies, but do not form a cap. Growth in culture Auriscalpium vulgare can be grown in pure culture on agar- containing plates supplemented with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above the surface of the agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6 mm and 15 mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4 mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar. The mature mycelium consists of thin- walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5‚Äì3.2 ¬µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched at an angle of about 45¬∞, with a clamp at the base of the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin- walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50‚Äì85 by 6.5‚Äì8.5 ¬µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals. Fruiting begins about six weeks after the initial inoculation on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow very close to the initial site of inoculation‚Äîwithin 3 mm‚Äîand take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form. Fruit body development Growth on a fir cone; the inset images depict the cap at different stages of development. Illustrated by Eugenius Warming. Fruit body primordia first appear between the scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48‚Äì72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances on the part of the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards. When grown in favorable conditions of high water availability and humidity, the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on all parts of its upper and lower surfaces. These secondary growths typically number between four and seven; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a relative humidity (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65‚Äì75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse. Light also affects fruit body development: both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth. When a stem is developing, the fungus is negatively geotropic, so that if the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic‚Äîthey will grow at right angles to the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal. Habitat and distribution Growing on a Douglas-fir cone Auriscalpium vulgare is a saprobic species. Its mushrooms grow solitary or clustered on fallen pine cones, especially those that are fully or partially buried. It typically favors Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris), but has also been reported on spruce cones, and in California grows primarily on Douglas-fir cones. One author noted finding the mushroom on spruce needles on top of squirrel dens where cone bracts were present in the forest floor. In a study conducted in the Laojun Mountain region of Yunnan Province, China, A. vulgare was found to be one of the most dominant species collected from mixed forest at an altitude of . A study on the effect of slash and burn practices in northeast India showed that the fungus prefers to fruit on burned cones of the Khasi Pine, and that the number of fruit bodies on unburned cones increases with cone girth. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central and North America, temperate Asia, and Turkey. In North America, its range extends from Canada to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt south of Mexico City. The mushroom is common, appearing in the summer and autumn, although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration. A. vulgare is the only representative of its genus in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.

Nevertheless, he believed that Native Americans were culturally and technologically inferior. Miller, 1980, pp. 66‚Äì67 Like many contemporaries, he believed that Indian lands should be taken over by white people. Jefferson never removed any Native Americans. However in private letters he did suggest various ideas for removing tribes from enclaves in the East to their own new lands in lands west of the Mississippi. Indian Removal was passed by Congress in 1831, long after he died. Before and during his presidency, Jefferson discussed the need for respect, brotherhood, and trade with the Native Americans, and he initially believed that forcing them to adopt European-style agriculture and modes of living would allow them to quickly \\"progress\\" from \\"savagery\\" to \\"civilization\\". Beginning in 1803, Jefferson's private letters show increasing support for the idea of removal. Jefferson maintained that Indians had land \\"to spare\\" and, he thought, would willingly exchange it for guaranteed supplies of food and equipment.Christian B. Keller, \\"Philanthropy betrayed: Thomas Jefferson, the Louisiana Purchase, and the origins of federal Indian removal policy.\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 144.1 (2000): 39-66. online Jefferson's view of Native Americans Jefferson was fascinated with Indian cultures and languages. His home at Monticello was filled with Indian artifacts obtained from the Lewis and Clark expedition. He collected information on the vocabulary and grammar of Indian languages. Acculturation and assimilation Andrew Jackson is often credited with initiating Indian Removal, because Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1831, during his presidency, and also because of his personal involvement in the forceful removal of many Eastern Indian tribes. Congress was implementing suggestions laid out by Jefferson in a series of private letters that began in 1804, although Jefferson did not implement the plan during his own presidency.Miller, 2006: p. 90 The rise of Napoleon in Europe, and rumor of a possible transfer of the Louisiana Territory from the Spanish empire to the more aggressive French, was cause for consternation amongst some people in the American republic. Jefferson advocated for the militarization of the Western border, along the Mississippi River. He felt that the best way to accomplish this was to flood the area with a large population of white settlements. Still recovering from the American Revolutionary War, the U.S. federal government was unable to risk starting a broad conflict with the powerful tribes that surrounded their borders. They were worried that this would cause a broader Indian War, and which would perhaps be joined by Britain, France or Spain..Rockwell, 2010: pp. 38‚Äì39 In his instructions to Meriwether Lewis, Jefferson emphasized the necessity for treating all Indian tribes in the most conciliatory manner.Harry W. Fritz (2004). \\"The Lewis and Clark Expedition\\". Greenwood Publishing Group. p.13. Jefferson wanted to expand his borders into the Indian territories, without causing a full-blown war. Jefferson's original plan was to coerce native peoples to give up their own cultures, religions, and lifestyles in favor of western European culture, Christian religion, and a sedentary agricultural lifestyle.Drinnon, 1997: Jefferson's expectation was that by assimilating the natives into a market-based, agricultural society and stripping them of their self-sufficiency, they would become economically heavily dependent on trade with white Americans, and would thereby be willing to give up land that they would otherwise not part with, in exchange for trade goods or to resolve unpaid debts.Owens, 2007: pp. 76‚Äì77Sheehan, 1974: p. 171Rockwell, 2010: p. 88 In an 1803 private letter to William Henry Harrison, Jefferson wrote: :To promote this disposition to exchange lands, which they have to spare and we want, for necessaries, which we have to spare and they want, we shall push our trading uses, and be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run in debt, because we observe that when these debts get beyond what the individuals can pay, they become willing to lop them off by a cession of lands.... In this way our settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach the Indians, and they will in time either incorporate with us as citizens of the United States, or remove beyond the Mississippi. The former is certainly the termination of their history most happy for themselves; but, in the whole course of this, it is essential to cultivate their love. As to their fear, we presume that our strength and their weakness is now so visible that they must see we have only to shut our hand to crush them, and that all our liberalities to them proceed from motives of pure humanity only. Should any tribe be foolhardy enough to take up the hatchet at any time, the seizing the whole country of that tribe, and driving them across the Mississippi, as the only condition of peace, would be an example to others, and a furtherance of our final consolidation. Jefferson believed that this strategy would \\"get rid of this pest, without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians\\". He stated that Harrison was to keep the contents of the letter \\"sacred\\" and \\"kept within [Harrison's] own breast, and especially how improper for the Indians to understand. For their interests and their tranquility, it is best they should see only the present age of their history.\\"Drinnon, 1997: pp. 87‚Äì88 Forced removal In cases where Native tribes resisted assimilation, Jefferson believed that to avoid war and probable extermination they should be forcefully relocated and sent west. As Jefferson put it in a letter to Alexander von Humboldt in 1813: :You know, my friend, the benevolent plan we were pursuing here for the happiness of the aboriginal inhabitants in our vicinities. We spared nothing to keep them at peace with one another. To teach them agriculture and the rudiments of the most necessary arts, and to encourage industry by establishing among them separate property. In this way they would have been enabled to subsist and multiply on a moderate scale of landed possession. They would have mixed their blood with ours, and been amalgamated and identified with us within no distant period of time. On the commencement of our present war, we pressed on them the observance of peace and neutrality, but the interested and unprincipled policy of England has defeated all our labors for the salvation of these unfortunate people. They have seduced the greater part of the tribes within our neighborhood, to take up the hatchet against us, and the cruel massacres they have committed on the women and children of our frontiers taken by surprise, will oblige us now to pursue them to extermination, or drive them to new seats beyond our reach. He told his Secretary of War, General Henry Dearborn (who was the primary government official responsible for Indian affairs): \\"if we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated, or driven beyond the Mississippi.\\"James P. Ronda, Thomas Jefferson and the changing West: from conquest to conservation (1997) p. 10; text in Jefferson's first promotions of Indian Removal were between 1776 and 1779, when he recommended forcing the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes to be driven out of their ancestral homelands to lands west of the Mississippi River. Indian removal, said Jefferson, was the only way to ensure the survival of Native American peoples.Jennifer McClinton-Temple, Alan R. Velie (2007). \\"Encyclopedia of American Indian literature\\". Infobase Publishing. p.295. His first such act as president, was to make a deal with the state of Georgia that if Georgia were to release its legal claims to discovery in lands to the west, then the U.S. military would help forcefully expel the Cherokee people from Georgia. At the time, the Cherokee had a treaty with the United States government which guaranteed them the right to their lands, which was violated in Jefferson's deal with Georgia.

He was born to Sherman and Roxie Mortensen in Ephraim, Utah on July 6, 1939. Kay graduated from Snow College, Utah State University, and finally from the University of Utah where he received a Ph.D. in Metallurgy. Kay was a professor of mechanical engineering at Brigham Young University for 37 years where he taught courses in manufacturing design, engineering technology, and mechanical engineering until his retirement. Three weeks before his murder he was released from serving as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Provo, Utah Mission at Cove Fort, Utah (now part of the St. George, Utah Mission). Home invasion On November 16, 2009 at about 7 p.m. Kay's daughter-in-law Pam Mortensen called 911 to report that she and her husband Roger, Kay's son, had arrived at Kay's home and had been promptly tied up by two young men described as clean-cut white males. After the men left, Roger and Pam freed themselves, Pam called 911, and Roger went upstairs to find that Kay had been murdered. Kent Carroll, a neighbor of Mortensen's family said they were planning to gather at the house Monday evening to play board games. Kay Mortensen's wife, Darla, was returning from Salt Lake County where she had gone to be with her daughter who was having a baby. Convictions Kay Mortensen's son, Roger Kay Mortensen, 48, and daughter-in- law Pamela Mortensen, 34, were eventually charged with the murder. They were arrested on August 4, 2010 and booked into the Utah County Jail. The police claimed that Roger's and Pam's stories were inconsistent. A search of Roger's home revealed he had possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a firearm by a restricted person. They also found hidden an AK-47 and a 12-gauge shotgun. A .22 caliber revolver was also found in a safe in the garage. A Grand Jury was impaneled, which found that Roger and Pam should stand trial for Kay's murder. On December 7, 2010, after serving four months in jail, Utah County exonerated Roger and Pamela Mortensen of the murder of Roger's father. Prosecutors moved to dismiss charges against the couple. That same day, they arrested two 23-year-old Vernal, Utah men, Benjamin David Rettig and Martin Cameron Bond, who is the son of a close friend of Kay Mortensen, after Martin Bond's ex-wife called police, turning him in. They were both charged by Utah County with aggravated murder, aggravated burglary and aggravated kidnapping. An anonymous informant advised police of the whereabouts of the suspects. When confronted, Bond showed detectives where he had allegedly buried weapons to conceal them. They found 14 shotguns, rifles and handguns buried at a location in Vernal and other weapons in a septic tank at a park in the area. The firearms had the serial numbers scratched off. Rettig was in possession of Roger Mortensen's driver's license. Rettig claimed that he and Bond had tied up Pamela and Roger Mortensen after the older Mortensen's throat had already been cut. After nearly five hours of deliberation, a jury found Martin Cameron Bond guilty of the 2009 slaying. A jury of five men and three women found the 25-year-old guilty of aggravated murder, three counts of aggravated kidnapping, and one count each of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.

He is said to be the son of a slave girl in the household of Rani Daya Kaur. Procured by Daya Kaur and presented to, and accepted by Maharaja Ranjit Singh as his son. After the assassination of Maharaja Sher Singh he made a bid for the throne of the Sikh Empire. Took refuge in British territory, 1844-1845. Returned to the Punjab, revolted and pardoned several times. He was strangled by Fateh Khan Tiwana and Sardar Chattar Singh Attariwala, at Attock, while in safe custody, 30th August 1845. He had only one son, Sardar Jagjoth Singh. Emergence as a contender for the throne Little is recorded about the early life of Pashaura Singh during the reigns of Ranjit Singh and his first four successors. After the assassination, on 15 September 1843, of Maharaha Sher Singh and his vizier Raja Dhian Singh Dogra, the Khalsa proclaimed Duleep Singh as Maharaja and Dhian Singh‚Äôs son, Hira Singh Dogra, as vizier. Later that year Pashaura Singh and his elder brother, Kashmira Singh, are recorded as having joined the camp of the holy man, Baba Bir Singh at Naura·πÖgƒÅbƒÅd, near Tarn TƒÅran. The camp had become the centre of Sikh revolt against the dominance of the Dogras and was a base for several Sikh sardars and commanders and a volunteer army of 1,200 musket men and 3,000 horse. In May 1844 Hira Singh despatched a force of 20,000 men and 50 cannon under the command of Mian Labh Singh to destroy Bir Singh‚Äôs camp. Bir Singh told his men not to fight \\"How can we attack our brethren?‚Äù He was killed by a shell while meditating over the Holy Book. Kashmira Singh was also killed in the cannonade, but Pashaura Singh escaped. Pashaura Singh visited Lahore later in 1844 in an unsuccessful attempt to form an alliance with Hira Singh, who, however had his own problems. He had lost favour with the Khalsa, because of several unpopular actions, including: his involvement in the death of Bir Singh, his confiscation of the jagirs of some of the army commanders, and his attempt to poison the Regent, Maharani Jind Kaur. He escaped from Lahore with several loads of gold and silver stolen from the treasury, but was pursued by the army, who killed him on 21 December 1844. Renewed bid for the throne During the second half of 1844, Pashaura Singh travelled around the Punjab seeking support against the Dogras. He crossed the Sutlej River and visited the British cantonment at Ferozepur. However, the British were unresponsive, being already in negotiation with Gulab Singh Dogra, brother of Dhian Singh. On learning of the death of Hira Singh, Pashaura Singh returned to Lahore on 1 January 1845. He was received with honour and goodwill in the court, and was offered presents of jewels, elephants and horses. Some of the army commanders proposed that he should be made Maharaja in place of the six-year-old Duleep Singh. However, some influential members of the Supreme Council of the Khalsa and the regimental committees supported the young Maharaja and his mother, Maharani Jind Kaur. They requested him to return to his estates, with a promise of an increase in his jagir, and the army ordered him to leave Lahore. A new vizier, the Maharani‚Äôs brother, Jawahar Singh, was appointed on 14 May 1845 and immediately despatched artillery against a force being assembled by Pashaura Singh. The Prince capitulated, but was allowed to go free. Attock rebellion Two months later, in July 1845, Pashaura Singh took the fort at Attock with a handful of Pathan followers and declared himself to be the ruler of the Punjab. He raised fresh levies and, with the money that the fort yielded to him, tried to obtain help from the chiefs within the kingdom, from Jehlum to Khaibar, and even opened negotiations with Dost Muhammad. After hearing of the rebellion in Attock, Jawahar Singh ordered Chattar Singh Attariwalla and Malik Fateh Khan Tiwana to recapture the fort and defeat Pashaura Singh. The prince was forced to surrender the fort on 30 August 1845 and place himself at the disposal of Chattar Singh, after receiving assurances of safe passage to Lahore and the retention of his estates at Sialkot. However, Jawahar Singh considered that the Prince posed too great a threat to his nephew, the young Maharaja, and sent instructions that Pashaura Singh be disposed of immediately. The prince was secretly removed from his personal bodyguard on 11 September 1845, and taken back by Fateh Khan Tiwana to Attock where he was strangled. For his part in this, Jawahar Singh was speared to death by the army on 21 September 1845 in front of his sister, the agonised Maharani.

The process optimally transfers partial information using entanglement and classical communication. It allows for sending information using an amount of entanglement given by the conditional quantum entropy, H(AB)\\\\,=\\\\,H(AB)-H(B) \\\\, . with H(A) the Von Neumann entropy, H(A):=-Tr\\\\rho_A\\\\log\\\\rho_A. It thus provides an operational meaning to this quantity. Unlike its classical counterpart, the quantum conditional entropy can be negative. In this case, the sender can transfer the state to the receiver using no entanglement, and as an added bonus, this amount of entanglement can be gained, rather than used. Thus quantum information can be negative. The amount of classical information needed is the mutual information I(A:R):=H(A)+H(R)-H(AR). The case where the classical communication is replaced by quantum communication was considered in. This is known as the Fully Quantum Slepian-Wolf Theorem, since everything is sent down the quantum channel.

The Ukrainian political scientist Vitaliy Kulyk however stated that while similar to signs used by Neo-Nazi organizations in Europe the sign Idea of the Nation has nothing to do with Wolfsangel and there were no actions that confirmed the party's Nazi image. Although there was an incident when on 21 September 1993 its people's formations came to the Verkhovna Rada building dressed all in black to differentiate themselves from woodland camouflaged UNA-UNSO activists. In the internet could be found an information that in the second half of 1990s the party also recruited skinheads and football hooligans. Media was accusing the party in criminal fighting which resulted in physical elimination of criminal elements of the Caucasus region from the West Ukraine. The SNPU's official program defined itself as an \\"irreconcilable enemy of Communist ideology\\" and all other parties to be either collaborators and enemies of the Ukrainian revolution, or romanticists. According to Svoboda's website, during the 1994 Ukrainian parliamentary elections the party presented its platform as distinct from those of the communists and social democrats.

Wahinepio means captive women in Hawaiian. Sometimes she is called Wahineopi ªo, or an extra  ªokina is added, calling her Kahakuha ªako ªi. She was also called Kamo ªonohu. She was considered Kamehameha I's third favorite wife and served as female Governor of Maui, an act unheard of at the time in the western world, but common in Hawaiian history.  Life  She was born on the island kingdom of Maui. Her father was Kekuamanoha, and her mother was Kamakahukilani, the niece of her father. Through her father she was a granddaughter of Kekaulike, the King or Mo ªi of Maui. Her mother was the daughter of Kauhiaimokuakama, the eldest son of Kekaulike, who was denied the right of succession to the throne of Maui due to his mother Kahawalu's inferior rank in contrast to Kekaulike's other wife Kekuiapoiwa I. Supported by King Peleioholani of Oahu, he fought against his younger half-brother Kamehamehanui Ailuau, who was assisted by the King of the Big Island Alapainui, at the Battle of Keawawa. The battle ended in a stalemate, but Kauhiaimokuakama was captured and drowned by Alapainui's orders. Her siblings included Kalanimoku, Boki, Governor of O ªahu, and Manono II, the wife of Keaoua Kekuaokalani. She was cousin of Ka ªahumanu, KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie, and Namahana Pi ªia, Kuakini, Governor of Hawai ªi; and Ke ªeaumoku II, who later served as her predecessor as Governor of Maui. Born Kahakuha ªakoi, details of her early life are scarce. She grew up in the court of her uncle King Kahekili II of Maui. During her early childhood her father Kekuamanoha helped Kahekili conquer the island of Oahu, and was the chief responsible for the capture and execution of its King, Kahahana, who was his own brother-in-law. Afterward Kahekili set up his court on Oahu. She probably stay on in Maui with her aunt Kalola, the most senior chiefess of Maui at the time, and her cousin Kalanikauika ªalaneo (later named Ke≈çp≈´olani), Kalola's granddaughter. When Maui forces under Kalanik≈´pule, Kahekili's son and regent in his absence, lost to Kamehameha I at the Battle of Kepaniwai, Kalola along with her family tried to flee to Oahu. They stopped in Molokai as sickness overcame the elderly Kalola, and were caught by Kamehameha's forces. The dying Kalola offered her granddaughter Ke≈çp≈´olani as a future bride in exchange for peace. Other Maui chiefesses, including Kahakuha ªakoi, also joined Kamehameha's court. She and her cousin both shared the new name Wahinepio (captive women) commemorating this event. Her cousin later adopted the name Ke≈çp≈´olani, while Kahakuha ªakoi is mainly called Wahinepio by historians throughout the rest of her life. = Marriages = Royal Court of King Kamehameha I at Kailua-Kona, c. 1816. Kamehameha I married most of the women he took captive because they were the highest-ranking women in all the Hawaiian Islands and any children bore by them would hold the highest mana or spiritual power. Wahinepio married Kamehameha around that time. She was related to everyone of Kamehameha's wives; her cousins mentioned above were all married to the king, and her younger sister Manono was later to be one of two young women taken by Kamehameha \\"to warm his old age\\". She was considered to be Kamehameha's third favorite wife, after Ka ªahumanu and KaheiheimƒÅlie, although Ke≈çp≈´olani was his most sacred wife. Like Ka ªahumanu she had no children by Kamehameha. She and Kamehameha separated in the early 1800s, around the time he married KaheiheimƒÅlie. As a sort of compensation Kamehameha may have given Wahinepio to KaheiheimƒÅlie's first husband, his half-brother, Kala ªimamahu.* Kamehameha gave many of his wives to his trusted friends and relatives. Remarriage was common among the chiefs of Hawai ªi, and many chiefesses could even choose to have more than one husband at a time. She had a son Kahalai ªa Luanu ªu by her second husband. Some sources state he was the product of her third marriage and not her second marriages, but most historian agree that he was Kala ªimamahu's son. Kahalai ªa would later be appointed Governor of Kaua ªi after helping suppress the Humehume rebellion in 1824. He had a possible daughter Ke ªelik≈çlani and an unnamed son from his fourth and fifth marriages, respectively. Her second marriage didn't last long, and she remarried to Kah≈ç ªanok≈´ Kƒ´na ªu, the eldest surviving legitimate son of Kamehameha by his wife Peleuli. According to Hawaiian tradition Kƒ´na ªu would have been Kamehameha's heir to the throne as his eldest son, instead his younger half-brother Liholiho was chosen to be Kamehameha's heir due to his mother Ke≈çp≈´olani's higher rank. This is ironic considering Wahinepio's own grandfather had been denied his right to the throne because of the inferior rank of his own mother. Tradition tells of a story, recorded down by John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´, that once while traveling with Kƒ´na ªu from Honolulu to Waikƒ´kƒ´, an offering of fishes were made to the couples by Kinopu from Moehonua's fishpond in KƒÅlia. At the moment the sea came into the pond and fishes of every kind entered the sluice gate. Fish nets were cast and the harvest was so abundant that a great heap of fish lay spoiling upon the bank of the pond. When word of this reached Kamehameha, instead of being pleased, was displeased at that their waste of food. Kalanimoku, who was by the king's side at the time, ordered that Kinopu release most of the fish. When Kala ªimamahu heard of what his nephew had done, his anger was kindled against him. With Kƒ´na ªu she had a daughter named Kekau ª≈çnohi, who later became one of the five wives of Kamehameha II and later Governor of Kaua ªi. Kekau ª≈çnohi had a son, but he died young. Kƒ´na ªu died around 1809 leaving her a widow. Her final marriage was to Kaukuna Kahekili, who was descended from the Kings of Maui like herself and had Spanish blood in his vein. Her fourth husband had absolutely no power and served no post under Ka ªahumanu, although he had help lead an army of a thousand soldier to Kauai with Hoapili and Kaikio ªewa to assist her brother Kalanimoku and her son Kahalai ªa put down the Humehume uprising in 1824. He was noted as a stern warrior with great strength and many battle scars. No known children came from this union. = Governor of Maui = Wahinepio died May 26. She served as governor of Maui at one point as one of the few female governors in the kingdom's history. Like many Hawaiian chiefesses at the time, Wahinepio was a giant of a woman. Reverend Stewart observed that she weighed no less than four hundred pounds. But like many females of rank, she became accustomed to Western dress and may have become self-conscious about her weight and thought of eating less poi, so her clothes could sit better. She became part of the first generation of Hawaiian women to be bothered by their appearance and inability to fit the mold of Western femininity. This came at the cost of lowering the status and right of Hawaiian women, and subsequent generations' only notion of being a woman was to follow their subservient Puritanic sisters. = Christianity = Wahinepio in the Christian funeral procession of Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, 1823. When the Christian missionaries arrived Wahinepio accepted Christianity along with Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, Hoapili, NƒÅhi ªena ªena, Ke ªeaumoku II, Kekau ª≈çnohi, Kahekili, and Kaiko and his wife Ha ªaheo Kaniu who all attended classes set up by the missionaries. After Ke≈çp≈´olani's death in 1823, many of the chiefs returned to some of the old ways including Wahinepio, who allowed most of her subjects to do as they wish. She was said to have been the principal agent in leading the princess to return to worshipping the old Hawaiian gods in 1824, a year after the death of her mother. Wahinepio may have assumed a motherly role over the recently orphaned princess. Although not for long because NƒÅhi ªena ªena return to the Christian faith the following year and forbade anyone to enter her house who could no read hymns, targeting Wahinepio who couldn't read. The angry Wahinepio likewise forbade any to enter her house who was not skilful in dancing, referring to the pagan hula forbidden by the missionaries. She may have eventually reconverted, but she was never considered a devout Christian and was clearly disliked by Reverend Richards and Reverend Bingham. Her refusal to bend to Western ways or submitting to Christianity and her strong belief in the old Hawaiian ways was identical to her possible granddaughter Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani. Reverend Richard tells of a change of heart by Wahinepio, in an account involving a Hawaiian girl Leoiki under her care. The sixteen-year-old girl Leoiki was an attentive student of the Christian missionaries. She had attracted the eyes of Captain William Buckle of the British whaleship Daniel IV, who resolved to have her board his vessel. She pleaded to be spared, but Wahinepio allow her to be taken for the payment of sixteen doubloons, valued at ten dollars each, and Leoiki was taken on board for seven months, according to Richard's as a slave.The popular slavery reference of Leoiki's condition is in conflict with British law at the time which outlawed the slave trade and made it a crime punishable by death. Wahinepio soon confessed that she had done wrong. She gave the coins to NƒÅhi ªena ªena who refused them, and according to legends the coins were placed among the treasures left by Kamehameha II. Afterward laws were placed throughout the islands forbidding women to visit ships for immoral purposes much to the anger of visiting sailors. Although, this might just be missionary propaganda. Other accounts seems to suggest that Wahinepio took the payment as dowry and assurance of her return. And that Leoiki, instead of being sold, married Captain Buckle and had a son with him, born on February 5, 1826 as a British citizen on board the Daniel IV. The boy was named William Wahinepi ªo Kahakuha ªakoi Buckle in honor of her, and he served in King Kalakaua's privy council and was the first warden of Oahu prison. Leoiki's granddaughter Jane Kahakuwaiaoao Keakahiwalani Buckle Clark was a lady-in-waiting of Queen Lili ªuokalani during her 1895 imprisonment in  ªIolani Palace. = Death and legacy = In 1826, an epidemic of whooping cough and bronchitis swept across Hawaii, claiming the lives of many Hawaiians who lack natural immunity to the disease. Her son Kahalai ªa and his son, her grandson, fell victim to the epidemic in April of that year. This double loss brought great sorrow to Wahinepio. Her grief weakened her constitution even further, and added with the rapid cultural change Hawaii due to the arrival of the missionaries, she succumbed to the epidemic. She died at Moku ªula, the royal residence of Kamehameha III, in May 1826. She was given the honor of being buried at Moku ªula, where Ke≈çp≈´olani and Nahi\`ena\`ena had been interred and where Wahinepio's daughter Kekau ª≈çnohi would be buried too. Her remains along with other royals were assumed to have been transported to the Waine ªe Church, later renamed the Waiola Church, in LƒÅhainƒÅ. Wahinepio Avenue in Kahului, next to Maui Community College and Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, is named after her.Google Map  Ancestry   References  Category:House of Kekaulike Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1826 deaths Category:Hawaiian Kingdom politicians Category:Hawaiian royal consorts Category:Native Hawaiian women in politics Category:Governors of Maui Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions ","title":"Wahinepio"},{"id":"30502158","text":"The Battle of Agua Carta, or the Battle of Lindo Lugar, was an engagement between the National Guard of Nicaragua and the rebels of Augusto C√©sar Sandino in 1932.Musicant, I, The Banana Wars, 1990, New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., It was fought near Mount Kilambe at the Agua Carta, a river in Sandino territory, as part of the American occupation of Nicaragua and a long lasting civil war.Alexander, pg. 61 Battle Following America's return to Nicaragua in 1926, the United States Marines took command of the Nicaraguan National Guard to fight Sandino's rebels and an occupation began which lasted for several years. A mounted patrol of forty guards under First Lieutenant Lewis \\"Chesty\\" Puller and Gunnery Sergeant William \\"Ironman\\" Lee headed north from Jinotega on September 1, 1932. Because both Puller and Lee were technically part of the National Guard, Puller assumed the rank of captain and Lee a first lieutenant. While about eighty to 100 miles from the city and just northeast of Kilambe the patrol found the Agua Carta and proceeded to cross it when the rebels attacked. Ambushes at river crossings were very common during the occupation so Captain Puller and his guards had no trouble in fending off the attack. When completely across the Marines and the guards found a main body of the enemy, positioned on a ridge, an estimated 150 men armed with seven automatic weapons and a number of bolt action rifles. The main engagement began with the rebel militia attempting to flank the guards but this attack was repulsed largely due to Lee's fire from his Lewis machine gun. Because of this Lee became a target and was one of the first men wounded by enemy fire. With two bullet wounds Lee managed to free his jammed machine gun and charge the ridge where he and a handful of other guards flanked from the left. Puller then advanced with the remaining men and flanked the rebels from the right and they were routed from the field. The battle was long and the rebels were found to have a large cache of ammunition available. Ten rebels were counted dead and at least ten others escaped wounded, of the guards two men were killed and four wounded. Captain Puller received his second Navy Cross of five and later became a general in the United States Marine Corps. First Lieutenant Lee survived and also received a Navy Cross. On the return to Jinotega, Puller's patrol was ambushed twice on September 30 and both attacks were repulsed with heavy losses on the rebel forces.

Each edition is newly edited, annotated, and includes an introduction, chronology, and bibliography. The series is distinguished by the inclusion of primary source documents contemporaneous with the work that help demonstrate the context out of which the work emerged. The inclusion of such materials was pioneered by D.L. Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf in their 1992 edition of Frankenstein; the inclusion of contextual materials soon became a feature of all titles in the series. There are over 260 titles in the series, including acclaimed editions of canonical titles such as The Canterbury Tales; Jane Eyre and Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals. Editions of lesser-known authors such as British writers Eliza Haywood and Charlotte Smith, as well as American writers such as Leonora Sansay and Henry Fuller, are also highly regarded.

Although she lived in England for a short time as a child, she returned to France, and ultimately went to Germany to complete her education. Shedlock's first job was as a schoolteacher. She taught school in England from age 21. At age 36 she began her career as a storyteller, having a debut performance in London. At age 46 she ceased teaching and began her career as a professional storyteller. She had two extended and well-received tours in the United States. Shedlock's first U.

Anne Carroll Moore head of the children's library at Pratt invited Shedlock to return to Pratt and tell stories to children. Her first American tour lasted seven years. After this first tour, Shedlock returned to London, later writing her two books. Shedlock's second U. S. tour began in 1915 and ran for five years. Shedlock died in January 1935. Influence on others Anna Cogswell Tyler a student at Pratt heard Shedlock perform and decided to become a professional storyteller herself. Tyler eventually became head of storytelling for the New York Public Library. Ruth Sawyer heard Shedlock reading the tales of Hans Christian Andersen at Columbia University.

Early life and education Steve Clark Hall was born in San Francisco on November 9, 1953, and attended high school in Eureka, California. He was nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy by Senator John V. Tunney of California. He graduated with honors in the Class of 1975 with a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering and rowed all four years on the Navy Lightweight Crew team. After completing his 20-year career as a nuclear submariner, he retired from Naval Service and returned to his home in the Castro District of San Francisco. =Career= After graduation from Annapolis, Steve Clark Hall entered the nuclear submarine training pipeline at the Naval Nuclear Power School in Vallejo, California. His sea tours included USS Haddock (SSN-621), Engineer Officer of USS Michigan (SSBN-727), as the Submarine Liaison Officer for Commander, Carrier Group THREE based at NAS Alameda deploying on the carriers USS Enterprise (CVN-65) and USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), as Executive Officer of USS Permit (SSN-594) and as the Commanding Officer of the nuclear submarines USS Greenling (SSN-614) (1992‚Äì94) and USS Drum (SSN-677) (1994‚Äì95) He was the commanding officer at the time the ‚ÄúDrum‚Äù collided with another ship in Hong Kong. His only shore assignment was as the Executive Officer (ashore) at the Navy Program Management Office, Sunnyvale, California. Later work After departing the U.S. Navy, Hall continued his public service, serving on the boards of various non-profit public benefit corporations including the Castro Area Planning + Action and the San Francisco Friends of City Planning.SFFOCP website He served as President of the Castro/Eureka Valley Neighborhood Association in 2008.ENVA website =Out of Annapolis project= Hall was one of 35 LGBT Naval Academy alumni who sought official recognition from the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association as the USNA Out Chapter.

Originally built in 1915, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The design of the bridge is of little significance. Its endposts appear to have come from materials dismantled from the old Wailua River Bridge in 1919, and its original trusses were removed during repair work in 1958. It is currently in poor condition and may have to be replaced, rather than restored, according to Kauai County Engineer Donald Fujimoto. It is listed on the Hawaii Department of Transportation's current statewide transportation improvement schedule. Bridge and neighboring pasture land Much more significant is its role in the socioeconomic history of the island. It was built to facilitate access to the Kapaa uplands, which had been opened to homesteaders two years earlier. When Hawaii became a United States Territory in 1900, most of its land was held in very few hands, primarily those of large-scale sugar planters and the government itself. Despite being dominated by the sugar industry, the territorial government sought to encourage the growth of family farms by opening up large tracts of its own land to homesteaders. The best coastal plains were already devoted to sugarcane plantations, so homestead lands on Kauai were located in the uplands of Kapaa on the east side of the island and KalƒÅheo on the southeast side. The Puu≈çpae Bridge was designed to serve tracts of land along Olohena and Waipouli Roads known as Kapaa Homesteads 2nd Series, which included 81 lots ranging from roughly 20 to 40 acres, on which 90 homesteaders harvested 31,500 tons of sugarcane by 1917, despite poor roads, limited water, and dependence on the large plantations for milling and marketing their sugar. Although most of the homestead plots have subsequently been rezoned as residential, the nearly 400 acres surrounding this bridge remain the only significant expanse of agricultural land in the region. :\\"The history of the Kapa'a Homesteads ... is not the product of a single Great Man who shaped the area but the collective story of a group of settlers who struggled to make a life as independent farmers for themselves and their families.

Life He was the son of Nikita Ivanovich Karapetov and Anna Joakimovna Karapetova. Karapetoff first studied at Petersburg State University of Means of Communication taking his first certification in 1897 and a second in 1902. During his studies he was a consultant to the Russian government and served as an instructor teaching electrical engineering and hydraulics in three of Saint Petersburg's colleges.James E. Brittain (1997) \\"Vladimir Karapetoff: A Pioneer Electrical Engineering Educator\\", Proceedings of the IEEE 85(10):1662, weblink from IEEE Explore In 1899, he went to the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt to study power systems, he wrote √úber Mehrphasige Stromsysteme in 1900. In 1903 Karapetoff emigrated to the United States and apprenticed at Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. The following year he began his long association with Cornell University as professor of electrical engineering. Karapetoff published the first part of his Engineering Applications of Higher Mathematics in 1911, and followed with parts two to five in 1916. That year he also published Electrical Measurements and Testing, Direct and Alternating Current. The American Institute of Electrical Engineers made him a Fellow in 1912. He became a charter member of the American Association of University Professors in 1915. Karapetoff was a research editor for Electrical World from 1917 to 1926. As a member of the Socialist Party of America, Karapetoff ran for the New York State Senate in 1910;SOCIALISTS NAME PROFESSOR in NYT on September 20, 1910 and for New York State Engineer and Surveyor in the State elections of 1914,C. E. RUSSELL FOR SENATOR in NYT on July 6, 1914 1920 and 1924. Karapetoff wrote several articles on special relativity to show that :much of the difficulty in understanding the subject lies in the popular effort to reconcile relativity with our every-day experience. Once this non-technical point of view, with its childish illustrations and analogs, has been abandoned, and the relativity space is considered mathematically per se, the treatment is not different from any other branch of mathematics. Certain postulates are made and a structure is built step by step on these, using mathematical logic and its recognized tools and operations.Scripta Mathematica 8:162 In the first three articles in the journal of the Optical Society of America (1924-1929), Karapetoff used the notion of a \\"velocity angle\\" Œ± which expressed the relation of a velocity v to the speed of light by sin Œ± = v/c (an equivalent definition was used before in 1921 by Paul Gruner while developing symmetric Minkowski diagrams). In the later articles he used instead the hyperbolic angle u called rapidity in relativity, and determined by tanh u = v/c. As explained in a footnote on page 73 of the 1936 article, when sin Œ± = tanh u, one says that Œ± is the Gudermannian angle of u, and u is the anti-Gudermannian of Œ±. Thus he explains, \\"the present treatment is in terms of the anti-Gudermannian of the velocity angle previously used.\\" The diagramatic treatments given by Karapetoff are frequently called Minkowski diagrams in physical science. In 1928 the Franklin Institute awarded him the Elliott Cresson Medal. Karapetoff was an accomplished cellist, and in 1934 was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the New York College of Music. On November 25, 1936, he married Rosalie Margaret Cobb at Dobbs Ferry, New York.MISS R. M.

Background Lillian Wald, the founder of public health nursing, began her mission on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At the time, this was the most densely populated area in the world. In 1893 Wald founded the Nurses' Settlement, which later changed its name to the Henry Street Settlement. In 1895, banker and philanthropist Jacob Schiff purchased the Federal style townhouse at 265 Henry Street for the new organization to use, and expansion continued to adjacent buildings over the next few years. Henry Street Settlement funded the first nurse in the New York City public schools‚Äîan innovation that led to the creation of a citywide public school nurse program, the first in the world. By 1940, nearly 300 visiting nurses were providing medical care throughout New York City. Henry Street Settlement's nurse service became the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. Corporate information =Staff= The VNSNY workforce consists of licensed practical and registered nurses; physical, occupational, and speech language therapists; social workers; home health aides and home attendants, physicians, registered dietitians, and psychologists.

In its most basic form it is one of the least complicated of drinking games. Gameplay requires a standard 52-card deck and may be played with any number of participants, to include a single player. Traditionally each player takes a turn in order, drawing a single card from the top of the deck. Before looking at the card, they must call either \\"Black\\" or \\"Red\\" indicating their guess as to the color of the card. If they guess correctly their turn is completed and the next player draws. If they guess incorrectly they must drink a specified type and volume of alcohol before their turn is over. The game may be considered to be finished when the deck is exhausted, or it may proceed indefinitely with cards being recycled back into the deck until a player has played enough. Score tracking may be done, but is not required. Some variants include additional rules, such as allowing players who successfully guess a color to select which player will draw next, that players who guess correctly a specified number of consecutive times may enact rules such as \\"may not guess black\\", \\"player must drink from the opposite side of their glass\\", etc., or that if a player guesses wrongly they must drink the number of sips shown on the card, while if they guess correctly they may distribute that number of sips to other players.http://www.findadrink.com/displaygame.html?gamename=red- and-black References Category:Drinking games Category:Matching games ","title":"Black or Red"},{"id":"30502372","text":"North Korean nationality law details the conditions in which an individual is a national of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea. History Until 1963, the DPRK had no formal nationality law. This led to situations which were quite unusual from the perspective of international law, most notably the Soviet Union's unilateral declaration that the Sakhalin Koreans were DPRK citizens--in effect, one sovereign state granting its residents the citizenship of another sovereign state, presumably without any consultation. The DPRK's first nationality law, passed on 9 October 1963, provided quite a broad definition of DPRK citizenship. Specifically, it stated that anyone who had citizenship of undivided Korea and had retained it up to the promulgation of the new citizenship law, as well as descendants of such persons, was thenceforth a citizen of the DPRK. This raised the possibility that every member of the Korean diaspora would be considered a DPRK citizen, as there had previously been no clear procedure for renunciation of Korean citizenship, and few had taken such an official step. The new law also established that foreigners could gain DPRK nationality by naturalisation. The law was amended on 23 March 1995. The law permits multiple citizenship, and specifies that nationality treaties with other countries take precedence over the text of the law. Due to the lack of normal diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan, Koreans in Japan with dual citizenship of the DPRK and Japan have had their requests to renounce Japanese citizenship in favour of solely retaining DPRK citizenship refused by Japan's Justice Ministry. It is also legally possible to renounce DPRK nationality; the DPRK issues certificates of loss of nationality in such cases, which may be required by other states in which a former DPRK national seeks to naturalise. However, such certificates have become more difficult to obtain , according to South Korean media reports.  Naturalisation  DPRK law prescribes that any person wishing to naturalise as a DPRK national should petition to the Supreme People's Assembly. As the SPA is a rubber-stamp legislature, actual naturalisation powers lie in whomever the Supreme Leader of North Korea is at the time. Naturalised North Koreans without Korean relatives would be granted the songbun \\"of foreign origin\\", and are not required to attend ideological training sessions. There are four main groups of naturalised North Koreans: Soviet Koreans, the Hwagyo, Japanese wives of repatriated Zainichi, and those who have been naturalised individually.

It resulted in the killings of two men, William French and Daniel Houghton by a sheriff‚Äôs posse, after a crowd occupied the Westminster Courthouse to protest the evictions of several poor farmers from their homes by officials and Judges from New York. The Westminster Massacre is regarded as an important event in the history of Vermont and one of the key events that helped spark the American Revolution.  Background  Tensions in the New Hampshire Grants had existed since the 1760s between the majority of its residents, lower class farmers from New Hampshire, and \\"Yorkers\\", a wealthy minority of landowners from England and New York. The New Hampshire Grants were claimed by both the Province of New Hampshire and New York. Surveyors employed by the Yorkers were often attacked and beaten by angry farmers, who formed the radical Green Mountain Boys, an Anti-Yorker militia led by Ethan Allen and Remember Baker. The Green Mountain Boys began destroying the homes of Yorkers who settled in the New Hampshire Grants. Many of these Yorkers had taken the land from impoverished farmers. Yorkers were almost always Loyalists, while farmers sided with the colonialists. In response to the attacks on Yorkers, officials from New York began arresting and evicting poor settlers across the New Hampshire Grants.  Incident  On March 13, 1775, a group of ‚Äúriotous and disorderly persons... [numbering] between eighty and ninety‚Äù assembled outside of the Westminster Courthouse to protest the arrival of a judge from New York, along with several settlers from New York. In an effort to prevent ‚Äúthe session of the county court scheduled for the following day.‚Äù Many members of the ‚Äúriotous and disordley‚Äù crowd were ‚Äúpro-Independence Whigs.‚Äù The number of people occupying the courthouse soon numbered in the hundreds, and many were armed with clubs and firearms. The ‚Äúrioters‚Äù were ordered to leave the courthouse by Sheriff William Patterson. When the rioters refused to disperse and end their ‚Äúriotous assembly‚Äù, Patterson rode to the town of Brattleboro, a loyalist stronghold, and recruited ‚Äú25 residents for the purpose of ‚Äòkeeping the peace‚Äô‚Äù. By 9:00 pm, when Patterson returned to Westminster with a posse of ‚Äú60 to 70 armed men‚Äù, the rioters were in control of both the courthouse and local jail. Once again, Patterson ordered the rioters to disperse, and once again the rioters refused, after which the Sheriff commanded his men to fire into the courthouse to frighten the rioters. The rioters returned fire, ‚Äúslightly wounding‚Äù a magistrate who had accompanied the sheriff‚Äôs posse. Patterson‚Äôs men proceeded to storm the courthouse, armed with swords and guns. Once they broke down the courthouse door Patterson‚Äôs posse began shooting into the crowd, killing William French in the moments after they entered. French was shot five times, and died immediately. One eyewitness described the chaos that ensued: \\"They rushed in with their guns, swords, and clubs, and did most cruelly maim several more, and took some that were not wounded, and those that were, and crowded them all into close prison together, and then told them they should be in hell before the next night, and that they did wish that there were forty more in the same case with that dying man [William French]. When they put him [French] into prison, they took and dragged him as one would a dog, and would mock him as he lay gasping, and make sport for themselves.‚Äù The opposing sides fought each other in hand-to-hand combat, in which many of the rioters were injured. The rioters poured out of the courthouse as Patterson‚Äôs men continued to shoot. One of the rioters, Daniel Houghton, was shot and beaten so brutally that he died from his wounds nine days later.  Aftermath  After the massacre, seven of the rioters were caught by Sheriff Patterson's posse and thrown into the local jail. News of the massacre spread quickly throughout New England and New York, partly because many of the rioters rode to neighboring towns and told locals of how the sheriff's posse had killed William French. The following day an angry mob of \\"upwards of 500\\" that included local farmers and teens as well as militias from the towns of Guildford, Westminster, and the counties of Windham, Bennington, and Albany, and even as far away as the colony of New Hampshire descended upon Westminster. The mob surrounded the courthouse and \\"took [with them] the judges, the sheriffs, the clerk\\" and local loyalists, who were paraded through town to the town jail. The mob broke into the town jail, freeing all the prisoners, including the seven rioters who had been arrested, and proceeded to lock up the officials and loyalists they had dragged through Westminster. The mob then searched the area for more loyalist leaders, who they captured and imprisoned in Northampton, MA. The mob continued south to Brattleboro, where they broke into the homes of prominent loyalists, including Samuel Gale and Benjamin Butterfield, who, along with several other Brattleboro loyalists, were brought to Northampton and imprisoned alongside loyalists the mob had already captured. The mob, which still numbered in the four hundreds, chased loyalist attorney Samuel Knight out of Brattleboro. Militias set up roadblocks in the countryside surrounding Westminster, who held people they believed to be loyalists or Yorker officials at gunpoint, then handed them to over search parties who brought the \\"Yorkers\\" to Northampton. A few days later, the mob created a committee who \\"charged\\" five of the prisoners with the murder of William French. The following year, Vermonters met at the Westminster courthouse and declared Vermont Republic an independent nation.

It is largely covered with tropical rainforest and receives an annual rainfall total of 2,000 mm. The tablelands are part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage area. Mountains associated with the tableland include Mount Spurgeon (1,317 m), Roots Mount (1,313 m), Devils Thumb (1,258 m) and Black Mountain (1,311 m). The plateau's highest point is unnamed, and is the fourth tallest mountain in Queensland. Fauna The Waterfall frog was feared to be extinct until it was rediscovered at a creek on the Mount Carbine Tableland in July 2008. The Northern barred frog is a recently described species which is only found on the Mount Carbine and Mount Windsor tablelands. The rich basaltic soils in the area supports forests which provide habitat for the Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo.

Endemol specialised in formatted programming that can be adapted for different countries around the world as well as different media platforms. One notable success has been the Big Brother reality television show, with versions in many countries after the initial Dutch version. Other examples include Deal or No Deal (sold to over 75 countries), The Money Drop (sold in over 50 countries), Fear Factor (sold in 30 countries) and Wipeout (sold in over 35 countries). In recent years the company has also been expanding its English language drama output with shows such as titles such as The Fall, Peaky Blinders, Ripper Street and Black Mirror in the UK and Hell on Wheels in the USA. In November 2013 the company launched Endemol Beyond, an international division specialising in original content for digital video platforms such as YouTube. =Shine Group= =Sale to Banijay= In April 2018, Fox and Apollo appointed Deutsche Bank and Aryeh Bourkoff's Liontree to handle a potential sale of Endemol Shine, following Fox's sale to The Walt Disney Company. William Morris Endeavor and Banijay Group had eyed an acquisition of Endemol Shine, with Banijay reported to have even entered advanced talks to buy the studio. On 29 August 2018, the RTL Group (which owns Fremantle) withdrew its bid for Endemol Shine. In September 2018, BBC Studios, along with Discovery, Inc. and Liberty Global (which each own 50% of All3Media) announced that they would not bid on the studio. ITV plc provisionally placed a bid on the studio but did not confirm an official bid as the sale is still only a potential scenario at this point. In October 2018, ITV plc withdrew from the auction. Sony Pictures Entertainment, DHX Media (now WILDBRAIN) and Lionsgate also ruled out of the bidding. ProSiebenSat.1 Media (which owns Red Arrow Studios) was reported to be considered for a joint bid with Banijay, but the latter ruled itself out as well. Endemol Shine later made a statement that they had been in negotiations with several parties and were confident they would have an owner by end of November 2018. However, on 6 November 2018 it was reported that both Fox and Apollo have decided to suspend the selling process as a deal could not be reached by prospective buyers. In the meantime, Fox's 50% stake in the company was given to Disney. The report was published hours before European Commission's clearance of Disney's impending purchase of Fox on certain conditions. On 22 October 2019, Banijay officially announced its intent to acquire Endemol Shine from Disney and Apollo for over $2.2 billion. On 26 October 2019, Banijay Group announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of Endemol Shine Group.Banijay Group to Acquire Endemol Shine Group The merger was approved on 26 October 2019, pending antitrust approval.

Ferguson studied law in Edinburgh, qualifying in 1757 to gain membership of the Faculty of Advocates. He then undertook a tour of Europe throughout 1758 before following in his father's footsteps by joining the Scottish legal profession. Later in life his interests turned to politics and he became a Scottish Tory politician. Among the extensive work carried out by Ferguson at Pitfour, he is also credited with beginning work on a canal between the Pitfour estate and the sea at Peterhead in order to transport agricultural produce. Despite planning objections from neighbours, work began in 1797. He is also credited with establishing the planned village of Mintlaw in 1813. Ancestry and early life 30 Heriot Row, Edinburgh James Ferguson was born at Pitfour on 25 May 1735.Buchan (2008): p. 15 He was the eldest son of James Ferguson (1700‚Äì1777) and Ann Murray (1708‚Äì1793).Buchan (2008): p. viii His parents were married on 3 February 1733, and he was born three years later. They had five other, younger children. Before undertaking a grand tour of Europe during 1758, Ferguson continued the family tradition of studying law in Edinburgh. After qualifying, he gained membership of the Faculty of Advocates and Society of Writers to the Signet in July 1757. Ferguson spent a great deal of time at Pitfour but also had an apartment in St James Place, Westminster, Middlesex. Ferguson became the third Laird of Pitfour on the death of his father, Lord Pitfour, in 1777. The Third Laird was a known associate of James Boswell and together with his brother Patrick, who was the designer of the Ferguson rifle, breakfasted with Boswell in November 1762. Other close associates were William Pitt the Younger and Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville. He was the Rector at Aberdeen University from 1794‚Äì6. In a confidential report titled \\"View of the political state of Scotland\\" published in 1788, Ferguson was described as \\"a man of real good sense, but indolent.\\" The document was published in 1887 but covered the personal circumstances of those involved in county elections in Scotland during the previous century. Ferguson was not a good-looking man and appeared plain, small and stocky. His mother once wrote to him: He remained a bachelor although there was speculation he yearned for Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon. She was born in Edinburgh in 1749, and was a Scottish Tory political hostess who was shrewd, sharp-witted and humorous but good-natured. In a riddle written by the Duchess, the last two lines refer to Ferguson (Laird of Pitfour) and confirm that he was not an attractive man. It reads:Buchan (2008): p. 22Ferguson & Fergusson (1895): p. 258 :My first is found upon the banks of Tyne :My second is scarce quite half of nine :My whole a laird of Aberdeenshire race :An honest fellow with an ugly face Around 1813, he established the planned village of Mintlaw, and he is also credited with expanding Longside in 1801.Buchan (2008): p. 86 Prior to his death his Edinburgh address was 30 Heriot Row in the Second New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1819-20 He died without issue, and on his death in St James' Place, London, in September 1820, the estate passed to his younger brother, George Ferguson (1748‚Äì1820), who was then 72 years old and in poor health. He was said to have died \\"without a struggle\\" of \\"apoplexy\\". Political career Ferguson became a Scottish ToryStooks Smith (1844): pp. 615‚Äì616 politician. He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1788 to 1800, and then in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom until his death in 1820. He unsuccessfully contested Aberdeenshire at a by-election in 1786 with the support of the Duke of Gordon. George Skene‚Äîproposed by the Earl of Fife, who held tremendous sway in the political circles of that time‚Äîdefeated him.Ferguson & Fergusson (1895): p. 255 The total electorate for Aberdeenshire was 190, and Ferguson was defeated by ten votes.Buchan (2008): p. 18 Ferguson was again nominated for Aberdeenshire in July 1790 and was appointed after Skene withdrew when his alcoholism began to blight his political career.Skene (1887): pp. 44‚Äì47 Ferguson was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Banffshire at a by- election in 1789,Stooks Smith (1844): p. 622 holding that seat until 1790. He was elected at the 1790 general election as MP for Aberdeenshire, and held that seat until his death 30 years later.Foster (1882): p. 133 The Member became a close associate and political friend of the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but this time with a more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never spoke in the Commons except to complain about a broken window behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.Ferguson & Fergusson (1895): p. 256Buchan (2008): pp. 18‚Äì20 The diarist and fellow lawyer Henry Crabb Robinson gave an indication of Ferguson's political party affiliation when he recorded in his diary of 1826: It was not until after 1832 and the introduction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics was taken from the hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.Buchan (2003): p. 338Lynch (1992): p. 391 Pitfour Side view of Pitfour House around the late 1800s The Pitfour Estate beside Mintlaw in the Buchan area of north-east Scotland became one of the country's most extensive and lavish estates during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Pitfour estate is shown on old maps as Petfouir or Petfour.Buchan (2008): p. 4 The estate was purchased by Ferguson's grandfather, the first Laird, in 1700 and was developed and extended by both the Sheriff and Lord Pitfour. Covering a large area of Buchan, the policies stretched to around 50 square miles and would be valued at ¬£30m at its peak in the 18th century. The third Laird is attributed with much of the development work on the mansion house which was designed by architect John Smith in 1809. In his architectural guide to Banff and Buchan, Charles McKean describes the estate as the \\"Blenheim of Buchan\\" and \\"the Blenheim of Northern Scotland\\".Buchan (2008): p. 1 ;Pitfour's canal and lake Ferguson was Laird of Pitfour during the period known as the Industrial Revolution in Britain. He began work on a canal between Pitfour and Peterhead in 1797 despite major opposition from adjoining landowners. The canal was proposed to cover about ten miles following the course of the River Ugie.Buchan (2008): pp. 95, 96 References also refer to Pitfour's canal as the St Fergus and River Ugie Canal.Graham (1967): p. 176 A project Ferguson had considered since 1793, it was never completed owing to \\"difficulties in effecting the necessary arrangements with neighbouring heritors.\\" The objections were particularly raised by the Merchant Maiden Hospital, which owned the land on the south side of the Ugie. Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work, in January 1797 the Hospital did not feel it had a strong enough case. However, four months later when two miles of the canal had been dug up to where the north and south Ugie joined, the Hospital did apply for an interdict, and this was granted in July 1797.Buchan (2008): p. 96 A few years after starting work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land to the front of the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time, and it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.Buchan (2008): p. 76 Pitfour House around the late 1800s ;Later history of the estate After the death of the Member intestate in 1820, the estate was inherited by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748‚Äì1820), who died shortly after inheriting the estate. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop the estate by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling debts, and although the estate had been valued at ¬£300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms and other parts of the estate to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the estate was mortgaged to the extent of ¬£250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835‚Äì1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained of the estate was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.Buchan (2008): p. 53May & Hay (2000): p. 215 References Citations Bibliography    External links https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Ferguson_(Scottish_politician)&action;=edit&section;=5# Category:1735 births Category:1820 deaths Category:18th-century Scottish people Category:18th-century Scottish lawyers Category:19th-century Scottish people Category:People from Aberdeenshire Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Burials at Greyfriars Kirkyard Category:Founder Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Lairds Category:Members of the Faculty of Advocates Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Politics of Aberdeenshire Category:British MPs 1784‚Äì1790 Category:British MPs 1790‚Äì1796 Category:Scottish Tory MPs (pre-1912) Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:UK MPs 1801‚Äì1802 Category:UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 Category:UK MPs 1806‚Äì1807 Category:UK MPs 1807‚Äì1812 Category:UK MPs 1812‚Äì1818 Category:UK MPs 1818‚Äì1820 Category:UK MPs 1820‚Äì1826 Category:Rectors of the University of Aberdeen ","title":"James Ferguson (Scottish politician)"},{"id":"30502710","text":"Boquerones en vinagre, ready for serving. Boquerones en vinagre are a type of appetizer or tapa found in Spain.Boquerones en Vinagre (Andalusia recipe in English: Anchovies in Vinegar) The central ingredient of the dish is the boquerones, fresh anchovies. The fillets are marinated in vinegar or a mixture of vinegar and olive oil, and seasoned with garlic and parsley. It is commonly served with beer or soft drinks, and rarely with wine. Characteristics and presentation Fresh anchovy fillets, which initially have a brown colored meat, are cleaned, de-scaled, and submerged in a bath of salt and water for 3 hours and vinegar for 6 hours in a cool place. The fillets slowly turn white as the vinegar reacts with the fish. Once having gone through this process, and the liquid has been drained, they are seasoned with minced garlic, olive oil and parsley. An alternative preparation is to submerge the fillets in a mixture 3:1 of vinegar and olive oil (it can be replaced by sunflower oil), already seasoned with garlic, parsley and salt, for two days. They are served cold with beer, rather than wine, since they already contain vinegar. The dish is very popular as a tapa in Spain served in restaurants and bars, especially during the hottest summer months. They are garnished with capers or olives and accompanied by potato chips. The prepared fish can be bought commercially, requiring only additional garlic and parsley. Health concerns Anchovies can concentrate domoic acid, which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, sea mammals, and birds. If suspected, medical attention should be sought. Anchovies also contain a high level of uric acid, a build-up of which can cause the inflammatory condition known as gout. Spanish health laws require the previous freezing of the anchovies when prepared in vinegar, in order to avoid the survival of any Anisakis larvae, even though this parasite is rarely found off Spanish coasts.

Cather was still under contract with Houghton Mifflin for her novels so Knopf offered to put out a selection of her short stories.

It contains the largest species in the family, Tenrec ecaudatus. All members of the genus possess spines, analogous to those of hedgehogs, for defense against predators. Tenrecinae is thought to have split from the lineages of all other extant tenrecs about 36 million years (Ma) ago. The deepest phylogenetic split within the subfamily, that between two clades composed of Echinops plus Setifer and Hemicentetes plus Tenrec, is thought to have occurred about 26 Ma ago. In turn, Hemicentetes is thought to have diverged from Tenrec about 16 Ma ago, and Echinops from Setifer about 10 Ma ago.
