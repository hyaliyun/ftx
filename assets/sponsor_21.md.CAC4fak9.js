The photorealistic painting is one of Richter's largest figurative paintings at 2,75 m x 2,90 m. It depicts Milan's Catherdral Square between the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele and the Milan Cathedral. It was sold by Sotheby's in New York on 14 May 2013 for 37.1 Million dollars, breaking the record price for a Richter painting for Abstraktes Bild (809-1).  History  Cathedral Square, Milan was commissioned by Siemens Elettra and from 1968 to 1998 hung in their offices in Milan. In 1998 it was acquired by the Pritzker family and was on display for more than ten years the at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Chicago. In 2013 the Hyatt Hotels Corporation consigned it to Sotheby's to be auctioned. It was bought by Donald L. Bryant, a Californian art collector and the founder of the Bryant Family Vineyard in Napa County.  Description  The painting shows the northern part of the Milan cathedral square from a birds-eye view. The facade of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, an imposing structure from the 19th century, takes up most of the left half of the painting, while only a part of the northern transept and the front of the nave of the gothic cathedral Santa Maria Nascente are visible. Between the Galleria and the Cathedral Square, one can see parked cars, on the square itself, several candelabra and ‚Äì blurred like in many early photographs ‚Äì vague outlines of people and undetermined objects. The contours of the buildings are out of focus and blurry. The many greytones in which the painting has been executed are reminiscent of black-and-white photography. Richter did not place the cathedral, the best known tourist attraction in Milan, in the centre of the painting. Instead he directed his view to its immediate surrounding with the space between the Galleria and the cathedral at its centre. Richter had already painted the facade of the cathedral in 1964 with Mailand, Dom also in graytones but in a smaller format of 130 x 130 cm. Parallel to Domplatz, Mailand Richter created another painting that had Milan as its subject, based on an aerial photograph, also in graytones and blurry contours that Richter later cut up in pieces of 85x90 cm, and declared them individual images that are listed in the Catalogue Raisonn√© from 170/1 to 170/9. The source after which Richter executed Domplatz, Mailand was a newspaper photograph that was in focus, from which Richter clipped a section and modified it.  Photography and cityscapes in the work of Gerhard Richter  From the 1960s onward Richter increasingly dealt with the photographic medium by referring to photographs as his choice of pictorial motif. In 1962 he created the first representational paintings that were based on photographs. In interviews, Richter has spoken about his attitude to photography several times. The motives were never arbitrary, but he had difficulties \\"to find a suitable photo at all\\". Benjamin Buchloh: Interview mit Gerhard Richter. √úber die Avantgarde. In: Gerhard Richter. Cat.Rais. Bd. 2. S. 86. Provocatively and contrary to established media theories, he naively considered photography \\"the only image that reports the absolute truth because it sees 'objectively'; it has primary credibility, even though it is technically deficient \\". In a conversation with und Fridolin Reske he said: Richter continued to create work that was based on aerial photography, from the Stadtbild M series 170/1 to 170/9 from 1968 to the print series Bridge 14 FEB 45 (II) from 2000. After his gray pictures, which represent the rejection of everything creative and according to Richter are \\"the most welcome and only possible equivalence to indifference, meaninglessness, refusal to statement and formlessness\\", Gerhard Richter, zitiert nach Hans Ulrich Obrist: Gerhard Richter.

During World War II, the German Luftwaffe staffed dozens of concentration camps, and posted its soldiers as guards at many others. Camps created for the exploitation of forced labor for armaments production were often run by the branch of the Wehrmacht that used the products. The Wehrmacht also posted about 10,000 Wehrmacht soldiers to concentration camps because of a shortage of guards in mid-1944, including many from the Luftwaffe. Camp operations By the end of the war, 2,700 Luftwaffe soldiers worked as guards at Buchenwald and its subcamps. The main camps of Flossenb√ºrg Mittelbau-Dora, and Natzweiler had many Luftwaffe guards. In late 1943, a Luftwaffe salvage yard () opened halfway between Auschwitz II-Birkenau and Auschwitz I. About 1,300 prisoners at a time were forced to work salvaging parts from Luftwaffe and Allied aircraft that had been damaged beyond repair. These prisoners were supervised by Luftwaffe personnel and guarded by the SS. Although many of the Luftwaffe personnel smuggled letters or provided food for the prisoners, their commanding officer, a Luftwaffe major, was known for beating prisoners with an aluminum pipe. The prisoners were housed at Birkenau and forced to march to the Zerlegebetrieb each morning; they were exempt from work if the temperature dropped below . Most were Polish or Soviet POWs; the latter were known for their frequent escape attempts. Because of the valuable items that could be found while dismantling the aircraft, prisoners frequently tried to smuggle them back to Birkenau to trade for necessities. The death rate was high because of the harsh working conditions and workplace accidents. A factory for anti-aircraft weapons at Monowitz was staffed by Luftwaffe guards. The Luftwaffe also provided flak units to protect Monowitz factories from air attack. By early 1944, there were 1,000 Luftwaffe guards at Auschwitz. Luftwaffe guards had a reputation for being slightly less brutal than the SS, in several cases attempting to improve the conditions for prisoners. Nevertheless, Luftwaffe personnel also frequently mistreated prisoners. For example, Luftwaffe technicians in several places forced prisoners to defuse or otherwise handle unexploded bombs. Luftwaffe soldiers reportedly executed prisoners during a death march, and tortured and murdered prisoners at Wiener Neudorf, a subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp. For the latter crimes, Ludwig Stier, the Luftwaffe captain in charge of the Luftwaffe soldiers at the camp, was sentenced to death by a US military court in 1947 and executed.

Myers (1948), thought this work contained \\"the essence of Satie the ironist, the wit, and the skillful parodist\\".Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 94. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. Songs The cycle consists of three songs set to whimsical verses by three contemporary French authors. Apart from a general light-hearted tone there are no unifying elements in the music or texts. Satie conceived it for mezzo-soprano voice but it has been successfully performed by soprano and baritone vocalists. L√©on-Paul Fargue :1. La statue de bronze (\\"The Bronze Statue\\"). Poem by L√©on-Paul Fargue. Dedicated to Jane Bathori. :- Pas trop vite (not too fast) :During the World War I years Satie found a friend and kindred spirit in avant-garde author L√©on-Paul Fargue, whose absurdist, virtually untranslatable poetry cannot be linked to any school. They would later collaborate on Satie's m√©lodie cycle Ludions (1923). Fargue's lyrics for La statue de bronze describe the ennui of an ornamental garden sculpture, a metallic frog, as passersby toss coins and other objects into its gaping mouth. There is a strong whiff of music hall in the cakewalk-like introduction, after which the piano part subsides into an oom-pah ostinato rhythm. Over this the initially ebullient vocal line fades into quiet pensiveness, as the artificial frog muses that it would rather be with real frogs in a pond \\"blowing bubbles of music out of the moonlight's soap\\",Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 94. and how at night its mouth is full of insects it cannot eat. :2. Daph√©n√©o. Poem by M. God. Dedicated to √âmile Engel. :- Tranquille (quietly) :\\"M. God\\" was a pseudonym for Marie Anne \\"Mimi\\" Godebska (1899-1949), the 17 year-old niece of Misia Sert, Satie's foremost patron of the period. Along with her younger brother Jean she was a dedicatee of Maurice Ravel's piano duet Ma m√®re l'Oye (1910).\\"3 M√©lodies, IES 34 (Satie, Erik)\\", complete score and notes at IMSLP. See External Link below for access to the page. Godebska's poem is a silly dialogue about trees between two faux- mythical characters, Daph√©n√©o and Chrysaline. Allmusic reviewer Virginia Sublett noted that the song \\"depends for its intelligibility on an untranslatable pun: eliding a final \\"n\\" turns \\"un oisetier\\" (a nonexistent word meaning \\"bird-tree\\") into \\"un noisetier,\\" or \\"hazel-nut tree.\\"Virginia Sublett, Allmusic review at https://www.allmusic.com/composition/m%C3%A9lodies-3-of-1916-for-voice-piano- mc0002368227 Satie's solemn, gently swaying underscoring gives the text an ironic dignity. Rollo H. Myers enthused, \\"The effect is irresistibly comic, although the means employed by Satie in turning this bit of nonsense into music are classic in their sobriety and restraint\\".Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 95. The Mad Hatter's tea party, illustration by Sir John Tenniel :3. Le chapelier (\\"The Hatter\\"). Poem by Ren√© Chalupt after Lewis Carroll. Dedicated to Igor Stravinsky. :- Allegretto (genre Gounod) (fairly brisk, in the manner of Gounod) :Satie was a great fan of imaginative and humorous literature, and was very fond of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). He once planned to write a ballet on the subject.Satie proposed the ballet Alice au Pays de Merveilles in June 1921. American translator Louise Norton and French author Henri-Pierre Roch√© worked on the scenario throughout the summer without success, and the project was abandoned. See Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 325. This song cleverly employs multiple levels of literary and musical pastiche. Poet-journalist Ren√© Chalupt (1885-1957) drew his lyrics from Chapter 7 of Alice, \\"A Mad Tea- Party\\", focusing on The Mad Hatter. The character frets over his pocket watch, which is running \\"three days late\\" even though he lubricates it with \\"the best butter\\" and dunks it into his tea. Satie's accompaniment parodies the love duet Chanson de Magali from Charles Gounod's opera Mireille (1864), which itself was an adaptation of an old Proven√ßal folksong.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 21-24. Robert Orledge suggested that the playing direction \\"genre Gounod\\" was the composer's discreet way of thumbing his nose (musically speaking) at Gounod, \\"that epitome of bourgeois sentimentality\\".Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 22. :Satie was so pleased with Le chapelier that he dedicated it to his friend Igor Stravinsky, one of the few contemporary composers he admired without reservation.David Drew, \\"The Savage Parade - From Satie, Cocteau, and Picasso to the Britten of 'Les Illuminations' and beyond\\", Tempo, New Series, No. 217 (July, 2001), p. 7. Published by Cambridge University Press. The drollery of the Trois M√©lodies would appear to link it with Satie's humoristic or \\"fantaisiste\\" compositions of the 1910s. But in this song cycle, apart from the \\"genre Gounod\\" reference, he refrained from using the witty playing directions and extramusical commentary that helped define the public perception of his music in the pre-World War I era. He had apparently grown weary of the formula.For example, Satie's song cycle Trois po√®mes d'amour (composed in 1914) was conceived in his vintage humoristic spirit, but upon its delayed publication in 1916 he chose to remove all the extramusical jokes and verbiage. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 308-309. Satie would revert to it only once more, for his spoof of 18th Century piano music, the Sonatine bureaucratique (1917). History Jane Bathori Satie wrote the Trois M√©lodies for mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori, a star of the Parisian opera world and a vigorous promoter of new French music. Although Bathori knew of Satie's reputation through their mutual friend Claude Debussy,Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 52. the two did not actually meet until early April 1916, in preparation for an upcoming \\"Ravel-Satie Festival\\" sponsored by the Soci√©t√© Lyre et Palette. Satie immediately agreed to provide two new vocal numbers for her, and the songs Daph√©n√©o and Le chapelier were completed by April 14. They were first performed by Bathori and pianist Ricardo Vi√±es at the festival, held at the Salle Huyghens in Paris on April 18, 1916.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 311-312. Trois M√©lodies, first edition cover (1917) Bathori was then invited to perform the two songs at a more prestigious event, a benefit concert \\"for artists affected by the War\\" sponsored by Germaine Bongard, sister of fashion designer Paul Poiret, scheduled for the following month. It would be staged in conjunction with an exhibition of modern painting, and Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were commissioned to design the programme.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 312. Satie habitually preferred to construct his compositions in groups of three, and on May 16 he sent L√©on-Paul Fargue a note requesting a bit of verse to cap the Bathori cycle - \\"something very short & terribly cynical\\".Caroline Potter, \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Routledge, 2016, p. 299. Fargue's brand-new poem La statue de bronze was duly delivered, and Satie completed his setting on May 26. The complete Trois M√©lodies was premiered by Bathori and Satie at the Galerie Thomas in Paris on May 30, 1916. The score was published by Rouart, Lerolle & Cie in 1917. In his last years the irascible Satie severed ties with two collaborators on the Trois M√©lodies, Ren√© Chalupt and L√©on-Paul Fargue, over petty misunderstandings.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, pp. 126-127.Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 164. But Jane Bathori continued to promote his music after the composer's death in 1925. With Satie disciple Darius Milhaud as her accompanist she made the first recording of the Trois M√©lodies, issued by Columbia in 1929.Library of Congress catalog, at https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg;=2005655290&searchType;=1&permalink;=y Discography Jane Bathori and Darius Milhaud (Columbia, 1929), Pierre Bernac and Francis Poulenc (Columbia Masterworks, 1952), Elaine Bonazzi and Frank Glazer (Vox, 1971), Mady Mespl√© and Aldo Ciccolini (2 songs only, excluding La statue de bronze, Arabesque, 1974), Marjanne Kweksilber and Reinbert de Leeuw (Harlekijn, 1976, reissued by Philips, 1982), Jessye Norman and Dalton Baldwin (Philips, 1977), Bruno Laplante and Marc Durand (Calliope, 1985), Eileen Hulse and Robin Bowman (Factory Classical, 1990), Sigune Von Osten and Armin Fuchs (ITM Classics, 1994), Jane Manning and Bojan Gori≈°ek (Audiophile Classics, 2002).

He was born in Soweto, South Africa. Mandela is currently the co-founder and chairman of the Mandela Institute for Humanity He is active in keeping the legacy of his grandfather alive, and introducing Nelson Mandela to a younger generation. He is the co-founder and co-chairman of Africa Rising Foundation. He is also the founder of the Mandela Project. He was part of the team for the Mandela Centenary in 2018. He is a member of the Pan-African Youth Council which works closely with the African Union. He is the longest serving global ambassador for UNAIDS, a specialized agency of the United Nations that campaigns to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Both of his parents died from the disease. 263x263px Early life Ndaba Mandela was born into a family of chieftains. His grandfather Nelson was both a direct descendant of the holders of the kingship of the Thembu people and heir to the chieftaincy of Mvezo in his own right. The latter dignity is currently held by Ndaba's elder half-brother Mandla. This notwithstanding, Ndaba grew up in what can be called a broken home. His father Makgatho Mandela grew up without a father. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned while his family was growing up, and he became a street hustler in Soweto. After Ndaba was born his family moved to the Eastern Cape. He spent the first years of his schooling in a small town called Cofimvaba. He was seven years old when he met his grandfather Nelson Mandela. Mandela had been imprisoned on Robben Island. Ndaba was eleven years old when he went to live with his grandfather. He spent two decades living with him - being cared for, and then caring for his grandfather. In the Xhosa culture boys between ages of 18 and 21 are taken to the mountains to be circumcised. Ndaba was 21 years of age when he was circumcised. They are taught their roles and responsibilities in becoming men. Roles and responsibilities that entail getting married, being a husband, a father, and having your own home. Career Ndaba majored in political science and international relations at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. He has worked for the Japanese Embassy as a political consultant. Africa Rising was founded to promote a positive image of Africa. Ndaba was featured in an online post by BET in which he spoke about his foundation, Africa Rising. Ndaba says his foundation aims to publicise a positive image of Africa through programming, films, media and social interaction, to change the mindset of young Africans and the world at large. In 2014 Ndaba was named one of the \\"28 Men of Change\\", by BET. The Men of Change is in honor of America's Black History month. It honors Black men that have excelled in industries or projects that promote black brilliance. He published his first book in June 2018. The book is titled, \\"Going to the Mountain: Life Lessons from My Grandfather, Nelson Mandela. He says that his grandfather taught him to create their own legacies and to give back to society. Ndaba says about his book, Going to the Mountain: Life Lessons from My Grandfather, that he has taken the life lessons that his grandfather taught him and some of his own to relate to a younger audience. So that people can understand his grandfather's values. In 2018 Ndaba has partnered with Prince Harry, and Sir Elton John to launch a campaign to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS. They kicked off the global campaign at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. In an interview with the Hill at the Library of Congress, June 2018, Ndaba is quoted as saying why he wrote the book, ‚ÄúI wanted people to know Nelson Mandela outside of being a statesman, outside of being this great iconic leader that they know and just to know him at the human level as a granddad.\\" Quotes \\"We have to break down the misconceptions that exist surrounding Africa. Africa is not just a place of war, poverty, disease and dictators. Africa is the birthplace of humanity.\\" \\"I don't always have his patience. I could never have spent 27 years in prison and then forgiven my enemies the way he did. But I learned so much from him and I believe he saw a good man in me. I may not be able to walk in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, but we can all walk in his light.\\" ‚ÄúThe world looks up to South Africa a lot as a country that is expected to stand on a pedestal of values and morality, because we are a country that produced this great international icon.

He was the right-hand man of Javier Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El JT\\"), the former leading operator of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. In 1997, he was arrested with several of his accomplices in Canc√∫n in possession of of Colombian cocaine. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was released in 1998 for inconsistencies in the case. Investigators suspected that he rejoined organized crime after his release and climbed up the leadership chain of the Sinaloa Cartel. Upon the arrest of El JT in 2004, Meza Ontiveros worked closely with Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El M-1\\") and Misael Torres Urrea (alias \\"El M-2\\"). In 2007, he was killed by armed men in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. The official details regarding his death are unknown. In the following years, his family suffered several loses. In 2009, his sibling Faustino was killed by suspected organized crime members. His son C√©sar Ra√∫l Meza Torres (alias \\"El Mini-6\\"), who tried to follow Meza Ontiveros' footsteps, joined the Sinaloa Cartel as a young assassin. He was killed by security forces in 2010.

Though originally from the state of Durango, he did most of his criminal career in Sinaloa. In 1989, he was arrested by the Sinaloa Ministerial Police for homicide and false declaration charges. In 1990, he was charged by Sinaloa's Office of the General Prosecutor for kidnapping, rape, and for concealing rape evidences against two women.

He worked under Javier Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El JT), a leading operator of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. He was also a close associate of other suspected Sinaloa Cartel leaders like Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El M-1\\"), brother of El JT, and Misael Torres Urrea (alias \\"El M-2\\"), El JT's son. On 27 May 1997, Meza Ontiveros was arrested by the Federal Judicial Police in Canc√∫n, Quintana Roo, with El JT and two other men, Ram√≥n L√≥pez Serrano and Manuel Meza Zamudio. Following their arrest, authorities were led to a safe house that contained of Colombian cocaine that Meza Ontiveros and the others who were with him had reportedly received from traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. At the scene, they also discovered several vehicles modified with compartments where investigators believe smugglers intended to conceal the drugs for further distribution in northern Mexico. They also seized two boats and multiple weapons. Meza Ontiveros was sent to the military camp in Canc√∫n once he was in custody. He was sentenced to ten years in prison that year, but a judge granted his release on 16 December 1997. He left prison on 11 March 1998. According to court indictments, the judge absolved Meza Ontiveros and the rest of his accomplices because of a mistake the PGR did in assembling evidence. The judge cited multiple \\"inconsistencies\\" in the lawsuit presented against the defense. The Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's former organized crime investigatory agency, identified him as a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel since his release. His role within the Sinaloa Cartel increased when his boss El JT was arrested in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, in January 2004. With this arrest, Meza Ontiveros succeeded him as a main operator under Zambada. Other sources stated that his relatives El M-1 and El M-2 reportedly took over El JT's activities in the Sinaloa Cartel following his arrest. Death On Monday, 27 March 2007, Meza Ontiveros was killed in Culiac√°n. The Sinaloa Ministerial Police stated that they did not have official information about how Meza Ontiveros died. They were called to a location in Las Quintas neighborhood because they were notified of a shootout between armed suspects. When they arrived at the scene the shootout had ended, but they were told that three armed assailants had taken a wounded man, Meza Ontiveros, to a private clinic. The police headed to the clinic but were impeded entry by Meza Ontiveros' family. The clinic personnel confirmed that Meza Ontiveros was killed. One account stated that Meza Ontiveros was dropping off his girlfriend in Montebello neighborhood when several men, who were waiting for him at the domicile, shot him in point-blank range. At least two gunshot wounds reportedly stuck his face. According to his autopsy report, he had a coup de gr√¢ce wound, showed signs of having been beaten, and had three wounds in his skull that were made with a sharp object. Investigators confirmed that Meza Ontiveros was tortured, but authorities did not disclose the details surrounding his death. The family denied investigators entry to the clinic, and requested the medics who attended Meza Ontiveros to keep the details confidential. His family only authorized the clinic personnel to release his name, age, and that he had died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds.  Family  Meza Ontiveros was the brother-in-law of El JT and El M-1. He had a son, C√©sar Ra√∫l Meza Torres (alias \\"El Mini 6\\"). El Mini 6 was a nickname he used from his father's alias El M6. C√©sar Ra√∫l followed his father's footsteps and joined the Sinaloa Cartel as a young assassin. He was killed in a shootout with security forces on 25 April 2010 in Zapopan, Jalisco, after he killed a police officer earlier in the confrontation. One source stated that Meza Ontiveros had another son, Arturo Meza, who was killed on 8 May 2008. However, he was confused with Arturo Meza C√°zares, son of suspected Sinaloa Cartel leaders Arturo Meza Gaspar and Blanca Margarita C√°zares Salazar. Meza Ontiveros' sibling Faustino Meza Ontiveros (aged 27) was killed by armed suspects in Culiac√°n on 8 January 2009. He was driving a vehicle in the streets of Culiac√°n when a pick-up truck with armed suspects tried to cut him off the road in an attempt to pull him over and kidnap him. Faustino got out of his vehicle and fled to a store, but the gunmen went after him and killed him inside the premises. Eyewitnesses notified the police of the incident, but no arrests were made.

It debuted in theaters on May 19, 1995. The film brings together the winners of the first edition of the Argentine National Film Board's (INCAA) annual public script competition, the grand prize of which is the budget to produce a short film.

Background Filmmaker Lucrecia Martel explained in a 2008 interview that the premiere of the compilation film was ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù in Argentina and came about after all the directors of the short films banded together and visited the Argentine National Film Board (INCAA) headquarters in Buenos Aires repeatedly to ask the script contest organizers to premiere all the short films as a string of films in a theater. The filmmakers waited for hours until the contest organizers would meet with them and argued that it was a waste of state funding if they didn‚Äôt exhibit the finished films. As a result, the films were exhibited on the dedicated screens of the national public circuit run by INCAA.

Producer Park Joon-soo declared to have been inspired by Samsung's former Future Strategy Office, which used to be an important department of the company before it was disbanded. He went on saying that he has \\"been producing a series of shows that make fun of the dark sides of Korea's entertainment industry\\" and he thought of YG because it was \\"going through a dark patch\\" at the time.

Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2012 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2012 Runway Show was presented on October 4, 2011 at the Grand Palais in Paris. With a massive seascape production, which Vogue described as spectacular and risk-taking, Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld unveiled 84 new looks with unconstructed jackets, cutaway backs, ostrich feather skirts, and sequined dresses in a lighter, iridescent palette of whites, creams, nudes, and metallics that shifted to pinks, corals, and blacks. For a sportier element, Lagerfeld added drawstring waists and bomber jackets. The collection featured a variety of fabrics ranging from tweed, organza, lace, chiffon and lam√© to knit, silk, and leather. With a slight 1920s influence, design details included drop-waists, pearl belts, seaweed panniers, boxy tweed jackets, and ruffles that mimicked sea sponges. There were also aquatic-themed accessories with handbags, shoes, and jewelry shaped as seashells, conch shells, and coral. The production included stylized, oversized installations of giant sea life sculptures: stingray, sea horse, shark, anemone, and coral branches in a variety of matte, glossy, and sparkly finishes. Florence Welch provided the soundtrack with a live performance of \\"What the Water Gave Me.\\" Saskia de Brauw opened the runway show.

Fashion Critic Tim Blanks described the runway presentation as \\"a magical underwater environment.\\" Following the October 4, 2011 presentation, Blanks asked Lagerfeld at what point did the theme of the undersea world assert itself on the collection. Lagerfeld replied, \\"Nothing is more modern than the shapes in the ground of the sea who have billions of years. The sea is the same all over the world; so it's a manualization in a very modern, graphic way‚Äîand where pollution hadn't reached yet.\\" Blanks noted the paradoxical metaphor of creating something very modern out of something very old. \\"I'm happy you say that,\\" noted Lagerfeld. \\"In fact, the oldest things are the most modern in a way.\\"  Chanel Ready-to- Wear Fall 2012 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2012 Runway Show was presented on March 5, 2012 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

The presentation's featured silhouette focused on a three-piece ensemble of jacket, shirt, and pants. The collection's dichotic inspiration sources were mineralogical and cubist. Embroidered crystals along the hemlines and cuffs referenced the former influence, while color-blocking and the angularity of the design details evoked the latter.

This looks like a city of skyscrapers that has exploded, in a way‚Äîso I think, nature is not such a bad designer, no? And the other inspiration in terms of cuts and shapes and embroideries is Czech cubism. I thought it was an interesting expression.\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2013 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2013 Runway Show was presented on October 1, 2012 at the Grand Palais in Paris. Vogue Runway described the set as having an architectural modernism.

The creative director used three-dimensional chiffon cut-outs to create more lightness, volume, and movement. He eschewed his typical use of braids, buttons, and chains in favor of a more liberal placement of pearl embellishments for a look that he described to WWD as fresh and light, with different proportions and volumes. Lagerfeld, who is approaching his 30th anniversary as Creative Director of Chanel, continues to modernize the house, without reinventing its core aesthetic. This season, he showed cropped jackets, cocoon shapes, trapeze cuts, bell sleeves, wide-cut jackets, skirt- dresses, embroidered flowers, and organza pinwheels. Kati Nescher opened the runway show.

Everything is airy.\\" When asked if this was the biggest thing he'd ever done, in terms of the production scale, the designer responded, \\"I don't judge my things in terms of size. Energy is the most important thing in life. The rest comes later.\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2013 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2013 Runway Show was presented on March 4, 2013 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

I love how he is always able to take history and meld it with the future in the most beautiful, sensible way.\\" As told to Style.com, Lagerfeld noted of his collection, \\"It was dark, but I don't think it was sad. It's not easy to run around in pink all day. It's a very cosmopolitan, international look. It's a global look women can wear all over the world‚Ä¶ An interesting thing is that today it's not that Europe, as big as the amount of shops, it's the rest of the world, it's the new world. And that's very interesting, because French luxury industry survives doing so well because there are all of those new fortunes in a new part of the world. And this is something I wanted to show too, that they see all the flags there in this new world‚Ä¶ It's globalization, a fashion globalization.\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2014 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2014 Runway Show was presented on September 30, 2013 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

It's not different young artists; only one old artist‚Äîit's me‚Ä¶ And I think it was right for today, no? Because life is not a red carpet. This is for daily life; that was the idea in fact.\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2014 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2014 Runway Show was presented on March 3, 2014 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Remixes of Lady Gaga and Rihanna provided the runway soundtrack.

Most outfits were layered over leggings. Corseted waistlines and knee-length skirts were paired with trapeze coats.

I really, really loved the layering, the colors, the tweed‚ÄîI wanted so many pieces right away‚Ä¶ Everything was brilliant. I think was very me. I feel like I could wear everything in the collection.\\" \\"We saw the punk girl. I think I saw the sophisticated, the very young teenagers‚Äîthey were all there, it feels like a brand that you can wear throughout any age,\\" noted Alicia Vikander. \\"I think that's one of the most extraordinary things about Karl,\\" added Keira Knightley, \\"For however long he's been doing this, he continues to reinvent and continues to be forward- thinking, and always about the present and the future.\\" Cara Delevingne opened runway show, which featured 78 looks.

Lagerfeld's team recreated an urban cityscape with building facades, wrought-iron terraces, pavements, and puddles. This season's underlying theme was female empowerment.

And also, there are all kinds of pieces; everybody can use, play with. It's not professional‚Ä¶ There are no 70s, no 60s‚Äîit's more of a Mod de Viv than mod.\\" W Magazine's Editor-in-Chief Stefano Tonchi said of the presentation, \\"Karl is such a great social commentator. It's true that fashion is supposed to be the mirror of society, but he really put the mirror on our faces and he reflects the feeling and the mood and the ideas that people have in their mind.

Last time we had the demonstration in the streets that belonged to us. Now we have the French brasserie, and it moves me in a way. It's like my cultural roots that come out.\\" \\"The whole brasserie side was lovely because it is like being at my corner cafe and the feeling of being very French‚Ä¶ And there were loads of tweeds and silhouettes that reminded me of France, reminded me of the 1960s in France and this whole culture of cafes at the time.\\" said Lou Doillon. \\"I'm a stranger so I have a distorted view on French life, because you know I'm a little tired also of people saying 'Oh France isn't good anymore.' Even the French, the famous French-bashing‚Äîso I wanted to show that are few things are not that bad and typically French, and they should enjoy what they have,\\" Lagerfeld added. \\"The minute I finish one, I have to think about the next one, eh? That's why so many designers think the speed is too big and I don't think so. It's a nonstop dialogue, and if you are not ready to have a nonstop dialogue with fashion, you should do another job.\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2016 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2016 Runway Show was presented on October 6, 2015 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

So, it was more like a happy airport,\\" observed Michel Gaubert. \\"We're flying high class and it was beautiful,\\" said Audrey Marnay. \\"All the prints at the beginning and the look with the long skirts, it's always a new thing.\\" \\"I thought the collection was very fresh and colorful.

It's always a surprise with Karl, I never know where I'm going to end up.\\" \\"I like the shape of airplanes. I love airplanes. It's like a kind of butterfly,\\" Lagerfeld added. \\"They also wear very formal things with nothing. The Chanel suits, there's no buttons, no braids, no pockets and it just looks Chanel.

Because the people in row number five, they don't see the detail with half a mile of runway, but the music was made that they could walk quickly and everything; it's for a fast life, you can move, you can travel...\\"  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2017 Runway Show  Monikered \\"Intimate Technology\\" as a celebration to all things digital, the Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2017 Runway Show was presented on October 4, 2016 at the Grand Palais in Paris which had been converted to a giant mainframe computer clicking, whirring, and flashing away with brightly wired circuit boards.

Vogue heralded Creative Director, Karl Lagerfeld as fashion's astronomer-in-chief with his starship themed-presentation, when at the finale a giant Chanel- branded rocket, measuring 35 meters or 115 feet high appeared to jettison off the catwalk to the soundtrack of Elton John's \\"Rocket Man.\\" The inspiration came from local news, specifically an obsession with Thomas Pesquet, a French aerospace engineer, pilot and European Space Astronaut, who was part of ESA's Expedition 50 and 51 from November 2016 to June 2017.

Transitioning from previous seasons of forests and waterfalls, this season‚Äôs Chanel beachscape featured sand, turf, waves, and lifeguards. For those concerned about the lavishness or potential waste of the production, the program notes assured guests that the water used to create the 25 centimeter depth and 131 x 32 meter surface would be ‚Äúreprocessed via the common sewage system operated by Eau de Paris,‚Äù while every grain of sand would be ‚Äúput back into the usual circuit of the construction industry, for which it was initially intended.‚Äù The production design was said to be reminiscent of Karl Lagerfeld‚Äôs childhood holidays on the island of Sylt. As reported by Vogue Italia, ‚ÄúIt is the beach of one of my favourite places‚Äînothing is going on there‚Äî no boats because the sea is too rough,‚Äù Lagerfeld explained. ‚ÄúI went as a child ‚Äì and back once for a campaign with Claudia Schiffer and Shalom Harlow,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the least polluted place on earth in the middle of the North Sea‚Äîin my childhood you had to take little fishing boats to go over.

Camille Hurel, Mica Arganaraz, Carolina Thaler, Anok Yai, Jing Wen, Selena Forrest, Soo Joo Park, Anna Ewers, Kaia Gerber, and Penelope Cruz also walked in the show. Ashley Benson, Caroline de Maigret, Claudia Schiffer, Karen Elson, Monica Bellucci, Janelle Monae, Naomi Campbell, Marion Cotillard, and Kristen Stewart were amongst the 2,600 guests who attended and joined the standing ovation. The press kit included an illustration by Lagerfeld of himself with Gabrielle Chanel and a caption that read, ‚ÄúThe beat goes on...‚Äù  Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2020 Runway Show  The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2020 Runway Show was presented on October 1, 2019 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It was Virginie Viard‚Äôs first ready-to-wear collection since the passing of Karl Lagerfeld on February 19, 2019. This season was set against a Parisian backdrop of Rue Cambon reimagined rooftops, drainpipes and airvents included. The designer debuted tweed playsuits, coatdresses, bell-shaped skirts, tiny shorts, and sequined jackets. Jackets with flounced collars, ruffled tops with balloon sleeves, and voluminous skirts with petticoats were the more promiment design details. Day looks were accesorized with two-tone, embellished sandals, little hats, and large silk and tweed handbags. Jewelry pieces included pearl brooches, cuff bracelets, and crystal necklaces. For evening, tiered dresses and skirts were constructed of chiffon, organza, and feathers. Stripes, checks, and color blocking were featured in a palette of red, orange, pink, blue, black, and white. Many critics noted Viard‚Äôs desire to stay true to the brand‚Äôs iconic, signature tweeds and Lagerfeld‚Äôs grand production values, while injecting her sense of wit and youthfulness, reinterpreting the tweed suit as a romper for spring and pairing metallic shorts with camellia-laden jackets. As told to the Italian Bureau of Fashion Network by Bruno Pavlovsky, President of Fashion at Chanel, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a collection that is the image of Virginie, very young, full of energy. It especially highlights her exceptional knowledge of the brand; 30 years with Karl; a perfect understanding of Mademoiselle Chanel‚Äôs contribution and in addition her own inspiration.‚Äù According to Vogue, Viard drew inspiration from the French New Wave Cinema of the 1950s and 1960s or the atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague. She cited Brand Ambassador Kristen Stewart‚Äôs biopic Seberg, along with Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs Breathless as reference points. Notably, French Youtuber and comediene Marie Benoliel caused a stir, by crashing the presentation, when she jumped up onto the runway from the audience. She was promptly escorted off the runway by Gigi Hadid. Virginie Ledoyen, Caroline de Maigret, Aiysha Hart, Sebastien Tellier, Ines de la Fressange, Isabelle Adjani, Sting, Trudie Styler, Soo Joo Park, and Cardi B attended the runway presentation. Fashionista noted the brand‚Äôs inclusivity with model casting. Maike Inga opened the runway presentation of 83 looks, while Rianne van Rompaey closed it. Sacha Quenby, Anna Ewers, Jing Wen, Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Lexi Boling, Felice Noordhoff, Sara Grace Wallerstedt, and Vittoria Ceretti also walked the show. Hubert Barrere, Artistic Director of Lesage, also observed. ‚ÄúYou know that with Virginie, everything is simple and obvious. I think that‚Äôs maybe the message of this collection. Simpler, less fuss-one fabric that we can texturize, make lighter, more flexible, maybe even a bit more shiny, like the zinc roofs of Paris and the like lights of Paris and that simply makes everyone dream.‚Äù  References  Chanel ","title":"Chanel ready-to-wear collection"},{"id":"58481604","text":"Kyaw Myint Oo ( , born 12 March 1974) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as an Amyotha Hluttaw MP for Mandalay Region No. 10 Constituency.

She designed several early modernist houses in southern New England with partner J. Peter Geddes and worked as a planner for the Providence Redevelopment Agency and as an independent planning consultant. Early life and education Margaret Burnham Kelly was born on September 26, 1907 in Evanston, Illinois. She was one of five children of George T. Kelly, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and Margaret Sherman Burnham, daughter of the architect Daniel Hudson Burnham. In December 1921, the widowed Margaret Kelly married Benjamin Fairchild Stower of Sturbridge, Massachusetts. In 1922 the family relocated to Brown Street on the East Side of Providence, Rhode Island. Margaret Burnham Kelly graduated from the Wheeler School in June 1925. Margaret Burnham Kelly entered Vassar College in the fall of 1925 and studied art and mathematics. Kelly was a member of the track team and a news editor for The Vassar Miscellany News. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated from Vassar with an AB in the spring of 1929. The following fall, Kelly enrolled as an architecture student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, Massachusetts where she studied under William Emerson, William H. Lawrence, Paul W. Norton, and Frederick Adams. Her senior thesis project for ‚ÄúA Beach Development‚Äù on Ocean Road in Narragansett, Rhode Island, though never built, is a prelude to her later designs in its combination of land use planning and development, effective response to the site, and careful consideration of circulation. Kelly described the project as \\"modern, very simple and direct, and horizontal in its treatment.\\" Architectural and planning career =With Peter Geddes= After graduating from MIT, Kelly returned to her family home in Providence and worked independently for several years. In 1934 she formed an architectural partnership with J. Peter Geddes, who had received his degree in architecture from Columbia University in 1926. The firm Geddes & Kelly worked predominately on residential projects and was active between 1934 and 1948, maintaining an office on the second floor of the Hospital Trust Building on Westminster Street in Providence. Geddes & Kelly disbanded briefly between 1942 and 1944 due to World War II, during which time Kelly worked as a Project Planner for the Federal Public Housing Authority in Washington, DC and as a truck driver employed by the U.S. Army while Geddes served as an Army engineer in the Pacific. Kelly and Geddes married on December 3, 1942, at which time Kelly changed her last name to Geddes. Around 1940, several houses designed by Geddes & Kelly were featured in American architectural periodicals. The first Geddes & Kelly house to be published was a small, single story, three-bedroom house in Seekonk, Massachusetts. The article in Architectural Forum noted ‚Äúclean lines and restful surfaces indoors, with an austere avoidance of decoration‚Ä¶ Even the trim around door and window openings has been banished, its place taken by the simplest quarter-round of stainless steel, flush with the plaster.‚Äù Similarly, the George R. Rowland House (1938) in Brookfield, Massachusetts made use of a simplified, stripped down version of traditional New England domestic architecture, relying on unadorned brick and bands of casement windows without panes. Geddes & Kelly designed their own residence at 29 Manning Street, Providence, Rhode Island. The design of the two-story, two-bedroom brick house was praised for the sensible arrangement of service areas on the street side and main living areas in the rear. Geddes and Kelly lived in this house until their deaths in 1990 and 1995, respectively. The building was promised to Brown University by Peter and Margaret in 1966 and it became property of the university at the time of Margaret's death in 1995. Brown's Urban Studies Program was housed in the building until 2015 when the University chose to demolish one of Providence's earliest examples of modernist architecture to make way for a new Engineering Research Center designed by KieranTimberlake, completed in October 2017. Twenty five years earlier, the architectural importance of the house and the possibility of demolition were already noted by William Jordy, professor of architectural history: ‚ÄúLooking to the future, should all houses along the Manning Street Corridor‚Ä¶be eliminated in future additions for the sciences? Or might it be possible to save the brick Geddes House‚Ä¶? For the architectural historian it has the additional interest of being an early example of domestic 'modernism' in Providence.‚Äù Geddes & Kelly also designed the much larger 47 Manning Street at the same time as their own home. Three of the firm's houses were included in the 1941 ‚ÄúExhibition of Contemporary Rhode Island Art‚Äù at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. Peter Geddes formed the partnership Harkness & Geddes with Albert Harkness in 1948. Margaret Geddes worked part-time at the new firm while she continued to work independently on architectural projects. In 1950 she designed the Scott House on Simpson Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island as an extension of a nineteenth-century garage. Kelly's designs were included in a 1950 architecture exhibition sponsored by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Institute of Architects at the Providence Art Club, where she was a lifetime member. =Planning and preservation work= Kelly left her position at Harkness & Geddes in 1956 when she was hired as Planner II for the Providence Redevelopment Agency. Earlier in the 1950s, Kelly had worked as an activist and organizer in the planning community, leading the community planning committee of the League of Women Voters of Providence and serving on the boards of the Providence Redevelopment Agency in 1954 and the Citizens Committee for Redevelopment in 1955. Once hired, Kelly's principal responsibility at the Providence Redevelopment Agency was project planning for the Constitution Hill rehabilitation area, located on the East Side of the city, along North Main Street and the Moshassuck River. She was also instrumental in early efforts to establish a historic zoning area in Providence's College Hill neighborhood, in collaboration with members of the Providence Preservation Society. She continued to educate members of the Rhode Island League of Women Voters on issues of redevelopment and remained openly supportive of fair housing laws in Rhode Island. =Later career= Kelly left the Providence Redevelopment agency in 1961 but continued to work on planning and advocacy projects. She considered herself a ‚ÄúCity Planning Consultant‚Äù and worked for various firms such as Blain & Stein and for the Cape Cod sector of the Massachusetts State Plan. She remained active in planning and policy in the 1960s and 70s. In 1964 she served on a panel on urban redevelopment policy at Vassar College and in 1974 advocated for responsible land use on behalf of the Audubon Society of Rhode Island. Kelly was a member of the American Institute of Planners and the Rhode Island chapter of the American Institute of Architects from 1940 until her death. She held various leadership positions in the RI AIA including Chair of the Public Information Committee from 1949 to 1952, Secretary from 1952 to 1954, and Chair of the Civic Improvement Committee in 1954, the same year in which Kelly represented the chapter at the 86th annual AIA convention. Kelly was involved with the League of Women Voters from 1952 to 1969, serving as the director of the Providence chapter from 1954 to 1956. She was a member of the Vassar Alumnae Council and the Rhode Island Vassar Alumnae Association, serving variously as its President and as the Chair of the Class of 1929 Fund.

Projects that have not provided significant production announcements within at least a year, would be considered in development limbo until further announcements are released. The following include live-action and animated film productions. Live action films =The Fantastic Four= In 1983, German producer Bernd Eichinger met with Marvel Comics' Stan Lee at Lee's Los Angeles home to explore obtaining an option for a movie based on the Fantastic Four. The option was not available until three years later, when Eichinger's Neue Constantin film company obtained it for a price the producer called \\"not enormous\\" and which has been estimated to be $250,000.Ito, p. 110 Despite some interest from Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures, budget concerns precluded any production, and with the option scheduled to expire on December 31, 1992, Neue Constantin asked Marvel for an extension. With none forthcoming, Eichinger planned to retain his option by producing a low-budget Fantastic Four film, reasoning, he said in 2005, \\"They didn't say I had to make a big movie.\\" In September 1992, he teamed with B-movie specialist Roger Corman, who agreed to produce the film on a $1 million budget. Production began on December 28, 1992 under music video director Oley Sassone. Storyboards were drawn by artist Pete Von Sholly. The 21-day or 25-dayGore, p. 40 production was shot on the Concorde Pictures sound stage in Venice, California, as well as in Agoura, California for a spacecraft-crash scene, the Loyola Marymount University campus for a lab-explosion scene, and the former Pacific Stock Exchange building in downtown Los Angeles for team-meeting scenes.Ito, p. 111 Costume designer R√©ve Richards recalled in 1993 going to Golden Apple Comics on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to buy Fantastic Four comic books for research, and, upon explaining his task, \\"[T]hese people in the store just swarmed me and said, 'You are going to be faithful to it?' And I told them, 'This is why I am buying these books.'\\"Gore, p. 31 Paul Ahern was hired as weapons consultant, and Scott Billups for computer visual effects.Gore, p. 33 (sidebar: \\"FF FX\\") The special-effects makeup was by John Vulich and Everett Burrell of Optic Nerve.Gore, p. 33 Stuntman Carl Ciarfalio, who wore a rubber suit to portray the monstrous superhero Thing, worked with actor Michael Bailey Smith, who played the Thing's human self, Ben Grimm, so that their mannerisms would match. During the months of post-production, music composers David and Eric Wurst personally contributed $6,000 to finance a 48-piece orchestra for the soundtrack. A 1993 magazine article gave a tentative release date of Labor Day weekend 1993.Gore, p. 41 During that summer, trailers ran in theaters and on the video release of Corman's Carnosaur. The cast members hired a publicist, at their own expense, to help promote the film at a clips- screening at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and at the San Diego Comic- Con International. By this time, the world premiere was announced to take place at the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 19, 1994, with proceeds from the event earmarked for the charities Ronald McDonald House and Children's Miracle Network.Ito, p. 218 However, the premiere was halted, the actors received a cease and desist order on all promotion from the producers and the studio confiscated the negatives. Eichinger then informed Sassone that the film would not be released. Speculation arose that the film had never been intended for release, but had gone into production solely as a way for Eichinger to retain rights to the characters; Stan Lee said in 2005 that this was indeed the case, insisting, \\"The movie was never supposed to be shown to anybody,\\" and adding that the cast and crew had been left unaware.Ito, p. 108 Corman and Eichinger dismissed Lee's claims, with the former stating in the same article, \\"We had a contract to release it, and I had to be bought out of that contract\\" by Eichinger. Eichinger, also in that article, calls Lee's version of events \\"definitely not true. It was not our [original] intention to make a B movie, that's for sure, but when the movie was there, we wanted to release it.\\" He said future Marvel film impresario Avi Arad, at this point, in 1993, a Marvel executive, \\"...calls me up and says, 'Listen, I think what you did was great, it shows your enthusiasm for the movie and the property, and ... I understand that you have invested so-and- much, and Roger has invested so-and-much. Let's do a deal.' Because he really didn't like the idea that a small movie was coming out and maybe ruining the franchise.... So he says to me that he wants to give me back the money that we spent on the movie and that we should not release it. In 2002, Arad recalled that, while on a trip to Puerto Rico in 1993, a fan noticing Arad's Fantastic Four shirt expressed excitement over the film's upcoming premiere, of which Arad said he was unaware. Concerned how the low-budget film might cheapen the brand, he said he purchased the film \\"for a couple of million dollars in cash\\" and, not having seen it, ordered all prints destroyed, in order to prevent its release.Ito, p. 219 Eichinger continued negotiations to produce a big-budget adaptation, speaking with directors including Chris Columbus, Peyton Reed, and Peter Segal. After pre-production briefly went underway in 1996, Eichinger and his company, by that time called Constantin Film, began production in 2004 of Fantastic Four with an estimated $90 million budget. Following that film's 2005 release, Eichinger and Constantin produced a $130 million sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). Although never officially released to the general public, but exhibited once on May 31, 1994, The Fantastic Four has been subject to bootleg recordings. The film is available to watch on YouTube and Dailymotion. =Dazzler= In the mid-1980s, screenwriter Gary Goddard was commissioned to write a script for a film based on Dazzler to star Bo Derek. The project was ultimately abandoned when temperamental director John Derek was brought on board, leading to investors backing out. Dazzler eventually made her film debut in Dark Phoenix, portrayed by Halston Sage. =Cannon Films Spider-Man= The low box office performance of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties a very low priority in Hollywood until the 1990s. In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films. Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues. However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990. Tobe Hooper, then preparing both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood the concept of the character and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist's new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory. Unhappy with this perceived debasement of his comic book creation, Marvel's Stan Lee pushed for a new story and screenplay, written for Cannon by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. The variation on the origin story had Otto Octavius as a teacher and mentor to a college-aged Peter Parker. The cyclotron accident which \\"creates\\" Spider-Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force. \\"Doc Ock\\" reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities, anti-gravity effects, and bilocation which threatens to engulf New York City and the world. Joseph Zito, who had directed Cannon's successful Chuck Norris film Invasion USA, replaced Tobe Hooper. The new director hired Barney Cohen to rewrite the script. Cohen, creator of TV's Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Forever Knight, added action scenes, a non-canonical comic for the villain, gave Doc Ock the catch phrase, \\"Okey-dokey\\", and altered his goal from the Fifth Force to a quest for anti-gravity. Producer Golan (using his pen name \\"Joseph Goldman\\") then made a minor polish to Cohen's rewrite. Zito scouted locations and studio facilities in both the U.S. and Europe, and oversaw storyboard breakdowns supervised by Harper Goff. Cannon planned to make the film on the then- substantial budget of between $15 and $20 million. While no casting was finalized, Zito expressed interest in actor/stunt man Scott Leva, who had posed for Cannon's promotional photos and ads, and made public appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel. The up-and-coming actor Tom Cruise was also discussed for the leading role. Zito considered Bob Hoskins as Doc Ock. Stan Lee expressed his desire to play Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson. Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May, Peter Cushing as a sympathetic scientist, and Adolph Caesar as a police detective. With Cannon finances siphoned by the expensive Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Masters of the Universe, the company slashed the proposed Spider-Man budget to under $10 million. Director Zito opted out, unwilling to make a compromised Spider-Man. The company commissioned low-budget rewrites from writers Shepard Goldman, Don Michael Paul, and finally Ethan Wiley, and penciled in company workhorse Albert Pyun as director, who also made script alterations. Scott Leva was still associated with the character through Marvel (he had appeared in photo covers of the comic), and read each draft. Leva commented, \\"Ted Newsom and John Brancato had written the script. It was good but it needed a little work. Unfortunately, with every subsequent rewrite by other writers, it went from good to bad to terrible.\\" Due to Cannon's assorted financial crises, the project shut down after spending about $1.5 million on the project. In 1989, Path√©, owned by corrupt Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, acquired the overextended Cannon. The filmmaking cousins parted, Globus remaining associated with Path√©, Golan leaving to run 21st Century Film Corporation, keeping a number of properties (including Spider-Man) in lieu of a cash buy- out. He also extended his Spider-Man option with Marvel up to January 1992. Golan shelved the low-budget rewrites and attempted to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out. At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads touting the script by \\"Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman.\\" As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point.David Hughes. The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made Golan submitted this \\"new\\" screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted \\"1989\\" date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also \\"covered\\" by script readers at Columbia. Columbia's script analysts considered all three submissions \\"essentially the same story.\\" A tentative production deal was set. Said Stan Lee in 1990, \\"21st Century [is] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia and the way it looks now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century.\\" =Wolverine and the X-Men= Around 1989, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont entered in talks with Carolco Pictures and Lightstorm Entertainment to make a film adaptation of the X-Men comic book series, with James Cameron as producer, Kathryn Bigelow as director and Gary Goldman as writer. Late actor Bob Hoskins was slated to star as Wolverine and actress Angela Bassett was attached to star as Storm. Claremont also contacted Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to revive the character of Jean Grey due to the character's demise in The Dark Phoenix Saga comic book storyline. However, the project entered into development hell when Lee piqued Cameron's interest on the long planned Spider-Man film and after the defunction of Carolco Pictures. A different film was released in 2000 with a different studio, 20th Century Fox, and Bryan Singer as director. =Silver Surfer= In 1989, Erik Fleming, then a film student from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, and Robert Letterman approached Marvel Studios and Constantin Film's producer Bernd Eichinger to ask permission to make a short film featuring the Silver Surfer, as a proof of concept for the use of CGI in creating a realistic silver coloured human figure. Supervised by Steven Robiner, this 5-minute short film, completed in 1991, premiered at First Look USC Film Festival on September 21, 1993, led to significant interest from major studios in a feature-length Silver Surfer project. However, in 1992, Quentin Tarantino, fresh from his critical success with Reservoir Dogs, had come to Constantin Productions with a Silver Surfer script, but was turned away. Andrew Kevin Walker wrote a different script for 20th Century Fox in 2000, but nothing ever came of this, either. =Early abandoned Iron Man scripts= In April 1990, Universal Studios bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen, with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property. By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal. In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character, while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film. Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain. Over 10 years later, MODOK was included in early drafts of Captain America: The Winter Soldier as the main villain, with Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage being the first choice for the role, (Dinklage eventually made his MCU debut in Avengers: Infinity War as Eitri the Dwarf King), but the character was cut from the final draft and replaced by Alexander Pierce. Tom Rothman, President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script. Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \\"we can't make them all.\\" In 1999, Quentin Tarantino was also linked to a live-action Iron Man film, as director and writer. By July 2000, the film was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character. and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script. In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes falling through, New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel. In November 2005, Marvel Studios decided to start development from scratch, discarding all previous scripts, and announced Iron Man as their first film of the MCU. =Carolco Pictures / MGM James Cameron's Spider-Man= 21st Century's Menahem Golan still actively immersed himself mounting \\"his\\" Spider-Man, sending the original \\"Doc Ock\\" script for production bids. In 1990, he contacted Canadian effects company Light and Motion Corporation regarding the visual effects, which in turn offered the stop-motion chores to Steven Archer (Krull, Clash of the Titans). Toward the end of shooting True Lies, Variety carried the announcement that Carolco Pictures had received a completed screenplay from James Cameron. This script bore the names of James Cameron, John Brancato, Ted Newsom, Barry [sic] Cohen and \\"Joseph Goldmari\\", a typographical scrambling of Golan's pen name (\\"Joseph Goldman\\") with Marvel executive Joseph Calamari. The script text was identical to the one Golan submitted to Columbia the previous year, with the addition of a new 1993 date. Cameron stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the director's choice for Doctor Octopus. Months later, Cameron submitted an undated 57-page \\"scriptment\\" with an alternate story (the copyright registration was dated 1991), part screenplay, part narrative story outline. The \\"scriptment\\" told the Spider-Man origin, but used variations on the comic book characters Electro and Sandman as villains. This \\"Electro\\" (named Carlton Strand, instead of Max Dillon) was a megalomaniacal parody of corrupt capitalists. Instead of Flint Marko's character, Cameron's \\"Sandman\\" (simply named Boyd) is mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment-style bilocation and atom-mixing, in lieu of getting caught in a nuclear blast on a beach. The story climaxes with a battle atop the World Trade Center and had Peter Parker revealing his identity to Mary Jane Watson. In addition, the treatment was also heavy on profanity, and had Spider-Man and Mary Jane having sex on the Brooklyn Bridge. This treatment reflected elements in previous scripts: from the Stevens treatment, organic web-shooters, and a villain who tempts Spider-Man to join a coming \\"master race\\" of mutants; from the original screenplay and rewrite, weird electrical storms causing blackouts, freak magnetic events and bi-location; from the Ethan Wiley draft, a villain addicted to toxic super-powers and multiple experimental spiders, one of which escapes and bites Peter, causing an hallucinatory nightmare invoking Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis; from the Frank LaLoggia script, a blizzard of stolen cash fluttering down onto surprised New Yorkers; and from the Neil Ruttenberg screenplay, a criminal assault on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1991, Carolco Pictures extended Golan's option agreement with Marvel through May 1996, but in April 1992, Carolco ceased active production on Spider-Man due to continued financial and legal problems. When Cameron agreed to make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his previous Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right to decide on movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film. In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits. Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued. 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron's participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract. In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt. Via a quitclaim from Carolco dated March 28, 1995, MGM acquired 21st Century's film library and assets, and received \\"...all rights in and to all drafts and versions of the screenplay(s) for Spider-Man written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Menahem Golan, Jon [sic] Michael Paul, Ethan Wiley, Leslie Stevens, Frank Laloggia, Neil Ruttenberg, Barney Cohen, Shepard Goldman and any and all other writers.\\" MGM also sued 21st Century, Viacom, and Marvel Comics, alleging fraud in the original deal between Cannon and Marvel. In 1998, Marvel emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan that merged the company with Toy Biz. The courts determined that the original contract of Marvel's rights to Golan had expired, returning the rights to Marvel, but the matter was still not completely resolved. In 1999, Marvel licensed Spider-Man rights to Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment. MGM disputed the legality, claiming it had the Spider-Man rights via Cannon, 21st Century, and Carolco. =She- Hulk= A She-Hulk live-action motion picture was planned in the early 1990s, with Larry Cohen as writer and director. Ten months later, Brigitte Nielsen was announced to play the title role in Cohen's film. She posed for photos dressed both as She-Hulk and her alter ego Jennifer Walters, but the movie was never produced. In August 2019, a She-Hulk series was announced for Disney+, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. =Deathlok= In the early 1990s, a Deathlok film was at the script stage, with screenwriter Randall Frakes writing the script, but the project never moved forward. =Luke Cage= In 1991, Quentin Tarantino was planning a Luke Cage film with Laurence Fishburne, but he decided to focus on Pulp Fiction. A different film adaptation of Luke Cage had been in development since 2003 by Columbia Pictures, with a screenplay penned by Ben Ramsey, Avi Arad serving as producer and John Singleton directing. Jamie Foxx and Tyrese Gibson were considered for the lead role, while Dwayne Johnson, Isaiah Mustafa and Idris Elba expressed interest in playing Luke Cage. In May 2013, it was announced that the film rights for Power Man had reverted to Marvel Studios, resulting in the Netflix series adaptation. =Namor the Sub-Mariner= Filmmaker Philip Kaufman had been in discussions with Marvel Studios to develop Namor: Sub-Mariner in 1997, and courted Sam Hamm to write the script in 1999, but the outing never materialized. Saban Entertainment became involved as a producing partner with Marvel, with a script written by Randall Frakes. By 2001 Namor was set up at Universal Pictures, who hired David Self to write a new script the following year. They hoped for filming to begin in 2003 for a mid-2004 release, but development stalled for two years until Chris Columbus entered talks to direct in July 2004 and the release date was subsequently moved to 2007. Columbus departed in 2005, and Universal replaced him with Jonathan Mostow in September 2006. In 2012, Marvel CCO Joe Quesada thought Namor's film rights had reverted to Marvel, but in August 2013 it was revealed by Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige that this was not the case, and the rights remained at Universal Pictures. On June 3, 2014, Borys Kit confirmed that Marvel, not Universal Pictures now has the Namor film rights. On July 18, 2014, Kevin Feige told IGN in an interview that the Namor film rights are not with Universal and Legendary Pictures, but he explained there are a number of contracts and deals that need to be sorted out. On June 2, 2016, Marvel Chief Creative Office Joe Quesada told Kevin Smith on his Podcast that the Namor rights are now back with Marvel. On February 16, 2017, Production Weekly listed The Sub-Mariner as a project going into production. In April 2018, Feige stated in an interview with IGN that Namor's movie rights are \\"complicated\\" and in a similar situation to solo film rights for The Hulk with Universal holding distribution rights. =New Line Cinema's Venom= In 1997, David S. Goyer had written a script for a film featuring the Marvel Comics character Venom, which was to be produced by New Line Cinema. Dolph Lundgren was rumoured to be tipped to star in the film, which would have included the character Carnage as the main villain. The project ultimately did not move forward, and the rights to the character moved to Sony Pictures along with those for the character Spider- Man, whom Venom is an antagonist of in the comics. =Iron Fist= In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to co-finance an Iron Fist film, hiring Ray Park to star and John Turman to write the script in January 2001. Park read extensively the comics Iron Fist had appeared in. Kirk Wong signed to direct in July 2001, with filming set for late 2001/early 2002. Iron Fist nearly went into pre-production in March 2002. Wong left the project in April 2002. By August 2002, pre-production had started. Filming was pushed back to late 2002, and then to late 2003. In March 2003, Marvel announced a 2004 release date. In April 2003, Steve Carr entered negotiations to direct. In November 2003, the release date was moved to 2006. In March 2007, Carr placed Iron Fist on hold due to scheduling conflicts. In 2009, Marvel announced they have begun hiring a group of writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, such as Iron Fist, along with others such as Black Panther, Cable, Doctor Strange, Nighthawk, and Vision. In August 2010, Marvel Studios hired Rich Wilkes to write the screenplay, implying that Marvel had a future Iron Fist film project planned. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that they \\"probably were never going to make feature films about\\" characters featured in Marvel's Netflix TV series such as Iron Fist but that if the Netflix series became popular, \\"[it was] quite possible that they could become feature films.\\" =The Hands of Shang-Chi= In 2001, Stephen Norrington announced that he had agreed to direct a film called The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu, a film adaptation based on the Marvel character Shang-Chi. Norrington described the film as \\"a real honest-to-goodness martial arts film, rather than a film that simply has martial arts in it\\". In 2004, it was announced that Ang Lee had been brought on as producer. In 2005, it was announced that Stan Lee had agreed to executive produce the film for DreamWorks, with Yuen Woo-ping directing from a Bruce C. McKenna screenplay. In 2005, Avi Arad stated that he thought that a PG-13 adaptation was possible. In 2006, Ang Lee confirmed his and Yuen's continued involvement with the project. In December 2018, a different film adaptation of Shang-Chi was announced, with a script by David Callaham. In March 2019, Destin Daniel Cretton was chosen to direct. =Daredevil 2= Feige had stated on potential future Daredevil films, \\"there are many more stories to be told with old Hornhead and we'd love to tell them someday.\\" Avi Arad has also said that a sequel will begin development once the rights go from 20th Century Fox to Marvel Studios. Director Mark Steven Johnson showed interest in returning to direct with the Born Again storyline, as well as suggesting Mr. Fear as a possible villain. During 2004, Ben Affleck shot a cameo role for the spin-off film, Elektra, at the request of Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. In October 2004, Affleck stated he would only return in the lead role if Fox would renegotiate to tell the darker stories of Daredevil, and showed interest in a Kevin Smith graphic novel which included Mysterio, as well as the Born Again storyline. However, in November 2006, Affleck stated that he would never reprise the role, having felt \\"by playing a superhero in Daredevil, I have inoculated myself from ever playing another superhero... Wearing a costume was a source of humiliation for me and something I wouldn't want to do again soon.\\" Despite this, Affleck would later sign on to portray the DC superhero, Bruce Wayne / Batman, in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In July 2006, Michael Clarke Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt \\"comfortable\\" being down to 270 pounds. However, he jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he was offered $20 million. Duncan suggested that the character is portrayed to have been training a lot in jail in order to become faster in combat against Daredevil, also working as a way to fit his weight loss into the story. Duncan would later go on to reprise his role as the Kingpin in an episode of the animated series: Spider-Man: The New Animated Series. =Hulk 2= At the time of the release of Ang Lee's Hulk, screenwriter James Schamus was planning a sequel, featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains. Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross. During the filming of Hulk, producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date. On January 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for The Incredible Hulks production budget, with Universal distributing, because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel. Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a parallel universe one-shot comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \\"really starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \\"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\\". After the mixed reception of Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the film rights to the character, and writer Zak Penn began work on a sequel titled The Incredible Hulk. However, Edward Norton rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a reboot; director Louis Leterrier agreed with this approach. Leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America. =Lionsgate's Black Widow= In 2004, Lionsgate Entertainment announced that a Black Widow motion picture, featuring the Natasha Romanova version, was in the script stage by screenwriter-director David Hayter. Lionsgate subsequently dropped the project. Since then, the rights to the character were reverted to Marvel. After the character's live action debut in Iron Man 2, Kevin Feige indicated interest in producing a solo Black Widow film. and in February 2014, development had begun on it. In January 2018, Jac Schaeffer was hired to write the script. In July, Cate Shortland was hired to direct. =The Punisher 2= Lions Gate Entertainment planned to produce a direct sequel to The Punisher titled The Punisher 2, with Avi Arad, chairman and CEO of Marvel Studios, stating that the second film would \\"become the fifth Marvel property to become a sequel.\\" Jonathan Hensleigh said that he was interested in working with Thomas Jane again for The Punisher 2. Jane said that the villain for The Punisher 2 would be Jigsaw. The project, however, lingered in development for over three years. Jonathan Hensleigh completed a first draft of the script before pulling out around 2006. John Dahl was in talks to direct the film but pulled out due to script quality issues and the studio not wanting to spend a lot of money on the project. In a statement on May 15, 2007 and in two audio interviews Thomas Jane said that he pulled out of the project due to creative differences and the budget of the film being cut, in addition to director Walter Hill being turned down as director by Lionsgate.Fangoria Radio ‚Äì Thomas Jane After reading the new script by Kurt Sutter, Jane stated: What I won't do is spend months of my life sweating over a movie that I just don't believe in. I've always loved the Marvel guys, and wish them well. Meanwhile, I'll continue to search for a film that one day might stand with all those films that the fans have asked me to watch. The film got rebooted in 2008 titled Punisher: War Zone with Ray Stevenson as Castle. =Nick Fury= Andrew W. Marlowe was hired to write the script in 2006. The script he wrote was loosely based on Jim Steranko Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. series and involved the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The script was not written for the version of the character appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it was constructed before Samuel L. Jackson was cast but Marlowe said that the script could be \\"tweaked\\" for Jackson's portrayal, but no further developments took place. =Guillermo del Toro's Doctor Strange= In 2007, Guillermo del Toro was attached to direct a Doctor Strange film, from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman. The film was eventually canceled due to low studio interest. =Spider-Man 4= In May 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles. Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration. However, Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films, those two films would actually be a continuation of each other. James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in January 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film. The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire in November 2008 and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009. Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6. In 2007, Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. Jeffrey Henderson, who worked on the storyboards for Spider-Man 4, said in 2016 that Bruce Campbell, after making cameos in the first three films, was intended to have been revealed as Quentin Beck / Mysterio. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made. Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider-Man 4 had been cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal from the project. Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 5, 2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively. Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still \\"hated it\\". =Topher Grace's Venom spinoff= The Marvel Comics character Eddie Brock, an antagonist of Spider-Man, was first introduced in cinema in the May 2007 film Spider-Man 3, with Topher Grace in the role. The character was initially intended to play only a minor role that did not explore his alter-ego Venom, but this was eventually changed to a major villain role for the latter because producer Avi Arad felt the series had relied too much on director Sam Raimi's personal favorite Spider-Man villains and not characters that modern fans were more interested in. Raimi had been hesitant to explore the character due to his \\"lack of humanity\\". Arad revealed plans for a spinoff film focused on Venom in July 2007. By July 2008, Sony Pictures was actively developing Venom alongside direct sequels to Spider-Man 3, hoping the character could \\"add longevity\\" to the franchise in a similar fashion to Wolverine in 20th Century Fox's X-Men films. Jacob Estes had written a script for the film, but the studio was considering taking it in a different direction from that draft and was seeking new writers. Sony was also not yet convinced that Grace could \\"carry\\" the film. That September, Sony hired Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese to write a new script, while industry insiders suggested that Grace should return for the spinoff \\"because the likeable actor could be a sympathetic evildoer\\", in response to Venom co- creator Todd McFarlane suggesting that a Venom film could not do well with a villain as the central character. Wernick and Reese had pitched an original story idea for the film to Sony, which Reese described as \\"realistic, grounded, a little more dark take on the character\\". The pair then worked on an outline with Sony and Marvel, who \\"had specific rules about the villain and the backstory and stuff like that\\". They had completed a draft by April 2009, which included a role written specifically for Stan Lee, and featured a sequence where the Venom symbiote jumps \\"from body to body [through a city], and each person that it inhabits ends up becoming really violent and striking someone else and then it jumps to [them].\\" Wernick and Reese had turned in a second draft by September 2009, and Reese said that Sony was \\"pushing forward in whatever ways they push forward\\". A month later, Gary Ross, who was rewriting the script for Spider-Man 4 at the time, was hired to also rewrite the Venom script, as well as direct, and produce alongside Arad. Grace was \\"not considered likely\\" to return to the role then, with the film starting \\"from the drawing board\\" and looking to make the villain \\"an antihero who becomes a defender of the innocent.\\" In January 2010, Sony announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be rebooted after Raimi decided to no longer pursue direct sequels to Spider-Man 3. =Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer sequel= A sequel to the June 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer was planned. The main four cast of the other two films originally signed a three-movie deal, with 20th Century Fox and Julian McMahon also signed for a third film. Michael Chiklis was told Ben Grimm's relationship with Alicia Masters would have had a greater focus in a third film and Jessica Alba expressed interest in introducing Franklin Richards, while Beau Garrett wished to return as Nova. Tim Story said he was interested in directing a third and fourth film and writer Don Payne stated while he had not discussed a sequel with the studio, he was interested in working with more Fantastic Four characters saying \\"I‚Äôve always loved the Inhumans, the Skrulls, the Puppet Master, and Annihilus and the Negative Zone\\". As Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer performed less at the box office than the first film, 20th Century Fox was unsure of the series' future, and no script was in development. In March 2008, Chris Evans revealed, \\"I'm pretty sure we won‚Äôt do another one. I‚Äôm assuming that one is a closed book.\\" The series was eventually rebooted in 2015. =Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer spin-off= In 2007, 20th Century Fox hired J. Michael Straczynski to write the screenplay for a spin-off film. Straczynski said his script is a sequel, but will also delve into the Surfer's origins. In mid-2009, Straczynski expressed doubts that spin-off would be produced. In this continuity, the Surfer's origins and powers are similar to those of his comic-book incarnation, in that he agrees to become Galactus' herald in return for the safety of his home world and the woman he loved. Also, if the Surfer is separated from his board, he becomes weaker; in addition, the board also serves as a beacon for Galactus. Director Tim Story said he created Galactus as a cosmic cloud so a future Silver Surfer spin-off film would be unique as the character had yet to appear in comic-book form. Film writer J. Michael Straczynski stated \\"You don't want to sort of blow out something that big and massive for one quick shot in the first movie.\\" New development surfaced when writer Brian K. Vaughan was attached to a Silver Surfer script. =Blade prequel= In October 2008, Blade director Stephen Norrington was developing a prequel trilogy to Blade, featuring Stephen Dorff reprising his role as Deacon Frost. =Daredevil reboot= In August 2008, Jason Statham expressed interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested \\"just give me the chance, I would love to be Daredevil.\\" Frank Miller commented in agreement \\"I think he should be Daredevil too.\\" In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said \\"a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about.\\" Rothman added that \\"what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision.\\" By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin. Later, it was announced that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job‚Äîhowever, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard- boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role. =Punisher: War Zone sequel= In September 2008, Ray Stevenson and Lionsgate were planning a sequel to Punisher: War Zone, hinting at Barracuda as a possible villain.IGN Punisher: War Zone Trailer, Videos and Movies At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, when asked if he signed on for more Punisher, he said, \\"If I had my wish, it's going to run and run. It's up to the fan base. If this works, we get to do it all again.\\" After the film was not received well by audiences, the rights for the character eventually reverted to Marvel, resulting in the Netflix series adaptation. =X-Men Origins: Magneto= X-Men Origins: Wolverine was set to be the first of a series of X-Men Origins prequels, with the other being focused on Magneto. However, in April 2009, X-Men Origins: Magneto entered development hell and was eventually canceled. X-Men: First Class, released in 2011, was another prequel to the series, using some elements of X-Men Origins: Magneto. Set in 1962, the film features a young Professor X and Magneto and the foundation of the X-Men. =X-Men / Fantastic Four / Daredevil crossover film= In 2010, Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller were to co-write a film featuring the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Daredevil and Deadpool. The plot revolved around a superhero registration act, pitting various characters on opposite sides of the conflict similar to the Civil War story arc. Paul Greengrass had been approached to serve as director, though scheduling conflicts placed the project indefinitely on hold. Warren Ellis worked separately on another draft of the script. =Ghost Rider 3= In February 2012, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor discussed producing a potential Ghost Rider 3, and having someone else direct it. Neveldine told The Playlist that Nicolas Cage had expressed interest in appearing in another Ghost Rider film, hinting that the film could move forward provided that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was a success, saying, \\"I know Nic wants to do it, he's very pumped about it.... We'll just have to see how well [this] does.\\" In March 2013, when Cage was asked about a possible third installment, he said, \\"It's possible, but it won't be with me... Anything's possible. But I doubt, highly, that I would be in the third installment of that.\\" Cage said in March 2013 he believes another Ghost Rider film might happen \\"down the road\\", saying, \\"It would be interesting if they did it with a female Ghost Rider.\\" He added, \\"Personally, I'm done. I've done what I had to do with that part. You never say never, but right now, today, I would say that I'm done.\\" In May 2013, the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios, with the Robbie Reyes version appearing as a recurring character during the fourth season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Gabriel Luna. In the episode \\"Good Samaritan\\", the MCU's version of Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider, brings Robbie back from the dead by giving him the powers of the Ghost Rider / Spirit of Vengeance. =Venom Carnage= By March 2012, Sony was still interested in a Venom film, now looking to capitalize on the release of the first reboot film, The Amazing Spider-Man. The studio was in negotiations with Josh Trank to direct after Ross left the project to direct The Hunger Games (2012). That June, Arad and fellow producer Matt Tolmach discussed Venom connecting to The Amazing Spider-Man, after comparisons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films crossing over in The Avengers (2012). Arad called it \\"an Eddie Brock story\\" only, but Tolmach added, \\"Hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday.\\" In December 2013, Sony revealed plans to use The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) to establish their own expanded universe based on the Marvel properties the studio had the film rights to, including Venom. Arad and Tolmach would produce the films as part of a franchise brain trust with Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Ed Solomon set to write the screenplay for Venom, which Kurtzman would direct. In April 2014, Arad and Tolmach said Venom would be released after The Amazing Spider-Man 3‚Äîwhich was set for release on May 27, 2016‚Äîbut before The Amazing Spider-Man 4. However, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed, and, with Sony \\"under tremendous pressure to perform [that had them taking] a hard look at their most important franchise\\", the direction of the shared universe was rethought. The Amazing Spider-Man 3 was pushed back to 2018, and the Venom film, now known as Venom Carnage, was moved up to 2017. Kurtzman was still attached to direct, and write alongside Solomon. In February 2015, Sony and Marvel Studios announced a new partnership that would see Marvel produce the next Spider-Man film for Sony, and integrate the character into their MCU. Sony still planned to produce the spinoff films without Marvel's involvement, but by November they were believed to have been canceled so Sony could focus on its new reboot with Marvel. =The Amazing Spider-Man 3= Sony Pictures had originally intended the film to launch an expansive film universe around Spider-Man to compete with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In June 2013, Sony Pictures announced a third Amazing Spider-Man film with a release date of June 10, 2016, which Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner would return to write, and a fourth film with a release date of May 4, 2018. Additionally, the series was to include spin-off films featuring the Sinister Six and Venom, with Drew Goddard writing and directing Sinister Six and Kurtzman directing a Venom script co-written by himself, Orci, and Ed Solomon. Sinister Six had been planned for a November 11, 2016 release. Additionally, by August 2014, Sony Pictures had hired Lisa Joy Nolan to write the script for a 2017 film starring Felicia Hardy / Black Cat. In addition, Sony Pictures revealed plans for a spin-off based on Spider-Man 2099 to be released in late 2017. However, between December 2013 and the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in May 2014, Andrew Garfield and Marc Webb revealed that while they would both return for the third film, neither was certain of their involvement in the fourth, with Webb adding he would certainly not be directing. Following the mixed critical reviews and franchise-low box office performance of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the future of the franchise was unclear. By July 2014, Orci had left the third film to work on Star Trek Beyond, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, which would have included Chris Cooper returning as Norman Osborn and focused on Peter recovering from Gwen's death, was delayed to an unspecified date in 2018, and The Amazing Spider-Man 4 was moved to a later, unknown date, before they were ultimately canceled. =Sinister Six= In December 2013, Sony announced two spin-offs of The Amazing Spider-Man franchise, The Sinister Six and Venom, with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct The Sinister Six. At the end of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a line-up/set-up of the team was foreshadowed throughout the film and during the end credits: Rhino, Vulture, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and Kraven the Hunter were all teased as the members, with the Green Goblin serving as the leader (however, the line-up is left in debate as Goddard stated he wanted to adapt a more classic adaptation of the group which would have included Sandman and Doc Ock as the leader). The film was said to be a redemption story for the characters, and would probably not feature Spider- Man. As the Sinister Six's original goal, however, was to kill him, there would seem to be a chance that he would appear. The film was originally scheduled for release on November 11, 2016. However, after the announcement in February 2015 of a new Spider-Man franchise with Marvel Studios, the spin-offs were postponed and eventually cancelled. In July 2017, following the collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, a different film featuring the Sinister Six was announced to be in development. The team was teased in the mid-credits scene of Spider-Man: Homecoming, showing Adrian Toomes in prison where he is told by Mac Gargan that he's got some \\"boys on the outside\\". In an email leaked by the Sony Pictures hack, Pascal revealed that she planned for Tom Holland Spider-Man to appear in a Sinister Six film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, depending on the success of the then- upcoming licensing agreement with Marvel Studios. In October 2018, Goddard acknowledge that his script could eventually be reworked for the film. By December of the same year, producer Amy Pascal confirmed that the studio intends to use the script in the upcoming project and expressed the company's desire for Goddard to direct the film as well. =Fantastic Four (2015) sequel= In March 2014, before Fantastic Four began filming, 20th Century Fox announced plans for a sequel with a scheduled release date of July 14, 2017. Fox then rescheduled the release for June 2, 2017, with War for the Planet of the Apes taking its place on the July 14, 2017, slot. It changed the release date again to June 9, 2017, to be two weeks after Star Wars: The Last Jedi initial scheduled release date of May 26, 2017. Initially, it was intended for both Galactus and Silver Surfer to be shown in a post-credits scene of the film destroying an entire planet to tease a possible sequel. Both Galactus and Silver Surfer were removed from the final version of the film, postponing their reveals, due to budgetary reasons. Due to Fantastic Four's poor box office performance and negative reviews, Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter said that it \\"throws into question whether Fox will move ahead with a sequel\\". Phil Hoad of The Guardian said it would \\"be interesting\\" to see if Fox proceeds with a sequel and if it keeps the \\"gritty-on-paper\\" tone, noting that if Fox did not produce a sequel or a reboot until 2022, the film rights would revert to Marvel Studios. Despite the performance, it was reported in September 2015 that Fox still planned to produce a sequel, with Simon Kinberg working on the project. Drew McWeeny of HitFix said that while a sequel may not be produced in time for the 2017 release date, Fox would likely attempt to salvage the franchise, working with Josh Trank's defined vision and adding adjustments to it. While Kinberg affirmed his intent to make a sequel, Kate Mara said that a sequel looked unlikely, despite expressing interest in reprising her role as Sue Storm. In September 2015, Tommy Wiseau expressed enthusiasm in directing a sequel, having personal admiration for the film. In November 2015, the sequel was removed from Fox's release schedule. In May 2016, Kinberg reaffirmed his intent to make another Fantastic Four film with the same cast. Later that month, Toby Kebbell stated he had no interest in reprising his role as Dr. Doom if a sequel were to happen. Both Miles Teller and Kate Mara said that they were open to returning for a sequel. On February 24, 2017, when asked by Collider whether they would make another Fantastic Four film, Kinberg stated \\"I have no idea. I think the truth is we would not do another Fantastic Four movie until it was ready to be made. One of the lessons we learned on that movie is we want to make sure to get it 100% right, because we will not get another chance with the fans\\". Toby Kebbell stated he would only be interested in returning to the role of Doctor Doom if he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Kebbell added \\"Truth is, Doom is an incredible bad guy. They just keep trying to force him into the Fantastic Four...Doom is a monster, but you know my Doom was not, so there's that\\". Stan Lee (co- creator of the Fantastic Four) also expressed interest in the Fantastic Four, as well as the X-Men, returning to Marvel Studios stating, \\"We should have all of our characters under Marvel. Remind me on my way home to do something about that. We'll do our best.\\" However, Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige stated in June 2017 that there were no plans of adding the Fantastic Four to the Marvel Cinematic Universe at that time. Matthew Vaughn has expressed interest in directing a new version of Fantastic Four himself as an apology saying, \\"One of my favorites is the Fantastic Four, so maybe one day I'll try and rectify the mistake.\\" Concept artist Alexander Lozano revealed that Trank's iteration of the Fantastic Four were to make cameo appearances in Tim Miller's take on Deadpool 2, but were cut most likely due to the disappointing reception of the film and to cut back on the self-deprecating humor. =Rom= In December 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hasbro Studios and Paramount Pictures are creating a movie universe combining Rom with G.I. Joe, Micronauts, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, and M.A.S.K.. Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Joe Robert Cole, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Riegel, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet have joined the writing team for the project. By March 2018, Zak Penn had signed on to write the film's script. =Silver & Black= In March 2017, it was reported that Sony Pictures was developing a Black Cat and Silver Sable-centered film with writer Christopher Yost. It was intended to be a part of a shared universe called Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, centered on characters from the Spider-Man mythology, beginning with Venom in 2018. The films would have been more adult- oriented and though they would have taken place in the \\"same reality\\" as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they would have not crossed over with each other. In May 2017, it was announced that Gina Prince-Bythewood would direct the film, now titled Silver & Black. Production was to begin in March 2018, but has been delayed \\"indefinitely\\". Prince-Bythewood revealed that the cause of the delay was due to script issues. While the film was initially scheduled to be released on February 8, 2019, Sony removed the release date from the schedule. Production was slated to begin in 2019. In August 2018, Sony announced that Silver & Black will be canceled in favor of having both characters having their own feature films. Black Cat will reportedly be a re- worked version of the Silver & Black script, while the studio searches for screenwriters for Silver Sable. Prince-Bythewood will serve as a producer on both projects. Films affected by Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox =X-Force= 20th Century Fox announced a film version of X-Force. On July 11, 2013, it was reported that Jeff Wadlow was hired to write and direct the adaptation. Lauren Shuler Donner and Matthew Vaughn signed on as producers. On December 3, 2013, Rob Liefeld confirmed that Cable and Deadpool would be appearing in the film. The film was planned to be released sometime in the year 2017. A piece of concept art shows Cable, Domino, Warpath, Cannonball, and Feral as members of the team. After the release of Deadpool, Reynolds felt that Deadpool would soon be in an X-Force film, and Kinberg stated that there was potential for X-Force to be R-rated like Deadpool in contrast to the PG-13 \\"mainline X-Men movies\\". Bryan Singer has stated in an interview with Fandango that he would like to see X-23 to appear in the film as the new Wolverine. In addition, Psylocke has been rumored to appear in the film as she is a very prominent member of the team in the comic books; however, actress Olivia Munn (who plays Psylocke in the film X-Men: Apocalypse) has not addressed these rumours. On November 9, 2016, Kinberg announced to The Hollywood Reporter that the film is still on their schedule. In February 2017, it was reported that Ryan Reynolds would co-write the script with Joe Carnahan. On September 7, 2017, Drew Goddard was brought on to write and direct X-Force. On February 21, 2018, Hollywood North Buzz reports that the film will start shooting this October before the Disney/Fox deal is finalised. Following the release of Deadpool 2 in May 2018, co-writer Rhett Reese confirmed the X-Force movie will be an R-rated take on X-Men and will have \\"all the sex, violence, and silliness one would expect from the Deadpool-skewed militarized mutant force\\". Reese said \\"they can get their hands dirty a little bit. There's more gray area. It'll be raunchier, it'll be rated R, I'm sure. We'll get to see an ensemble movie that's pushed, hopefully, as far as the Deadpool individual movie was pushed.\\" In January 2019, all Fox Marvel properties were postponed until the Disney‚ÄìFox deal closes. On March 20, 2019, the deal was officially completed. =Gambit= In October 2014, Josh Zetumer was hired to write the screenplay for a film about the character Remy LeBeau / Gambit, based on the treatment by comic-book writer Chris Claremont. In June 2015, Rupert Wyatt was then hired to direct but left in September due to schedule conflicts. In November, Doug Liman was hired to direct the film. However, he left the film in August 2016, to direct Justice League Dark, and also cited script issues. In August 2017, Channing Tatum, who signed on as the title character, stated that the script was in the process of being rewritten. By October, Gore Verbinski had signed on as director, while Zetumer continued to work on the script. In January 2018, Verbinski departed the film due to scheduling issues. The film would have starred Channing Tatum with Donner, Kinberg, Tatum and Reid Carolin attached as producers. Kinberg stated that the film was intended to be the start of multiple installments focusing on Gambit. In May 2018, Kinberg stated that the final script had been completed, production would have commenced in New Orleans by the third quarter of 2018 and the film was scheduled for release on March 13, 2020. In October 2018, Daniel Woburn of Screen Rant opined that the film, which he described as being in development hell since 2014, was likely to be canceled once Disney's acquisition of Fox was complete since Marvel Studios would want to integrate the X-Men characters into the MCU. Lauren Shuler Donner revealed that Gambit, as well as the rest of the Fox Marvel films, were \\"on hold\\" until the Disney‚ÄìFox deal went through. In May 2019, the film was removed from the release schedule and officially cancelled. =Dark Phoenix sequels= Kinberg said in May 2016 that he planned for his directorial debut Dark Phoenix to be the first in a trilogy, spawning a new line of films focusing on the younger versions of the original X-Men characters. After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the X-Men would be integrated with the MCU under Disney, resulting in a probable reboot of the X-Men franchise. A year later, Kinberg revealed that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige had reviewed the script and tone of Dark Phoenix. In March 2019, Fox executive Emma Watts described Dark Phoenix as the final Fox X-Men film, ending development on the sequels. =The New Mutants sequels= In December 2016, Josh Boone and Knate Lee originally pitched The New Mutants to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy. In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and Karma would appear in the sequels, which he wanted to be \\"their own distinct kind of horror movies. The first film is certainly the 'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie. The next one would have been a completely different kind of horror movie. Our take was just go examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film. Drawing from the big events that we love in the comics.\\" He added that connections to the wider X-Men universe could have been explored more in future films. Boone and Lee revealed that they were interested in filming the first sequel in Brazil, and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would have played a role in the franchise. Fox executive Emma Watts described The New Mutants as the final film in Fox's X-Men series, ending possibilities of sequels. In August 2020, Boone confirmed there were no plans to incorporate The New Mutants into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. =X-23 spin-off= In February 2017, James Mangold has stated that he would like to see X-23 appear in future X-Men films, and that he would like to be involved in one way or another, should that happen. Kinberg has also stated that the studio's plans for future movies do, in fact, include X-23. On October 24, 2017, Mangold confirmed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that a script for an X-23 spinoff movie was in the works, stating: \\"We're just working on a script.\\" He had also cited the success of DC Films' Wonder Woman as 20th Century Fox's inspiration. It was then announced that X-23 creator Craig Kyle would have been involved in the solo spinoff alongside Mangold. There have been no further announcements, adding upon more uncertainty about whether it would be made due to the Disney / Fox deal. =Alpha Flight= In February 2017, Kinberg stated that 20th Century Fox had been focusing on developing ideas for future mutant-based teams that could expand the film series. He added that the Alpha Flight were characters being developed for a film adaptation. There have been no further announcements, adding upon more uncertainty about whether it would be made due to the Disney / Fox deal. =Exiles= In February 2017, Kinberg stated that Fox had been developing ideas for another mutant team that could become a film series. He added that the Exiles were characters being developed for a film adaptation. There have been no further announcements, adding upon more uncertainty about whether it would be made due to the Disney / Fox deal. =Doctor Doom= In July 2017, a Doctor Doom solo film was in development with Noah Hawley attached to direct. In an interview with ScreenGeek, Mads Mikkelsen had expressed interest in playing the character, having previously auditioned for Doctor Doom for the 2015 film. Dan Stevens was said to be involved with the film. In June 2018, Hawley stated that the script was almost finished, but that there was \\"uncertainty\\" about whether it would be filmed due to his upcoming film Lucy in the Sky and the fact that Disney plans to acquire Fox. In March 2019, Hawley revealed that he was still unsure about whether he would be continuing the project, as it had not been officially greenlit, but that he spoke to Kevin Feige about it. Hawley planned a more purist take on the film focused on the character, describing the film as a \\"kind of Cold War, geopolitical movie‚Äù that would have taken place in the fictional Eastern European nation of Latveria, which Doom rules with an iron fist as a monarch. After 10 years of isolation, Doom would invite a female journalist to visit for the purpose of sharing a message to the rest of the world. =Multiple Man= In November 2017, a film centering around Jamie Madrox / Multiple Man was in development with James Franco starring as the titular Marvel character. Allan Heinberg signed on to the project as screenwriter with Simon Kinberg and Franco attached as co-producers. There have been no further development news, adding upon more uncertainty about whether it would be filmed due to the fact that Disney plans to acquire Fox. =Kitty Pryde= In January 2018, it was announced that a Kitty Pryde solo movie was in development, with Tim Miller attached as the director and Brian Michael Bendis as the writer. There have been no further announcements, adding upon more uncertainty about whether it would be filmed due to the Disney / Fox deal and due to it being announced a month after the deal was announced. =X-Men: Fear the Beast= X-Men: Fear the Beast was the title of a spin-off film pitched by Byron Burton, former assistant to editor/composer John Ottman while he was working on X-Men: Apocalypse. Ottman was skeptical of the idea that Beast could carry his own film, but when Burton said he could complete a script in two weeks, Ottman gave the aspiring screenwriter a chance to prove the idea could work. After reading Burton's draft, Ottman decided to join the project and rework the script as a $90 million film. Fear the Beast would have been set in the late 1980s, opening in a snow-covered Inuit village that was being stalked by a mysterious creature. Ottman likened the film to John Carpenter's The Thing, due to both settings involving an \\"inhospitable environment\\". The story would then jump forward to Hank McCoy living in the X-Mansion, where he would be struggling to keep his mutation under control with a serum that was introduced in X-Men: Days of Future Past. His beastly nature surfaced during a Danger Room sequence, where the Friends of Humanity would have also made an appearance. Early in the first act, it would be revealed that Hank had been helping a scientist with a similar mutation known as Dr. Paul Cartier. Hank provided Cartier with a sample of his serum, but would later discover that he was the one terrorizing the Inuit village at the start of the film as the Wendigo. It would culminate in a showdown where Hank teamed up with Wolverine, who was located by Professor X using Cerebro. Fear the Beast ended with a tease of Mister Sinister having watched all of the proceedings. This was going to be a set up to Sinister being a multi-film villain orchestrating things. Ottman passed the idea around to people at 20th Century Fox, but because Fear the Beast involved core X-Men characters such as Professor X and Beast, the film would needed to be signed off by Simon Kinberg. Kinberg was the key architect behind the X-Men films and was working on Dark Phoenix at the time. He politely declined to read the script to avoid being influenced by it, as he had plans to reintroduce Wolverine into the X-Men films after Hugh Jackman retired from the role. As such, Wolverine being used in any other film would have muddled Kinberg's plans. However, Ottman didn't mind as he would have pushed to direct the film himself had Fox been interested. Ottman was constantly reworking the script to avoid any problems that would have showed up in post-production. Both Ottman and Burton noted that the version of Fear the Beast they originally pitched was an early draft that would have changed over time. =Omega Red= An outline of an Omega Red film was written by Byron Burton and John Ottman. It was planned to be a follow-up to X-Men: Fear the Beast, which teased Mister Sinister as a multi-arc villain orchestrating events behind-the-scenes. It would have been set in the late '80s and involved Sinister testing the X-Men. Animated films =Howard the Duck= In 1984, George Lucas announced development of an animated film based on the character created by Steve Gerber and quoting lines from Bill Mantlo. Director Willard Huyck and producer Gloria Katz strongly felt that the film should stay animated, but a contractual obligation with Universal Pictures required Lucas to provide the distributor with a live-action film, so he decided to make the film using live actors and to use special effects for Howard, resulting in the 1986 box office bomb. In 2019, another animated adaptation of Howard, as a television series, was announced to be released on Hulu, from writers Kevin Smith and Dave Willis. =Ultimate War / Thor= In January 2013, a proposed Ultimate War / Thor dual film DVD, for the Marvel Animated Features series, was passed over for the 2009 released Hulk Versus dual film DVD. Ultimate War would have adapted the Ultimate Marvel comic book of the same name while the Thor movie would have selected a Walt Simonson classic Thor storyline with the original selection being a Beta Ray Bill story. =JLA/Avengers film= In 2009, Bruce Timm expressed interest in making an animated film based on the JLA/Avengers comics series. Since then, there has been no further announcements. =Big Hero 6 sequel= On February 18, 2015, the directors of Big Hero 6, Don Hall and Chris Williams, said a sequel was possible. Hall added, \\"Having said that, of course, we love these characters, and the thought of working with them again some day definitely has its appeal.\\" In March 2015, Genesis Rodriguez told MTV that a sequel was being considered, saying, \\"‚Ä¶There's nothing definitive. There's talks of something happening. We just don't know what yet.\\" In April 2015, Stan Lee mentioned a projected sequel as one of several that he understood were in Marvel's plans for upcoming films. A film sequel was scrapped in favor of Big Hero 6: The Series, created and executive produced by Kim Possible Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, and co- executive produced by Nick Filippi. The majority of the cast from the film returned to voice the characters, except for Damon Wayans Jr. and T.J. Miller.

Duly, the pair of hapless middle-aged lovers sign up for flying lessons and accidentally find themselves performing some wild stunts in an aircraft. The owner of the \\"Spirit of Goldberg\\" (Lester Bernard) is impressed with the skills of these two tyros. He persuades the duo to make a long ocean flight. The flight leads to more aerial mayhem, especially when the \\"real\\" pilot (Duke Martin) turns out to be a lunatic.

Reception The contemporary film review of The Flying Romeos by Mordaunt Hall in The New York Times, noted, \\"The fun in this piece really starts when Messrs.

scholars for centuries, and it continues to remain so. The Tamil Nadu government has ratified 31 BCE as the year of birth of Valluvar. Still the precise date as to when Valluvar completed writing the Kural text remains murky. This article speaks about various dates arrived at by various scholars over time. Dating bases The Tirukkural belongs to the Late-Sangam period and has been listed as one of the chief text of the Sangam corpus. However, scholars find it difficult to ascertain the exact period of the text and its author and have employed, besides archaeological research, various historical references and linguistic methodologies to arrive at a date. The following are some of the linguistic methodologies scholars use to date the Kural text: * Comparing the text with other contemporary Sanskrit texts and finding out the date by the relevance found in them. * Finding out the date on the basis of the number of Sanskrit loan words found in the Kural literature. * Arriving at a date on the basis of the meaning of certain terms as suggested by early commentators. The Sangam texts were historically grouped as the Eighteen Greater Texts (which includes the Ten Idylls and the Eight Anthologies) and the Eighteen Lesser Texts in that order. Many scholars count only the Eighteen Greater Texts as proper Sangam texts and refer to the Eighteen Lesser Texts as the late-Sangam works. The Kural literature, which has been traditionally listed under the Eighteen Lesser Texts group, is the oldest of this group. Evidently, there is no mention about Valluvar in any of the proper Sangam texts. Thus, scholars conclude that the Kural literature appeared only after the Ten Idylls and the Eight Anthologies texts. In the earliest Sangam literature, verses were composed mostly in the asiriyappa metre. Later texts were written in the vanjippa metre. Other metres such as kalippa, paripaadal, and venpa appeared much later. Verses in all the proper Sangam texts appear in the asiriyappa, kalippa, and paripaadal metres. The Kural couplets were composed in the venpa metre. Thus, Kural is said to have been composed after the Ten Idylls and the Eight Anthologies texts. The Kural literature has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third Sangam, appearing before other post-Sangam texts, and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who uphold this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M. Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian K. K. Pillay assigned it to the early 1st century CE. Content-based dating While other Sangam texts approved of, and even glorified, the four immoral deeds of meat- eating, alcohol consumption, polygamy, and prostitution, the Kural literature strongly condemns these as crimes. In fact, it was the Kural text that condemned these as crimes for the first time in the history of the Tamil land. Thus, scholars find this as another reason to place the Kural text after the proper Sangam era. Historical dating Scholars who consider Kural to be a work of the 1st century BCE include J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai, D. P. Palaniyappa Pillai, C. Rajagopalachari, C. Dhandapani Desikar, M. Rajamanickam, V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, Maraimalai Adigal, and Tarlochan Singh Bedi. According to these scholars, there are many evidences that put Valluvar's date during or before the 1st century BCE. For instance, in his work Description of Ceylon (1726), Dutch scholar and Christian missionary Fran√ßois Valentijn quotes Seneca the Younger's (c. 4 BCE‚Äì65 CE) mentioning of the Tirukkural in his works, hinting that Valluvar must have lived during or before Seneca the Younger's time: \\"Tiriwalluwir: One of their best prayer books, composed in clear and concise verses by Thiruwalluwer. Those who can read and understand him, can also understand the most difficult poets. This writer, according to the writings of Seneca, lived over 1500 years ago at Mailapore.\\" In his 1969 book, C. Dandapani Desikar cites the work Studies in Tamil Literature, which lists several historical evidences about Valluvar's period: * Elaela Singan Chettiyar, historically known as a contemporary and friend of Valluvar, who has been mentioned as Elaela and Alara in Ceylon history, lived between 144 BCE and 101 BCE. * Tiruvalluva Maalai, a collection of paeans praising the Kural text and Valluvar, was written by various late-Sangam authors, some of whom lived during the 1st century BCE. * Mamulanar, one of the contributors of the Tiruvalluva Maalai, has mentioned about the Ganges flood in Pataliputra. However, he has not mentioned about the Pataliputra fire during the 1st century CE. This shows that Mamulanar lived before 1st century CE. * The Kural text's books on aram and porul bear semblance with various Sanskrit texts such as the Dharma Shastra and Artha Shastra. Koutilya (371 BCE‚Äì283 BCE) authored the Artha Shastra during the 4th century BCE. If the Kural were based on these, it must have been authored no later than a couple of centuries. * The Kural text is divided into three parts, which was a common practice during the period of the writing of works such as Panchatantra, Hitopadesha, Kamandaka, and other texts, which makes them a contemporary of the Kural literature. Linguistic dating Opining that the Kural literature does not belong to the Sangam period, Czech linguist Kamil Zvelebil dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE. His estimate is based on the language of the Kural text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises. Zvelebil notes that the Kural text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The Kural text also features a higher number of Sanskrit loan words compared with these older Sangam texts. According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, Valluvar was also a part of the \\"one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition,\\" as a few of his verses seem to bear similarities with the verses in Sanskrit texts such as MƒÅnavadharma≈õƒÅstra and Kautilya's Artha≈õƒÅstra. S. Vaiyapuri Pillai assigned the work to c. 650 CE, believing that it borrowed from some Sanskrit works of the 6th century CE. Zvelebil disagrees with this assessment, pointing out that some of the words that Pillai believed to be Sanskrit loan words have now been proved to be of Dravidian origin by Thomas Burrow and Murray Barnson Emeneau. Many Christian missionaries, such as George Uglow Pope and Robert Caldwell, even pushed the date further down to between 800 and 1000 CE, claiming that ‚ÄúChristian Scriptures were among the sources from which the poet derived his inspiration.‚Äù However, scholars, including Zvelebil, J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai, Sundaram Pillai, Kanakasabai Pillai, and Krishnaswamy Aiyengar, and even missionaries such as John Lazarus refute such claims. Zvelebil points out to the Kural's unwavering emphasis on the ethics of moral vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and non-killing (Chapter 33), as against any of the Abrahamic religious texts, which suggests that the ethics of the Kural is rather a reflection of the Jaina moral code than of Christian ethics. Pillai declares Pope's claim as ‚Äúan absurd literary anachronism‚Äù and says that the first two books of the Kural in particular are ‚Äúa stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality.‚Äù John Lazarus observes that, in stark contrast to the Bible's concept of killing, which refers only to the taking away of human life, the Kural's concept of killing ‚Äúdeals exclusively with the literal taking away of life,‚Äù of both humans and animals. Notwithstanding the incessant debate on the precise date, taking the latest of the estimated dates, the Tamil Nadu government officially declared 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar, as suggested by Maraimalai Adigal, in 1921. On 18 January 1935, Valluvar Year was officially added to the calendar.

It assists coroners, their staff, public sector agencies, researchers and other agencies in obtaining coronial data to inform death and injury prevention activities.  History  The NCIS was the first national database for coronial information in the world. It was established in Australia following recognition by coroners that their mandate for public health and safety could be improved if they could share coronial data across borders to identify previous similar deaths. Prior to the establishment of the NCIS there was no systematic national data storage system for Australia‚Äôs eight coronial jurisdictions and the NCIS is considered an invaluable tool to facilitate public health knowledge and research, hence strengthening the coroner's role In September 1997, the Australian Coroners' Society endorsed a business plan for the development and management of the NCIS by a consortium called the Monash University National Centre for Coronial Information (MUNCCI). The consortium was made up of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (a statutory agency of the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation, which also hosts the Department of Forensic Medicine at Monash University), Monash University‚Äôs Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, and the Monash University Accident Research Centre.AIHW, Driscoll T, Henley G, Harrison J, (2004).The National Coroners Information System as an information tool for injury surveillance.

Since 2012, the NCIS has been part of the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation through the Service, Strategy and Reform Division  Data  The NCIS collects demographic, contextual and circumstantial information on every reportable death in Australia and New Zealand, as well as legal, medical and scientific reports such as the coroner's finding, post mortem report, toxicology report and police summary of death reports. Supplementary data is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the New Zealand Ministry of Health.

The NCIS database is available by application only to approved users, including death investigators (coroners, coronial death investigators, forensic pathologists and police assisting a coroner) and ethically approved third party researchers. Access for Australian and New Zealand death investigators provides them with the ability to review previous coronial cases across jurisdictions that may be similar in nature to current investigations, thus ensuring their ability to identify systemic hazards within the community.

History The Great China Match Company Factory was founded by Ong-Sung Lieu (), Kyih-Sung Lieu (), and T.L. Soong () in 1939. The factory on Peng Chau was established as the Great China Match Company relocated its operations from Mainland China to escape the advancing Japanese occupation of China. Cheung Chau was initially explored as a site for the factory, however this idea was later abandoned as residents were fearful of the dangers of having such a volatile facility on their island. Peng Chau was chosen as the site as the residents of the island were eager to create employment opportunities following the closure of the large lime production facilities on the island. The business was originally established with HK$300,000 of capital. The factory commenced operations in April 1940 with 580 employees. During the 1940s, the factory was one of the largest employers in Hong Kong with between 1,000 and 2,000 employees. During the Second World War, the factory was seized by the Japanese military between November 1942 and August 1943. In January 1948, there was an explosion at the factory which led to the death of one employee, and injured another. In November 1952, a drastic reduction in demand from South Asia forced the company to close the factory and fire over 640 workers, however, a surge in demand from South East Asia prompted the company to reopen the factory in January 1953. The introduction of lighters led to a steep decline in demand for matches and the factory was finally closed in 1976.

History The factory, originally consisting of two buildings, was established in the 19th century and was one of 11 lime kilns present on the island of Peng Chau. The current building was constructed during the 1920s. The lime was produced by burning oyster shells, clam shells, and coral. Lime from the kiln was used in a variety of industries including construction and paper-making. The development of more modern materials led to the decline in business for the kilns in the 1950s. The kiln was able to maintain operation, even during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during the Second World War. However, as lime became an obsolete material during the 1950s, the factory was finally closed during the 1970s. Heritage Status The building was submitted to the Antiquities Advisory Board for consideration as a heritage building under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance on the 19th of March 2009, which was granted on 20 Sept 2010. This was largely done to preserve the building, which was beginning to fall into dilapidation, by opening up avenues of potential funding to cover the cost of the upkeep of the building for the owner under the Financial Assistance for Maintenance Scheme.

Set as a detective investigation scene, in Deception players find themselves in a scenario of intrigue and murder, deduction and deception. Players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case, but one of the investigators is actually the killer. Different roles are randomly assigned at the start of play. As the investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. The game was originally released via Kickstarter, raising over $65000. Deception received positive reviews, and was awarded with the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence  Gameplay  In Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, each player first receives a secret role: Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, or Accomplice. Everyone then closes their eyes except for the forensic scientist, who instructs the murderer to open his eyes. The murderer does so, revealing himself to the scientist, and he points to one of the five murder weapons in front of them and one of their five pieces of evidence. The Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist. The Murderer and his Accomplice try to secretly mislead the real detectives by picking the wrong weapon and clue.  Release and reception  Deception: Murder in Hong Kong was initially sold via Kickstarter, with 1,796 backers contributing $65,777 during the campaign. It was delivered to backers in December 2015 and then released in retail stores. Deception: Murder in Hong Kong won the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence.

Biography  Nikolai Dudin was born on December 22, 1973 in the village of Mikhalkovo, Ivanovo Oblast. Dudin suffered greatly because of his father's beatings in his childhood, as well as specific skills that his father instilled in him, such as teaching him hunting at a young age and even cutting up the warm carcasses of dead animals. In the end, all of this led to Nikolai shooting his father with a sawed-off shotgun on December 3, 1987. Arkady Dudin's body was well hidden, but after a year Nikolai was arrested for rape, and confessed to his father's murder. The court considered that at the time of the murder, Nikolai was still under 14 years of age, and did not execute him, instead imprisoning him for 7 years. Subsequently, he was repeatedly penalized for defiance of the administration, trying to organize a riot and escape, attempting to kill a prisoner from a neighboring cell, as a result of which he was again convicted and released in 2000, 12 years after the conviction. The next murder Dudin committed was on February 15, 2002. His victim was an employee of the Furmanov telecommunications company. In a state of intoxication, he struck her with a hard blunt object on the head, breaking the base of the skull, as a result of which the victim died. Dudin subsequently claimed that he had wanted to rob her. On the same day, he committed a double murder, this time the victims being two employees of a local sewing shop. As it later turned out, the drunk Dudin had decided to get acquainted with the girls, but they rejected his advances, prompting him to stab them with a knife, causing a total of 28 wounds on the first woman, and 32 on the second. The killer committed the following murders during the May holidays: on the night between May 1st and 2nd, 2002, a resident of the city disappeared without a trace, her body being discovered only after Dudin was arrested. On May 8, he committed a triple murder. In a state of intoxication, he leaned on the face of a house on Kremlyovskaya Street, bringing it down. The owner of the house, Andrei Polozov, was present, and Dudin pulled out his sawn-off and opened fire. Then he shot the wife and killed their 11-year-old daughter with a knife. On May 10, Dudin committed another triple murder under similar circumstances. The situation in the city was heated, and panic ensued, as Dudin committed a double murder shortly after. On July 17, 2002, the killer was captured red- handed with a new murder attempt. On August 6, 2002, he wrote a confession, explaining his motive was that he killed people who humiliated his dignity. In December 2003, Dudin was sentenced to life imprisonment in a special regime colony by the Ivanono District Court. The Supreme Court of Russia then upheld the verdict without change. He is currently serving his sentence in the White Swan prison. See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  Elena Aristarkhova. The grim maniac.

Varkala Tunnel during 1900 With a length of , the two tunnel played a vital role in transferring ferry goods and people from capital city Trivandrum to Kollam during the pre-independence era. The tunnel is located under the main cliff of the region and represents the architectural excellence of the workers and engineers of that era. Varkala Tunnel in 1920 Built under the supervision of T. Madhava Rao, the Dewan of Travancore Kingdom, the tunnel also make up for the Varkala reach of Thiruvananthapuram‚ÄìShoranur canal, which passes through this delicate structure.  Features  The tunnel is built in an area that is famous for Cenozoic sedimentary formation cliffs are a unique geological feature on the otherwise flat Kerala coast, and are known among geologists as Varkala Formation. The tunnels are carved through Laterite rocks. There are two tunnels in the system namely, * Sivagiri Passage 722 m long and, * Chilakkoor Passage 350 m long. The tunnel system connects the Anchuthengu Kayal with Edava- Nadayara Kayal.  Present Status  Despite of immense tourism potential the passages are remaining as unused. It is silted and maintenance works are all in limbo. In 2006 period there was a renewed interest to revive the tunnels by then Chief minister of Kerala, Shri. V. S. Achuthanandan he had even undertaken a boat ride in the canal to make a first-hand assessment. There after it was in limbo until 2014 -16 period, when few discussions started again and died down as usual. In 2016, the state government had sought the help of Metroman E. Sreedharan to revive the tunnel. In 2017 there were discussions to construct new waterway bypass skipping existing tunnels due to lack of width and draft as per National Waterways standards. As of 2020, in Chilakkoor passage, dredging work and sledge removal are progressing. Works on Sivagiri passage is also expected to start soon. The passages are planned to be used for tourist activities. Also Government of India has turned down Kerala's demand to extend the existing National Waterway 3 route to Kovalam from Kollam through Varkala.

She challenged the government of Canada in a landmark case regarding sex-based discrimination among Indigenous women and children.  Brief summary  Sharon McIvor was born in Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. She identifies as a Lower Nicola Indian Band member and is recognized through her roles in advocacy, where she stresses the importance of Aboriginal Rights. She has been a strong supporter for missing and murdered Indigenous women, including children and has emphasized the importance of such societal issues by addressing the seriousness of this on-going battle. McIvor is also an advocate for NWAC, also referred to the Native Women‚Äôs Association of Canada. She persistently challenged the government of Canada on numerous accounts regarding sex-based discrimination among Indigenous women and children. More specifically, she shed light on the issue of disenfranchisement and the difficulty it has when obtaining status for the offspring of couples who were victims of this form of identity loss. To expand, this consists of an Indigenous woman who marries a non-Indigenous man, resulting in a loss of status. When Sharon McIvor applied to obtain her status, and by extension of her children as well, she was denied due to the policies under the Indian Act. By being a representative of the Indigenous population who empowers her community through acts of kinship, the deconstruction of colonization and discrimination is prevalent in her attempts to remove sexist undertones from legislation in order to ensure gender equality. Continuing her path of perseverance by overcoming adversity that has been implemented by the government through restrictive and limited policies such as the Indian Act (Bill C-31), McIvor continues to address an array of concerns which inevitably results in deleterious effects for many generations of Indigenous people. Through Sharon's work she has been honoured by The Feminist Alliance for International Action as a member of the Indigenous Famous Six. Other members are Jeannette Corbiere-Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Senator Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, Lynn Gehl, and Senator Lillian Eva Dyck.  Early life and education  McIvor was born and raised in Merritt, B.C, Canada. She studied at the University of Victoria and Queen's University where she has acquired two degrees, an LL.B. and LL.M. in 1987 and 1995.  Career  McIvor is currently employed by the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology in Merritt, British Columbia, which specializes in post-secondary education for those who identify as Indigenous. She has been contributing information to an array of departments within her workplace including the criminology department, Indigenous Academic Studies, and University transfers. To expand she teaches about history, politics, colonization, and human rights to aboriginal students. McIvor is known for focusing on topics such as systemic discrimination within Bill-C31 (The Indian Act), while shedding light on the lengthy process of the court proceedings that she was extensively involved in. Her ability to continue persevering through the courts lengthy proceeding shows how dedicated she is when advocating Indigenous Rights. Spreading awareness of the colonialism that has impacted those who identify as Indigenous for so many years is imperative when rectifying policies and legislation that enforce effects in a discriminatory manner.

Dewar's writings were first translated from Gaelic to English in 1879 and since then have been published in multiple formats. The collection of the folktales was intended to ensure that they were not forgotten by the population of the Scottish Highlands, and the manuscripts serve today as both a cultural record and historical source. Concept and creation The creation of The Dewar Manuscripts has its origin in the vision and works of John Francis Campbell. In the mid-19th century Campbell took it upon himself to record as much Gaelic oral folktale as he was able, for the sake of preventing the loss of this cultural heritage. Unable to make time in his work schedule for this endeavour, Campbell employed others to collect tales from the Scottish Highlands. One of Campbell‚Äôs most trusted collectors was John Dewar. Dewar had no formal training in the field methodology of recording folk tales. Instead Dewar developed his own shorthand, by which he would take notes on the stories orally recounted to him, particularly regarding the phrases or words his subjects employed. After compiling multiple accounts of the same or similar folktales, Dewar would combine his notes to produce a single fluid written account of a tale. Dewar is believed to have taught himself to read and write in Gaelic and English, however his accounts were written in Gaelic, the language in which the oral accounts were given to him. Tales collected by Dewar were first included in Campbell‚Äôs Popular Tales of the West Highlands, published in 1860. In 1881, Hector Maclean completed an English translation of the complete collection of Dewar‚Äôs writings, amounting to 19 volumes. Of these, one volume was published in 1964. A collection of John Dewar's notes can be found among the paper of John Francis Campbell in the National Library of Scotland. Contents In addition to a foreword by John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, and an introduction by the Rev. John Mackechnie, The Dewar Manuscripts Vol.1 contains 45 of the folktales translated from John Dewar's original notes in Gaelic. =Folktales= *Cailean M√≥r This story describes an assassination attempt on Cailean M√≥r (Big Colin) by the Malcolm Clan.

Legacy/Importance The Dewar Manuscripts are a foundational work in the specialised field of the history of Scottish folklore, though some contention remains as to their validity as a record of actual historical events. Prior to the compilation of The Dewar Manuscripts, Scottish-Gaelic folklore was held in some measure of contempt by the broader academic community. Legislation and cultural practices had resulted in a decline in the use of the Gaelic language in Scotland, and consequently oral folktales were at risk of being lost entirely. The Dewar Manuscripts serve to preserve a substantial body of oral folklore which would otherwise be unavailable to modern historians. Some historians claim that, in contrast to written sources of Scottish history, oral folklore provides insight into the lifestyles of non-literate Gaelic communities. This form of cultural heritage has allowed for communities belonging to the non-aristocratic classes to maintain agency in the telling of their histories. Conversely, it has been argued that the contents of The Dewar Manuscripts owe more to the style of heroic saga, shedding light more so on family and clan histories than on the lifestyles of commoners. The Dewar Manuscripts have been the source of some controversy regarding the validity of oral folktales as historical sources. Gibson draws attention to a ‚Äú‚Ä¶tendency to blur the line between historical and other sources‚Ä¶‚Äù, in reference to the use of tales from The Dewar Manuscripts to supplement written evidence regarding the Appin Murders. However, Macfarlane points out ‚ÄúIn many societies they [oral folktales] are the only material with which to reconstruct the past‚Ä¶‚Äù Regardless, The Dewar Manuscripts are broadly appreciated for its contribution to the body of published oral history and have been described as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a work of unique importance...‚Äù Publication history The Dewar Manuscripts, Volume 1 was first published in 1964, appearing as an English translation of the tales collected by John Dewar, under the commission of the 8th Duke of Argyll. Dewar‚Äôs work was translated from Gaelic into English in 1879 by Hector Maclean, a fellow contemporary of J.F Campbell, under the commission of the 9th Duke of Argyll. This translation was published in 1964. The Book was edited and contains a foreword by Rev. John MacKechnie. The book was published independently, financed by Charles A. Hepburn, a Scottish businessman and patron of the arts. John Dewar, 1801 or 1802 - 1872 Towards the beginning of 1859, John Francis Campbell, Scottish author and scholar, began assembling a network of contacts that could be trusted to do the work of faithfully collecting and recording folktales of the Scottish Highlands. The earliest evidence of Dewar‚Äôs association with J.F. Campbell is found in a letter from October 1859, in which Dewar indicates his willingness to collect tales for him. Accordingly, Dewar began his work as a collector at the age of 57, having previously worked for much of his life as a woodman in the service of George Campbell, the 8th Duke of Argyll. At some point prior to his engagement with J.F Campbell, Dewar suffered an injury which ended his career as a woodman. Thus Dewar was able to make the collection of folktale his primary occupation for the latter part of his life. Dewar left the employment of J.F Campbell in 1860, following the publication of Campbell‚Äôs Popular Tales of the West Highlands, which features some of the stories recorded by Dewar. From 1860 until his death in 1872, Dewar continued collecting folktales with the sponsorship of the Duke of Argyll. John Dewar‚Äôs death certificate labels his occupation as being ‚ÄòCollector of Traditions‚Äô. Contemporaries of Dewar, notably J.F Campbell, note that he was known for his ability to record stories in writing as quickly as they were told to him. The Scottish-Gaelic poet Calum Macphail (1847-1913) wrote a poem entitled ‚ÄòCumha lain Mhic an Debir‚Äô in recognition of Dewar‚Äôs work.

He killed 9 people with special cruelty, caused two people serious bodily injury, and more than a dozen victims received from mild to moderate psychological disorders.  Biography  Serebryakov was born on August 18, 1941 in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, in the city of Malgobek. Since childhood he showed criminal tendencies‚Äîpossessing violent character and a craving for alcohol, repeatedly getting into fights with strangers, his colleagues and relatives, for which he was repeatedly detained by law enforcement. He also fell into the field of view of the police for inflicting bodily harm, theft, arson and rape, but his guilt could not be proven. In January 1967, after being demobilized from the ranks of the Soviet Army, he moved to Kuybyshev to his sister. He began work at the Kuybyshev Cable Plant. On September 4, 1967, Serebryakov tried to rape Yekaterina Kharitonova, a dispatcher in one of the Kuybyshev tram depots. He rushed into the control room wearing only swimming trunks and with a knife in hand. The woman was stabbed in the neck and arm, but Serebryakov, frightened by her resistance, fled.–£–±–∏–π—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞ –≤–µ–ª–æ—Å–∏–ø–µ–¥–µ (–°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞, –≥. –°–∞–º–∞—Ä–∞) The first killings Serebryakov committed on the night of April 27 to 28, 1969. He entered through a window into one of the living rooms of a 24-room one-story dormitory belonging to the Progress plant (now Litvinov) he killed Stepan Zorkin, his 5-year-old son Lyonya and his wife Maria by hitting them with a brick. After raping the dead woman, he stole 135 rubles and set fire to the deceased's clothes. Several rooms of the hostel were damaged from the fire, with suspicion falling on Maria's ex-husband.–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫ –∏–∑ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–≥–æ (–≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ ¬´–í–æ–ª–∂—Å–∫–∞—è –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∞¬ª, –≥. –°–∞–º–∞—Ä–∞)¬´–ù–æ—á–Ω–∞—è —Ç–≤–∞—Ä—å¬ª –°–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä—è–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –ö—É–π–±—ã—à–µ–≤–µ (1969‚Äî1970 –≥–æ–¥—ã) The next crime Serebryakov committed happened a year later. On the night of April 30, 1970, after entering an apartment on Aeroflot Street, he beat the landlady Ekaterina Kutsevalova and her daughter Olga with the bottom side of an axe he had taken with him. He began to rape the mother, thinking she was dead, but her daughter regained consciousness and started screaming, waking up the neighbors and frightening the maniac. Both of them survived. While searching for victims, Serebryakov traveled around the city on a bicycle \\"Ukraine\\". On the night of May 8 to 9, 1970, Serebryakov killed 70-year-old Praskovya Salova and 30-year-old Nina Vasilieva, with an axe. Soon a man named Timofeev came to the police, who claimed to have committed the murders, but verification proved that he was lying. After that, panic ensued in Kuybyshev. In 1970, the USSR was supposed to hold elections for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Residents refused to let agitators into their apartments, even when accompanied by police officers, and directly stated: \\"Until the killer is caught, we will not vote.\\" On the night of June 4 to 5, 1970, in a house on Podgornaya Street, in the Oktyabrsky District near the Country Park, Serebryakov hacked to death the Malomanov family - father, mother and two children - with an axe. After violating the woman's corpse, the maniac set fire to the house and fled on his bicycle. = Arrest = On May 22, 1970, an investigative brigade was created, headed by General Igor Karpets. Militia patrols on the streets were reinforced, and the number of volunteers increased. Near one of the crime scenes a key to Serebryakov's bicycle with the brand of the Kharkov bicycle factory was found. After that, special attention was paid to cyclists. On June 8, 1970, Serebryakov, who was riding a bicycle on a side street near the Airport Highway, was noticed by the druzhinnik Zagfar Gayfullin. He initially did not cause any suspicion, but when a gust of wind opened his cloak, his axe was seen, after which a chase began. Serebryakov jumped into the courtyard of a private house and hid himself in a street toilet. The druzhinnki, along with the owner of the house who was awakened by them, began to search the yard. One of the men, Victor Kochanov, opened the toilet and got a blow to the face, then a brick to the head.–¢—É–ø–∏–∫. –Æ. –°–∫–ª—è—Ä–æ–≤. ¬´–í–æ–ª–∂—Å–∫–∞—è –∑–∞—Ä—è¬ª, 24 –∏—é–Ω—è 1970 –≥. Serebryakov ran to the railway station \\"Internatnaya\\", near which at that time there was a freight train consisting of tanks and fuel oil. He climbed on the ladder of one of the tanks and wanted to leave by train, but was seen by one of the machinist's assistants, forcing him to run to the other side of the railway to the asphalt plant. There he climbed a tree and jumped off at the territory of the Progress Rocket Space Center. The alarm went off, and soon Serebryakov was detained by security guards of the plant, and then taken to the police. The maniac's arrest took place a week before the election. The policeman who arrested the maniac was promoted two ranks, from senior lieutenant to major. Serebryakov's fingerprints and blood type matched with the corresponding characteristics of the murderer, and in his room, stolen items from the victims were found. He soon confessed. The forensic psychiatric examination found that Serebryakov did not suffer from mental illness, and although he had obvious deviations in behavior, this did not become an obstacle to his criminal prosecution. During the court hearing, people who did not fit in the hall looked through the windows, everyone wanted to see the man who had been holding the whole city in fear for almost a year and a half. In the fall of 1970, the Kuybyshev Regional Court sentenced Serebryakov to death. When they announced the verdict, those present in the audience applauded, and Serebryakov himself said: \\"I'll be back.\\" All petitions for a pardon were rejected. In early 1971, Boris Serebryakov was executed in the Syzran Prison. For the detention of the particularly dangerous criminal, all of the militiamen were awarded a medal for \\"an excellent service for the protection of public order\\".

They grow in soil that is rich in calcium, and especially soil with a strong component of heavy metals. Species The genus includes the following species: * Commicarpus adenensis A.G.Mill. * Commicarpus ambiguus Meikle * Commicarpus arabicus Meikle * Commicarpus australis Meikle * Commicarpus boissieri (Heimerl) Cufod. * Commicarpus brandegeei Standl. * Commicarpus chinensis (L.)

Early life  Thomas Pheasant was born in Washington D.C. in 1955 and grew up in a split level house in Adelphi. Pheasant demonstrated an interest in interior design by redesigning his own bedroom at the age of 9 after being inspired by an Auntie Mame episode in which she redecorated her apartment. His design changes included dying his bedspread, adding decorations and even changing his furniture. Pheasant went to college at the University of Maryland where he started studying architecture. In his second year he started to look at interior design after a one-on-one presentation with a professor who told him he had a connection with interior spaces. While in college, Pheasant volunteered at a fabric showroom. He thought this would be a good way to meet designers and be able to network with them. Six months into working there Pheasant overheard designer Victor Shargai telling the manager he was looking for an assistant and if he knew anyone that would be interested. Pheasant set up a meeting with him and put together a port folio filled with fake projects. He got the job and worked in the back room folding clothes and returning items to the showroom. After four years, he was approached about a project and as he was unable to take any side jobs with his assistant position decided to quit and take the project. Due to Pheasant's youth and inexperience he was fired by his first client as he didn't fully understand what they wanted. His career began after college in the early 1970s when he bought a derelict house. After his renovation was complete the local paper picked up on it and hailed him as \\"Washington's new, young, \\"radically spare\\" designer\\".  Career  Pheasant opened his own company based in Washington D.C in 2013 named Thomas Pheasant studios which is collection of limited edition furniture. The studio acts to \\"be an actively moving force that is inspired as much by history and nature as it is by the unique talents of the artisans and craftsmen\\". The first collection he launched in 2013 focused on decomposition looking at nature. He has worked on many residential and commercial projects throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. He has worked on the Hay-Adams Hotel and with BET co-founder Sheila Johnson. One of his most notable works was decorating and designing The Blair House, which is the active guest house in the White House. Pheasant was hired in 2012 by the Blair House Restoration Fund to refresh the Blair House after it suffering from wear and tear. Pheasant was named \\"Dean of American Design\\" by Architectural Digest US in 2005 and Andrew Martin International Designer of the Year. He was also the first American designer to exhibit at the Pavillon des Antiquaries et des Beaux Arts in Paris. Pheasant is currently working on Georgetown's Rosewood Hotel where he will be designing the interiors of ‚ÄúThe six new, 1,000-square- foot townhouses‚Äù. = Collections =  Baker  Baker is a luxury furniture brand with which Pheasant launched a collection in 2002. The collection was titled The Thomas Pheasant Collection and was made up of furniture described by Sheffield Furniture as using \\"simplicity, bold silhouettes and clean finishes\\". The collection exhibits strong neoclassical influences and demonstrates an idea which Pheasant refers to as \\"bridging the past to the present\\". Exceptional Living describes his Baker Furniture collection as ‚Äúmodern, elegant and distinctive‚Äù and that he is able to ‚Äúevoke a feeling of calm, luxurious comfort.‚Äù  McGuire  Pheasant made two separate collections with McGuire, The Thomas Pheasant Collection and The Thomas Pheasant Outdoor Collection. The Thomas Pheasant Collection focuses on indoor furniture which uses McGuire's signature materials \\"rattan core, leather, cast bronze, glass and stone\\" mixed with Pheasant's design style. The Thomas Pheasant Outdoor Collection focuses on outdoor environments consisting of functional and versatile pieces. = Book = In 2013 Pheasant wrote a book with Victoria Sant titled Simply Serene published by Rizzoli International Publications.  Style  Pheasant's design style is a combination of the past and present described by Barker as a \\"contemporary dimension to classical design\\". His style is inspired by various different traditional architecture from all around the world. His design philosophy is said by Taste of Life Magazine to be composed of ‚Äúclassic minimalism, tradition, and vision ‚Ä¶.. with a balanced tranquillity.‚Äù  Publications  * Simply Serene by Thomas Pheasant (2013) * Interior Design Master Class (2016) * Decorating with Carpets: The Stark Tradition (2015) * Jonas: The Art of Fine Upholstery (2015) * Robert A.M.

The event took place on October 28, 2018, in Gimnasio Miguel Hidalgo in Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. It was the twelfth annual AAA show held in honor of deceased founder Antonio Pe√±a, and featured the Copa Antonio Pe√±a tournament named in his honor. The main event was a Lucha de Apuestas or \\"bet match\\" where both Jeff Jarrett and Dr. Wagner Jr. will bet their hair on the outcome of the match. The show also featured the 2018 Copa Antonio Pe√±a tournament, a match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship and two additional matches Production =Background= In 1992 then-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) booker and match maker Antonio Pe√±a left the company alongside a number of wrestlers to form the Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n, later known simply as \\"AAA\\". Over the next decade-and-a-half Pe√±a and the team behind AAA built the promotion into one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world. On October 5, 2006 Pe√±a died from a heart attack.

Overview  Despite the name, Rosbiratscka is a game of German origin for three to four players that is known in different regions under different names. It is easy to learn and suitable as a parlour game i.e. with friends and family.  Rules  The following rules for four players are based on Altenburger. = Aim = A full game involves a partie of six different contracts and the aim is to score as few penalty points as possible. Rule for four players  A 32-card pack is used with German suits i.e. Acorns, Leaves, Hearts and Bells. The ranking of the cards in each suit is Sow (~Ace), King, Ober, Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven. Each player is dealt 8 cards (2-3-3). The player to the left of the dealer (forehand) leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit (Farbzwang) and the highest card wins the trick. there are no trumps. If suit cannot be followed, a player may discard a card of his choice. Six individual contracts are played: # No Tricks!: In No Tricks! (Keinen Stich!) each player attempts to avoid taking any tricks as in the game of Ramsch. Every trick taken scores one penalty point. If a player takes no tricks, each trick counts 2 points. If a player takes all 8 tricks however, it is a Durchmarsch (\\"walkover\\" i.e. \\"slam\\"), he receives 8 plus points. # No Hearts!: In No Hearts! (Keine Herzen!) each player aims to take as few Heart cards as possible in his tricks. Each Heart card taken scores a penalty point. If a player takes no Hearts at all, each Heart card counts 2 penalty points. If a player takes all the Heart cards however, he scores 8 plus points. # No Unters!' In No Unters! (Keine Unter!) each player aims to take as few Unters in his tricks as possible. For every Unter captured, 2 penalty points are scored. If a player has no Unters, then each Unter is worth four penalty points. If a player gets all 4 Unters however, he receives 8 plus points. # No King of Hearts! In No King of Hearts! (Achtung, Herz-K√∂nig! i.e. \\"Beware the King of Hearts\\") each player tries not to capture the King of Hearts. If the King of Hearts is player, the deal ends and the player who has captured him receives 8 penalty points. # Hundred!' In Hundred! (Hundert!) the aim is play cards so as not to be the first to exceed a given number. For this purpose the cards count as follows: Ace 11, King 4, Ober 3, Unter 2, Ten 10, Nine 0, Eight 0, Seven 0. Everyone lays a card in the middle and counts its collective value aloud e.g. \\"Ten, 10!\\" \\"Ace 21!\\" etc. Whoever is the first to exceed 25 gets a penalty point, whoever is first to exceed 50 gets 2 penalty points and whoever is first to exceed 100 receives 5 penalty points. On exceeding 100 points, the deal ends. # Rosbiratschka!The final deal, Rosbiratschka, in progress Rosbiratschka! is the card game of Unteransetzen and involves melding and laying off cards to the table, building up sequences in each suit (see illustration). The aim is to avoid being the last player holding any cards. Forehand must lead with an Unter. If he does not have one, the next player must lead and so on until someone is able to meld an Unter. As soon as an Unter is melded, the next player must lay off next to it a card of the same suit that ranks one above or below it. If a player is unable to do this, he must meld another Unter above or below the first and start a new row in a different suit. If a player cannot meld or lay off a card, he says \\"pass!\\". When just one player is left with cards in his hand the others shout \\"Rosbiratschka!\\" and the player receives 8 penalty points.  Rules for three, five or six players  For three players, remove all Sevens and Eights from a 32-card pack and deal eight cards to each player; score 2 minus points for the Ace and King of Hearts in deal 2. For five players remove the Six of Bells and deal seven each. Score 2 minus points for the last trick in deal 1. For six players use a 36-card pack and deal six to each player; score 2 minus points for the first and last tricks in deal 1.

B. Salmond, was a Scottish journalist, poet and novelist. During the First World War he wrote poetry and, with Wilfred Owen, was for a time joint editor of The Hydra, a journal published within Craiglockhart Military Hospital in Edinburgh. He was born in Arbroath, the son of James Boath Salmond, a non- fiction writer, novelist and editor of the Arbroath Herald. Salmond senior died in 1901, aged only 41. J. B. Salmond obtained a degree in Political Economy from the University of St Andrews in 1913. After working as a journalist with Northcliffe Press, he joined the Inns of Court Regiment, a territorial unit, at the beginning of the First World War, and was soon commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant. Salmond wrote many poems about his war experiences, some in Scottish dialect, but is less well-known for his poetry than many of his contemporaries. During his time in the Black Watch, as a junior officer, he was involved in both the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Arras, following which, diagnosed with neurasthenia, he was consigned to Craiglockhart War Hospital. Salmond arrived at Craiglockhart on 25 June 1917, and Wilfred Owen on the following day. As editor, Salmond made improvements to The Hydra, the in-house magazine produced by patients to which both Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon contributed. Salmond was discharged from Craiglockhart on 13 November 1917, about two weeks after Owen. After the war, he resumed his career as a journalist, and married Peggy Chalmers in 1923. He later took on the editorship of The Scots Magazine, which had been in existence since 1739, and was revived in the 1920s by the St Andrew's Society of Glasgow, later moving to Dundee. Salmond became a prominent citizen of Dundee, and among other things was President of the local branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society. He was also involved with the Scottish Youth Hostels Association, the Grampian Club, and the Abertay Historical Society, having settled at Newport-on-Tay. During the Second World War, he was in the Home Guard. He gave up the editorship of the Scots Magazine in 1948 in order to become Keeper of Muniments and warden of St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.

History Amplifon was founded in 1950 in Milan by Algernon Charles Holland, a former official of the British special forces, involved in the Italian Resistance movement. At the end of the World War II, he started a company aimed at supporting those who experienced hearing loss due to the conflict, establishing a widespread local presence and building a solid relationship with hearing care professionals. In the 1960s and the 1970s, Amplifon opened stores in every region of Italy, becoming market leader in the supply, sales, and fitting of hearing aids. In 1971, the Amplifon Centre for Research and Studies (CRS) was founded: an independent organisation aimed at spreading knowledge in the audiological and otological fields, through resources and research. During the 90s, Amplifon began tailoring the services to the client, rolling out the first digital hearing aids in Italy in 1996. In this period the company gained a market share of over 40%. In 1992, a new company was founded in Spain, Amplifon Iberica, which expanded into Portugal a few years later. Between 1998 and 2000, Amplifon entered Switzerland, Austria, France, Netherlands and the United States markets through acquisitions. The Amplifon stock started to be traded in the Borsa Italiana in June 2001. In the same year, they entered a joint venture with Bardissi Medical in the Middle East, in Egypt, alongside the acquisition of stores in Hungary. In 2002, Amplifon acquired the Sonus Corporation in the United States, and later in 2003 took hold of the National Hearing Centers, a company with stores located primarily in large shopping centres. In the following years Amplifon continued its acquisition strategy in the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium. In 2010, in fact, the company acquired 100% of National Hearing Care (NHC) in Australia, New Zealand and India. In 2012 they expanded into more regions in India, acquired 51% of Maxtone in the Turkish Market, and entered the Polish market by founding Amplifon Poland. Brazil followed in 2014 with Amplifon's purchase of 51% of shares in the Brazilian company Direito de Ouvir. In 2016 the company invested Euro 80 million to acquire 170 stores, including two retail chains in Germany and another in Canada. In 2017, Amplifon invested a further Euro 110 million for the acquisition of 300 stores, including two retail chains in France and Portugal. A year later, Amplifon completed its largest acquisition, acquiring the Spanish GAES for Euro 528 million. GAES has 600 stores (about 500 in Spain, and the remainder scattered across Portugal and Latin America), 1,800 employees, and 210 million in revenue. Since 2015, the Amplifon stock value tripled, outperforming the FTSE MIB, the index of the top 40 listed companies in the Borsa Italiana. As of August 2018, the share price has risen nearly 1,000% since its IPO. The chairman is Susan Carol Holland, daughter of Algernon, who owns 44.9% of Amplifon through her family's holding company. Business and operations Amplifon has an 11% global market share, and is present in 29 countries, in the geographic areas of EMEA, the Americas, and APAC. The company operates through a network of about 5,150 direct points of sale, 4,000 shop-in-shops and corners and 1,800 stores affiliated to the network, employing 16,000 employees overall.

She wrote several books and multiple academic articles on the semi-nomadic lives of transgender sex workers, and established the first assistance center for transgender people in Australia.  Biography  Perkins completed her BA honours dissertation at Macquarie University in Sydney, in 1981 . Her dissertation surveyed the lives and experiences of drag queens and transsexuals, and was one of the first ever theses by an openly transgender woman in Australia. In the 1980s, she was an early member of the then newly-created Australian Transsexual Association, which supported trans people by lobbying for social and legal reform. In 1983, she published her first book, The Drag Queen Scene: Transsexuals in Kings Cross, a survey of 146 drag queens based upon her dissertation. Frank Walker, New South Wales Labor Assembly person and at that time Minister for Youth and Community Services, read the book, and invited Perkins to meet. She told him about the poverty, homelessness and violence experienced by transgender sex workers, many of them youths; about the rape, beatings, harassment, and evictions, and how trans women could find no aid in either men's or women's shelters.Roberta Perkins (1940‚Äì2018), Katherine Cummings, June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018 Walker understood the gravity of the situation, and expressed his commitment to help. As a result, Perkins received a grant of AU$80,000 to open a center that would operate as a shelter for transgender sex workers. The home, originally called \\"Tiresias House\\", opened in Sydney with 12 beds, which were immediately filled. The center quickly grew, and within a few years included four houses, and had on permanent staff a registered nurse and a community worker. After six years, its name changed to the Gender Centre.Trans Sex Worker Activist Roberta Perkins Mourned By Community, Jesse Jones, Star Observer, 28 June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018. Perkins left the Gender Centre in 1985, to concentrate on writing and publishing books and articles in academic publications about transgender women and sex workers. She was a noted figure in the struggle for sex worker rights in New South Wales and Australia as a whole. She was a founding member of the Australian Prostitutes Collective NSW, which advocated for decriminalization of sex work and for the improvement of sex workers' lives. The collective's work is continued today by the Sex Worker Outreach Project (SWOP) NSW. Perkins died on 26 June 2018, at the age of 78.

It is known for its large proven oil reserves. Before oil was discovered, Venezuelan production was primarily agriculture, such as coffee and cocoa. After the first commercial drilling for oil in 1917, oil production increased drastically due to the oil boom of the 1920s and was later furthered by World War II, as Venezuela supplied oil to the United States. From 1958 to 1989, democratic leaders attempted to use the large oil revenues to invest in other industry through various policies such as import substitution and other programs designed to diversify the Venezuelan economy away from a highly specialised export range. These attempts, for the most part, were unsuccessful as Venezuelan government revenues continued to be highly volatile due to the fluctuating price of oil, which was reflected especially throughout the 1980s due to the oil price crash. After struggling with fiscal debts due to a variety of trade protection measures and other policies, the President of 1989, President Andr√©s P√©rez, worked with the International Monetary Fund in an attempt to rectify some of the issues plaguing the Venezuelan government. Perez was eventually unsuccessful due to political instability due to proposed austerity measures, and Hugo Ch√°vez was later elected in 1998, after a defeat of both major political parties. The Ch√°vez government begun enacting various socialist programs, such as free education and healthcare. These programs would continue up until Ch√°vez's death in 2013. President Nicol√°s Maduro, Ch√°vez's successor, was elected on 14 April 2013 and pledged to continue Ch√°vez's work. However, due to hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine and political instability, about 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015. TOC  Economic and political events from 1913-2002  = 1913 - 1958: Military rule, beginning of oil production = Juan Vicente G√≥mez, military general and dictator of Venezuela from 1908 to 1935 In 1913, Dictator Juan Vicente Gomez issued a concession to explore twelve of the twenty Venezuelan states for oil to the Royal Dutch-Shell Oil Company. The first commercial drilling for oil in Venezuela occurred in 1917, however the existence of oil was known before this. Along with the oil boom of the 1920s, World War I was important in triggering Venezuelan oil production[1]. Shortly after this, the oil boom of the 1920s meant Venezuela became the wealthiest state in Latin America. Investment and oil exports increased tremendously during the period from 1920 to 1935. The share of oil exports on total exports in Venezuela increased from 1.9% to 91.2% this period due to the commercialisation of Venezuelan oil. During this period, agricultural production declined drastically, resulting in an economic phenomenon known as ‚ÄòThe Dutch Disease‚Äô, where a commodity increases income for one sector of the economy to the detriment of other sectors due to a strong currency. Due to this, Venezuela fell behind other Latin American countries in terms of the level of industrialisation. In 1936, the Venezuelan government first introduced the idea named ‚ÄòSembrar el petr√≥leo‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòto sow the oil‚Äô. The idea of this was that oil revenues were fleeting, and so reinvesting oil income into agriculture and other industry would benefit Venezuela. This ended up having limited effects in the economy as World War II broke out and Venezuela continued supplying large amounts of oil to the United States. Through the 1950s, the Venezuelan economy grew at a healthy rate despite rampant corruption and deceit for foreign companies and the indifferent stance of the government. = 1958 - 1989: Democracy, creation of OPEC = In 1958 Venezuela elected President R√≥mulo Betancourt in a presidential election after a military coup ousted the first democratically elected president of Venezuela, President R√≥mulo Gallegos. R√≥mulo Betancourt's government founded the Central Office of Coordination and Planning (also known as Cordiplan) which issued multiyear plans with broad economic development objectives Throughout his tenure, the government pursued social projects such as improving health, education and access to potable water, an effort propelled by the Democratic Action Party that R√≥mulo Betancourt belonged to. These efforts were mainly focused on improving education and health in an attempt to diversify Venezuelan exports away from oil to encourage other industry to develop. Despite these efforts, the government made little progress towards diversifying its own revenue streams, passing reforms of its oil policy with the Hydrocarbons Act of 1943. The Hydrocarbons Act changed the basis of oil income from concessions and customs revenue to taxes based on income from mining. Coupled with Venezuela's oil revenues and thus an increasing dependence on them, this act led to a heavy reliance on government oil revenues rather than conventional revenues such as income tax. As well as this, in 1960 the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was created. Venezuela, along with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were its founding members. Despite the creation of OPEC in 1960, they only began setting the oil price in 1973. To do so, the member countries seized their domestic production of oil to control the price and quantity at which oil was exported at in each member country. In Venezuela, the government resolved to stop giving out concessions, and later semi-nationalised its oil and steel industries in 1973. President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez From 1972 to 1974, world oil prices rose drastically and almost quadrupled Venezuelan government revenue. During this period President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez was elected and pledged to make Venezuela a developed country within a few years, known as 'La Gran Venezuela', through policies revolving around financing state-owned and enterprise-led industrialisation in order to facilitate heavy import substitution as a rebirth of the ‚Äòsow the oil‚Äô campaign as well as price controls, income increases and fighting poverty. Import substitution industrialisation (ISI) was a popular method of industrialisation in the 1970s, especially in Latin America. It, ideally, would stimulate economic growth and development through establishing (and protecting) domestic production of goods that were otherwise imported. To further the ‚Äòsowing of the oil‚Äô, government spending increased by 26 per cent per year and established many new state-owned businesses as well as purchasing private ones in an effort to stimulate economic growth and development, and further the policy of import substitution. In 1976, the government fully nationalised the Venezuelan oil industry with the creation of 'Petr√≥leos de Venezuela' (Oils of Venezuela, or PDVSA). In its first year of operation, Petr√≥leos de Venezuela had three affiliates known as Lagoven, Maraven and Corpoven. Together, Petr√≥leos de Venezuela produced a total of 2.3 million barrels of oil a day in its first year. Despite the oil boom of the 1970s greatly benefiting Venezuela in terms of export revenues and development, due to large government projects and heavy spending, the Venezuelan government had an increased indebtedness as well as a inflation problem due to the price hike. These issues typified the presidential campaigns of 1978-1979 due to concerns about the rapid rate of public and private expansion. Despite these concerns, the newly elected president Luis Herrera Campins continued the frenzy of government spending after oil prices surged again from 1978 to 1982. Due to this dismissal of growing problems with debt and government expenditure, when oil prices declined in the mid 1980s due to an oversupply of oil. This resulted in a seventy percent decrease in the price of oil from November 1985 to March 1986. Given that Venezuelan oil revenues represented almost 60 percent of total government revenue, this had a large effect on government finance and exacerbated the problems Venezuela was already dealing with in terms of fiscal policy and the exchange rate. As a result, the national debt multiplied and the government could no longer support its large array of protections such as price controls and subsidies, as well as over four hundred state-owned businesses. As well as struggling with debt and currency issues, in the late 1980s inflation in Venezuela rose to 84.5% in 1989. Through 1983 to 1989, there were attempts to recover from the oil shock of 1983 by devaluing the currency, increased import protection and other methods of protection, to little degree of success due to high inflation, interest rates and widespread corruption. In 1989, President Carlos Andres Perez was elected and attempted to combat these issues using various International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans and other austerity measures, however this ultimately resulted in what is now known as the 'Caracazo'. This refers to the series of protests, riots and lootings that occurred on the 27th of February 1989, after the 'Structural Adjustment Package' (a series of policies such as privatising utilities, remove import tariffs and other policies designed to reduce the fiscal deficit, was launched by President Perez. = 1990 - 2012: Hugo Ch√°vez = Hugo Ch√°vez in 2012 Venezuela historic inflation vs. oil revenue In 1992, the then Colonel Hugo Ch√°vez and his made 2 coup attempts, resulting in 2 years jail time. During this time, Ch√°vez met with Luis Miquilena, a left-wing activist who ultimately advised Ch√°vez to pursue his political ambitions through the electoral process. Consequently, after his release in 1994, Ch√°vez began to pursue politics instead of military power, and created the party 'Movement for the Fifth Republic'. After the election of 1994 in which Raphael Caldera, the Copei party leader was elected President, Ch√°vez began to gain support and in 1998, both major parties were defeated and Ch√°vez was successfully elected. Ch√°vez's party offered an anti corruption, anti poverty programs and a more pacifistic democracy, where the major concerns would be the welfare of the people. He began his presidency by proposing a new Constitution and held a referendum to decide if the people would support this. Ch√°vez received 71% of the votes in the referendum, allowing for the creation of a new Venezuelan constitution. This constitution was later created by the people electing delegates to a constitutional assembly in order to form the new constitution. When the project was submitted to the public in December 1999, it received a 72% yes vote, allowing Ch√°vez to introduce the new constitution, named the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, named after Simon Bolivar, a military hero from the Wars of Independence in South America Throughout this time, multiple referendums and elections were used to enact various constitutional reforms to strengthen power over these institutions. Before Ch√°vez took office on the 2nd of February 1999, he visited the leaders of the OPEC countries and later the OPEC countries convened in Caracas, Venezuela for the second OPEC summit in September 2000. The meeting involved reestablishing OPEC as a leader in the world oil market as well as recovering oil prices, as Venezuela had become one of the cartel's most unreliable producers in regards to the quotas set by OPEC. In 2001, Ch√°vez used the enabling act, which allowed the President to enact various laws without legislative approval, to enact over 49 laws designed to redistribute land and wealth in Venezuela. This action caused some business and labour circles to grow vary of attempts to consolidate economic and political power. During this time, the new Hydrocarbons Act was also introduced, increasing the taxes companies were required to pay for oil exploitation. Tensions within the country came to a head in 2002 when a coup removed Ch√°vez from power for several days, exploiting the media in Venezuela in order to promote the coup and associated strike as well. This continued for several days until business leader Pedro Carmona and his vice president Diosdado Cabello were removed from Miraflores Palace and Ch√°vez was restored to power. After the coup, Ch√°vez began to purge political opponents from the armed forces, solidifying his power over the institution, as well as later firing 18000 workers at PDVSA who went on general strike in an attempt to force Ch√°vez out of power. The general strike and the aftermath of it allowed Ch√°vez to retake control of PDVSA. The strike cost Venezuela approximately 13.5 billion dollars in direct loses due to the shutdown of PDVSA for over two months and the need to import oil and gas from Brazil to run transport and other facilities. In 2004, Ch√°vez and his government returned to furthering their programs promoting welfare and the redistribution of wealth across the Venezuelan people, particularly focused on the poorer areas of the country. These programs were known as 'misiones' and allowed (and were staffed by) many Cuban teachers, doctors and paramedics to practice in Venezuela and were financed by oil export revenues. After winning the referendum (a 'recall' referendum designed to oust Ch√°vez), he continued to forward the programs established beforehand and further consolidating power by increasing control over the judiciary sector. In 2003, the central bank suspended auctions of dollars. After President Ch√°vez died in 2013, his successor, Nicol√°s Maduro, was elected to power. = 2013 - Present: Nicol√°s Maduro = alt= With the election of President Maduro on 14 April 2013, Ch√°vez's successor was sworn into power. In 2014, nationwide protests broke out, beginning in the T√°chira and M√©rida state in response to the attempted rape of a female student, as well as record inflation and shortages of basic goods. These protests ended in violence, and later resulted in US sanctions against several Venezuelan officials. In response, the Maduro government gave the President the power to legislate by decree for nine months. In 2016, the situation resulted in Maduro calling a state of emergency as shortages for basic goods resulted in long queues and inflation increased to over 700%. This trend of hyperinflation (where inflation rises more that 50% every month) results in a large currency devaluation and due to continuously high prices of goods and services, hoarding of said goods and services. Due to this, the United Nations estimate that about 3 million Venezuelans have fled due to hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine and political violence.

The powerful and illustrious Marcali and Apponyi noble families descended from this kindred. The clan had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to Slavonia and other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. History and family tree =Zala branch= The clan originated from Sokor√≥ Hills, in the southern region of Gy≈ër County, their ancient clan estates laid in present-day Felp√©c and Kaj√°rp√©c. The earliest known member of the kindred was Lucas I, who lived in the early 13th century. He is apparently the founder of the clan too. Based on the clan's coat-of-arms (narrow silver stripe in blue shield), it is possible that Lucas was a knight from Western Europe, who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of Andrew II of Hungary. For his military service, he was granted lands in Gy≈ër County and the surrounding regions. Depending on his origin (German or French), Lucas might have come to the country as an accompanist of either Gertrude of Merania (1205) or Yolanda de Courtenay (1215), the first and second spouse of Andrew II, respectively. His career and life is difficult to outline: it is presumable that he is identical with that Lucas, who served as Master of the cupbearers in the royal court from 1229 to 1230. Lucas' eldest son was George, who owned Ludbreg sometimes before 1248. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson Nicholas Ludbregi in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban John Cs√∫z and his descendants. The most powerful member of the kindred was George's another son Denis. Initially, he was a confidant of rex iunior Stephen, but later joined the partisans of the elderly B√©la IV of Hungary. He actively participated in the military campaigns against Austria and Bohemia. He served as Palatine of Hungary and other high- ranking positions several times during the era of feudal anarchy. His son, John was isp√°n of Veszpr√©m County as a confidant of Queen Mother Tomasina Morosini in 1295, while his unidentified daughter married Stephen Hah√≥t. Through their only son Nicholas, they were ancestors of the powerful B√°nfi (B√°nffy) de Als√≥lendva noble family.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Hah√≥t 1.) George's third son was Serfesd, who owned Nevna (or N√©vna), present-day Levanjska Varo≈° in Croatia. His only son Ladislaus Nevnai held estates in Valk√≥ and Po≈æega counties, including Orjava (today Orljavac, Croatia), and was considered one of the richest landowners of the region. He fathered two daughters, Catherine and an unidentified girl. Their marriages to Nicholas Treutel and Andrew Garai, respectively, have prompted the rise of the Treutel kinship and the Palatinal branch of the Garai family. Ladislaus Nevnai handed over his estate of Nevna to his son-in-law Nicholas Treutel in 1324. It is presumable, he died shortly thereafter without male descendants, ending the Nevnai family line after two generations.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 1. Zala branch) George's younger brother was Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Alongside two other local nobles, he unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit for the ownership of some portions of Kaj√°r (present-day Kaj√°rp√©c) in 1240; B√©la IV ruled in favor of the Bakonyb√©l Abbey, referring to St. Ladislaus' royal charters from the late 11th century. He had five sons; Gregory was one of the military leaders of the Bulgarian campaign in 1266. He was Ban of Barancs and Kucs√≥ in 1272‚Äì73, then Judge royal in 1288. It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgy√∂rgy in order to protect his landholdings against the K≈ëszegi family. However they besieged and captured the fort from Gregory's only son Joachim around 1315. Through his only son Stephen, Joachim was the forefather of the illustrious Marcali family, which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 2. Marcali branch) Mark I's second son Mark II (fl. 1275) remained insignificant member of the clan. His granddaughters' filial quarter was divided between his brothers' surviving branches in 1349. The third son, Apor was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, during the era of Interregnum. He had no descendants. Stephen I was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lor√°ntfis and S√°ndorfis.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 3. Berzencei [Musinai] branch) Lucas III served as isp√°n of Zala County from 1289 to 1291 and in 1298. He and his brother Apor besieged and captured T√°tika Castle (located near Zalasz√°nt√≥), which belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszpr√©m.

In 2019 a study showed that Olorinab reduces Visceral Hypersensitivity in the TNBS-induced colitis animal model, attempting to control for its mechanism of action by using a CB2 antagonist (SR-144,528). Results were favorable showing reduced visceral hypersensitivity in animal models of IBD and IBS but not in healthy controls, suggesting that activation of CB2 causes antinociceptive actions in visceral sensory pathways in models of IBD and IBS. Also SR-144528 prevented olorinab-induced inhibition of colonic nociceptor hypersensitivity, further validating the role of the CB2 receptor in nociception.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States. This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel) * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety- Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident- flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.  Incidents  * On January 1, 2000, at Whitewater, Michigan, two snowmobile riders in the pipeline right of way had mechanical problems and were using a cigarette lighter to see better when leaking natural gas ignited. Both snowmobilers were treated for their burns and released. The pipeline was owned by Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MICHCON). Investigators found that the pipe, which was installed in 1973, had leaked due to internal corrosion.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents, gtgg1986to2001 spreadsheet, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. * On January 10, approximately 4200 gallons of jet fuel were discharged from Plantation Pipeline in Newington, Virginia, some of which entered into Accotink Creek and its adjoining shorelines. The failure resulted from a failed gasket on an interface detector. * On January 21, a Chevron pipeline leaked from a welding flaw near Corinne, Utah, spilling about 4200 gallons of diesel fuel. The product spread over 38 acres of salt flat and wetlands used by birds. About 75% to 80% of the spill was intentionally burned to eliminate it. * On January 21, an Equilon Pipeline Co. crude oil line was ruptured off of the Louisiana coast, by an eight-ton anchor dropped by a ship. About 94,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled, creating a slick 2 miles wide by 7 miles long. * On January 27, in Winchester, Kentucky, a Marathon Oil pipeline accident released about of crude oil. NTSB investigators found a dent on the bottom of the pipe in the rupture area. Marathon spent about $7.1 million in response to the accident. Many more NTSB accident reports can be found at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. * On February 2, an Equilon Pipeline Co. pipeline leaked 756 gallons of crude oil, in Jefferson County, Texas, west of Highway 366, causing estimated $75,000 in property damage. Corrosion was listed as the cause of the leak.https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Global-Warming/Reports/Full-Oil- Incident-List.pdf * On February 5, a pipeline failed and spilled over of crude oil in the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania. The source of the spill was a break in a miter bend in the pipe, which was estimated to be at least 50 years old. * On February 18, 2000, a 24-inch diameter Tennessee Gas Pipeline at Marcellus, New York, leaked natural gas due to a crack in the pipe, thought to be caused by a manufacturing defect in the pipe which had been manufactured and installed in 1951. * On February 23, 2000, in Clare County, Michigan, the ANR Pipeline Company‚Äôs 12-inch diameter Lincoln Pipeline ruptured. Factors contributing to the leak were frost heave, mismatch of pipe ends, residual forces applied during clamping of the pipe replacement ends to the existing pipeline, unusually cold weather on the day of the rupture, and non-homogeneous material in the weld metal at the origin of the fracture that reduced effective thickness of the pipe wall. The pipe was manufactured in 1951. * On March 9, an Explorer petroleum products pipeline failed in Greenville, Texas. The 28-inch pipeline ruptured and released of gasoline. The released gasoline eventually reached East Caddo Creek. The banks of the tributary and creek contained the escaping gasoline as it flowed away from the ruptured pipe. The probable cause of the pipeline failure was corrosion- fatigue cracking that initiated at the edge of the longitudinal seam weld at a likely preexisting weld defect. Contributing to the failure was the loss of pipe coating integrity. * On March 17, about 3300 gallons of crude oil spilled into the Miller Branch Creek bed, near Stiles, Louisiana, when a small oil pipeline was snapped by a falling tree. Approximately 200 yards of the Miller Branch Creek bed, which flows into the James Bayou, was affected. The James Bayou flows in Caddo Lake, two miles south of the spill. Another spill not far from the Stiles site had occurred two days earlier, when 12,600 gallons of crude was discharged into a creek, after a bulldozer ran over a pipeline.https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Global-Warming/Reports/Full-Oil- Incident-List.pdf * On March 22, in Karnes County, Texas, a PG&E; 20-inch diameter natural gas pipeline blew out through pavement and was on fire eight miles south of Kenedy, Texas, on U.S. Highway 181. Work began the same day to repair the road. The leak was caused by external corrosion of the pipe, which was manufactured in 1961. * On April 7, a pipeline released fuel oil at Chalk Point, near Aquasco, Maryland. The Piney Point Oil Pipeline system, which was owned by the Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), experienced a pipe failure at the Chalk Point Generating Station in southeastern Prince George's County, Maryland. The release was not discovered and addressed by the contract operating company, Support Terminal Services, Inc., until the late afternoon. Approximately of fuel oil were released into the surrounding wetlands and Swanson Creek and, subsequently, the Patuxent River as a result of the accident. No injuries were caused by the accident, which cost approximately $71 million for environmental response and clean-up operations. * On May 2, 2000, at Greenville, Mississippi, six workers were injured during a turbine construction project at the Williams Gas Pipeline-Southcentral natural gas compressor station. A flash fire occurred when contractor employees were beginning to install an isolation cap on a 26-inch diameter natural gas line. The fire extinguished itself. Evidence available has not allowed determination of cause.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (1986-2001), link on the Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and- statisticspipelinepipeline-incident-flagged-files. * On May 13, 2000, at a Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Duke) compressor station in Perry County, Pennsylvania, the emergency shutdown device was activated by a lightning strike to the compressor unit gas monitor. All equipment operated properly with the exception of a suction valve that malfunctioned and did not close automatically. This allowed gas to continue venting to atmosphere in a controlled manner for nearly an hour until the valve was manually closed. The part was installed in 1958. * On May 19, a Colonial Pipeline Co. line failed near Greensboro, North Carolina. At least 714 gallons (17 barrels) of kerosene spilled, some of which entered a pond that flows into a tributary of the East Fork Deep River. The kerosene spill caused a sheen about 40 feet by 40 feet in the pond. As a result of this, and six other previous Colonial Pipeline accidents, the EPA fined Colonial $34 million in 2003. * On June 7, a stopple fitting weld failed on a Wolverine Pipeline Company line, causing a rupture releasing of gasoline into the environment, and causing the evacuation of more than 500 houses in Blackman Charter Township, Michigan. The failure caused the shutdown of 30% of Michigan's gasoline supplies for nine days, contaminated a creek which flows into the Grand River, and a railroad track near the failure site was shut down for a week. Later tests found 715 anomalies in this pipeline. Wolverine later agreed to pay for switching houses in the area from local water wells to a city water source. * On June 28, 2000, at Prentiss, Mississippi, an 8-inch high pressure natural gas pipeline ruptured, releasing gas. A local landowner notified the Prentiss Volunteer Fire Department and AIM Pipeline Company gas control of the leak. The gas ignited within half an hour. No effort was made to extinguish the fire; it was allowed to burn under control. Within three hours the fuel had been consumed and the fire was contained. As a precaution, the Prentiss Volunteer Fire Department evacuated three nearby residences. All residents were allowed to return to their homes that evening. There were no injuries and no major property damage. The rupture in the pipe measured six inches by three inches. The rupture point in the pipe was in a low-lying area on the bottom of the line approximately two inches from a joint weld.

The fire could be seen from 35 miles away. * On August 19, a 30-inch diameter El Paso Natural Gas pipeline rupture and fire near Carlsbad, New Mexico killed 12 members of an extended family who were camping more than from the rupture point. The force of the escaping gas created a -wide crater about along the pipe. The explosion ejected a section of the pipe from the crater, in three pieces measuring approximately , , and in length. The largest piece of pipe was found about northwest of the crater. The cause of the failure was severe internal corrosion of the pipe, which was manufactured in 1950.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents, gtgg1986to2001 [gas transmission & gas gathering] www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and- statisticspipelinepipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2017.12.29.

After the line was excavated, the leak was found at a weld failure where a mechanical clamp repaired an older leak adjacent to the long seam of the pipe, which was manufactured in 1948. * On September 7, on State Route 36 south of Abilene, Texas, a bulldozer ruptured a 12-inch diameter NGL pipeline, which exploded. An Abilene police detective with 21 years of service was severely burned when the vapors ignited; he later died. Nearby, a woman saved herself by going underwater in her swimming pool, but her house was destroyed by the explosion and fire. The pipeline's owner, ExxonMobil, was fined by the Texas Railroad Commission for not marking the pipeline's location. * On September 26, 2000, at Mission, Texas, a Kinder Morgan 12-inch diameter pipe ruptured due to external corrosion. The pipe was manufactured in 1956. * On September 27, 2000, in Spearman, Texas, a 26-inch diameter pipe owned by Kinder Morgan‚Äôs Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America sprung a pinhole leak at a butt weld. The pipe was manufactured in 1947. * On October 12, 2000, at Edna, Texas, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 24-inch diameter pipe manufactured in 1944 ruptured. Investigators reported that a weld cracked due to external corrosion. * On November 3, a front end loader punctured an 8-inch pipeline carrying Diesel fuel in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Diesel fuel sprayed into the air. The fuel flowed for over 2 hours before stopping, and contaminating the area with more than of Diesel fuel. * On November 28, in Portland, Tennessee, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company maintenance crew was welding an oil lubrication line at a compressor station when an explosion and flash fire occurred, injuring three workers. Apparently, gas from the compressor migrated into a crankcase and was ignited by a spark. The equipment was installed in 1950. * On December 4, 2000, near Baytown, Texas, an El Paso Field Services 30-inch diameter pipeline ruptured and gas blew into the air. The Beach City fire department reported a flume of natural gas but no fire at the junction of Highway 565 and Needlepoint Road (FM 2354) and partially evacuated the area. The pipe was manufactured and installed in 1955. * On December 16, 2000, an incident occurred at an Illinois Power Company natural gas plant in Irving, Illinois. While conducting a routine inspection, the plant operator determined that water should be transferred from the water separator tank to the produced water holding tank and began to transfer the water. When he no longer heard water flowing through the transfer line, he closed the valve, but then abnormal sounds came from the holding tank. Seconds later, a violent roar erupted and the lights went out. Scanning outside with a flashlight, he saw large pieces of metallic debris. The 50,000 gallon water holding tank was dislodged from its foundation and moved about 300 feet. A factor contributing to the accident was severe weather conditions: temperature 5 degrees Fahrenheit, wind velocity 35 mph gusting to 40-45 mph, wind chill minus 35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

Probably built about 1730, it is one of the town's few surviving 18th-century houses, and a good example of a two-story Georgian colonial house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Eliphalet Dowd House is located in eastern Branford, on the south side of East Main Street (United States Route 1) at Sycamore Lane. It is set near the road, on a property shared by a local private school. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically about the center entrance. The entrance has a transom window, and is flanked by pilasters which rise to a frieze and cornice. The second story has a slight overhang above the first floor, and the gable ends on the sides have a similar overhang as well. The main roof cornice has a line of dentil moulding. The house had a stone chimney at its center, With which is no longer visible above the roof line. The house has traditionally been ascribed a construction date of 1754, but land record analysis suggests it is older, and may have been built as early as 1730. Its architectural features suggest a date no later than the third quarter of the 18th century. The house is one of a small number of two-story 18th-century houses in Branford.

The first two title holders played significant roles in the construction of a new modern mosque. Lagos Central Mosque The first central mosque in Lagos was developed by the Jamat Muslim Council of Lagos who established an executive council of the Lagos Central Mosque around 1905. The new mosque was completed in July 1913 and served the Lagos community for 70 years. Ideas about building a new mosque began soon after the golden jubilee celebration of the old central mosque in 1963. The old mosque was deemed archaic by some members who wanted a new befitting edifice for da'wa while some preferred an extension of the old structure. Initially, funds were raised in 1973 for the construction of an extension to the old mosque and purchase of adjoining properties. The plan was later shelved with majority of members preferring a new edifice, the old mosque was finally was demolished in 1983. Members then attended Friday prayers at a nearby Alli-Balogun mosque until the new mosque was completed. Opened by President Babangida on May 28, 1988, the new mosque was built by G. Cappa Ltd. It has four prominent minarets, two small and two tall ones, the smaller ones are placed on top of the entrance and the taller ones flanked the west and east wing of the building. The building space is about one acre and consumes 50 metres of space along Nnamdi Azikiwe. The new building entrance leads to a riwaq, accentuated by decorated columns and beside it is the courtyard or Sahn. The prayer function is served by a 750 sq meter prayer hall with a central dome made of metal that is 15 metres in diameter and conspicuous outside because of its gold plated aluminium cladding. There is space underneath the building for the vaults of deceased Imams and prominent members and for use as a drive in garage. The building also has an office block, reference library, Islamic centre and apartment for the Chief Imam.

The Da Ming Baochao () was a series of banknotes issued during the Ming dynasty in China. They were first issued in 1375 under the Hongwu Emperor. Although initially the Da Ming Baochao paper money was successful, the fact that it was a fiat currency and that the government largely stopped accepting these notes caused the people to lose faith in them as a valid currency causing the price of silver relative to paper money to increase. The negative experiences with inflation that the Ming dynasty had witnessed signaled the Manchus to not repeat this mistake until the first Chinese banknotes after almost 400 years were issued again in response to the Taiping Rebellion under the Qing dynasty's Xianfeng Emperor during the mid-19th century.  Background  The precursor of paper money (Á¥ôÂπ£) known as \\"Flying cash\\" were issued by the Tang dynasty, however these bills of exchange could in no way be considered to be a form of paper money as they weren‚Äôt meant to be a medium of exchange and were only negotiable between two distant points. The first true paper money in the world was issued under the Song dynasty, these were promissory notes issued by merchants in Sichuan known as the Jiaozi,Glahn, Richard von (2006). \\"Re- Examining the Authenticity of Song Paper Money Specimens\\", Journal of Song- Yuan Studies, 36: 79-106. under the reign of Emperor Zhenzong (997‚Äì1022) the government of the Song Dynasty granted a monopoly for the production of Jiaozi notes to sixteen wealthy merchants in Sichuan, as these merchants were slow to redeem their banknotes and inflation started affecting these private banknotes the government nationalised paper money in the year 1023 under the Bureau of Exchange. As these paper notes were backed by the government they were instantly successful and the people regarded them to be equally trustworthy as cash coins, other types of paper notes issued under the Song dynasty include the Huizi and the Guanzi.Chen, Chau-Nan, Chang Pin-Tsun, Chen, Shikuan. \\"The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles\\", Journal of Macroeconomics, 17/2: 273-288. Before the Mongol Empire conquered China the Jurchen Jin dynasty also issued paper money, the Jiaochao (‰∫§Èàî). Before the establishment of the Ming dynasty the Mongol Yuan dynasty had suffered from a severe case of hyperinflation which made the paper money issued by them worthless.Bernholz, Peter (1997). \\"Paper Money Inflation, Prices, Gresham's Law and Exchange Rates in Ming China\\", Kredit und Kapital, 30/1: 35-51. Under the reign of the Yuan dynasty copper cash coins remained in circulation with the inscriptions Zhida Tongbao (Ëá≥Â§ßÈÄöÂØ∂), Dayuan Tongbao (Â§ßÂÖÉÈÄöÂØ∂), and Zhizheng Tongbao (Ëá≥Ê≠£ÈÄöÂØ∂) forming the majority of the circulating issues and \\"strings of cash coins\\" remaining a currency unit.Glahn, Richard von (2010). \\"Monies of Account and Monetary Transition in China, Twelfth to Fourteenth Centuries\\", Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 53/3: 463-505.Yang, Lien-Sheng (1975). \\"Monetary Terms in Chinese History\\", T'ung Pao: Journal of the Society for Oriental Numismatics, 1/2: 47-54 [reprinted from Chinese Culture, 1/4 (1958)]. Silver then started to occupy a paramount place in the Mongol economy and was supplemented by government issued paper money.Li, Kangying (2007). \\"A Study on the Song, Yuan and Ming Monetary Policies against the Context of Worldwide Hard Currency Flows during the 11th-16th Centuries, and their Impact on Ming Institutions and Changes\\", in Angela Schottenhammer, ed. The East Asian Maritime World 1400-1800: Its Fabrics of Power and Dynamics of Exchanges (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz), 99-136. Under the reign of Kublai Khan the Zhongtong Jiaochao (‰∏≠Áµ±‰∫§Èàî) was issued whose value was based on the fabric silk. In the year 1271 the Zhiyuan Baochao (Ëá≥ÂÖÉÂØ∂Èàî) was issued which was supplemented with the silver-based Zhida Yinchao (Ëá≥Â§ßÈäÄÈàî), but these circulated only for a year. The final series of paper money issued by the government of the Yuan dynasty from 1350 were the Zhizheng Jiaochao (Ëá≥Ê≠£‰∫§Èàî). A major difference between how paper money was used under the Mongols and under the Song dynasty was that, in certain regions of the Yuan dynasty, paper notes were the only acceptable form of currency and could not be exchanged in either copper cash coins or silver sycees. Exchanging paper money into copper or silver was known as du√¨xi√†n (ÂÖåÁèæ, \\"convert into specie\\") which was the main reason why earlier forms of paper money were deemed reliable. As these regions were completely dependent on paper money inflation hit them more severely as their notes could not be converted into a currency based on any intrinsic value, for this reason the Mongols allowed their subjects to continue using copper-alloy cash coins and issued new ones every now and then. During the last few decades of the Yuan dynasty the inflation caused people to lose their trust in paper money and barter became the most common means of exchange.Williams, S. Wells (1975). \\"Paper Money among the Chinese\\", T'ung Pao: Journal of the Society for Oriental Numismatics, 1/2: 38-40 [reprinted from The Chinese Repository, 20 (1851)].

The first banknotes of the Ming dynasty bore the reign title of the Hongwu Emperor and were issued in the year 1375, a year prior he created the Supervisorate of Paper Money (ÂØ∂ÈàîÊèêËàâÂè∏, b«éo chƒÅo t√≠ j«î sƒ´) to supervise their production.Google Arts & Culture - Chinese Ming Banknote from the collection of the British Museum.

Retrieved: 14 September 2018. Notes with the denomination of 1 gu√†n could be exchanged for one thousand bronze cash coins throughout all of the Ming Empire, this was illustrated by an image of a string of bronze cash coins split into ten segments, smaller denominations contained images fewer segments of the string and were issued in 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 w√©n. The size of the 1 gu√†n was 36.4 √ó 22 cm making them the biggest paper notes ever produced in the history of China. All paper notes from this first series of the Da Ming Baochao contained the inscription that they were a valid currency issued by the Palace Secretariat (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, zh≈çng sh≈´ shƒõng), other texts explained that forgers would face punishment and those that expose these counterfeiters shall receive a high reward, finally the date of issuance would written with the nianhao (or reign era) first, then followed the Chinese characters for year, month, and day. Contrary to the paper money issued by the Song and Yuan dynasties, the Da Ming Baochao didn't have any geographical restrictions imposed upon them, nor did they have an expiration date. Paper notes issued by the Ming dynasty contained the text that they would circulate forever, possibly reflecting the idea that the Ming state would be there to accept these banknotes forever as well. The Da Ming Baochao also wasn't backed by any forms of hard currency or reserves and the government never set any limitations on their production. These circumstances all lead to the paper currency of the Ming dynasty to start suffering from inflation, in the year 1376 new legislation was introduced to remove older more worn out notes from circulation by having them replaced for new banknotes at the cost of a fee known as \\"Gongmofei\\" (Â∑•Â¢®Ë≤ª, g≈çng m√≤ f√®i) which was set at 30 w√©n per paper note. However in the year 1380 a new law restricted the replacement of paper notes which were unreadable, this caused the people to accept these older banknotes at reduced value, during this time the government stopped accepting worn out banknotes and in some cases didn't even accept banknotes which frustrated the people. During this period the government of the Ming dynasty only threw more banknotes on the market in various forms such as military salaries (ËªçÈ§â, j≈´n xi«éng), while they themselves hardly accepted or replaced any existing paper money causing the people to lose trust in the Da Ming Baochao. In the year 1380 the Imperial Secretariat was abolished, and the Ministry of Revenue (Êà∂ÈÉ®, h√π b√π) was made responsible for the manufacture of the Da Ming Baochao paper notes, the Ministry of Works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, g≈çng b√π) for that of the copper-alloy Hongwu Tongbao cash coins. In the year 1389 the government of the Ming dynasty released treasury notes with lower denominations \\"as a help to the people\\" (‰ª•‰æøÊ∞ëÁî®) and improve internal trade, these were the denominations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 w√©n and depicted unstrung cash coins. Under the reign of the Yongle Emperor the Da Ming Baochao was fixed to be the exclusive valid paper money for the rest of the dynasty and because of this the paper currency of the Ming would see no further alterations or reforms. Overprinting led to severe hyperinflation and distrust of paper currency. The Hongzhi Emperor and Zhengde Emperor abolished the production and use of banknotes. In the year 1535, 1 gu√†n of paper money rather than being exchanged for 1000 copper-alloy cash coins was valued at only 0.28th of a coin. A proposal was made in 1643 to reintroduce paper money in order to finance the expenditures caused by the difficult situation that the Ming dynasty faced at the time confronted by the rebel Li Zicheng. The Bank of England planted a small stand of mulberry trees as an homage to these banknotes in the 1920s.  Surviving specimens  A Da-Ming Tongxing Baochao (Â§ßÊòéÈÄöË°åÂØ≥Èàî) banknote on display at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum in Nagoya, Japan. Note its size compared to modern US dollar banknotes. During the early 20th century two discoveries were made where a large number of 1 gu√†n Da Ming Baochao banknotes were uncovered, the first of these discoveries occurred in the year 1900 when foreign forces occupied the capital city of Beijing in response to the Boxer Rebellion. During the occupation a number of European soldiers of the Eight- Nation Alliance had overthrown a sacred image of Gautama Buddha in the Summer Palace which uncovered a large number of gold and silver ingots alongside various gems and jewelry and a bundle of 1 gu√†n Da Ming Baochao banknotes, as these European soldiers were happy with the gems and precious metals they acquired they handed the bundle of banknotes to US Army Surgeon Major Louis Livingston Seaman, who was a bystander and only unofficially present. Louis Seaman gave the bundle of banknotes to the museum of St. John's College in the city of Shanghai. One of these banknotes was reproduced as a lithographic facsimile in the book The Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire written by Hosea Ballou Morse. Another batch of 1 gu√†n banknotes was discovered when sometime in the year 1936 one of the walls surrounding the city of Beijing was torn down. When the labourers got to the huge gate in the wall, they uncovered a large bale of 1 gu√†n Da Ming Baochao banknotes which was buried in the wall itself. After the labourers removed the soiled and damaged notes, they started selling the banknotes to bystanders standing around them. The labourers only sold them for a few copper coins each which would only amount to a couple of cents in American currency at the time. One of the bystandards who purchased one of these Da Ming Baochao notes was Luther Carrington Goodrich of the Yenching University who purchased two specimens for only a couple of coppers who later gave it to his friend Reverend Ballou who wrote about the account. Due to these circumstances it‚Äôs relatively easy for modern collectors of banknotes and paper money to acquire the 1 gu√†n banknotes which are the only pre-Qing Chinese banknotes available on the market. A handful of notes from other denominations survive as they were issued only during the reign of the first emperor. These notes as well as printing plates for denominations that have no known surviving notes are held in Chinese museums. In 2016 art experts at Mossgreen's Auctions, a former auction house with a reputation for deceiving its bidders, were reported to have found an anachronistic 1 gu√†n Da Ming Baochao banknote hidden inside of a 1 inch fold of a wooden luohan sculpture in Melbourne, Australia. However, this specimen later turned out to be fraudulent.  See also  * Economic history of China before 1912  References   Sources  * Hartill, David (September 22, 2005). Cast Chinese Coins.

In the 2018 elections, May ran for New York State Senate against Valesky in the Democratic primary, making it Valesky's first real challenge since taking office. In a year with strong anti-IDC sentiment, May narrowly defeated Valesky. With the district leaning Democratic, she was elected in November. With Democrats taking the majority in the general election, May is serving as the Chair of Committee on Aging.

The founder, Kattan, was chosen as one of \\"The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet\\" by Time in 2017, listed as one of The Richest Self- Made Women and one of the Top Three Beauty Influencers by Forbes. In the span of 5 years, the brand has built a positive reputation on some of its products, such as fake eyelashes series, a collection of foundation, eyeshadow and some face palettes. Background In April 2010, Huda Kattan started the beauty- related blog, Huda Beauty, and a YouTube channel. She later found success on other platforms. Kattan launched a cosmetic line named after her channel in 2013. It has since become one of the world's fastest-growing beauty brands. , Huda Beauty has more than 4 million subscribers on YouTube and is the number one account on the Instagram Beauty section in the world, with over 40 million followers. The contents of Kattan's channels are beauty tutorial-oriented: Kattan shares makeup techniques, skincare routines and personal preferred beauty products from multiple brands. Launch The first Huda Beauty product was a collection of false eyelashes released through Sephora, in Dubai in 2011 and in the United States in 2015. The Kardashian sisters were reported to use Huda Beauty lashes, providing an early publicity boost to the label. , Huda Beauty has an estimated net value of and the company as a business is valued at over a billion dollars, according to Forbes. In December 2017, the company received a minority investment from TSG Consumer Partners, a private equity firm that had previously invested in beauty brands such as 'Smashbox' and 'Its Cosmetics' (both of which were purchased by major beauty conglomerates ‚Äî Est√©e Lauder and L'Or√©al). Products Huda Beauty offers more than 140 products online or in-store. The beauty brand has launched an entire range of products, including lipstick collections, face palettes like highlighter and contour, false lashes, and a collaborative product with Tweezerman. Its Samantha Lashes #7, since launch, has been ranked as one of the best selling and highly reviewed lash products. In 2018, all launched products that together bring in at least $200 million in annual revenue. Time described this as ‚Äúan internet based beauty brand age‚Äù, as internet-to-business beauty products have taken over a large percentage from the traditional beauty market. They own a significantly growing share of the whole market. =Price= The price of Huda Beauty's products has been widely seen as reasonable compared to similar products that are sharing similar markets. Though, among blog-to-brand beauty brands, that created by YouTubers or Instagram bloggers the price of Huda Beauty's products are relatively high. Bloggers mostly launch beauty products that they set a price a bit lower than the regular market price, as their brand names and quality usually have not been tested through time. However, Huda Beauty's foundation sells at 65 Australian dollars in Australian Sephora stores, while Fenty beauty by Rihanna offers a similar market-targeted foundation by 50 dollars. Also, the first-line beauty company, Estee Lauder, sells its well-reviewed foundation ‚ÄúDouble Wear‚Äù under 60 dollars at a department store, like Westfield and David Jones in Australia. However, Huda Beauty's most well known product: fake lashes ‚Äú#7 Samantha‚Äù still achieve success in the sale, although its price is 35 dollar in Australia. While SHU UEMURA, currently the first name in eye-related beauty section offers fake lashes for around 25 Australian dollars in department stores. =Review= The most welcomed products of the brand, according to its sale volume and net income is its fake lashes, which labeled as ‚Äú#7‚Äù, and a collection of foundations. The foundation has widely commented as sufficient choice for a wide range of different skin tones. In the meanwhile, the eye shadow palette and fake eyelashes are the mostly positively reviewed products. While the face palettes and liquid lipstick or other products have seen a draw in the market share. Controversies and criticism =Genital lightening= Huda Beauty as an internet based tutorial and brand has sparked major controversy on some topics. The brand faced intense disagreement over a blog post advising women about ways to lighten the color of their genitals. Originally published on April 7, 2018, the page, named ‚ÄùWhy Your Vagina Gets Dark And How To Lighten It‚Äù, noted some tips from \\"trusted expert\\" and board-certified dermatologist Doris Day, MD. This post has been criticized as unprofessional and misleading. = Allegations of copying =  Foundation vs Fenty Beauty's  In 2017, Huda Beauty announced that it would soon be debuting a foundation collection with a more diverse range of shades. Just after this, this collection been criticized by Fenty Beauty followers that ‚Äúit copies Fenty Beauty‚Äôs \\"Pro Filt'r\\" foundation collection image‚Äù. Huda Beauty's \\"#FauxFilter\\" foundations have a selection of 30 shades, while Rihanna's brand - Fenty Beauty \\"Pro Filt'r\\" foundation collection has 40 shades. Others, however, applauded Huda Beauty for being one of the first brands to release an inclusive range of shades in Sephora stores globally. = Acne scar controversy = In 2015, a Youtuber from the UK, Em Ford, posted a video named ‚ÄúYou Look Disgusting‚Äù. The video talks about the surrounding negative comments to her, for humanizing people behind the screens to end any kind of language bully. So far, as in October 2018, the video has been viewed more than 28 million times. There was a post from Huda that been blamed for shaming other peer Youtubers‚Äô acne scars. The owner, Kattan, posted a line said the only thing worse than a breakout is the acne scar. Nevertheless, Huda used Ford's positive post to show ‚Äúhow ugly‚Äù the acne scars could be. After seeing Huda's post, Em Ford made a new post questioning if Huda as a popular brand wants to be one of the bully problems or one of the solutions. This ended with Kattan's replies to the posts and apology online. Marketing The beauty industry is estimated to be worth $445 billion. A key driver to its rapid growth are influencers on visually focused social platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest who build blog-to-brand businesses such as Fenty Beauty. According to Forbes, the barrier to entry for cosmetic businesses has fallen, as entrepreneurs with a strong social media following can hire laboratories to test formulae on a contract basis and can sell their products through stores such as Sephora and Ulta. , Blog to beauty brands take a relatively high portion of the beauty market. According to the instagram scheduling tool HopperHQ, which publishes an 'influencer rich list' estimating the value and income of internet influencers, Kattan could possibly earn up to AED 66,000 per sponsored post as the owner of Huda Beauty. However, Kattan does not do sponsored content on her channel. Kattan was named as one of Time Magazine's 25 most influential people online, alongside J.K Rowling and Kim Kardashian West. Huda Beauty is among the best-selling cosmetics brands in Sephora in the Middle East and Harrods in London. According to The Business of Fashion, Kattan's background as an Iraqi immigrant in America distinguishes her from other beauty influencers. She studied finance in the United States, and pursued a career as a makeup artist in Dubai. Fragrances In 2018, Huda Beauty stated that they were entering the skincare and fragrance markets and announced a new collection of perfume.

He showed his best form as a juvenile in 2000 when he won the Prix Morny by six lengths and took third place in the Middle Park Stakes. He did not run as a three-year-old and had no success when campaigned in Dubai in 2002. He failed to make any impact as a breeding stallion. Background Bad As I Wanna Be was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Yeomanstown Stud. In October 1999 the yearling was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought by the Curragh Bloodstock Agency for 62,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of the American banker Joe Allbritton and was sent into training with Brian Meehan at Lambourn in Berkshire. His sire Common Grounds was a British-bred stallion who was trained in France and showed his best form as a two-year-old in 1987 when he won the Prix de la Salamandre. As a breeding stallion, the best of his other progeny included Fallow (July Stakes), Murghem (Geoffrey Freer Stakes) and Flanders (Weatherbys Super Sprint). Bad As I Wanna Be's dam, Song of the Glens, showed very little racing ability as she failed to win or place in five starts but was a granddaughter of Polly Macaw, the dam of Right Tack. The name Bad As I Wanna Be was derived from the autobiography of Dennis Rodman. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Bad As I Wanna Be made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in which he started at odds of 11/2 but came home eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Patsy's Double. After a break of over two months the colt returned for a five furlong maiden at Windsor Racecourse on 31 July in which he started at 6/1 in a sixteen-runner field. Ridden by Jimmy Fortune he took the lead from the start and won \\"readily\\" by three lengths from Senior Minister. On 20 August Bad As I Wanna Be was stepped up sharply in class and sent to France to contest the Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse in which he was partnered by Gerald Mosse. The Richmond Stakes winner Endless Summer started odds on favourite ahead of Noverre and Rolly Polly (Prix Robert Papin) with Bad As I Wanna Be starting the 14.4/1 outsider of the six runners. The colt led from the start, broke clear of his rivals 400 metres from the start and won by six lengths from Endless Summer. The runner-up was later disqualified when it was discovered that he had been foaled five days before the end of 1997 and was thus technically a three-year- old. After the race Meehan commented \\"He's a good, old-fashioned type of horse with a decent pedigree. I'd like to find another race for him before the end of the season, but I am not sure what that race will be\\". Mosse again took the ride when the colt returned to France for the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 16 September. Starting the odds-on favourite, he raced in second place for most of the way but faded in the closing stages and finished last of the four runners behind Tobougg. Twelve days after his defeat at Longchamp, Bad As I Wanna Be contested the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and went off the 11/2 second favourite. He finished fourth behind Minardi, Endless Summer and Red Carpet but was promoted to third when Endless Summer was disqualified as an ineligible entrant. In the official classification of European two-year-olds Bad As I Wanna Be was given a rating of 119, making him the fourth best juvenile colt of the season behind Minardi, Okawango and Tobougg.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc01/EndMaterial.pdf At the end of the year Bad As I Wanna Be was purchased privately by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. =2002: four-year-old season= After missing the whole of the 2001 season Bad As I Wanna Be returned for two sprint races on the dirt track at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai in early 2002 but made little impact. He ran third in a minor race on 12 February and then came home eighth in the Listed Mahab Al Shimaal on 2 March. Stud record Bad As I Wanna Be stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland and France but had no success as a sire of winners. His last recorded foal was born in 2012.

The car's 392 hemi was built by Jim Harrell (of Jim's Auto Parts). He raced Winged Express for ten years, winning AA/FA (supercharged A-category Fuel Altered) at the NHRA Winternationals in 1967 and 1968. Since AA/FA was not recognized as a class by the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) until 1967, Borsch was never credited with a national title.

Borsch qualified for the 1968 NHRA Winternationals, a 32-car field in Top Fuel, setting an AA/FA record elapsed time of 7.29 seconds. The rest of the field refused to race him, for fear of the ill-handling Altered. It turned out they were right: in round one of Super Eliminator, Borsch went from guardrail to centerline in a wild ride, which was photographed by Bob McClurg; it \\"became one of the most famous drag racing photos of all time.\\" After getting a deal with model kit maker Revell for royalties,National Dragster online at NHRA.com (retrieved 14 September 2018) Borsch took the wheel of the new Wild Man Dodge Charger funny car. Because he had become famous for driving Winged Express one-handed, using his other arm to brace himself against the body of the car, he created a dummy arm and attached it to the left window of the new funny car. This was included as a feature of the Revell kit. The Revell deal, and the partnership with Marcellus, fell apart after the independent-minded Borsch refused to wear a sponsor teeshirt for a publicity event.Boyce, p.176, item #515.

Beginning as a grassroots effort, spearheaded primarily by Linda Ervine, Turas aims to promote the language particularly in the Protestant Unionist community. Historically, the Irish language was more closely associated with Irish Catholic identity. Turas was first established in 2011 with a single Irish-language class held on the Newtownards Road. Today, the project caters to approximately 200 learners and is considered the largest provider of Irish-language classes in Belfast. Turas has received many accolades for its cross-community work. In 2015, after awarding Linda with the Civic Leadership Award, Community Relations Council chairman Peter Osborne stated that Turas' success was a \\"testament to Linda‚Äôs vision, bravery and leadership.\\" History Linda Ervine, sister-in-law of the late Progressive Unionist Party leader David Ervine, participated in a six-week Irish-language course in early 2011 as a member of an East Belfast cross-community women's group. When an article published by the Belfast Telegraph prompted local interest in learning Irish, East Belfast Mission decided to host a 15-week Irish-language class in November 2011. In 2012, with funding from Foras na Gaeilge, East Belfast Mission was able to hire Ervine as Irish Language Development Officer. In 2014, further funding allowed for the allocation of a permanent space for Turas in the newly built Skainos Centre. Programme Turas currently offers 12 Irish-language classes each week, with levels ranging from total beginners to GCSE. Some learners at Turas have since continued on with A-levels as well as diploma certificates. Cultural classes include singing, set dancing, and tin whistle. Turas also hosts plays, lectures, debates, film screenings, festivals, and trips to the Gaeltacht. Outreach Ervine and Gordon McCoy (who has served as Education Officer at Turas since 2015) host outreach presentations and events about the 'hidden' heritage of Northern Ireland at local churches, clubs, libraries, schools, and community centres. McCoy is an expert on Irish-speaking Protestants, and runs a bus tour about the history of the language in East Belfast. Ervine and McCoy have also encouraged and facilitated the development of Irish-language programmes throughout the greater Belfast area. Advocacy The status of the Irish language has proved divisive in post-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland. As a representative of Turas, Linda Ervine has actively engaged with Unionist politicians, as well as members of the Orange Order, in order to promote the language.

Of uncertain 18th-century construction, it is a candidate as the oldest surviving building in the town, and a good example of period residential architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Howd-Linsley House is located in northern North Branford, on the south side of Middletown Avenue (Connecticut Route 17) at its junction with Sol's Path, a private lane. It is oriented facing west toward the lane on of land. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The rear roof face extends to the first floor, giving the house a classic New England saltbox profile. The front facade has an irregular arrangement of windows around a center entrance, which is simply framed and sheltered by a projecting hood. The interior retains many original finishes, and exposes some of its main framing elements, allowing a construction sequence to be reconstructed. With The house's date of initial construction is not known, but its architecture is suggestive of multiple construction periods spanning different eras of the 18th century. A core portion of the house was probably built early in the century, including its massive chimney, with the leanto in the rear added later. The building underwent a restoration in 1928, when a number of 19th-century additions were removed.

The same year, the Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition was established at Deception Island to help the survey of the Antarctic Peninsula, operating aircraft from Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd. History The Station was inaugurated on February 12, 1955 by the Defence Minister of Chile Tob√≠as Barros Ortiz, when at that time the Commodore Jorge G√°ndara was in charge of the Chilean Air Force. The base was first designated with the name of the then President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, but after the inauguration received the name of the former president Pedro Aguirre Cerda, in gratitude to his disposal of the decree that defined the Chilean Antarctic Territory in 1940. The research was carried out on volcanology, climatology and meteorology. Since 1965, a weather office was in operation in order to elaborate national and international meteorological forecasts. The base operation ended violently and definitively on December 4, 1967 when a volcanic eruption destroyed it. It was abandoned evacuating the 16 men who made up its endowment. New volcanic eruptions in 1969 and 1970 affected again the structures of the base. The ruins of the base, including its meteorological and volcanological center, were declared in 2001 as Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica N¬∞ 76 under the Antarctic Treaty System, on the proposal and preservation of Chile. Guti√©rrez Vargas Refuge The Guti√©rrez Vargas Refuge, so called in memory of the aviation Captain who died on December 30, 1955, was located at from Aguirre Cerda Station and was inaugurated on February 12, 1956. Its purpose was to serve as a refuge for the members of the Station in the case of fire. On December 4, 1967, the refuge was definitively abandoned, as was the Aguirre Cerda Station, due to a violent volcanic eruption. The poor remains of the refuge structure can still be seen on the beach where it was located.

He took office in the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665‚Äì67), when the French expelled the English from the island, and left office early in the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97), when the English expelled the French from the island. Family Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent was the son of Fran√ßois Roux, seigneur de Saint Laurent and Lucr√©ce, daughter of Balthazar Bruin de Castellane. His brother Joseph was received as a chevalier of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1633. Chevalier of Saint John (1641‚Äì66) Saint- Laurent was received as a chevalier of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem (Hospitallers) in 1641. In 1651 the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique went bankrupt and Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy persuaded Jean-Paul Lascaris- Castellar, the grand master of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, to buy the French part of Saint-Christophe and the smaller islands of Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Martin and Saint Croix for 120,000 √©cus. King Louis XIV of France remained sovereign of the islands, and Poincy was confirmed as governor of Saint Christophe. After Poincy died in 1660 the order, which had still not paid all the purchase money, appointed Charles de Sales the new governor. He was the nephew of Saint Francis de Sales. Jean-Baptiste Colbert put pressure on the Hospitallers to cede the islands back to the crown. The Hospitallers ceded the islands to France in 1665, when Saint-Laurent was lieutenant governor, passing ownership to the new French West India Company. The Second Anglo-Dutch War began that year, and France joined on the side of the Netherlands in 1666. The French and English had shared Saint Christopher until then. Fighting began on 21 April 1666 (Gregorian calendar), and the French routed the numerically superior English forces two days later. Charles de Sales was killed during the fighting, as was the English governor William Watts. Saint-Laurent received the English capitulation. He became governor of the whole island. However, in the absence of a formal royal commission the officers of the king's forces refused to accept his command. Governor of Saint Christophe =Expulsion of the English (1666)= Fort of Saint Christophe and vicinity (Basseterre) sent by Saint-Laurent Saint-Laurent gave the English settlers the choice of selling up and leaving the island with their slaves and personal effects or becoming subjects of the King of France. Those who stayed would not be allowed to practice their Protestant religion in public. A number chose to stay, and it took some time for the others to dispose of their property. Saint-Laurent saw these English settlers as a threat, since he expected an attempt to retake the island. He obtained reinforcements from Martinique and Guadeloupe to oppose any attempt. Civilians who were hostile to the French were deported to Nevis and Montserrat, or to other English islands or mainland colonies. 500 to 600 English \\"vagabonds\\" were expelled first, then 800 Irish, and then property owners. In all 8,000 English left the island, suffering considerable losses. Four of the Protestant churches were seized, dismantled and the beams removed. =Capture of Montserrat (1667)= On 17 January 1667 Lieutenant General Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre arrived in Saint Christophe after having examined all the coasts of Montserrat with a view to invasion. Saint Laurent received his commission as governor of Saint Christophe, signed by the king. All the royal troops stationed on Saint Christophe and 500 militia embarked on 25 ships of barques. La Barre had overall command, and Saint-Laurent consented to served under Saint-L√©on who commanded the land forces. The fleet sailed on 29 January 1667. On 4 February 1667 the fleet arrived at Montserrat. La Barre learned that the garrison of Governor Roger Osborne included many Irish Catholics of dubious loyalty, and decided to land a few days later. His land force included 500 militiamen from Saint Christophe under Saint-Laurent and 500 regular troops of the Navarre and Normandie regiments led by Marshall Saint L√©on. The force advanced inland in search of the English force, which they could not find, but they did capture Osborne's wife and other civilians, forcing the governor to sue for peace. The French took large quantities of armaments, slaves, horses and cattle. 2,000 Irish residents of Montserrat agreed to become subjects of France under the Sieur de Praille as interim governor. =English blockade (1667)= English attempt to retake Saint Christophe in 1667 An English squadron commanded by Sir John Berry entered the Caribbean and blockaded Saint Christophe. The English fleet arrived off the Nevis point on 4 April 1667. The English stayed out of range of the cannons of the fortifications, but kept frigates off the harbour of Saint Christophe to prevent any French ships entering. Saint-Laurent wrote to inform La Barre of the dangerous situation on the island and the risk of famine. In an effort to relieve the blockade La Barre and the governor of Martinique, Robert de Clodor√© combined their forces with the Dutch commander Abraham Crijnssen. The Franco-Dutch fleet sailed for Nevis, and engaged the English in the Battle of Nevis (20 May 1667). La Barre caused a retreat through his incompetence, and Crijnssen left for Virginia in disgust. A larger English fleet arrived under Sir John Harman, which destroyed La Barre's fleet and established English supremacy. An English invasion force under Henry Willoughby of 14 warships and 15 or 16 barques carrying soldiers reached Saint Christophe on 17 June 1667. The force disembarked at Pointe-des- Palmistes the next day. After the troops under Saint-Laurent put up a strong resistance, Willoughby chose to withdraw to Nevis. Eight flags had been captured from the English. Saint-Laurent sent his nephew to France to report to the king. =Return to peace (1668‚Äì88)= With the Treaty of Breda of 31 July 1667 (Gregorian calendar) the status quo ante was restored. The English settlers returned to find that the French had devastated their estates on the island. From 1668 to 1688 the French and English colonists on Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) were at peace. From March 1683 until June 1684 Saint-Laurent was acting governor general of the French Antilles during the absence of Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac. =Renewed war (1688‚Äì89)= When war broke out between England and France in 1688 the governor general of the Antilles, Bl√©nac, decided that to ensure the safety of the French on the island he must expel the English. He came to Saint Christopher at the start of 1689 with naval troops, local forces from Martinique and Guadeloupe and buccaneers, who joined the local militia. He attacked the English energetically and drove them back to Fort Charles, which he besieged and took, then transported the English to Jamaica, Barbados and other islands. Saint- Laurent was replaced as governor of Saint Christophe by Charles de Pechpeyrou- Comminges de Guitaut. From February 1689 until his death on 31 March 1689 Saint-Laurent was interim governor of Martinique.

The genus Metarhizium is known to infect arthropods, and collectively are referred to green-spored asexual pathogenic fungi. This species grows near the roots of plants and has been reported as an agent of disease in captive veiled chameleons. The etymology of the species epithet, \\"granulomatis\\" refers to the ability of the fungus to cause granulomatous disease in susceptible reptiles. History and taxonomy Originally named Chameleomyces granulomatis, M. granulomatis resembles Paecilomyces viridis. Because of the polyphyletic nature of the genus Paecilomyces Sigler and co-workers decided this species was better accommodated in a new genus in the family Clavicipitaceae. The first documented case of M. granulomatis was seen in the Copenhagen Zoo, showing morphology similar to Metarhizium viride (previously called P. viridis). This fungus causes fatal disseminated mycosis in veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus). Small subunit 18S rDNA (SSU), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and domains D2 and D2 of the large subunit 28S rDNA (LSU) were used to demarcate the fungal species M. granulomatis and differentiate it from closely related species, particularly M. viride. Growth and morphology UAMH 11177 Metarhizium granulomatis in phase contrast microscopy showing yeast-like cells grown in slide culture on PDA at room temperature UAMH 11177 Metarhizium granulomatis in colony grown on PDA at 30 C for 14 days Colonies of M. granulomatis differ in morphology depending on the growth medium used. Colonies on Potato dextrose agar (PDA) after 3 days incubation at are white in colour and reach 3 mm in diameter. Cultures developed on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) are similar in appearance although they grow more slowly on this medium. After 10 days, colonies on PDA reached a diameter of 27 mm and produced a diffusible brownish-grey pigment. Colonies the SDA are 12 mm in diameter and grey-ochre in colour. The hyphae of M. granulomatis are septate and bear phialides that have single apical openings (monophialides) resembling a wine bottle. The conidia produced are in short, curved, chains, appearing glassy and smooth. Conidia are spherical-to- oval and 3.3-3.8 Œºm in length by 1.2-1.6 Œºm in width. The fungus produces a yeast-like stage in vitro on PDA after 3 days incubation at 35¬∞C. Pathogenicity M. granulomatis is a rare fatal disease that infects veiled chameleons. Similar symptoms of disease are seen in M. viride. Common clinical signs seen in the veiled chameleons for this fungal disease are anorexia, hemorrhages in the tongue, necrotic toes, and ulcerative skin lesions. When observing the organs commonly infected, including the visceral organs, granulomas, glossitis, pharyngitis are seen. After death, cultures from the veiled lizard can be taken from the tongue, liver, lung, heart, kidney, small and large intestines. 1 to 3 mm spherical yeast-like yellow-to-white nodules are visible in the lung, liver and kidney. Antifungal treatment Treatment with nystatin and/or terbinafine may prevent further spreading or infection. When isolated most isolates susceptible to terbinafine, clotrimazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole and posaconazole. Although M. granulomatis is also resistant to some of the antifungals previously mentioned such as amphotericin B, voriconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole.

The company is India's second largest producer of cheese under its brand Go and the country's largest producer of cow ghee under its brand Govardhan. As of 2017, the company's daily procurement of milk was 1.2 million litres. History Parag Milk Foods started as a dairy in Manchar with a 20,000 litre capacity in 1992. It concentrated on a niche segment, producing skimmed milk powder and by 2004 became India's largest exporter of the skimmed milk powder. However, the company faced a challenge when the Government of India banned export of milk powder on account of local milk shortage. Thereafter the company began investing in cheese production in 2008. The company invested in a new facility to produce 1200 metric tonnes of cheese monthly at a time when the country only produced 600 metric tonnes of cheese a month. Consequently, there was a huge increase in cheese consumption in India with the expansion of quick-service restaurants in the country. In 2008, Motilal Oswal and IDFC Alternative Fund came in as investors in the company. As of 2013, Cheese, Ghee and Yogurt contributed 75% of the company's annual revenue. The company has a second dairy in Palamaner, Andhra Pradesh. In 2016, the company turned public with an initial public offering listing on National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. Brands The company's brands include Gowardhan, Go, Pride of Cows and Topp Up. The company launched the Go brand in 2009, Pride of Cows in 2012 and Topp Up in 2013. The company sells milk, ghee, dahi and paneer under the Govardhan brand and cheese, milk, chaas, lassi, yoghurt under Go brand. The company is India's second-largest producer of cheese under its brand Go and the country's largest producer of cow ghee under its brand Govardhan.. The company supplies milk directly from farms to customers homes under the brand Pride of Cows. The milk is produced at Bhagyalaxmi Dairy in Manchar, and procured from 3,800 Holstein Freisan cows. The milk is supplied to households in Mumbai, Pune, Surat and is airlifted to customers in New Delhi daily. The company uses an invitation-only mobile application subscription-based distribution model for this brand. In June 2019, Pride of Cows claimed to become the first Indian brand to sell fresh milk in Singapore. The company airlifts the milk from Pune to Singapore daily and uses a home delivery model to reach the product to the end consumer. In 2019, the Parag Milk Foods introduced Whey protein produced from cow milk and branded under Go Protein Power and Avvatar. The company also sells milk based energy drinks under the brand Topp Up.

Also known as bentwood hats, and hunting hats, the headgear take the form as either closed crown conical hats, with long frontal bills; open crown hats, with long bills; or visors with short bills.Ivanov, Aleut Hunting Headgear and Its Ornamentation, 269. Closed crown conical hats were historically worn by chiefs, whalers, and high-ranking sea hunters, while open crown hats and visors were worn by regular and lower-rank sea hunters. These hats are recognized by their distinctive shape, elaborately painted designs and artistry, as well as their ornamentation with bone carvings and sea lion whiskers. Russian and European explorers collected many Unangan wooden hats in the late 18th and 19th century. These hats are now part of many museum collections around the world.Black, Glory Remembered, 153‚Äì170. Since the 1980s, contemporary Alaska Native artists have spawned a resurgence creating this customary headgear.  Types  The hats can be categorized into three types: #QayaatxÃÇuxÃÇ (eastern Aleut dialect): meaning ‚Äúchief‚Äôs hat, decorated, closed top, long wooden hat‚Äù. This was a closed crown, conical hat with long- billed front; it has also been classified as ‚Äúclassic Aleut‚Äù by some ethnographers. #ChagudaxÃÇ: (eastern Aleut dialect) meaning ‚Äúwooden hat without a crown‚Äù. This is an open crown (no closed top) hat, with long-billed front. #ChagudaxÃÇ (eastern Aleut dialect): meaning ‚Äúwooden hat without a crown‚Äù. Similar to type 2, this is an open crown visor, but with a short billed front instead of a long-billed front. These were more common and worn by all seahunters.  Origins and history  = Development in the Kodiak Island region = Lydia T. Black states that Unanagan wooden headgear trace their origins to the Kodiak Island region.Black, Glory Remembered, 18. The headgear of this area, belonging to the Kodiak Alutiiq, developed through a combination of influences and adaptations from neighbouring Indigenous peoples including the Yup‚Äôik (in the north-west of Alaska), the Tlingit and the Haida (in the north-west coast of Alaska and British Columbia).Ivanov, Aleut Hunting Headgear and Its Ornamentation, 495.Black, Glory Remembered, 13. The Kodiak Islanders adopted a similar hat shape to the Yup‚Äôik, whose headgear were characterized by the closed crown hats. The style of peaked tops found in closed crown hats were influenced by the Tlingit, whose grass woven hats with split cylindrical tops indicated high-rank and privilege, and were reserved for chiefs. Stylized zoomorphic features on Kodiak hats were influenced by Haida headmasks, which featured carved animal heads.Liapunova, Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts', 224. By the mid 18th century when explorers had arrived in the Kodiak region, they remarked on seeing wooden headgear worn by the Indigenous peoples.Black, Glory Remembered, 21. They noted their use during festivals, times at sea, and also during trade with other peoples. = Introduction into the Aleutian Islands = With close regional proximity to Kodiak Island, the spread of headgear made its way its way into the eastern and central Aleutian Islands. This introduction was a slow movement; while visors were reported by explorers in the Shumagin Islands in 1741, the closed crown hats in the Aluetians were rare. The price of one chief's hat was the equivalent to 1 to 3 slaves, which was more than a baidarka (kayak).Black, Glory Remembered, 79. Further spread into the Aleutian region is likely due to the whaling hunt, which was a widespread practice among the Kodiak Alutiiq and Sugpiat. For the Kodiak Alutiiq and Sugpiat, whaling was a highly spiritual and ritualistic practice; whalers were both avoided and revered for going on such dangerous missions. From the time prior to the hunt to the time after the hunt and cleansing, whalers were eschewed; however outside of the hunt they were respected within the community for their ability to capture such a large sea mammal that contributed to survival of the community. Lydia T. Black notes that whaling was introduced to two islands, Four Mountain Island and Unalaska Island (via Krenitzen Island).Black, Glory Remembered, 78. On Unalaska Island, the first record of a closed crown hat was noted by Carl Heinrich Merck in 1778 when Unangans were seen capturing a whale. Black notes that a few years later headgear were seen at Atka Island, where some Kodiak Alutiiq had settled.Black, Glory Remembered, 80. Similar to the Kodiak Alutiiq, whaling for the Unangan people was highly valued within the community, as the kill was shared amongst members. Unangan hunters and whalers who participated in the practice were highly regarded; they often answered to the chiefs, as chiefs decided when whalers would go out on the waters. By the 19th century, further recordings of the headgear were noted by other explorers. During his voyage to Unalaska Island in 1805, German naturalist, explorer, and Russian diplomat, Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff described a qayaatXÃÇuXÃÇ chief's hat saying that \\"the most elegant and expensive headdress is a pointed wooden hat with an umbrella-like projection over the eyes and is rounded cap-like in the back‚Äù. Dating prior to contact, and with a long evolution that led to the development of stylized elements, Russian scholar S. A. Ivanov argues that Unangan headgear reached a pinnacle of design sophistication due to the relative isolation of the Aleutian Islands.Ivanov, Aleut Hunting Headgear and Its Ornamentation, 503.  Purpose  Drawing of an Unangan man wearing a ChagudaXÃÇ visor. A portrait of a man and a woman from the Aleutian Islands, 1822. Ludovik Choris, Anchorage Museum, 81.68.4. Male Unangan sea hunters, whalers, and chiefs wore the long billed open crown hats classified as chagudaXÃÇ.Liapunova, Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts', 222. Regular ranking hunters wore the more common open crown visors (also called chagudaXÃÇ), which had a shorter bill. The visor served to shield the glare of sunlight on the sea, and spray of water. Younger male hunters wore the short billed visors; and as a hunter matured in age, they would graduate to the longer-billed visor. As Russian ethnographer Rosa G. Liapunova has indicated, visors decorated with sea lion whiskers indicated the hunting abilities of the wearer; the more whiskers, the better the hunter. Closed crown hats classified as qayaatXÃÇuXÃÇ were worn by exceptional hunters, whalers and chiefs. Denoted by the shape of their pointed tops, these hats marked the whaler's and chief's place in society as respected members; the hats differentiated them from regular members of the community. Similar to short- and long-billed visors, these hats blocked the glare of sunlight and water. When not as sea, chiefs wore the closed crown hats during festivals and during visits to other villages.  Creation process  Unangan hat makers constructed headgear through a time- and labour-intensive process that began with finding and obtaining wood.Liapunova, Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts', 219. Since wood is scarce in the Arctic region, Unangans placed high value in its rarity. Finding a piece large enough was often acquired from a stump that had washed ashore, usually spruce, cedar or birch. The makers carefully cut and scraped out the found wood into a plank board, so that it was thin and flexible enough to bend into shape; this process could take up to a week. From there the makers steamed and softened the planks by using hot stones and pouring water over the wooden piece. They would then shape the wood into an asymmetrical visor or conical hat, with the intention of the longer side projecting over the eyes of the wearer. The Unangan makers would fasten the ends together at the back of the hat using sinew or baleen threads. They would further decorate the headgear with paint, as well as volutes, figurines, and sea lion whiskers, depending on the level of elaboration. alt=  Design and ornamentation  = Painting = Unangan hat makers painted the headgear with an undercoat base of white paint, and then added to it with a second coat of colour; the inside was painted in red.Black, Glory Remembered, 52. Paints were mostly made with mineral pigments and on rare occasions with plant-based pigments; they were mixed and with bodily fluids such as blood plasma or nasal mucus as a binding agent. In his journal recordings from a Russian scientific expedition, German naturalist Carl Heinrich Merck stated that colours such as black were obtained from mainland Alaska; while white was found near volcanic vents or through trade; green, red, and yellow were produced with the ochre clay found in pond water. Blue was created by mixing together green and black.Liapunova, Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts, 220. Painted designs included horizontal bands of colour, dots, closed and open curves, spirals, and on occasion representational drawings.Liapunova, Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts', 221. = Volutes = For more elaborate designs on conical hats, Unangan headgear makers would add carved bone plates, also called volutes, to the backs and sides. These plates covered the back seam where the wooden piece was bound, adding sturdiness to the hat. It was also the location where sea lion whiskers or beads would be inserted. On the sides, makers would add a carved plate near the wearer's temple; it had a long trianglual shape with a rounded circle at the end. S. V. Ivanov hypothesizes that this shape is a stylized bird head.Ivanov, Aleut Hunting Headgear and Its Ornamentation, 495. Whiskers were also inserted on the side to the bone plates. = Figurines = Unangan headgear makers also added small bone carved figurines to the tops of hats; these could be in the shape of birds or of other sea mammals like otters. The figurines could also resemble human beings. Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff's recorded observations note these figurines as being made of walrus tusk. = Sea lion whiskers = To indicate the abilities of a hunter, Unangan hat makers added sea lion whiskers to hats and visors; the more decorated a hat, the more skilled the hunter. The location of whiskers was placed on the opposite side as the hunter's throwing arm, as to not get in the way of any hunting tools, such as a harpoon, when throwing. A right-handed whaler would have the whiskers placed on the left side; a left-handed hunter would have the whiskers attached on the right side.  Contemporary revival  In the 1980s, the art of making bentwood hats was revived by Andrew Gronholdt, a retired boat builder, who researched the construction methods and techniques to produce the headgear. More recently, Unangan artist Okalena Patricia Lekanoff Gregory, who studied under Gronholdt, has demonstrated making hats at universities and the Smithsonian.

Different road safety innovations were tested to determine if they would reduce the number of road accidents. Amongst other innovations the experiment trialled the first linked traffic signals in the country, single yellow no-waiting lines, a keep left system for pedestrians and yield signs at junctions (the latter developed into the modern give way sign). The experiment also saw the first use of 20 mph and 40 mph speed limits in the UK. The experiment cost at least ¬£133,100 and resulted in a 10% reduction in serious injuries and fatalities.  Background  A British zebra crossing The British Government's Road Research Laboratory's (RRL) Traffic and Safety Division was established at Langley, near Slough in 1946. The division was soon tasked with developing a new type of pedestrian crossing that would be visible in all weather conditions. These had previously been marked only by lines of metal studs across the road and poles on the footway at either side. Several different crossings were trialled in Slough from 1951 with the first zebra crossing being laid out on 31 October. The very first zebra crossing has since been lost as the road it was sited on was pedestrianised. RRL testing revealed that of all the crossings trialled the zebra crossing was the best solution and this was adopted for nationwide use.  Planning  In 1954 Slough was selected as the site for a study of road safety measures. This was at the instigation of the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation John Boyd-Carpenter, who wanted the measures tested in a live highways environment. Slough was selected as the urban area was relatively compact and the roads were characteristic of the typical British town centre. The study was carried out by the RRL with the assistance of a \\"management body\\" that included Slough Borough Council, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, the RRL, Buckinghamshire Police, the Social Survey Unit of the Central Office of Information, the Slough Road Safety Council and Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The experiment ran from 2 April 1955 to 31 March 1957, with the public given no prior warning so that the data for the preceding period was not affected. During the experiment Slough was designated as a \\"safety town\\" and this term was widely circulated by means of posters and leaflets. In addition a \\"safety town\\" song was composed which was played in Slough's cinemas and taught to school children in music lessons. A short ditty that ran: \\"Slough is the safety town, let us keep it so, road safety is the code everyone should know\\" was also promoted. The experiment was described at the time as one of the world's biggest road safety experiments. To improve public awareness a beacon was erected in the town's shopping centre that showed a red light following a fatal road accident.  Measures trialled  The experiment trialled a wide variety of different road safety measures, many of them unique in the country at that time. On the town's High Street four existing zebra crossings were replaced with six light- controlled pedestrian crossings, these contained pedestrian push buttons to activate a set of vehicle control lights. Three different types of signals for pedestrians at these crossings were trialled: a round signal, backlit rectangular signals and neon rectangular signals. A set of 11 traffic signals were introduced along Bath Road, with their sequencing linked to that of the signals on the High Street and linked to the speed limit of the road with the intention of minimising delays for motorists. These were the first linked traffic signals in the country. Bath Road also saw the introduction of pedestrian crossing islands and refuge areas for waiting right-turning cycles which were described as particularly novel. Modern single yellow line on a British street The trial experimented with the use of a single yellow line to mark the extent of no waiting areas and yellow stripes on kerbs to denote no loading areas. Two types of luminous road marking paint were also trialled and the use of amber cat's eyes on the approach to junctions. Road marking footprints were also trialled on footways to attempt to encourage pedestrians to follow certain routes and to follow a \\"keep left\\" system. Various new road signs were also trialled. This included the use of T-junction and crossroad advanced warning signs on the A4 trunk road, a development of a scheme first trialled during blackout conditions in the Second World War. The use of 6-inch reflective metal discs mounted on posts at the edge of carriageways on bends was also trialled. The experiment also trialled the use of yield road signs at junctions (these later developed into \\"give way\\" signs) where previously only a generic \\"slow\\" sign had been used. It had been intended to trial American and European-style directional signage but it proved too short notice to include these in the experiment. Road signs indicating 20 mph and 40 mph speed limits were trialled for the first time in the UK. In order to maximise compliance police activity in the town was intensified for the duration of the experiment. The police also ran a series of road safety courses on the Slough Trading Estate that included cycling proficiency tests for school children.  Results  The Slough experiment cost ¬£124,900 in infrastructure and ¬£8,200 in training and publicity. This did not include staff costs which were borne by the budgets of the providing organisations. The experiment provided enough data for years of ongoing study afterwards. By November 1955 it was shown that road accident injuries and fatalities were steady in Slough, in spite of an increase of 11% nationwide. By the end of the experiment it was shown that Slough had achieved a 10% reduction in fatalities and serious injuries compared to a 9% rise nationwide over the same period. A rise in the number of minor injuries was attributed to better reporting due to greater public awareness and the heightened police presence. The experiment led to an increase in the number of people surveyed who considered that Slough was safer than other towns. Modern British pedestrian crossing signals panel The new light-controlled pedestrian crossings proved to be three times safer than an uncontrolled crossing. The neon rectangular pedestrian signals were selected as the most appropriate of the three types trialled and were adopted for future crossings. Light-controlled pedestrian crossings were further developed into the panda crossing which were in use from 1961 and the pelican crossing which were implemented from 1969 and remain in use. The use of luminous road markings was not adopted as it proved no more effective than existing markings in areas with a good level of street lighting. The use of amber cat's eyes at junction approaches did not prove effective and was discontinued. The \\"keep left\\" pedestrian footpath markings did not prove effective as the majority of the pedestrians proved to walk on the right-hand side or else walked adjacent to shop frontages for ease of window shopping. The experiment's final report recommended the adoption of the no waiting and no loading kerbside markings and further experimentation with the 20 mph and 40 mph speed limits ‚Äì these measures would later be adopted across the country. Slough continued to promote itself as the \\"safety town\\" for at least the next fifty years, a fact that was highlighted in news reports of 2007 when it was revealed that Slough had an accident rate 35.7% above the national average.

Goblinshead. p.267 The tower occupied a roughly triangular position, which was naturally defended by deeply worn water-courses. History In 1543 Michael Borthwick of Glengelt acquired the land from James, Abbot of Newbattle, with the consent of the abbey‚Äôs patroness, Mary, Queen of Scots, and built the property; the castle was purchased by Sir James Dundas of Arniston in 1624. By the early 20th century Newbyres was in an unsound, ruinous condition, and the local council demolished it in 1963 for reasons of 'public safety'. Structure The Remaining Ruins of Newbyres Castle It had been an L-plan tower, the main block being by . The wing was at the south angle, and measured by . In the early 20th century the walls of the main block facing west and north were complete to the wall-head, the rest being fragmentary. There seems to have been a courtyard wall. The North East corner of the tower, standing to about , and a mound of overgrown rubble nearby are all that remain of Newbyres Castle. The building was rubble-built with freestone quoins; the tower was vaulted, rising from a basement course. There was a boldly projecting corbelled parapet equipped with rounds. There were numerous gun-loops, four at ground level and two at the second floor. The unusual cap house to the projecting entrance wing collapsed in February 1881. There was an armorial panel bearing the Borthwick arms. The remaining structure is a scheduled monument, regarded as of national importance because it provides evidence and has the potential to provide further evidence for the study of the defensive architecture and domestic life of the minor gentry in mid-sixteenth-century Scotland.

Chivers in 1912 in America. The species has sexual fruiting bodies that are ornamented with characteristic, coiled hairs giving it a wooly appearance. C. subspirale colonies are brown, which the characteristic hairs are also responsible for. It is commonly found in various soil and dung samples. C. subspirale produces the mycotoxin, oxaspirodion, which inhibits inducible TNF-a expression and inhibits the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. History and taxonomy Professor A.H. Chivers recognized Chaetomium subspirale in 1912 in America through the course of his work on the genus Chaetomium. Through the examination of many successive generations and the cultivation of species from different sources on various media, Chivers was able to examine a large series of specimens from various herbaria and exsiccati. This examination allowed Chivers to provide his preliminary diagnosis of C. subspirale along with a number of other species within Chaetomium. X.W. Wang conducted a phylogenetic analysis of C. subspirale. Wang's findings have led her to propose the transfer of C. subspirale to the genus Humicola as H. subspiralis. MycoBank lists this new bionomial name as a synonym for C. subspirale. Growth and morphology C. subspirale has been recognized for having a daily growth rate of 2.5-3.5 ¬µm for colonies. Canadian mycologist Dr. Adrian Carter observed a moderately fast growth rate of 3.0-3.5 mm/day in Czapek‚Äôs medium and Leonian‚Äôs medium and a growth rate of 3.0-4.0 mm/day for the tomato paste and oatmeal-based medium, Weitzman & Silvia- Hunter‚Äôs agar. Characteristic hair help to distinguish C. subspirale. The lateral hairs are short, straight and dark, with tightly coiled tips. The terminal slender is initially delicately coiled in a spiral and then elongated and twisted later. This gives the appearance of wool threads to the fungi. In comparison, the acogonial coil are short, stipitate and irregularly coiled. Colonies of C. subspirale have an appearance of brown due to the erect, verrucose mycelial hairs. The ascomata, which are usually 200-280 ¬µm, take 14 days to mature. In reflected light, they give a grey appearance with a brown wall of flattened, angular (7-12 ¬µm) cells. With a brown and distinctly septate broad base of 2.5-3.5 ¬µm, C. subspirale also has well-developed rhizoids, which can be up to 400 ¬µm in length. C. subspirale‚Äôs barrel shaped petithecia help to distinguish it from other species of Chaetomium. =Similar taxa= C. subspirale is similar to various other species in the genus Chaetomium. However it is possible to distinguish between the species due to differentiating characteristics. A few species that C. subspirale is similar to include C. homopilatum, C. ampullare, C. sphaerale, C. pulchellum, and C. semispirale. C. subspirale has smaller ascomata with a conical beak and larger ascospores than C. homopilatum. C. ampullare and C. sphaerale are easily distinguished from C. subspirale due to the larger ascospores and ascomata of C. subspirale. C. pluchellum morphologically resembles C. subspirale, however, C. pluchellum has more slender terminal perithecial hairs. Different ascospore sizes and colony morphology on Leonian‚Äôs and Czapek‚Äôs media help to differentiate C. subspirale from C. semispirale. Habitat Chivers states that C. subspirale is commonly found in various soil and dung samples. In terms of soil, C. subspirale has been found in cultures of various substrata from New England frequently. For dung samples, C. subspirale appears in various locations and various types of dung samples. In Ontario, Canada, it has been observed on paper and rabbit, cow and deer dung. In the US, C. subspirale has appeared on the dung of sheep, dog, good, deer and rabbit. In South America, it has been reported from chicken dung, while in the Isles of Shoals, it has been recorded to appear rat dung. It is also found on dung in The Netherlands and South America. Chivers identified C. subspirale on antelope dung in Kenya as well. Industrial Use Significant research has revealed a large number of natural products derived from fungi that have potential for anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties for human cancer cells. Some compounds have even been tested in mouse models of human cancer to demonstrate their therapeutic benefits. Oxaspiradion is one of the fungi- derived natural products with an ability to aid in anti-inflammatory and anticancer measures. Isolated from C. subspirale, oxaspirodion inhibits inducible TNF-an expression and inhibits the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Inflammatory diseases, such as, septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn‚Äôs disease, involve TNF-a as the main pro-inflammatory cytokine. Some new therapeutic approaches target the regulation of TNF-an expression. Rether et al. used a cell-based screening system to identify a low molecular weight compounds inhibitory to the induction of TNF-an expression from a large panel of mycelial cultures of basidiomycetes, ascomycetes. Rether et al. found that oxaspirodion derived from C. subspirale inhibited the expression of a TNF-a-driven luciferase reporter gene. The NF-kappaB pathway is considered a prototypical proinflammatory signaling pathway. Oxaspirodion inhibits the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to interest in its potential as an anticancer therapeutic.

The vegetation was killed by escaping gas. The cause of the leak was a split in a seam near a girth weld on a 36-inch diameter Kinder Morgan Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America line. The pipe was manufactured in 1960. * On May 1, a MAPCO 10-inch propane pipeline exploded and burned, in Platte County, Missouri. 13,500 barrels of propane were burned. * On May 24, a bulldozer being used in Taylor County, Texas hit a petroleum pipeline, causing a large petroleum fire. There were no injuries. * On June 13, in Pensacola, Florida, at least ten persons were injured when two Gulf South Pipeline natural gas lines ruptured and exploded after a parking lot gave way beneath a cement truck at a car dealership. The blast sent chunks of concrete flying across a four-lane road, and several employees and customers at neighboring businesses were evacuated. About 25 cars at the dealership and ten boats at a neighboring business were damaged or destroyed.Associated Press, \\"No one seriously injured as gas explosion rocks Pensacola,\\" http://jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/061301/D7CJVCJ80.html, accessed 2018.01.14. The eight-inch diameter pipeline was installed in 1943. *On July 8, 2001, a Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. pipeline at Corrine, West Virginia, was damaged by cataclysmic flooding of the Guyandotte River, which washed out 200 feet of pipe where it crossed over the river. Due to washed out roads and bridges and dangerous flooding in the area, it took 5 hours for the crew to reach shutoff valves on both sides of the washout. * On July 24, a pipeline ruptured and spread burning gasoline near Manheim, Pennsylvania. * On August 11, at approximately 5:05 a.m. MST, an El Paso Natural Gas 24-inch gas transmission pipeline failed near Williams, Arizona, resulting in the release of natural gas. The natural gas continued to discharge for about an hour before igniting. Stress corrosion cracking was determined to be the cause of the failure. * On August 12, a bulldozer hit a 14-inch LP gas pipeline near Weatherford, Texas, causing a massive fire. One person was injured. * On August 17, an Oklahoma crude oil pipeline ruptured after being struck by a machine cleaning roadside ditches, sending oil into the air and damaging nearby cotton crops with up to spilled. * On September 3, at approximately 1 p.m. CST, a rupture occurred near the intersection of the 22-inch diameter T-ML Pipeline and the Black Bayou in Louisiana, resulting in the release of an estimated of natural gas. In addition, the liquids loss is estimated to be 15,000 gallons. The pipe was manufactured in 1926. The Mid-Louisiana Gas pipeline ruptured and leaked due to internal corrosion. * On October 4, a drunken man used a rifle to shoot a hole in the Alaskan Pipeline. More than 285,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled, costing more than $13 million to clean up. The man was later convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison. * On October 15, a 6-inch diameter ConocoPhillips LPG pipeline failed near Sweeny, Texas, forcing 2 dozen residents to evacuate. About 195,000 gallons of LPG were lost. * On November 7, 2001, at Westernport, Maryland, a Columbia Gas of Maryland natural gas pipeline built in 1907 was impacted when a wildfire burning on the mountainside crossed over the area and ignited small leaks ‚Äúthat were on a regular monitoring schedule.‚Äù * On November 13, 2001, at Waverly, Kansas, road salt corroded an aboveground eight-inch Williams Gas Pipeline Central pipeline, inducing a leak due to external corrosion of the pipe, which was manufactured in 1977. * On or about November 27, approximately 2,575 barrels of Jet A Kerosene (Jet Fuel) discharged from the P-62 pipeline of the TEPPCO Pipeline System into tributaries of the Neches River and the Neches River itself. The release occurred 4 miles southeast of Vidor, Texas. This spill was caused by disbonded coating and external corrosion on the pipeline. This incident was later part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency consent decree. * On December 14, an anhydrous ammonia spill near Algona, Iowa killed nearly 1.3 million fish, the largest fish kill on that state's record-to-date, Iowa state officials said. More than of anhydrous ammonia over a nine-hour period spilled into Lotts Creek and the Des Moines River, killing minnows, bass and other game fish. Koch Industries owned the 8-inch pipeline, and was doing maintenance work on a valve on the pipeline. The plume drifted over a six-mile (10 km) area causing officials to evacuate residents in its path.

She is best-known for a trio of plays, set during and after the Second World War, known as The Nibroc Trilogy. The initial play of that trilogy, Last Train to Nibroc, was the first play to transfer from FringeNYC to Off-Broadway (the second to do so was the hit musical Urinetown). Other works for which she is known include a one-act dramatic work about the aftermath of a sexual assault, I Dream Before I Take the Stand; a one-act musical drama set among the members of a Shaker community in the 19th Century, As It Is in Heaven; and a Holocaust-themed work, Letters to Sala, based on actual documents. She has also created plays for young audiences. Her work has won many awards. From The Nibroc Trilogy, Last Train to Nibroc received a 2000 New York Drama League Best Play nomination, See Rock City won the In the Spirit of America Award, and Gulf View Drive received L.A. Weekly and Ovation Award nominations, as well as the 2018 Ovation Award for Best Production at the Rubicon Theatre. She is a three-time winner of the Samuel French Short Play Festival, and eight- time finalist for the Heideman Award at Actors Theatre of Louisville. Hutton has received critical acclaim for her plays, which have been compared to the works of Horton Foote, William Inge, Jane Austen and Lanford Wilson, among others. Of her, one journalist wrote, ‚ÄúIn an era when playwrights are a vanishing species and Disney dominates Broadway, [Hutton] has fashioned a remarkable place for herself.‚Äù Early life, education and playwriting career Born in Louisiana, Hutton was raised in Sarasota, Florida. Her parents were both college professors with roots in Eastern Kentucky, which is partly the setting of her best-known and most-acclaimed work, The Nibroc Trilogy (Last Train to Nibroc, See Rock City and Gulf View Drive), though her work is not directly autobiographical. Hutton majored in theatre arts at Rollins College, a private liberal arts college in Winter Park, Florida. Her experience at Rollins included acting, directing, and costuming. After graduating from Rollins, she went to Asolo Conservatory at Florida State University (FSU), where she received an MFA in theatre. In the 1990s, Hutton wrote her first play, I Dream Before I Take the Stand. She has several times described herself as the \\"accidental playwright,\\" because, according to her, she was only moved to write plays to create better roles for herself than those of the plays in which she'd been appearing. In 1995, she took several one-act plays, including I Dream Before I Take the Stand, to the Edinburgh Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland to be staged. At the festival, her plays were favorably reviewed. When Last Train to Nibroc premiered in New York, it attracted so much attention that it transferred to an off-Broadway venue. Eventually, she gave up acting to concentrate completely on playwriting. She credits Tennessee Williams and Lanford Wilson as among her major inspirations. Hutton‚Äôs artist‚Äôs residencies have included Access Theatre, the Australian National Playwrights Conference, the New Harmony Project, Blue Mountain Center, Greenville Centre Stage‚Äôs New Play Festival, the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo and Winterthur. Hutton is an alumna of New Dramatists and a member of Ensemble Studio Theatre, the National Theatre Conference and The Dramatists Guild. Plays =The Nibroc Trilogy= Background Last Train to Nibroc, the first part of Hutton‚Äôs best-known work, The Nibroc Trilogy, was inspired by her learning, from a book about S.J. Perelman, that the legendary writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Nathaniel West, Perelman‚Äôs brother-in-law, had not only died within a day of one another in 1940, but that their corpses may very well have been shipped back for burial to the East Coast on the same train. The title of the play refers to Corbin, Kentucky ‚Äì her parents‚Äô state of origin ‚Äì where the real-life annual Nibroc Festival is held (‚ÄúNibroc‚Äù is Corbin spelled backwards). Despite Hutton's expectation while writing it that the play would not be popular, Last Train to Nibroc turned out to be the playwright‚Äôs most frequently-produced play, having received about 100 productions to date. Critical reception of the individual plays and the trilogy The New York Times critic, D.J.R. Bruckner wrote: \\"'Last Train' is not about events; it is about character. And when you leave this performance after 90 minutes of seeing these people reveal depths of feelings they are trying to hide, you might think you could easily enjoy another few hours of this.\\" Chris Jones of The Chicago Tribune awarded Last Train to Nibroc four stars, writing that it \\"most closely recalls the work of Horton Foote, although Hutton is very much her own writer.\\" David C. Nichols of the Los Angeles Times observed that \\"Had Arlene Hutton been around during Broadway's golden age, her finely wrought plays might rank with those of William Inge or Horton Foote.\\" In a review of See Rock City, Philip Brandes of The Los Angeles Times wrote ‚ÄúWith so many dramas these days built around bad behavior ‚Äî the worse the better, it seems ‚Äî it's a downright anomaly to come across a genuinely compelling story about ordinary people trying to do their best.‚Äù In his review of Gulf View Drive, directed by Katherine Farmer, which won an Ovation Award for Best Production at the Rubicon Theatre, Brandes wrote that the third play \\"thoroughly satisfies on its own merits.\\" However, Marilyn Stasio of Variety wrote that the play covers so much socio-historical ground that it \\"tends to sag from the weight of its responsibilities. But the spine of the central relationship holds it up.\\" Eric ReeL (sic) observes that \\"Hutton‚Äôs trilogy‚Ä¶ is not only a work that captures a period in our history, and the timeless story of a young couple living through that history, but she has captured the essence of an entire era in the history of American theatre.\\" Stasio believes that the three plays will attract audiences looking for \\"'event theater' that eschews flashy effects, demanding instead a long-term commitment to deserving characters caught up in trying circumstances.\\" Gina Bellafante in The New York Times calls the three parts of the work \\"exquisitely quiet, gently reaching plays\\" that \\"ought to be seen by anyone who doubts the capacity of front porch drama to tell a meaningful story beyond its own perimeters.\\" =I Dream Before I Take the Stand= Background Hutton‚Äôs first play, I Dream Before I Take the Stand, about a woman facing a hostile interrogator concerning a sexual assault incident in which she was the victim, was first performed, as noted above, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1995. The work has since received many professional productions, as well as amateur stagings, and has been anthologized in the collection The Best American Short Plays 1998-1999. Reception The List (Edinburgh, Scotland) called I Dream Before I Take the Stand \\"a feminist classic.\\" The New Jersey Independent called it \\"a riveting piece of theatre. The writing is pithy and fierce.\\" The critic for New York Newsday wrote that the play had \\"David Mamet overtones, but far more sympathy for the female victim enduring a nightmare quizzing than Mamet ever musters.\\" Since 2017, Hutton‚Äôs play has received particular attention with the rise of the #MeToo movement protesting sexual harassment and sexual assault. In April 2018, a group of Pittsfield High School students chose the play because they considered it particularly timely. The production inspired an editorial in The Berkshire Eagle that considered the issue of sexual assault as it relates to young people. =As It Is in Heaven= Background As It Is in Heaven, a play with an all- female cast, was first performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2001. A production was scheduled to open at off-Broadway‚Äôs 78th Street Theatre Lab in New York City on September 13th of that year. Two days prior, the September 11 attacks occurred, and on that night, the cast members responded by rehearsing the Shaker hymns performed in the play. The production later opened as planned. In 2008, the play was performed in Shakertown, in Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, the place that had first inspired it, and it was revived in New York in 2011. Critical reception Calling Hutton \\"one of the most richly humane voices in contemporary theater,\\" F. Kathleen Foley of The Los Angeles Times described As It Is in Heaven as ‚Äúamusing, intellectually stimulating and moving ‚Äì a beautifully crafted piece that will endure.‚Äù Reviewing the original New York production, Brooke Pierce of TheaterMania noted that the \\"90-minute, bare bones production... is moved along smoothly... to its satisfying and inspiring conclusion.\\" The critic of The Village Voice, Alexis Soloski, noted that \\"the scenes of the women working and living together are wonderful for their very Shaker-like qualities: simplicity, unpretentiousness, attention to detail,\\" although Soloski claims that the playwright \\"weaves in a dramatic arc that never seems as finely worked as the rest of the play.\\" Anita Gates in The New York Times, reviewing the New York revival, described As It Is in Heaven as a \\"modest, strangely moving one-act,\\" which \\"is also an unexpected patchwork of high and low cultural influences,\\" including The Age of Innocence, The Crucible and even The Book of Mormon. =Letters to Sala= Background Letters to Sala was derived from letters owned by Sala Garncarz Kirschner, a Polish Jewish woman who, beginning at age 16, spent five years in Nazi labor camps and kept letters and other messages she received in the camps carefully hidden from the Nazis. Her daughter, writer Ann Kirschner, was moved to write a book about the letters, Sala's Gift: My Mother's Holocaust Story. The original short play was presented at the New York Public Library to accompany an exhibition of Sala‚Äôs letters. Kirschner, theatre director Lawrence Sacharow and Hutton then began collaborating on a full- length version of the play, a project that survived Sacharow‚Äôs death from leukemia. The full play was performed at Rollins, Hutton's alma mater, in 2011, under the direction of Hutton‚Äôs longtime collaborator Eric Nightengale, with Sala and her husband, Sidney, present in the audience. Critical reception For a 2007 workshop of the play in Tucson, Arizona, a critic wrote, \\"I found myself just listening to the letters being read by the various actors and forgetting they actually were playing roles in a play. It was the richness of the written word that intrigued me.\\" The critic for the Orlando Sentinel, reviewing the Rollins College production, noted that \\"in places the play seems like a poem... a moving, timeless, beautiful poem,\\" though he expressed reservations about \\"a slight imbalance in the dual stories, with too much emphasis on the modern family's quarrel.\\" In a review of the Barrow Group performance of the play, critic R. Jones wrote that the play was written \\"with loving grace\\" and noted that \\"there was always a spark of hope in the bright young eyes of Sala... That is the beauty and the magic of Letters to Sala.\\" =Other plays= Other plays for adults written by Hutton include: * The Three Sisters Bront√´, a drama about the Bront√´ sisters inspired by Anton Chekhov‚Äôs classic, The Three Sisters, in which the sisters \\"struggle to find creative prosperity while navigating the harsh realities of male society.\\" * Running, a play set against the New York City Marathon. A New York Times writer praised Hutton for her \\"fine ear for the fits and starts of conversation\\" and noted that the \\"loose, thinking-it-through-as-we-go quality [of the play] is part of its charm.\\" * Vacuum, a drama about a scientist who may have found the cure for cancer. According to one critic, the play is \\"filled with great characters and very profound ethical undertones\\" and \\"exceeds‚Ä¶ what you can normally expect\\" of FringeNYC. * Five short plays: Studio Portrait, Houseplay, At the Tone, Friends for Life and The Price You Pay. Hutton has also written the following plays for young audiences: * Happy Worst Day Ever: Commissioned by Cincinnati Playhouse, the play won the Macy‚Äôs 2010 New Play Prize. * Kissed the Girls and Made Them Cry. Two two-character short plays by Hutton have been produced for Internet podcast on the playingonair.org website: Last Train to Nibroc (see above), featuring Mamie Gummer and Gregg Mozgala and directed by John Rando, and Closing Costs, featuring Amy Ryan and Michael Stuhlbarg and directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch. Teaching Hutton has served as an adjunct professor at Fordham University, as both a Tennessee Williams Fellow and faculty member at Sewanee: The University of the South, and as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Playwriting at the College of Charleston. She currently (as of 2019) teaches playwriting at The Barrow Group School in New York. Awards and honors In addition to the above-mentioned honors and awards, Hutton received a New Play Festival Best Play honorable mention at the Chattanooga Theatre Center for Letters to Sala, the Lippmann and Calloway Awards (as playwright) from New Dramatists, and a Francesca Primus Prize finalist designation from the American Theatre Critics Association. The playwright has twice received The Tennessee Williams fellowship from The University of the South and the NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship in 2016 from the New York Foundation for the Arts, as well as fellowships from the William Inge Center for the Arts and the South Carolina Arts Commission. She also received an EST/Sloan Commission (for the play Maria Sybilla) from Ensemble Studio Theatre. In 2017, Hutton was commissioned by The Big Bridge Theatre Consortium (BBTC), a consortium of university theatre departments across the country, committed to developing new plays dedicated to peace and interfaith dialogue. She was the first playwright ever to be so honored. Publications Hutton‚Äôs works have been published by Dramatists Play Service, Samuel French, Dramatic Publishing and Playscripts. Her plays have been frequently anthologized.

In this initial isolation, two families of closely related arylomycins, A and B, were identified. The family of glycosylated arylomycin C lipopeptides were subsequently isolated from a Streptomyces culture in a screen for inhibitors of bacterial signal peptidase. The initially isolated arylomycins have a limited spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The only activity against Gram-negative bacteria was seen in strains with a compromised outer membrane. Arylomycin A2 in complex of the E. coli signal peptidase. The catalytic (Ser90 & Lys145) dyad is shown in stick form in proximity to the C terminus of the natural product. Following their initial identification and characterization, co-crystal structures with the E. coli signal peptidase were determined and showed that the core of the arylomycins binds to the signal peptidase with the alanine residue in the macrocyclic ring taking the place of the P3 alanine residue in the signal peptidase Ala-X-Ala recognition motif. Additionally, the C terminus of the arylomycins is seen to be within hydrogen bonding distance of the serine/lysine catalytic dyad. Intrigued by the possibility that the arylomycins could represent a class of latent antibiotics whose activity is hidden by mutations in the signal peptidase of bacteria otherwise susceptible to them, researchers in the laboratory of Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California, developed a total synthesis of these natural products. The first arylomycin synthesized was arylomycin A2, and this was followed by the preparation of the arylomycins B2 and C. Their mechanism of action involves inhibition of bacterial type I signal peptidase (SPase). Because there are currently no pharmaceutical drugs with this type of antibiotic activity, arylomycins may have applications in treating drug-resistant bacterial infections and they have therefore attracted research interest. Synethetic analogs of arylomycins, such as G0775, have been developed which have broader spectrum activity and greater efficacy.

From the 5th grade, he dropped out of school unexpectedly, claiming that he had heard some voices that told him not to go to school.

Thus, at the age of 14, Usov received 2 disability groups and a small pension.–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ At the age of 17, voices began to call for Usov to perform acts of a pederastic nature. The first murder he committed occurred in Kuybyshev on August 1, 1974, when an 8-year-old boy named Boris, who had been missing since July 30, was killed. On that day, the boy was playing in the courtyard of his house when a man in a sports suit came up to him and suggested going to a nearby forest to collect nuts. No one else saw the boy after that. This was the coroner's report:After that, Usov killed four more boys. After the murder of 7-year-old Valery in Tolyatti, a witness reported seeing suspicious people who made strange signs to each other. Rehearsing this version, the senior inspector of the Criminal Investigation, Gronid Simakov, entered the company of several homosexual people. The murder of two of the victims was initially attributed to the physics teacher Petr Popov. He willingly took the blame, wishing to die, because during the investigation his sexuality was revealed, writing a death letter and twice trying to hang himself in his cell. While studying Popov's testimony, Simakov realized that the suspect was innocent, and informed the authorities about this. Employees of the criminal investigation department had already reported to Moscow about \\"exposing\\" Popov and began to pressure Simakov, threatening him with court, and he was removed from office. However, Simakov stood his ground, and it was impossible to condemn the innocent Popov. The last murder Usov committed was on June 17, 1975 in the Goreliy Khutor village. After raping and strangling a child, he collected a heap of dry brushwood, flunked the boy's body with it and set it on fire. He was arrested soon after. On June 1, 1977, the Kuybyshev Regional Court ruled that Vladimir Usov be sent to compulsory treatment in a psychiatric clinic. For 18 years he was kept in a specialized clinic in Kazan, and then transferred to a clinic in Samara, where he managed to escape from in 1996. He kidnapped two boys whom he was going to kill, but was too afraid.

Freedom for Humanity was a temporary mural by the American artist Mear One (Kalen Ockerman), painted on a wall in Hanbury Street, London in mid September 2012. It depicted suited men seated around a table, under an Eye of Providence, playing a Monopoly-like board game that rests on the backs of bent over naked figures, with a background of industry and protest. The mural attracted criticism as antisemitic, due to what some saw as stereotypical depictions of Jews, together with its reference to finance and the monetary and Masonic associations of the Eye of Providence.  Reactions  A local Conservative Jewish councillor likened it to antisemitic propaganda in pre-war Germany. Lutfur Rahman, then Mayor of Tower Hamlets, said \\"the images of the bankers perpetuate antisemitic propaganda about conspiratorial Jewish domination of financial and political institutions\\", and sought to remove it. Mear One responded: > \\"I came to paint a mural that depicted the elite banker cartel known as the > Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans, the ruling class elite few, the Wizards > of Oz. They would be playing a board game of monopoly on the backs of the > working class. The symbol of the Free Mason Pyramid rises behind this group > and behind that is a polluted world of coal burning and nuclear reactors. I > was creating this piece to inspire critical thought and spark conversation. > A group of conservatives do not like my mural and are playing a race card > with me. My mural is about class and privilege. The banker group is made up > of Jewish and white Anglos. For some reason they are saying I am anti- > semitic. This I am most definitely not... What I am against is class.\\" Nick Wright, in an article for the Morning Star, wrote that while, of the six figures depicted - Lord Rothschild, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Aleister Crowley, Andrew Carnegie and Paul Warburg - only two (Rothschild and Warburg) were Jewish, the piece \\"clearly exaggerates the distinctive features of all six men\\" and that \\"exaggerated depictions of Jews are created, disseminated and understood in a historically defined context that includes a powerful, even dominant, discourse that draws upon the long traditions of anti-semitism embedded in the dominant ideology and expressed, over the centuries, in the dominant visual culture\\". Further he states \\"the subterranean narratives around notions of the Illuminati, Freemasonry and bourgeois conspiracies cannot, in much popular imagination, be disentangled from deeply suspect discourses in which alien, semitic and covert elites are the controlling forces in our lives\\", and concludes \\"This is bad art and worse politics\\".  Jeremy Corbyn controversy  When Jeremy Corbyn received via Facebook an image of the mural with a message from Mear One that it was to be effaced the following day and appealing to freedom of expression, he asked \\"Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\\" His response was queried by The Jewish Chronicle in November 2015, and in March 2018, Luciana Berger demanded an explanation. Corbyn replied, \\"I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic.\\" The revelation and Corbyn's response fuelled accusations of insensitivity to antisemitism against him which, together with other examples, prompted protests, public debate and a number of internal reforms within the party.

The church is dedicated to Saint Lawrence, the patron saint of the island of Itaparica. It was built early in the Portuguese settlement of Brazil as part of the plantation of Gabriel Soares de Sousa. The Church of Saint Lawrence was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1952. 90% of the collection of religious objects and images were stolen from the church in 2010; they were never recovered. Location The Church of Saint Lawrence is located at the north of the island of Itaparica. While it was once an isolated plantation church, it is now located within the Historic Center of Itaparica. The church forms part of an architectural set that includes the Parish Church of the Blessed Sacrament (Igreja Matriz do Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento) and the Fort of St. Lawrence (Forte de S√£o Louren√ßo). It faces west on Rua Lu√≠s da Grana, and its south elevation faces Pra√ßa da Matriz, a small public square; the Parish Church of the Blessed Sacrament is on the same street facing east. The church is separated from the sobrado do Tenente Bottas, a two-story house of the colonial period, by a small yard. History The Church of Saint Lawrence was constructed in the 16th century as part of the plantation of Gabriel Soares de Sousa (1540‚Äì1591), a Portuguese explorer and naturalist. He describes a chapel as an integral part of his plantation in his Tratado Descritivo do Brasil of 1587. Ubaldo Os√≥rio, in A Ilha de Itaparica, states that the church was constructed in 1610, a more likely date of construction. Rocha Pita cites a report from Father Luiz Ferreira that a sermon against the Dutch incursion in Brazil was made from the pulpit of the church; this event dates to approximately 1623. The design of the Church of Saint Lawrence was likely influenced by the Church of Santo Amaro do Cat√∫, also on the island of Itaparica, which has a single nave, corridors, and porch. The bell tower dates to the late 17th century; its pyramidal endings of towers only appear in Bahia in the second half of the century, notably in S. Antonio de Cair√∫ and Parish Church of Saint Bartholomew. The side corridors seem original to the structure, but the left corridor was modified, possibly in the 19th century. The church was damaged by the soldiers under General Madeira during the Brazilian fight for independence in 1822. It was abandoned and in ruin by 1941. IPHAN carried out significant restoration works during this period, including reconstruction of the roof, the lining of the main chapel, stabilization of the walls, replacement of cement floors with ceramic tiles and restoration of carpentry and carving. This work was finished in 1944. General restoration work was carried out again in 1977. =2010 Theft= A large-scale theft of religious objects in 2010 resulted in the loss of 90% of the collections of the Church of Saint Lawrence and Parish Church of the Blessed Sacrament. 34 of the 41 images and religious objects of the Church of Saint Lawrence were stolen on March 19, 2010. Among the most important pieces stolen were the wooden image of S√£o Elesb√£o (Saint Kaleb of Axum), at in height, being the only that exists in Brazil. Other items stolen include a golden chalice, monstrance, a wooden crucifix; 17th- and 18th-century images of the Infant Jesus, Saint Francis, Our Lady of the Conception, Lord of Bonfim, and Our Lady of the Rosary were also stolen. Mateus Morbeck of IPHAN described it as \\"one of the biggest robberies in history.\\" Structure The Church of Saint Lawrence consists of a single nave with side aisles and lateral corridors. The walls are of the structure are of brick and mixed masonry; it has a gabled roof with overlapping eaves; a wooden barrel vault is located above the chancel. It demonstrates a transition from the simple rural chapels of the interior of Bahia with \\"T\\" floor plans to the larger Parish and Brotherhood churches of the 18th century. Like many plantation churches of the Rec√¥ncavo region of Bahia, the church had a covered porch. The porch was removed, but existed at least until 1823. A semi-open porch serves as a vestibule on the right side of the church. The church houses the remains of numerous figures from Itaparica; they likely include those of Maria Felipa de Oliveira (died 1873), an Afro-Brazilian resistance fighter during the Brazilian War of Independence. Festival A three-day festival dedicated to Saint Lawrence is held annually in August. Protected status The Church of Saint Lawrence was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1952. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive under inscription number 462. It is an important element of the protected historical center of Itaparica (Conjunto Arquitet√¥nico, Urban√≠stico e Paisag√≠stico de Itaparica), established in 1980.

The fungus is frequently found in soil and has been linked with skin and systemic infections. This species is also known to cause disease in the green alga, Cladophora glomerata as well as various fruit and vegetable crops grown in warmer climates.  History and taxonomy  Sarocladium kiliense was renamed from Acremonium kiliense by Gr√ºtz in 1925, and it is particularly known as Cephalosporium acremonium in medical mycology. The name Cephalosporium was used to describe colorless molds with simple unbranched conidiophores and condiogenous cells bearing at the tip or head of the unicellular conidia. For all such molds that had these characteristics, many authors have been using the name C. acremonium. However, in 1971, Walter Gams kept the name A. kiliense to describe the fungus that were frequently found in soil and were associated with skin infections. Other similar fungus were put to a new species called A. strictum. Gams divided Acremonium into three major sections: Acremonium, Gliomastix, and Nectriodea. Acremonium comprises four major clades: A. sclerotigenum, Sarocladium, A. curvulum, and A. breve. The genus Sarocladium contains multiple species previously treated in Acremonium and those that belong to the A. strictum and A. bacillisporum clades. Sarocladium species are noted for melanogenesis, a pathogenic factor in fungal disease, which is seen in S. kiliense.  Morphology  Colonies of S. kiliense have distinct characteristics, such as its colour, when grown on different medium. When the colonies are grown on glucose peptone agar at a temperature of , colonies can reach a diameter of 50 mm in one week. The colonies have a flat topography with a grey to an orange coloration. At the microscopic level, predominant features include balls of ellipsoidal conidia accumulated at the ends of long slender phialides and have oval chlamydospores. The conidiophores are long, straight, slightly tapering phialides, arising as side-branches on hyphae. At the end of the phialides are accumulated balls of slimy conidia with an ellipsoidall shape measuring 3-6 x 1.5 mm. Colonies that are grown on sabouraud dextrose agar have a white coloration that later becomes pink during further incubation. Microscopically, the growth mostly has fasciculate mycelium giving rise to slender phialides. When the colonies are grown on oatmeal agar at a temperature of for 10 days, the isolates form poorly differentiated phialides, and single-cells, thick- walled uncoloured chlamydospores with chromophilic walls measuring 4-8 Œºm in diameter on the ends of hyphae and intervening in filaments. After 7 days of incubation, the chlamydospores become apparent although sclerotia remain absent.  Ecology and growth conditions  Sarocladium kiliense is a fungus that can be found throughout the world and have been seen in various European countries and warmer countries such as Egypt, India, and Nigeria. It is commonly isolated from the soil and seen in cereal fields, hay, apples, endosperm of rye grains, tomatoes, ground nuts, pineapples, and the soils of grass lands. In addition, Sarocladium kiliense have also been found to be an aerial contaminant. Isolates that are grown at higher temperatures have larger colonies than isolates grown at lower temperatures. When colonies are grown on glucose peptone agar at a temperature of , colonies can reach a diameter of 50 mm in one week. Colonies that are grown at on malt extract agar (MEA) form smaller colonies measuring 1.8-2.3 cm in diameter.  Pathogenicity  S. kiliense has been mainly known to be a human opportunistic pathogen and infections have been found to be more frequent in tropical countries. However, in individuals who are immunocompetent, the pathogenicity of S. kiliense is very low. Infection from the fungus usually occurs through a penetrating injury or open wounds that are exposed to the fungus. Since the fungi has the ability to go through the process of melanogenesis, one of the resulting infections is mycetoma. In patients who are immunocompetent, some of the local infections that may be seen are keratitis, endophthalmitis, onychomycosis, granuloma formation, or cutaneous skin infections. On the other hand, individuals who are immunocompromised and are infected by the fungus can face severe systemic infections and may develop peritonitis. In one study, it was found that S. kiliense was reported to invade the lungs. During the study, they were able to look at the blood and see narrow septate hyphae, cylindrical conidia, and other characteristics of S. kiliense. In addition to the lungs, it has also been known to invade the upper respiratory tract mucosa, sinuses, and conjunctiva. Despite S. kiliense being mainly known as a human and animal pathogen, it also plays a role in plant diseases. It has been noted that they are pathogenic to the green algae, Cladophora glomerata, and isolated in plants such as apples, ground nuts, pineapple, lettuce and fennels. In 2016, in India, it was reported that S. kiliense was responsible for causing fruit rots in pears. When infected pears were examined, they displayed watery discolouration if the interior tissues without any browning. This was the first case that the fungi was known to cause the rotting in pears.  Diagnosis and treatment  Individuals who are infected by S. kiliense, diagnosis can be established by isolating the fungus from the infected region, culturing it, and identifying the fungus‚Äô typical characteristics. Additionally, diagnosis can also be performed through the sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA). Currently, there is no optimal treatment for infections caused S. kiliense since it is resistant to almost all antifungal drugs. S. kiliense infections are difficult to treat and the outcomes are usually fatal. However, there have been successful reports of amphotericin B (AMB) during the treatment of the infection while other cases were unsuccessful. Moreover, the drug voriconazole has also been shown to have success in treating life threatening S. kiliense infections within immunocompromised patients.  Metabolism  In biotechnology, S. kiliense, which use to belong to the genus Cephalosporium produces cephalosporin C, an antibiotic similar to that of penicillin. Moreover, since S. kiliense use to belong to the genus Acremonium, it was noted that species from this genus can degrade polysaccharides, pectin, Carboxymethyl cellulose, xylans, and with S. kiliense mainly degrading starch. Furthermore, the fungus is also known to oxidize manganese in the soil and produce alkaline proteases and amylases.

Buchanan attended the Terrill School in Dallas, then Southern Methodist University, also in Texas, and George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Career Mr. Buchanan began his government career with a World War II agency called the War Production Board. He later became an official with the National Production Authority in the early 1950s. =Diplomatic career= On September 12, 1953, he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Luxembourg by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to replace fellow Texan and outsize personality and steel heiress Perle Mesta. He presented his credentials on December 1, 1953 and, two years later, when the two countries agreed to raise their respective missions to embassy level, he was promoted, appointed on September 9, 1956, and confirmed (during a recess of the U.S. Senate), as the U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Buchanan left his post in Luxembourg on December 20, 1956. Shortly after returning from Luxemboug, Eisenhower appointed Buchanan became Chief of Protocol, a role designed to assist the international diplomats stationed in the United States. He was protocol chief until January 1961 when John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as President and he was succeeded by Angier Biddle Duke, the former Ambassador to El Salvador and a close friend of Kennedy. In 1959, The Washington Post described Buchanan as follows: > \\"What kind of a man is Wiley Buchanan? ... He is of medium height--five > feet, eight and a half inches of shrewd determination... Buchanan has the > same firm lines around his jaw and the same love of hospitality which > characterized his ancestor, the fifteenth President of the United States, > James Buchanan... His formidable fortune, flowing originally from Texas > lumber, cotton, and oil, keeps multiplying through his Washington real > estate foresight.\\" After leaving the government, he wrote an amusing memoir in which he candidly discussed his work as head of protocol. The book, Red Carpet at the White House: Four Years as Chief of Protocol in the Eisenhower Administration, was published in 1964. Buchanan was a close friend of Richard Nixon, and contributed to his campaign for president. On March 25, 1975, then President Gerald Ford appointed Buchanan as the U.S. Ambassador to Austria. He presented his credentials on April 2, 1975 and served throughout the rest of the Ford administration, leaving his post on March 13, 1977. Upon Jimmy Carter's election to the presidency, Buchanan was succeeded by Milton A. Wolf, a former investment banker and real estate developer from Cleveland, Ohio. In Washington, he was a member of the Federal City Council, L'Enfant Plaza Corporation, and the National Symphony, of which he sat on the board for the last two. He was a trustee of his alma mater, George Washington University, and the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

Research  Jordano's research focuses in evolutionary ecology. He is devoted to explain how ecological interaction, more precisely pollinators and seed dispersers, evolve and are vital for biodiversity survival and proliferation. He has spent most of his research time in Spain, but he also conducts research in Brazil in collaboration with Dr. Mauro Galetti and others. Together, they have studied the role of seed dispersers in Brazilian ecosystems including the Atlantic Forest and Pantanal; they also created a course on Frugivory and Seed Dispersal as part of the post-graduate program in Ecology and Biodiversity at the State University Paulista \\"Julio de Mesquita Jr.\\" (UNESP). Current research projects include components of pollination effectiveness and their consequences in insular pollinator assemblages, ecological correlates of interaction in complex plant-animal mutualistic networks and ecological networks in a fragmented world.

It is a boring species, tunnelling into living coral colonies. It can be found in the tropical western central Pacific Ocean. Description Lithophaga simplex is one of the smaller members of its genus. The shell grows to a maximum length of and a width of . It is narrow and cylindrical, tapering slightly at the posterior end, with the umbo near the anterior end. Both ends are rounded and the hinge line is straight. The periostracum is yellowish and covered by a chalky crust. This mollusc can be distinguished from other similar species by its inflated shell and by the dark siphon. Ecology Lithophaga simplex bores into living colonies of coral. In the Red Sea it is commonly found in the massive coral Astreopora myriophthalma. The mollusc was at one time considered to be a parasite of the coral because its tunnelling activities weakened the coral structure and made it more liable to suffer damage. However it has now been found that the ammonium products that the mollusc excretes serve as nutrients, and the benefits of these to the coral colony may outweigh the disadvantages of structural weakening, so the relationship between the two is probably mutualistic. Other host corals for this bivalve include Goniastrea pectinata, and Plesiastrea versipora. When molluscs of this species were removed from their host corals, researchers found that they tended to spawn in the last quarter of the lunar month or around the time of the new moon. The larvae followed the normal course of development of mytilids. When the veliger larvae were well-enough developed to settle on the seabed, they were capable of delaying metamorphosis by up to four months, a fact that would enable them to disperse widely while searching for suitable substrates on which to settle.

Her last known confirmed sighting was on July 13 at her residence in downtown Crestone, but some have stated seeing her at a later date. In 2018, Saguache County Sheriff's Office and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation now believes foul play was the cause of Reisinger's disappearance. Personal life An Arizona native, Reisinger was relocated to Denver to be with her aunt after a difficult childhood upbringing. This arrangement became strained, leaving Reisinger as a ward of the court at the age of 15. At this time, Reisinger moved in with Rodney and Debbie Ervin after dating their son. Thereafter, Reisinger spent a few years with the Ervins before attending Western State College in Gunnison, where she met her best friend Michael. During the summer vacations from college she would live with Michael's family and after college she remained living between Michael's family and the Ervins. In 2014, Reisinger moved from Denver to Gunnison, Colorado, teaching a course and taking coursework in psychology and sociology at Western Colorado University. Later that spring, she moved to Crestone in the San Luis Valley. Reisinger was a very spiritual person with interests in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American religion. She also practiced tarotology and claimed to be a clairvoyant and a medium. She has one daughter with her former boyfriend Elijah Guana. Disappearance The Saguache County Police Department was notified of Reisinger's prolonged absence by her landlord, Ara McDonald, on July 13, 2016. Once inside the apartment, investigators found Reisinger's cell phone and medication. Numerous Crestone residents claim to have seen her at the Full Moon Drum Circle gathering the night of July 18, 2016.

Map of the coast of Bulgaria near Burgas; the site of ancient Antheia is marked Antheia () was a town on the western coast of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) in ancient Thrace, a colony of the Milesians and Phocaeans. It later bore the Latin name Anthium, and was the precursor settlement to Apollonia Pontica (modern Sozopol). It was located on the Gulf of Burgas between the modern cities of Burgas and Sozopol in Bulgaria. Situation The settlement was on the coast of the Gulf of Burgas, located on the peninsula of Atia (), which lies between the bays of Vromos and Atya, about 2 km northwest of the modern town of Chernomorets. About 10 km southeast is Sozopol, the ancient Apollonia, which was the successor settlement to Antheia. Today, the peninsula is occupied by the Atiya Naval Base, thus the site is within a restricted military area. Not far away is the village Atia. History In the course of Greek colonization of the Black Sea in the late 7th and early 6th century BCE. The place was founded by Greeks from Miletus and Phocaea. All finds made in the area of settlement originate from Archaic period leading to the conclusion that the place was abandoned early. The place was apparently just an apoikia and never attained the status of polis,. and possibly merged with Apollonia by synoikismos. Pliny, writing in the first century, reports that Antheia was located in the area where Apollonia was in his time - Astice regio habuit oppidum Anthium, nunc est Apollonia. The interpretation of this passage, that Antheia was a former name of Apollonia, is based on a misunderstanding. Archaeology From Antheia comes the statue of a headless archaic Kouros () and archaic ceramics. In 1927 a hoard of arrowheads of the 5th century BCE was found there, which has been interpreted as showing that arrowheads were a form of pre-monetary medium of exchange. In the Middle Ages, the Atia peninsula was populated again. On its highest elevation are the sparse remains of a medieval fortress.

The basic purpose of the law was to protect the tenant farmers from the Rabassa Morta (\\"dead strain\\") and promote their access to the land they were cultivating. The law was not implemented because it was revoked by the Court of Constitutional Guarantees. The negotiation that followed between the Spanish and Catalan governments was interrupted by the Revolution of October 1934, that included the proclamation of the Catalan State. Both events resulted in failure.  Background: the problem of the Rabassa Morta  The Rabassa Morta was a type of contract that was widespread in Catalonia, whereby a lessee (lessee rabassaire) rented a portion of land to grow vines, on the condition that the contract was dissolved if one-third of the first strains planted had died. The legal nature of this contract was discussed: while some considered it a rental, others (the majority) considered it a long-term lease. In the eighteenth century, there was an increase in the value of the land at the same time that inflation soared. The landowners considered themselves harmed by the improvements in agricultural methods that prolonged the life of the vineyards, while the rent lost value and extended for several generations. The conflict was resolved in favor of the owners, when the Barcelona Provincial Court ruled in 1756, that the contract would be dissolved by either the death of the vineyards, or fifty years after its signing, later confirmed by the Civil Code of 1889. The system was the source of several disputes, especially after the arrival of phylloxera, an agricultural disease affecting vines, which originated in France in the late nineteenth century. The movement of the agricultural disease into Catalonia during the late 1800s and early 1900s led to the widespread destruction of the areas grapevines, and consequently, the replacement of prevalent European native strains with those of American origin. Difficulties for those working the land where compounded, as the new vine strains proved to be significantly shorter-lived than the vines they replaced. Thus, the contracts were completed in a very short time and the owners, seeing that the cultivation of the vine was no longer profitable, expelled the rabassieres to cultivate other plantations. On the other hand, the rabassaires maintained that the replanted vineyards were the same old strain, which could perpetuate the life of the vineyard.  The approval of the law  In December 1933, the president of the Government of Catalonia, Francesc Maci√†, was replaced by Llu√≠s Companys, one of the founders of the Uni√≥ de Rabassaires, whose main objective was access to the land of the rabassieres tenants. Company's immediately stated his intention to carry out an agrarian reform adapted to the specificity of the Catalan countryside, especially in the sector of the vineyard, in which some 70,000 small farmers dedicated to the cultivation of grapes did not have ownership of the land, but cultivating it under long-term contracts that depended on the life of the vineyards (rabassa morta). They ran the risk of being evicted from the land. Thus, the Parliament of Catalonia unanimously approved on March 21, 1934 by the deputies present‚Äîthose of the Catalan League, a new denomination of the veteran Regionalist League of Catalonia, were absent‚Äîthe Crop Contracts Law, equivalent of the State law of leases that could not be approved by the Spanish Parliament in the summer of 1933, which guaranteed to the rabassaires the exploitation of lands for a minimum of six years and the right to access the property of the plots that they had been cultivating uninterruptedly for more than eighteen years.  The annulment of the law by the Court of Constitutional Guarantees  The law was met with radical opposition from the Catalan Agricultural Institute of San Isidro, which grouped the most important landowners, and the Regionalist League of Catalonia, who asked the government of the Radical Republican Party, presided over by Ricardo Samper, that the League and the CEDA supported in Parliament, to appeal the law before the Court of Constitutional Guarantees, which it did on the 4th of May. The appeal was based on the invasion of state powers, those referring to contractual obligations, that Article 15 of the Constitution of 1931 reserved to the State, while the Government of Catalonia argued that by virtue of Article 12 of the Statute, it corresponded to the legislation in matters of agrarian social policy, that the government's argument was the lack of powers of the Parliament to place the evidence to the League \\"It put forward the defense of the economic interests of its potential voters to that of the autonomic powers, contradicting the desire expressed in its programmatic declaration of 1933 to aspire to\\" a formula of much wider autonomy \\".{ On June 8, 1934, the Court of Guarantees declared, by 13 votes to 10 and without many of its members having heard the case, that the Parliament of Catalonia was incompetent on the subject and thus annulled the law. The response by the Government of Catalonia was the approval by the Parliament of Catalonia of a virtually identical law on June 12.  The conflict between the Central Government and the Government of Catalonia  The annulment of the Crop Contracts Law created a serious political crisis between Madrid and Barcelona, including the withdrawal of the Republican Left of Catalonia deputies from the Spanish Parliament, to which the Basque Nationalist Party added in a show of solidarity faithful to its line of agrarian social justice, which it tried to apply in Navarre, and a considerable nationalist exacerbation, which favored the paramilitary activities and the separatist propaganda of the Joventuts d'Estat Catal√†, directed by Josep Denc√†s. Denc√†s managed the Ministry of the Interior and on September 18, retaliating against the anarcho-syndicalist movement of Barcelona, while Miquel Badia, of the Republican Left of Catalonia, was commissioned to the Public Order services of Catalonia. However, since neither of the two governments wanted to start a new confrontation, representatives of the same negotiated over the summer the introduction of amendments in the regulation that the law had to develop. But the agreement reached between Samper and Companys was broken when the new government headed by Alejandro Lerroux was set up in Madrid at the beginning of October and three CEDA ministers were part of it. The Revolution of October 1934 began immediately afterwards, in which Companys was one of the protagonists with the Proclamation of the Catalan State, within the \\"Federal\\" Spanish Republic. The failure of the Revolution led to the imprisonment of Companys and the dissolution of his government and the suspension of the Statute of Autonomy.

He explains that he needs money to solve his financial problems at home and Jonny offers to help him swallow the bags of pills out of sympathy. While at the border crossing, Jonny experiences extreme pain from the bags rupturing in his stomach so Andrew quickly turns the car around and drives to a hospital but is too afraid to go inside. When Jonny dies in the car, Andrew and Melissa hide his body in the front storage compartment of the car. They drive back to Pepe's to ask for something to flush out the pills in Andrew's stomach. Pepe gives Andrew muscle relaxers and gives Melissa a tranquilizer to relax, then forces them to wear costumes for his party. During the party, Andrew breaks into Pepe's stash room and steals all of his money, nearly $20,000. While attempting to leave, he is caught by Pepe's guard Raul, who demands to look in the front storage compartment of the car. He finds Jonny's body and accidentally shoots it, then he tells Andrew and Melissa to lie down and prepares to shoot them.

When the Greene-Sullivan Circuit Court denied Leach's petition for admission to the bar in 1893, her successful appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court, In re Petition of Leach, broke the gender barrier for admission to the bar in Indiana, securing the right for women to practice law in the state. The landmark decision, a progressive one for the time, also set a precedent that was used in 1897 as a test case to give Indiana women the right to vote, although the voting rights challenge in Gougar v Timberlake was unsuccessful. Leach was also an active politician and a supporter of women's suffrage who favored a constitutional amendment to secure women's right to vote. The Wooster, Ohio, native and married mother of two was trained as a lawyer and stenographer. She began her legal career as court reporter for the Greene-Sullivan Circuit Court in Sullivan, Indiana. After Leach was admitted to the bar in 1883, she maintained a general law practice in Sullivan and in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1911 until her retirement in 1917. Leach also held several leadership roles in local and state politics, including membership in the Republican Party and serving as a delegate to the party's state convention in 1896, before joining the Progressive Party when it endorsed equal suffrage. Leach served for three years as Sullivan County chair of Progressive Party and for twelve years as president of the Sullivan County Bar Association. She was admitted to Indiana State Bar Association in 1909. Leach served as a State Organizer for the National American Suffrage Association and ran an active but unsuccessful campaign for state representative in 1910. In addition, she founded the Woman Citizen, a monthly publication of Indiana's Equal Suffrage Association, in 1911 and served as its editor for two years. Two plaques in the rotunda of the Sullivan County Courthouse commemorate Leach's life and her successful effort to secure women the right to practice law in Indiana. Early life and education Antoinette was born on April 3, 1859, in Wooster, Ohio, to Lydia and Henry Daken, Her father died when she was only a few months old. Lydia Dakin later married a carpenter named Brighton and the family moved to Gosport in Owen County, Indiana. Dakin's stepfather adopted her as a child and she was known as Nettie Brighton until her marriage. In 1871 the Brightons moved to Sullivan County, Indiana, where young Nettie attended common school in Sullivan, Indiana, and was raised by her mother after the death of her stepfather. Brighton also attended Ascension Academy, at least through 1875, when she was hired to teach school in Sullivan. In 1878, after two years of teaching, she enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, but left school to marry and did not earn a degree there.Shields and Buchco, pp. 1202‚Äì03. Marriage and family Antoinette Dakin married George W. Leach, a Sullivan businessman, when she was aged twenty and still a student attending Ohio Wesleyan. Prior to their marriage the couple made an agreement, unusual for the time, that gave Antoinette the choice to pursue educational and vocational opportunities of her choice. The couple resided in Sullivan, where George had interests in several businesses and was also a landowner. He fell ill with Bright's Disease in 1917 and died on December 27, 1919, at the age of seventy-one.Shields and Buchco, pp. 1204 and 1216. Antoinette and George Leach had two children. Their daughter, Hortense Eugenia, was born on February 1, 1880; she later married Milton S. Sheplar and moved to New York. Their son, George W. Leach Jr., was born on December 22, 1882, and later resided in New York City.Shields and Buchco, p. 1205. Lydia Dakin Brighton, Antoinette's mother, also lived in the Leach family's home. Legal training In 1884, after the birth of her two children, Leach left her home and children in Sullivan, Indiana, under the care of her husband and mother to attend a law school in Knoxville, Tennessee. Leach received a law degree in 1884 and continued her legal training as a student of the Sprague Correspondence School of Law of Detroit, Michigan, in 1887.Shields and Buchco, p. 1206. Career =Early years= Although Leach began work as a teacher, she began studying stenography around the time of her marriage and became court reporter for the Greene-Sullivan Circuit Court. Leach introduced stenography to the court and taught the subject in her school, which was located near the county courthouse in Sullivan. After completing her legal training Leach continued to work as a court reporter and as the bookkeeper for her husband's business in Sullivan, in addition to work at a local law firm. Leach worked in the law office of John S. Bays for six years and as a court reporter for the Greene-Sullivan Circuit Court until 1893. Leach applied for admission to the Greene County, Indiana, bar on February 14, 1893, in a petition submitted by John Bays, her employer. Although Leach had graduated from law school, had experience as a court reporter, and four members of the Sullivan County bar supported her petition, Greene-Sullivan Circuit Court Judge John C. Briggs, for whom Leach served as a court reporter for six years, denied her petition for admission to the bar.Shields and Buchco, pp. 1206 and 1219‚Äì20. Judge Briggs blocked her from practicing law on the basis that Article 7, Section 21, of the Indiana Constitution and an 1881 state statue described those eligible for admission to the bar had to be a voter, among other qualifications. The judge ruled that Leach did not meet all the qualifications because she was not a voter (women had not yet been granted suffrage in Indiana at that time) and denied her petition to be admitted to the bar. Bays, Leach's attorney, appealed the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court on her behalf. =In re Petition of Leach= In re Petition of Leach, 134 Ind. 665 (1893), the Indiana Supreme Court handed down its decision in a written opinion on June 14, 1893, with Leach winning the appeal of her case. The Indiana Supreme Court reversed the trial court's ruling and ordered that she be admitted to the bar. Justice Leonard J. Hackney, writing on behalf of the court, explained that the Indiana Constitution should not be interpreted as disqualifying nonvoters from becoming lawyers and that women who met all the other qualifications, as Leach did, had the right to practice law. According to the court's ruling, eligibility was intended to include voters, but not to deliberately exclude women. Justice Hackney \\"maintained that women had the same 'right to a choice of vocations' as men did.\\" He also remarked in the court's decision: \\"If nature has endowed woman with wisdom, if our colleges have given her education, if her energy and diligence have led her to a knowledge of the law, and if her ambition directs her to adopt the profession, shall it be said that forgotten fictions must bar the door against her?\\" The decision was unanimous in Leach's favor, but it met with some resistance and surprised some of the attorneys in the state.Seager, pp. 14‚Äì15. The significance of Leach's landmark case was that it legally established women's right to become lawyers in Indiana. The Indiana decision was a progressive one for the time; other state supreme courts, such as Illinois, had denied similar petitions from other women. However, the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling did not make Leach the first woman in Indiana to practice law as some sources have claimed. The Vigo County Circuit Court admitted Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Jane Eaglesfield of Terre Haute, Indiana, on September 8, 1875, and CeDora of Danville, Indiana, was admitted to the Hendricks County Circuit Court in 1886.Seager, p. 15.Shields and Buchco, p. 1219, note 218. Leach's landmark victory set a legal precedent that was used in 1897 as a test case to give Indiana women the right to vote; however, this challenge to the state constitution proved to be unsuccessful when Lafayette, Indiana, lawyer Helen M. Gougar brought suit against the Tippecanoe County, Indiana, elections board after it refused to allow her to vote in the November 1894 elections. In Gougar v Timberlake (1897) Gougar appealed the Tippecanoe County Superior Court's decision in favor of the election board to the Indiana Supreme Court. Gougar argued on her own behalf that voting was natural right for men and women, asserting that the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution assured her that right, regardless of the text in Article 2, section 2, of Indiana's state constitution, which limited the franchise to males aged twenty-one and older. Justice Hackney, again writing on behalf of the Indiana Supreme Court, denied Gougar's appeal. He explained that the Court considered voting a political right, not a natural right, as was the ruling in Leach‚Äôs case, and stated that the state constitution specifically provided voting rights to its male citizens.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 39, 138‚Äì39, and 207‚Äì08. =Law practice= After winning her landmark Indiana Supreme Court case, Leach was sworn in as a member of the Sullivan County bar on October 10, 1893. On June 21, 1894, she was admitted to practice before the Indiana Supreme Court. Leach was admitted to the Indiana State Bar Association in 1909.Shields and Buchco, p. 1207. Leach maintained a general law practice in Sullivan for many years, and from 1911 to 1917 she was a partner in the law firm of Enslow and Leach in Indianapolis. Leach also served twelve years as president of the Sullivan County Bar Association.Seager, p. 15.Shields and Buchco, p. 1212. =Women's suffrage advocate and politician= Leach was initially a member of the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to the party's state convention in 1896, but joined the Progressive Party when it endorsed equal suffrage. Beginning in 1912 Leach served for three years as Sullivan County‚Äôs chair of the Progressive Party.Shields and Buchco, p. 1210. Leach was an active organizer on behalf of women's suffrage, and formed the first \\"effective suffrage club in Sullivan.\\" In 1910 she became state organizer for the National American Suffrage Association and ran for state representative on the Equal Suffrage Party's ticket, receiving ten votes in the November election.Shields and Buchco, pp. 1211‚Äì12. As a strong supporter of women's suffrage, Leach was also an ally of Susan B. Anthony. Alva Belmont, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, described Leach as \\"the most capable advocate of the equal suffrage movement since Susan B. Anthony.\\"Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 208. Leach also founded the Woman Citizen, a monthly publication of Indiana's Equal Suffrage Association, in 1911 and served as its editor for two years.Shields and Buchco, pp. 1213‚Äì15. In February 1911 Leach spoke before the Indiana General Assembly in favor of amending the state constitution to grant women the right to vote. In a resolution she wrote to amend the state constitution in 1911, Leach proposed that the word \\"male\\" be removed from the voting qualifications. After the resolution passed the Indiana House of Representatives, the Indiana Senate shelved it after a third reading due to Indiana governor Thomas R. Marshall's proposed plan for a new state constitution. =Businesswoman= Leach and her husband were involved in local businesses, including a department store called the Golden Rule in Sullivan that she also managed. The store opened around 1906 or 1907, but the venture was unsuccessful and closed within a few years. The Leaches suffered from other business reversals, including her husband's prosecution and conviction for illegal sales of liquor in 1911. Later years Ill health forced Leach to retirement from practicing law in 1917. Following her retirement and her husband's death in 1919, Leach moved to New York to be closer to her children and grandchildren.Shields and Buchco, p. 1216. Death and legacy Antoinette Dakin Leach died at her daughter's home at Oxford, New York, on June 11, 1922, at the age of sixty-three, two years after Indiana women won the right to vote.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 206 and 208. Leach's remains are interred at Center Ridge Cemetery in Sullivan, Indiana. Leach's longtime commitment to the battle for equality, which continued for more than seven decades, her active involvement with the women's suffrage movement, and several leadership roles in local and state politics culminated in successful efforts to attain enfranchisement for women only a few years prior to her death.Shields and Buchco, p. 1230. Most significant is Leach's appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court in 1893. The landmark case broke the gender barrier for admission to the bar in Indiana, securing the women's right to practice law in the state. She is also credited with introducing new technology such as the use of stenography and typewritten documents into the practice of law. Her petition to the Indiana Supreme Court is believed to be one of the first typewritten document submitted to that court. Honors and awards A plaque was erected in 1937 in the rotunda of the Sullivan County Courthouse to honor Leach. In 1993 another tablet was placed in the Sullivan County Courthouse's rotunda to commemorate the centennial of her successful effort to secure women the right to practice law in Indiana. Each year the Indianapolis Bar Association names one of the state's women lawyers as the recipient of the Antoinette Dakin Leach Award.

Whereas the configuration model (CM) uniformly samples random graphs of a specific degree sequence, the SCM only retains the specified degree sequence on average over all network realizations; in this sense the SCM has very relaxed constraints relative to those of the CM (\\"soft\\" rather than \\"sharp\\" constraints). The SCM for graphs of size n has a nonzero probability of sampling any graph of size n, whereas the CM is restricted to only graphs having precisely the prescribed connectivity structure. Model formulation The SCM is a statistical ensemble of random graphs G having n vertices (n=V(G)) labeled {v_j}_{j=1}^n=V(G), producing a probability distribution on mathcal{G}_n (the set of graphs of size n). Imposed on the ensemble are n constraints, namely that the ensemble average of the degree k_j of vertex v_j is equal to a designated value widehat{k}_j, for all v_jin V(G). The model is fully parameterized by its size n and expected degree sequence {widehat{k}_j}_{j=1}^n. These constraints are both local (one constraint associated with each vertex) and soft (constraints on the ensemble average of certain observable quantities), and thus yields a canonical ensemble with an extensive number of constraints. The conditions langle k_j rangle = widehat{k}_j are imposed on the ensemble by the method of Lagrange multipliers (see Maximum-entropy random graph model). Derivation of the probability distribution The probability mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) of the SCM producing a graph G is determined by maximizing the Gibbs entropy S[G] subject to constraints langle k_j rangle = widehat{k}_j,  j=1,ldots,n and normalization sum_{Gin mathcal{G}_n}mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G)=1. This amounts to optimizing the multi-constraint Lagrange function below: : begin{align} & mathcal{L}left(alpha,{psi_j}_{j=1}^nright) [6pt] = {} & -sum_{Ginmathcal{G}_n}mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G)logmathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) + alphaleft(1-sum_{Gin mathcal{G}_n}mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) right)+sum_{j=1}^npsi_jleft(widehat{k}_j-sum_{Ginmathcal{G}_n}mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G)k_j(G)right), end{align} where alpha and {psi_j}_{j=1}^n are the n+1 multipliers to be fixed by the n+1 constraints (normalization and the expected degree sequence). Setting to zero the derivative of the above with respect to mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) for an arbitrary Gin mathcal{G}_n yields : 0 = frac{partial mathcal{L}left(alpha,{psi_j}_{j=1}^nright)}{partial mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G)}= -log mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) -1-alpha-sum_{j=1}^npsi_j k_j(G)  Rightarrow  mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G)=frac{1}{Z}expleft[-sum_{j=1}^npsi_jk_j(G)right], the constant Z:=e^{alpha+1}=sum_{Ginmathcal{G}_n}expleft[-sum_{j=1}^npsi_jk_j(G)right]=prod_{1le i < j le n}left(1+e^{-(psi_i+psi_j)}right) being the partition function normalizing the distribution; the above exponential expression applies to all Ginmathcal{G}_n, and thus is the probability distribution. Hence we have an exponential family parameterized by {psi_j}_{j=1}^n, which are related to the expected degree sequence {widehat{k}_j}_{j=1}^n by the following equivalent expressions: : langle k_q rangle = sum_{Gin mathcal{G}_n}k_q(G)mathbb{P}_text{SCM}(G) = -frac{partial log Z}{partial psi_q} =sum_{j e q}frac{1}{e^{psi_q+psi_j}+1} = widehat{k}_q,  q=1,ldots,n.

Along with her first husband and fellow artist, George Joseph Mess, she was active in the Indianapolis and Brown County, Indiana, arts community. Awarded an honorary doctor of philosophy degree from Colorado State Christian College in 1973, and a recipient of a Sagamore of the Wabash award in 1987, she was also a past president of the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs and a former secretary of the Indiana Artists Club. Her work is represented in several permanent collections that included the Library of Congress, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Indiana State Museum, the Indiana State Library, the Indiana University Art Museum, the Richmond Art Museum, DePauw University, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Early life and education Evelynne Charlien Bernloehr was born on January 8, 1903, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to John A. and Anna B. Bernloehr. John Bernloehr, a jeweler of German ancestry, was a partner with his brother in an Indianapolis jewelry business. Anna Bernloehr was a homemaker of Swiss heritage whose family operated a local bakery. John and Anna Bernloehr enjoyed music and the arts. The Bernloehr family included six children (three girls and three boys), two of whom died in childhood. Bernloehr's surviving siblings were Lenora, Wilmer, and John.DuBois, pp. 2, 9. As a member of a musical family, she learned to play piano and several stringed instruments, including banjo, mandolin, and guitar, but she developed a strong interest in drawing at an early age and aspired to become an artist. Bernloehr attended Indianapolis's public schools. At the age of twelve she received a scholarship to join Indianapolis's John Herron Art Institute's Saturday-morning art classes for children. (The Herron Art Institute was a forerunner to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.) Bernloehr continued to attend weekend classes at Herron through her high school years at Indianapolis's Arsenal Technical High School, where she studied with illustrator Frederick Polley.DuBois, p. 4.Newton and Weiss, pp. 93‚Äì94. She also studied for a year at Indianapolis's Shortridge High School from 1920‚Äì21 before enrolling at Butler University, but left after a year to continue her studies at Herron. Bernloehr spent the next two years (1923‚Äì24) as a full-time student at Herron, where she studied under William Forsyth and Clifton Wheeler, and taught children's art classes in order to earn a teaching certificate in art. She also attended Wayman Adams School of Portrait Painting in New York, the Chicago Art Institute, and √âcole des Beaux Arts.DuBois, p. 6. Marriage and family Bernloehr met her first husband, George Joseph Mess, while assisting with evening art classes at the Herron in 1925. Mess was a commercial artist and one of the students in William Forsyth's drawing class. Bernloehr and Mess were married on April 28, 1925, at her family's home in Indianapolis. Following their marriage the couple set up an art studio in the living room of their home in suburban Broad Ripple. George Mess died in 1962, after suffering nearly two decades of ill health. The couple had no children.DuBois, pp. 9, 17.Newton and Weiss, pp. 94, 97, and 269. ‚ÄúMarriage is wonderful if the persons involved are truly partners, especially if they work together in a field they both love, as George and I did,‚Äù Evelynne said of her husband, George. ‚ÄúWe shared everything we did in art and complemented each other.‚Äù Evelynne Mess met her second husband, Edward Daily, a widower and Eli Lilly and Company retiree, in 1968. They were married the following year and resided in his Brown County, Indiana, home near Nashville. Edward Daily died in 1974.Newton and Weiss, pp. 96‚Äì97. Career After graduating from the Herron Institute of Art in 1924, Bernloehr took a job teaching art at Emmerich Manual High School in Indianapolis, but decided not to renew her teaching contract the following year. In order to maintain her contacts in the Indianapolis arts community, she assisted with the evening art classes at Herron. After her marriage to George Mess in 1925 she worked on her art in their home studio. It was unusual, in that time, for a woman to continue her career after marriage, but Evelynne Bernloehr Mess Daily loved her art too much to give it up.DuBois, pp. 9 and 17. Evelynne Bernloehr Mess Daily‚Äôs artistic interest always lied with etching, inspired by the newspaper drawings of Frederick Polley, who taught her art at Arsenal Technical High School. At the time, however, there were no course offerings in etching. Bernloehr taught herself the art, learning from the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Along with her husband, George, and brother-in-law, Gordon Mess, the trio founded the Circle Art Academy, a commercial art school in Indianapolis in 1927. Although the academy remained in operation until 1932, Evelynne only taught during its first year of operation. Afterwards, she focused fulltime on etching and printmaking. Seeking inspiration and additional art instruction, Evelynne and George Mess spent the summer of 1929 studying at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts at Fontainebleau, France, where she was especially interested in training with an experienced graveur, Achile Ouvr√©. At the end of the summer the couple spent additional time traveling and sketching in France, Switzerland, and Italy, before their return to the United States in the fall.DuBois, p. 20. After the trip Mess resumed her work as an etcher and printmaker. During these early years she created etchings from many of the sketches she had made in Europe, although her preferred method was to draw designs directly onto copper plates and use fast-acting acids to score the freehand work.DuBois, pp. 27‚Äì28. By 1932 she had introduced her husband, George, a trained painter, the medium of etching and taught him the basics of printmaking. While George remained heavily involved in directing and teaching at the Circle Art Academy during the day, Evelynne took over the tedious work of producing prints from his artwork. She also worked as a substitute teacher at Indianapolis schools and during the 1930s became active in several art-related clubs.DuBois, pp. 28, 30. Mess was a member of the Indiana Artists Club, the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs, and the art department of the Indianapolis Woman's Department Club, where she served for several years as chairwoman of its exhibits committee. In 1934 Mess founded the Indiana Society of Printmakers and also organized a print show for the Woman's Department Club.Newton and Weiss, p. 96. She also took on leadership roles as a president of the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs and as secretary of the Indiana Artists Club. In addition, Mess became involved in the Hoosier Salon and the National Society of Arts and Letters, as well as the Brown County Art Gallery and the Brown County Art Guild. In 1937 the Evelynne and George Mess moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he took a job supervising the reproduction of artwork for several magazines and she took classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. The couple returned to Indianapolis in 1940 after he was diagnosed with cancer. In addition to maintaining a home/art studio in Indianapolis, the Messes purchased a farm outside of Nashville in Brown County, Indiana, in 1941. Their rustic weekend retreat was called Oxbow Acres. They also spent three months during the summer of 1944 teaching printing to students attending the Old Mill Art School, a summer school that their friends and fellow artists, Margaret and Wayman Elbridge Adams, had established on property in the Adirondack Mountains near Elizabethtown, New York.Newton and Weiss, pp. 130‚Äì31. To supplement their household income, Evelynne taught at Ladywood School in Indianapolis in 1942‚Äì43 and worked as a substitute teacher for the Indianapolis Public Schools. During the 1950s and 1960s she also taught at the Indianapolis Art League.Newton and Weiss, p. 269. George Mess, who suffered from cancer for more than twenty years, died from the illness on June 24, 1962.Letsinger- Miller and Perry, p. 188. Overwhelmed with grief, Mess spent her first year of widowhood organizing a memorial exhibition of his art. In 1967 Mess realized a longtime dream to open a summer art school at Oxbow Acres, her retreat in Brown County, Indiana. Although the school emphasized printmaking, Mess and occasional guest instructors also offered instruction in painting, drawing, silk screening, and metal engraving, among other arts. The following year she met her second husband, Edward R. Daily, at a Brown County Art Gallery show. They married in 1969 and continued to reside in Brown County; however, after Daily's death in 1974, she returned to the home/art studio in Indianapolis that she had shared with her first husband, George. Evelynne Mess Daily closed her art school and sold Oxbow Acres in 1980. Mess Daily exhibited her etchings and other art at national and international exhibitions held at the Indiana State Fair, the Indiana Artists Club, the Indiana Federation of Arts Clubs, the Hoosier Salon, the Herron Art Institute, the Indiana Society of Printmakers, the Brown County Art Association, the Society of American Etchers, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, among other venues. Later years She suffered from ill health in her later years, undergoing an operation for retinal detachment. In addition, acid damage to her lungs forced her to give up printmaking for two decades. Despite these setbacks Mess Daily continued to exhibit her artwork. Water Fantasy, her rendering of a mermaid, was displayed at the Cincinnati Art Museum in 1990. Death and legacy Evelynne Mess Daily died in Indianapolis on January 9, 2003 at age 100.Newton and Weiss, p. 267. Her remains are interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Evelynne Mess Daily and her first husband, George Joseph Mess, were well known in the Indianapolis and Brown County, Indiana, art communities. Mess Daily is best known as an etcher and printmaker, although she also worked a painter and illustrator. In addition to art, her major legacy was supporting the development and careers of other artists and printmakers, including her husband, and as the founder of the Indiana Society of Printmakers in 1934.

The Cincinnati, Ohio, native began his career as a commercial artist and teacher; however, he became nationally known for his work as an etcher, printmaker, and painter. Along his wife, Evelynne Mess Daily, he became a prominent member of the Indianapolis and Brown County, Indiana, arts communities. Mess produced mostly Impressionist-style landscapes as a painter, but he was especially known for his aquatint etchings and prints of rural scenes in the modern styles of the 1930s and 1940s. Mess was also a founder of the Circle Art Academy, a commercial art school in Indianapolis, Indiana, that operated from 1927 to 1932, and founded a local engraving company. Mess was the recipient of several prizes and awards for his art from the Hoosier Salon, the Herron Art Institute (a forerunner of the Herron School of Art and Design and the Indianapolis Museum of Art), the Indiana State Fair, and various state and local arts clubs. His work is represented in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Indiana Historical Society, and Minnetrista, among others. His illustrations also appeared in several print publications. Early life and education George Joseph Mess was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 30, 1898, to Anna Gleis Mess (1875‚Äì1960) and Joseph J. Mess (1871‚Äì1933). Mess's father was of German heritage; his mother's family was of German and Dutch ancestry. The Mess family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1899, when Joseph Mess took a job as a foreman of the photoengraving department at the Indianapolis News, one of the city's major daily newspapers. George Mess, second of the family's three sons, became interested in art and wanted to become an artist at an early age. At the age of thirteen he received a scholarship to attend Saturday-morning art classes for children at the John Herron Art Institute, a forerunner to the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Mess also attended Indianapolis's public schools, graduating from Emmerich Manual High School in 1916. His two brothers, Arthur and Gordon, also became artists. After Mess graduated from high school he worked as a technician for Western Electric in Indianapolis before joining the U.S. Army in 1918. Although he served during World War I, Mess was never sent overseas. After receiving an honorable discharge from the military, Mess enrolled at Butler University and joined Delta Tau Delta fraternity. While attending Butler he earned extra money by working at a local lumberyard. Mess left Butler after a year and spent a semester at Teachers College, Columbia University, studying art under Arthur Wesley Dow. Mess returned to Indianapolis in 1921.DuBois, pp. 13, 15. Marriage and family Mess met artist Evelynne Bernloehr while attending one of William Forsyth's evening art classes at the Herron Art Institute. Within months of their first meeting, Mess and Bernloehr were married on April 28, 1925, at her family's home in Indianapolis. The couple set up an art studio in the living room of their home in suburban Broad Ripple.DuBois, p. 17. In 1941 they also bought a farm outside Nashville in Brown County, Indiana, to use as a weekend retreat from the city. Evelynne and George Mess had no children. Seven years after Mess's death in 1962, his widow married Edward Daily. Evelynne Mess Daily died on January 9, 2003, at the age of 100.Newton and Weiss, pp. 94‚Äì97, and 267‚Äì69. Career Mess began his artistic career in 1921 as an artist in Indianapolis, where he established a commercial art business with his younger brother, Gordon, and continued his art training in the evening at the Herron Art Institute. In 1927 Mess founded the Circle Art Academy with his wife, Evelynne, and his brother, Gordon. The Mess brothers served as directors and art instructors at the academy. Evelynne Mess taught at the academy during its first year of operation before focusing fulltime on etching and printmaking. After the trio closed the school in 1932, the brothers organized the Circle Engraving Company, where George worked as the head of its commercial art department for the next five years.DuBois, p. 30.Newton and Weiss, pp. 93‚Äì94. During the summer of 1929 George and Evelynne Mess took a break from their work in Indianapolis to study art at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts at Fontainebleau, France. At the end of the summer they spent additional time traveling and sketching in France, Switzerland, and Italy. After their return the United States, Mess resumed his work at the Circle Art Academy and continued to paint on weekends and in the evenings. Mess's wife, a master etcher, introduced him to the medium of etching and taught him the fundamentals. She later assisted him with the technical aspects of his etching and printing work due to his busy schedule as an art teacher and commercial artist.DuBois, pp. 20, 25, 27. In 1931 he was awarded a fellowship from The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation to study in New York. Mess exhibited his art at international exhibitions in Stockholm, Paris, and Rome, as well as at national shows at venue such as the Hoosier Salon, the Herron Art Institute, the Indiana State Fair, the Indiana Artists Club, the Indiana Society of Printmakers, the Society of American Etchers, the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dayton Art Institute, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, among others. Mess's Winter in Indianapolis was part of an international exhibition at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1930. (Mess was one of only forty-eight American painters whose work was included in the exhibition.) Metamora won a prize in 1931 at the Indiana Art Association‚Äôs annual exhibition, the same year that Indianapolis in Snow and Brookside Bridge were exhibited at the Cincinnati Art Museum's 38th Annual Exhibition of American Art. In 1933 Mess and nineteen other Indiana artists exhibited their art at the Century of Progress International Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois. The following year he had a solo exhibition at the Herron Art Institute.DuBois, pp. 27, 30. In 1937 Mess and his wife moved to Chicago, where he took a job supervising the reproduction of artwork for several magazines that included Esquire, Coronet, and Apparel Arts. The Messes returned to Indianapolis in 1940, a year after he was diagnosed with cancer. Despite his ill health, Mess and his wife continued to make their living teaching and selling their art.

Blakely (August 29, 1829April 19, 1920) was an American miner, lawyer, and a Methodist minister. He served as a district attorney, judge, and legislator in Arizona, where he lived the majority of his life. Biography Blakely was born in the Delaware County town of Kortright, New York on August 29, 1829. He was educated first in the local school system, then at the Delaware Academy, and graduated from the New York State Normal School in Albany. In 1849, he left for California in pursuit of riches during the gold rush. After four years of mining, he returned to New York and paid off the mortgage on his father's farm with his mining wealth. He then studied law in Delhi at the office of Amasa J. Parker after which he returned to California, settling in Sonora, where he practiced law and continued mining. In Sonora, he discovered the prosperous Eureka mine in 1858. Blakely was ordained a minister of the Methodist church, receiving a license from the California Methodist Episcopal conference. In 1861, he left California and moved his family to Carson City in the adjacent Nevada Territory where he began the practice of law. He was appointed Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction by Governor James W. Nye in 1861 and was heavily involved in organizing the territory's public school system. Blakely then relocated to Austin where he constructed a Methodist Episcopal Church and served as its pastor. He simultaneously continued mining and developed a stamp mill to treat gold-bearing quartz from the Mother Vein mine. The William G. Blakeley House built in 1887 in Kingman, Az. Blakely then moved to Pioche where he continued mining and practicing law. He also developed mines in Cerbat and Mineral Park in the Arizona Territory. He moved again in 1871 to Kingman, the county seat of Mohave County where he was elected judge of the Mohave county court and later appointed by Governor C. Meyer Zulick as probate judge and superintendent of schools. In 1880, he was first elected Mohave County district attorney, serving until 1904. During this period, Blakely continued his law practice. He was the attorney in Kingman for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, and also represented many other large mines and businesses in the area. In 1893, Blakely was selected to be a permanent representative of Mohave County to the statehood committee. He then became a superior court judge, and representative in the upper house of the 24th Arizona Territorial Legislature of 1907. He introduced a bill to prohibit the sale of alcohol in the territory and another to prohibit \\"the establishment of a saloon within one mile of an educational institution\\". Blakely was an honorary member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and publicly spoke in support of prohibition based on his experiences with alcohol consumption in mining communities. In 1908, Blakely was appointed district attorney again to fill a vacancy caused when the elected district attorney resigned to move to Los Angeles. In 1910, he accepted a pastorship in Kingman, a position he held previously before devoting more time to his other professions. Blakely died on April 19, 1920. The funeral procession from the church to the cemetery was reported to have included \\"the longest line of automobiles ever seen at a funeral\\" in Kingman. Personal On September 5, 1853, Blakely married Susan Elizabeth Wilson from Orange County, New York. Mrs. Blakely was born on August 20, 1829, and died in Kingman on August 20, 1899. They had four sons, including Ross H. Blakely. His eldest son, John E. Blakely, committed suicide in October 1907 at age 37. The suicide was attributed to alcoholism. Blakely's other two sons, William G. Jr and James W., both died in 1899. Blakely's house, built in 1887 and located at 503 Spring Street in Kingman, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986. Blakely was a brother in the Elks Kingman Lodge.

Contents Hazony argues that the nation state is the best form of government that humans have yet invented, contrasting both with historical empires and modern forms of global governance including United Nations affiliated institutions such as the International Court of Justice. In particular, Hazony argues that nationalism uniquely provides, \\"the collective right of a free people to rule themselves.\\" According to Hazony, national identity is based not on race or biological homogeneity, but on \\"bonds of mutual loyalty\\" to a shared culture and a shared history that bind diverse groups into a national unit. Hazony argues that the social cohesion enabled by a nation-state where a common language and history are shared by the majority of the population can produce a level of trust that enables the production of social and moral goods, such as civil and political liberties. He argues that because, in contrast with systems like the European Union where member states are bound by measures taken by the Union, each nation state sets up unique systems, standards and administrative procedures, effectively producing a series of experiments that other nation states can freely copy as they strive for improvement. And he asserts that it is a matter of historical fact that the rights and freedoms of individuals have been protected best by nation-states, especially in England and in the United States. This, in Hazony's view, contrasts sharply with attempts at ‚Äúuniversal political order . . . in which a single standard of right is held to be in force everywhere, tolerance for diverse political and religious standpoints must necessarily decline.‚Äù Hazony argues that globalizing politically progressive elites have promoted a ‚Äúglobal rule of law‚Äù that is intolerant of cultural differences, of patriotism, and of religious faith. Hazony writes that globalists promulgate ‚Äúanti-nationalist hate,‚Äù and are aggressively intolerant of cultural particularism. In Hazony's words, \\"liberal internationalism is not merely a positive agenda. . . . It is an imperialist ideology that incites against . . . nationalists, seeking their delegitimization wherever they appear.\\" =Israel and the European Union= In a juxtaposition that book reviewer Ira Stoll describes as the book's \\"strongest case,\\" for nationalism Hazony discusses the conflicting understanding held by Europeans and by Israelis. In November 1942, as word seeped out of Europe about mass killings of Jewish families, Israel's founding President Ben Gurion said that Jews were being ‚Äúburied alive in graves dug by them,... because the Jews have no political standing, no Jewish army, no Jewish independence, and no homeland.‚Äù The consensus view in Europe is that the Holocaust was caused by German nationalism. Therefore, in Hazony's words, ‚ÄúIt is not Israel that is the answer to the Holocaust, but the European Union.‚Äù Hazony describes the Nazism of the Third Reich as both a distinctive form both of imperialism and of racial supremacism. He states that what the Jews lacked was a Jewish state in which they could have sought refuge. The consensus view among Israelis is that Israel is the most effective response to the Holocaust. Critical reception John Fonte, writing in the National Review, described Virtue as a book \\"that will become a classic.\\" In February 2019, the book won the Paolucci Book Award from the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.https://home.isi.org/conservative-book-year-award Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Justin Vogt called Hazony's narrative a, \\"reductive approach (that) poses a false choice between an idealized order of noble sovereign nations and a totalitarian global government.\\" In Vogt's opinion, \\"The world could use a less moralistic, more nuanced defense of nationalism. This book is a missed opportunity.\\" In that vein, critics of the book largely faulted Hazony's use of terms and categorizations. For instance, one review by Park MacDougald for New York magazine's the Intelligencer commented: ‚ÄúThe book‚Äôs major flaw is that Hazony tends to define his terms as ideal types and then argue from those definitions.‚Äù Likewise, another review by George Washington University professor Samuel Goldman in Modern Age stated that Hazony's argument ‚Äúrests on a confusing and counterproductive use of terms.‚Äù Some reviewers commented that Hazony's theory and defense of nationalism does not appear to take into account the historical body of nationalist thought, possibly to make his position more palatable to his readership. For instance, an essay by Michael Shindler in Jacobite, notes that Hazony's theory is heavily derived from recent scholarship from Israel and the anglosphere (particularly Fania Oz-Salzberger‚Äôs 'The Jewish Roots of Western Freedom,' and Philip Gorski‚Äôs The Mosaic Moment), which depicts \\"nationalism as a descendant of the biblical Israeli model,\\" as opposed to the \\"robust body of nationalist theory that‚Äôs been developing since the 19th century.\\" This lack of engagement, Shindler claims, is \\"conspicuous\\" since that body of literature, though it is \\"quite cogent...admits that nationalism is culpable of precisely what it is accused of by its liberal critics.\\" See also * National conservatism References 2018 non-fiction books Books about nationalism ","title":"The Virtue of Nationalism"},{"id":"58486466","text":"John Mackie (died 3 July 1858) was a British Whig politician.

The direct cause of the conflict was the death of duke Francesco IV Gonzaga of Montferrat and Mantua on 22 December 1612 without male heirs. His brother Ferdinando Gonzaga was a cardinal, but renounced his ecclesiastical career in order to succeed his brother in both the Duchy of Mantua and the Duchy of Montferrat. However, Francesco's wife Margaret of Savoy was the daughter of duke Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy, who claimed Montferrat now fell to his dynasty. Charles Emmanuel invoked the treaty of 1 May 1330 on the occasion of the marriage of Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrat, daughter of Theodore I, Marquess of Montferrat, and Argentine Spinola, with Aymon, Count of Savoy. The treaty stipulated that when the male descendants of the marquis of Montferrat went extinct, those of Yolande (and thus the House of Savoy) would succeed in the marquisate, to provide the daughters with money. Both sides rallied numerous other states to their camps, and the war raged on for four years. Spain and France joined Ferdinando's side, but France would defect to Charles Emmanuel's side in 1615. That year, the Peace of Asti was drawn up, determining that Savoy should relinquish its claims on Montferrat, but the treaty was never signed and the war continued. Eventually, Savoy and Spain finally signed the Peace of Asti in 1617, which confirmed Ferdinando as the legitimate heir of Francesco. When Ferdinando died in 1626, his brother Vincenzo II (1594‚Äì1627), also a cardinal, succeeded him as Duke of Mantua and Montferrat. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals (for violating the celibacy), neither produced any legitimate children.

This policy was justified directly by the Marxist concept of proletarian internationalism and was first articulated by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro at the Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America in 1966. However, as an informal policy it had been adopted as early as 1959, shortly after the Cuban Revolution. It formed the basis for a number of Cuban military initiatives in Africa and Latin America, often carried out in direct conjunction with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact member states which provided advisory or logistical support. These operations were often planned by the Cuban general staff through an overseas headquarters known as an internationalist mission. Military internationalism formed the crux of Cuba's foreign and military policy for almost three decades, and was subordinate only to domestic defense needs. Its support for resistance movements in Central America contributed to Cuba's diplomatic isolation in that region and was instrumental in triggering its suspension from the Organization of American States. Internationalist operations ranged from varying degrees of covert activity and espionage to the open commitment of combat troops on a large scale. The Cuban military presence in Africa was especially notable, with up to 50,000 troops being deployed to Angola alone. For a small country such as Cuba the deployment of 50,000 troops would be the equivalent of the United States deploying more than 1,000,000 soldiers, or Canada more than 100,000. Cuban forces in Africa were mainly black and mulatto. Castro justified the use of the armed forces on the African continent as a result of the debt Cuba owed Africa due to its participation in the Atlantic slave trade and the contributions patriotic black Cubans had made to the Cuban War of Independence. Internationalist missions were perceived by the Cuban government as one means of combating the global influence of the United States by proxy, and Cuba's opponents during these efforts were often decried as American pawns. Likewise, the US government and its allies perceived the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) as a Soviet proxy, and the use of internationalist missions as a means to indirectly increase Soviet military influence worldwide. There were also more practical reasons for deploying Cuban troops abroad, such as giving the relatively inexperienced armed forces combat experience across a wide range of theaters. By the mid 1980s, a quarter of Cuba's total military strength was committed to its internationalist missions, fighting with socialist governments or factions in various civil conflicts. At least 200,000 Cuban citizens had served overseas with the FAR in a number of capacities. Military internationalism ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, which curtailed much-needed Soviet logistical and financial support needed to sustain Cuba's foreign expeditions. The FAR terminated all its major overseas commitments between September 1989 and May 1991. Origin Following the success of the Cuban Revolution, the 26th of July Movement assumed power in Havana and began revising the country's foreign policy. Many of its leading members, including Fidel Castro, believed that Cuba held a special place in the vanguard of international revolutionary movements and began pursuing the active support of revolutionaries in other countries. Castro's interest in revolutionary causes extended beyond Cuba's shores, as he had previously participated in the 1948 Bogotazo riots and was sympathetic towards anti-government forces in the Dominican Republic. Support for revolutions abroad thus became an integral part of the radical new Cuban regime's policies, long before it embraced socialism or diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Approximately 1,000 Cubans fought in Spain in the 1936‚Äì39 Spanish Civil War (nearly all of them in the Communist ranks of the International Brigades). On April 24, 1959, about 80 militants, including a number of Cuban revolutionaries, landed in Panama during a short-lived attempt to overthrow that country's government. The expedition failed and they were arrested after a skirmish with the Panamanian National Guard. Castro held the expedition had been carried out without his foreknowledge and denied all involvement. This led to the establishment of the so-called \\"Panama precedent\\", by which the Cuban government agreed that its support for revolution would not supersede relations with other states that were otherwise friendly (in this case, Panama). However, Castro reserved the right to intervene in any country plagued by tyranny or despotism. List of internationalist operations Cuban artillerymen in Ethiopia during the Ogaden War, 1977. The FAR officially recognizes 5 military interventions of Cuba: in Algeria, Syria, Congo, Angola, and Ethiopia. However other sources expand the list including Nicaragua. This list only includes the sending of Cuban military personnel as regular forces recognized as belligerents between the States. Military invasions are added separately for coup purposes. * 1963: The Sand War in Algeria was the first intervention of Cuban armed forces in foreign territory. Cuba sent 686 men, a battalion of 22 tanks, artillery and mortar groups and a battery of anti-tank guns. * 1973‚Äì1974: During the Yom Kippur War, Syria requested military aid from Cuba and the Cuban government sent two tank brigades that participated in combat operations against the Israeli army. * 1975‚Äì1991: Regular Cuban forces entered Angola in a mission called Operaci√≥n Carlota (Operation Carlota) to support the communist government and participate in the Angolan Civil War and the South African Border War. Cuban troops, supported by Soviet logistics and using sophisticated Soviet weapons, defeated South Africa's armed forces in conventional warfare. Cuban troops also defeated the FNLA and UNITA armies and established MPLA control over most of Angola. Cuban troops allegedly committed atrocities in Angola, including rape, looting, and napalming of civilians with Russian-made rockets. * 1975‚Äì1991: Cuban troops were stationed in Pointe- Noire, Republic of Congo, with the mission of supporting units in Cabinda, Angola. * 1977‚Äì1978: During the Ogaden War, 16,000 Cuban troops‚Äîarmed and transported by Moscow‚Äîentered into Ethiopia to support the Ethiopian socialist government and help defeat an invasion force of Somalians. In retaliation to the Somali invasion, Cuban-Ethiopian forces, directed by Soviet generals Grigory Grigoryevich Varisov and Vasily Ivanovich Petrov, launched a counter- attack in early February 1978, accompanied by a second attack that the Somalis did not expect. A column of Ethiopian and Cuban troops crossed northeast into the highlands between Jijiga and the border with Somalia, bypassing the SNA- WSLF force defending the Marda Pass. Mil Mi-6 helicopters helilifted Cuban BMD-1 and ASU-57 armored vehicles behind enemy lines. The attackers were thus able to assault from two directions in a \\"pincer\\" action, allowing the re- capture of Jijiga in only two days while killing 3,000 defenders. The Somali defense collapsed and every major Somali-occupied town was recaptured in the following weeks. The last significant Somali unit left Ethiopia on 15 March 1978, marking the end of the war. The Somali army, which had taken a severe beating from Cuban artillery and aerial assaults, was destroyed as a fighting force. A large Cuban contingent remained in Ethiopia after the war to protect the socialist government. The presence of a large number of Cuban soldiers with very low pay and easygoing Caribbean sexual habits led to unfortunate incidents with Ethiopian women. * 1979‚Äì1990: In the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua, the Cuban State sent military personnel who took control of the Nicaraguan military security and intelligence services. =Failed invasions= * 1959: Failed expedition to Panama in order to start a revolutionary movement in the country. They were arrested after a skirmish with the Panamanian National Guard. * 1959: Failed expedition to the Dominican Republic to overthrow the government in alliance with Dominican exiles. The ten Cubans and 200 Dominican exiles were massacred just hours after having disembarked. * 1963 and 1967: Failed expeditions to Venezuela in order to overthrow the government together with Venezuelan exiles. The Venezuelan government repelled the invasion by destroying Cuban artillery installed in Venezuelan islands.

Life Anna Maria Ball was born in 1785 at 5 Werburgh Street, Dublin. She was the second daughter of John Ball, a silk merchant, and his second wife Mabel Clare (n√©e Bennett). Ball was educated at St Mary's convent, Micklegate Bar, Yorkshire from July 1800 until 1803. Upon her return to Dublin, she began her philanthropic work. In November 1805, she married a wealthy Dublin merchant, John O'Brien, bringing a dowry of ¬£5000. Ball became friends with Mary Aikenhead from 1807 when she attended the profession of her older sister Cecilia into the Ursulines. Aikenhead regularly visited Ball and her husband at their home on Mountjoy Square, and they would visit the Dublin poor together. She was also a close friend of the future archbishop of Dublin, Daniel Murray, a relationship she used to help Aikenhead in her foundation of the Religious Sisters of Charity. In 1809, she was involved in the establishment of the House of Refuge in Ashe Street, Dublin, and oversaw its move to Stanhope Street in 1814 to be taken over by the new order of the Sisters of Charity. She was a generous patron of the Sisters of Charity, aiding in the fund-raising for St. Vincent's Hospital, with her chaperoning three sisters to Paris to study nursing in 1833. Alongside the sisters, Ball made visits to female prisoners in Kilmainham Gaol and to Jervis Street Hospital. She was appointed the manager to the sisters' school on King's Inns Street, a position she filled until old age prevented her from visiting. Ball also supported the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland which was founded by her youngest sister, Frances Mary Teresa Ball. She provided the funds for the sisters to buy their house on St Stephen's Green. Ball had no children of her own, but she raised the three orphaned children of her elder half-brother, John Ball after his death in 1812. She died on 28 March 1871 at her home in Mountjoy Square, after suffering from senility for two years previously. A portrait of Ball by Nicholas Joseph Crowley from 1845 is held by the Sisters of Charity.

In 2018, California ranked first in the nation as a producer of electricity from solar, geothermal, and biomass resources and fourth in the nation in conventional hydroelectric power generation. As of 2017, over half of the electricity (52.7%) produced was from renewable sources.  Legal renewables requirement  In 2006, the California legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 which set a goal for 33% of electricity consumption in California to be generated by renewable sources by 2020. In 2015, SB350 mandated that electric utilities purchase 50% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Then in 2018, Senate Bill 100 was passed which increased the renewables requirement for electric utilities to 50% by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% by 2045. Significance at national level California's total energy consumption is second-highest in the nation but the state's per capita energy consumption is the fourth-lowest, due in part to its mild climate and its energy efficiency programs. The percentage of renewable energy in California is perhaps made more notable by the particularly high population of the state, states with similar or higher percentages of renewable energy generally have lower populations. In 2009, the energy production in California was 8.43% of the nation's total renewable energy production, the second highest in the country after Washington. By 2017, California was the highest, with 10.05% of national renewable production.  Hydroelectric power generation  Hydroelectric power is power created from the energy of running water. This water is usually stored and controlled by dams. Its productivity changes in accordance to how much rainfall is produced annually. In 2018, California ranked second in the United States for conventional hydroelectric generation, however this is highly variable depending on droughts. For instance it obtained 21% of its electricity through hydroelectric power sources in 2017. This was higher than the previous year when only 14% of its electricity was produced through hydroelectric power. A drought in 2012 led to a reduction in the generation of hydroelectric power. Because of this, in 2014 the Energy Commission of California began to track the conditions on how the drought started. Utilities responded to the decrease in precipitation and lack of hydroelectric power by making short-term market purchases and relying on other renewable sources of electricity. Recovery from the drought started in late 2016, partly due to increased precipitation that restored hydroelectric power to normal conditions. = History of Hydroelectric Power Generation in California = San Bernardino, California became the first western region state to receive a hydroelectric plant in 1887. San Bernardino also received a voltage increase of 10,000 in 1892, from a 42-mile line extension that originated from a single phase 120 kilowatt (kW) plant built in San Antonio Creek, California. While this is occurring in California, in the same year, Edison General Electric and Thomas Houston combine to form General Electric. An ore mill owned by Standard Consolidated Mining, began receiving electricity from a 12.5 mile 2,500 AC power line that originated in Bodie, California. With the first three-phase hydroelectric system being built in Germany back in 1891, the U.S. gets its first three phase system in 1893 in Mill Creek, California: featuring a line connection that extended 8 miles and carried 2,400 volts of electricity. Folsom, California received the same type of system in 1893 as well, except it had 11,000 volt alternators put in place, and its power line extended all the way to the state capitol, Sacramento. The acquisition of Colgate hydroelectric plants in 1899 by Sacramento Power & Light Corporation gives them ownership of a 62 mile long power line extension. In 1901, Bay Counties Power Company builds a 142 mile long power line from the Colgate hydroelectric plant, to Oakland, California. In the 1902 Reclamation act, the authority to install and input hydroelectric facilities was given to what would later become the Bureau of Reclamation. In 1920, the Federal Power Commission is created through the Federal Power Act with the authority to give licenses for companies to build hydroelectric facilities. Two years later in 1922, the first hydroelectric plant is built to meet peaking power capacity. In 1944, Shasta Dam begins producing electricity for the first time in California. The late 1960s and the 1970s ushered in an era of protection policies from the federal government. The first was the 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which stopped any attempt to build hydroelectric facilities on or near rivers. The National Environment Policy Act followed the year after in 1969; and it enforced the idea of protecting the environment amongst the many federal agencies. Then came the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act in 1974, protecting species of fish and wildlife from the activities of the federal government. Four years later, the year 1978 brought about the Public Utility Regulatory Policies act, which allowed utility companies to go without federal licensing for hydroelectric projects. By 2008, the United States gets 6 percent of its electric power from hydroelectric production.  Solar power generation  Solar Power is power generated via the collection of the sunlight exerted from the sun. In 2018, California ranked first in the United States for solar power generation. Over the past eight years, the prices of solar panels and solar power have fallen considerably. In 2010, only about 0.5% of California's electricity came from solar power, although this percentage rose to about 10% in 2016. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar electricity costs about 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, in part due to California's emphasis on solar power. This price is on par with the cost to produce electricity through a natural gas plant and is half of the cost of a nuclear power facility. On December 5, 2018, the California Building Standards Commission voted unanimously to add energy standards to the state building code, officially making California the first state in the United States to require that new homes, built in 2020 and later, be solar powered. In recent years, California's electricity generation from solar power has increased substantially. There have been issues with solar power plants producing too much electricity for the transmission grid to handle and the state to use. In March 2017, California produced so much extra solar power it paid Arizona to take the electricity, saving Arizona substantial amounts of money on electricity. = History of Solar Power Generation in California = Electricity generated from sunlight via silicon solar cells was the invention produced by Bell Laboratories D.M. Chapin, C.S. Fuller and G.L. Pearson in 1954. In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed The Energy Tax Act. This was to counter the Arab Oil Embargo which generated an energy crisis in the U.S. during the 1970s. A 40% tax credit was given to homes that installed solar devices on their homes on or after April 20, 1977 and before January 1, 1986. Even though this policy was rolled back by the Raegan administration, this led to the rise in utility-scale solar systems and turbines in California. The world's largest photovoltaic cell manufacturing facility was built in Camarillo, California by ARCO in 1979. Within a four-year period, ARCO built a facility in the Californian Carrissa Plain, capable of generating 6 megawatts of photovoltaic cells. Later expanded to two megawatts, a 1.0 megawatt photovoltaic power plant was built in the Sacramento Municipality Utility District in 1984. Two years later in 1986, featured in California's Mojave Desert was the largest solar thermal electricity facility. Currently, this same facility generates 300 megawatts of solar thermal energy. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;) built a 500-kilowatt grid-supporting photovoltaic system in Kerman, California. Being 1993, it was the first of its kind \\"distributed power\\" PV installment. In 1996, solar two illustrated how the storing of energy with efficiency could allow power and electricity to be generated even at night. This is why the U.S. Department of Energy and an industry consortium upgraded from solar-one, to solar-two. Also in 1996, the state legislature and Governor Pete Wilson put in place Assembly Bill 1890: which boosted incentives to produce more grid-based PV systems under the direction of the California Energy Commission's Renewable Energy Program, while at the same time weakening state investor-owned electric utilities. Senate Bill 90, which supported the provisions of Assembly Bill 1890, focused the resources of the Energy Commission to renewable energy. Uplifting a self- sustaining market for \\"emerging\\" renewable energy technologies was the objective in Senate Bill 90. = Technology used for Solar Power Generation = The technology behind solar power generation varies, depending on the method being used to generate power. Photovoltaic (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP), and solar heating and cooling (SHC) systems are the three different solar technologies used to generate power. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into power directly. Observed on solar panels, photovoltaic is the more familiar method of technology in regards to solar power. They can be seen on the roofs of homes, in a field next to schools, behind stores, etc. Concentrating solar power (CSP) features massive areas of solar mirrors that indirectly generate power. They are more so used in large scale facilities and campuses like power plants. Solar heating and cooling technology takes heat from the sun and provides for things like water heating, space heating, and more. = How The Process Works = Solar energy is produced in three different ways as mentioned above: via photovoltaic cells (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP), and solar heating and cooling (SHC). In the case of photovoltaic cells, electricity is generated via the absorption of sunlight. The sunlight is converted into electricity by a semi-conductor. The photons, after phasing through the semi-conductor, loses their electrons. Concentrating solar power (CSP) features turbines powered by huge areas of solar mirrors that in turn derive energy from the sun. Solar heating and cooling (SHC) systems can be installed into homes just like other basic installations. Solar water heating provides that a solar collector store heated water, which is warmed by thermal energy from the sun, in a storage tank. Hot or cold, this water can then be used for any residential purposes.  Geothermal power generation  Geothermal power is power generated via the collection of thermal energy, stored over millions of years in the earth's core. In 2017, California ranked first in the United States in geothermal power generation. California is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, with the conjunctions of tectonic plates providing California the largest potential for producing geothermal energy generation in the country. Most of California's geothermal plants are located slightly north of San Francisco in Lake Folsom and Sonoma Counties. This is due to the geysers geothermal resource area, which produces electricity from dry steam. This area has been producing electricity since the mid-1960s, with dry steam in this location existing in only one of two places in the world. There are 43 operating geothermal power plants in California, which produced 11,745 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2017. This in-state generation, combined with 700 GWh of imported geothermal energy, led geothermal energy to contribute 5.69% of the state's total electricity usage in 2017. = History of Geothermal Power Generation in California = In 1847, north of San Francisco, California, a streaming valley containing an area called \\"The Geysers.\\" The area was discovered by William Bell Elliot. A member of John C. Fremonts's survey party, he believed he had found the gates of hell. In 1927, Imperial Valley, California featured the first exploratory wells. They were drilled by the Pioneer Development Company. Thirty-three years later in 1927, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company began the operating the nation's first large-scale geothermal electricity-generating plant. Encompassing an 11 megawatts (MW) productivity of net power, it lasted for three decades. Seal of the U.S. Department of Energy 1970 brought about the both the Geothermal Resources Council and The Geothermal Stream Act. The Geothermal Resources Council was to inspire the development of geothermal resources around the world. The Geothermal Stream Act, established in the U.S. that the Secretary of the Interior have the power to lease federal publicly owned lands to geothermal explorations. The rest of the 1970s saw a rise in geothermal organizations. One of those was The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which was established in 1977. The Imperial Valley in California gets the first electrical development of a water-dominated geothermal resource in 1979. Producing 10 megawatts (MW), 1980 brings about the first geothermal flash plant, producing 10 megawatts (MW) in Brawley, California. It's developed by the Union Oil Company of California (UNOCAL). In 2005, the Energy Policy act evolved America's policy by giving tax incentives for energy production. This made for a more competitive environment for geothermal energy with fossil fuels.  Biomass power generation  Biomass power is power generated by extracting the energy stored in plants and animals. Biomass is all solid, nonhazardous, cellulosic material taken from forested areas. California ranked first in the United States in power generation from biomass in 2017. Biomass-based electricity in California produced 5,767 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2017, contributing to about 2.8 percent of the state's total energy usage. There are 93 operating biomass- based power plants in California. California's biomass power mostly comes from waste-to-energy based power plants. There are four specific types of biomass power generation in California: biomass, digester gas (anaerobic digestion), landfill gas, and municipal solid waste. In addition to these four categories, there is one biomass electricity plant in the state that uses chipped-up forest residue as fuel for electricity generation. Wind power generation California ranked fourth in the United States in wind power generation in 2017, behind Texas, Oklahoma, and Iowa. Wind power in California successfully generated about 13,500 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2016; this contributes to about 6.81 percent of the state's electricity usage. This does not account for homes and farms that use personal turbines to produce power. = History of Wind Power Generation in California = Just like with solar energy, tax incentives from the Energy Tax Act (ETA) of 1978 led to a rise in wind based electrical systems in the state of California. In 1978, wind developers began large wind projects in both Altamont Pass and Tehachapi, California. Three years later in 1981, utilities were required to establish long-term possessions of alternative energy because of a boom in wind energy production, which was caused by the movements and changes made by the California Public Utility Commission. However, by 1985 the need for wind power retracts a little due to the drop in oil prices. So, California utility companies stop contracting deals that involved wind power because the incentive decayed a little. Still, that did not stop the production of wind power in California. In fact, in that same year (1985), productivity was still active enough for a preference on the type of turbine installed by companies. The 56-100 kW machine became the most preferred wind turbine in the United States. Most if not all of those turbines resided in California by 1986, with Altamont Passencompassing 6,200 turbines, and California wind farms having a 1,200 megawatt (MW) total capacity. Technology that, lessens the amount of energy spent and cheapens the costs of turbines, is brought about by Kenetech in 1993. The 2005 Energy Policy Act, like it did the other types of renewable energy sources, effected the capacity to which the U.S. could produce electricity via the wind, by increasing it. By 2015, California is leading the way when it comes to renewable energy, and begins establishing more opportunities to expand the use of wind energy with a 50 percent renewable portfolio standards (RPS).

She was killed by a bullet shot at her by the Guardia Civil during a protest in Tudela, Navarre, against the nuclear station construction program for the Basque Country, and the aircraft firing range of Bardenas. She has since become an important icon of the ecologist movement.  Biography  Gladys del Estal was born in Venezuela to parents exiled during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The family returned home, settling down in Egia, Donostia-San Sebasti√°n. The young Gladys had finished her studies at the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of the Basque Country in 1978, and worked as a programmer in a small computers company.  Death  The anti-nuclear movement called a protest on 3 June 1979 at Tudela, converging with another against the Bardenas aircraft firing range. The Civil Guard took positions in Tudela and charged against the 4,000 marchers who turned out at the demonstration. As marchers fled, a number of them decided to sit down at the bridge against repression, with Gladys among them. A Civil Guard squad approach them, with one of them brandishing an automatic rifle, who shot at the back of the head of the young activist, causing her immediate death. The author of the shot was judged, receiving a sentence of 18 months imprisonment in December 1981 for \\"reckless endangerment\\", since the tribunal in Pamplona deemed his action was 'unintended'. Just the opposite, fellow ecologist activists who prefer to remain anonymous state that the officer Jos√© Mart√≠nez Salas would direct an obscene comment at her, for which she insulted him. The officer retorted by shooting at her. Under Spanish premier Felipe Gonzalez, the shooter was awarded the Cross of Military Merit.  Memory  A memorial was erected in remembrance of Gladys del Estal at the site where she was killed one year on; it read Gladys gogoan zaitugu (Basque for \\"Gladys we hold you in our memory\\"); still it was removed by the Civil Guard. A demonstration was held where protesters chanted slogans against the power company Iberduero and the police forces, at a time of intense violent activity pursued by ETA, police forces acting beyond official missions, and paramilitary groups. The organizers also planted a Basque flag with a black ribbon. The governmental authority reported the organizers for not sticking to the schedule and showing \\"punishable slogans and attitudes\\". She has a memorial in the Cristina Enea Park in Donostia (San Sebasti√°n). 38 on after her death a tribute was staged at the site of her memorial. A footbridge in the city also bears her name.

The Parker Solar Probe with WISPR on board was launched by a Delta IV Heavy on 12 August 2018 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WISPR is intended take advantage of the spacecraft's proximity to the Sun by taking coronagraph-style images of the solar corona and features like coronal streamers, plumes, and mass ejections. One of the goals is to better understand the structure of the solar corona near the Sun. WISPR is designed to study the electron density and velocity structure of the corona. The instrument field of view is planned to extend from 13 to 108 degrees away from the Sun, and does not directly image the Sun; the area of interest is a very wide field extending away from the Sun.

Blockson (born December 16, 1933) is an American historian, author, bibliophile, and collector of books, historical documents, art, and other materials related to the history and culture of African Americans, continental Africans, and the African diaspora throughout the rest of the world. He curated two university collections related to the study of African-American history and culture: the Charles L. Blockson Collection of African-Americana and the African Diaspora at Pennsylvania State University and the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University. Early life and education  Born on December 16, 1933, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Charles Leroy Blockson is the oldest of eight children born to Charles and Annie Blockson. During a history lesson his fourth grade teacher, a white woman, asserted that \\"Negroes have no history. They were born to serve white people.\\" Blockson went home and told his parents, who assured him that black people do have a history and taught him about prominent African-American men and women. That statement launched Blockson's lifelong journey to unearth, collect, and preserve the history, culture and contributions of African descendants. Book collecting excursions led Blockson to the Salvation Army, antique shops, church bazaars, and Philadelphia, where he discovered many book stores. Blockson became well-known among book and artifact dealers, and his passion for collecting ultimately has taken him around the world, inspired him to write books, and made him one of the foremost experts on the Underground Railroad. Educated in Norristown Area School District, Blockson excelled in athletics, including football and track and field. A star athlete at the Norristown High School and Penn State University, he won state and national honors, and participated in the Penn Relays. While in high school and college, he would go to bookstores when traveling to participate in sports events. Blockson is a 1956 graduate of Pennsylvania State University and has three honorary doctorate degrees from Lincoln University, Holy Family University, and Villanova University. Career Blockson is a co-founder of the African American Museum in Philadelphia; founding member of the Pennsylvania Black History Committee of the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission; past president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society; former chairman of the National Park Service Underground Railroad Advisory Committee; and former director of the Philadelphia African American Pennsylvania State Marker Project (the largest African-American marker program in the United States). Among his proudest moments was the commemoration of the Pennsylvania Slave Trade marker at Penn's Landing near the Independence Seaport Museum, unveiled in 2016. Blockson retired from Temple University in 2006 and serves as Curator Emeritus of the Afro-American Collection. = The Charles L.

Credential Guard was introduced with Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. As of Windows 10 version 20H1, Credential Guard is only available in the Enterprise edition of the operating system. Summary After compromising a system, attackers often attempt to extract any stored credentials for further lateral movement through the network. A prime target is the LSASS process, which stores NTLM and Kerberos credentials. Credential Guard prevents attackers from dumping credentials stored in LSASS by running LSASS in a virtualized container that even a user with SYSTEM privileges cannot access. The system then creates a proxy process called LSAIso (LSA Isolated) for communication with the virtualized LSASS process. Bypass techniques There are several generic techniques for stealing credentials on systems with Credential Guard: * A keylogger running on the system will capture any typed passwords. * A user with administrator privileges can install a new Security Support Provider (SSP). The new SSP will not be able to access stored password hashes, but will be able to capture all passwords after the SSP is installed. * Extract stored credentials from another source, as is performed in the \\"Internal Monologue\\" attack (which uses SSPI to retrieve crackable NetNTLMv1 hashes).

The Diamond Rubber Company was incorporated in March of 1894 in Akron, Ohio by the owner of the Diamond Match Company, O.C. Barber. Barber had moved the match company plant to his adjacent self-named planned town of Barberton, Ohio in order to boost the town's economy which had taken a hit during the Panic of 1893. He decided to use the abandoned Diamond Match Company facility in Akron for his new rubber products factory. The Diamond Rubber Company was located in the southwestern part of Akron, adjacent to the Ohio and Erie Canal, on the southwest side of Falor Street. The B.F. Goodrich plant was located across the street, on the northeast side of Falor. Today, Falor Street is named West Falor Street. Some later sources have the company founded as the Sherbondy Rubber Company in 1893 or 1894 with its name changing to Diamond Rubber Company in 1896. But no such listing is found for Sherbondy Rubber Company in the Akron city directories for those years, or any years. Instead, it is the Diamond Rubber Company that first appears in the 1894 Akron city directory, which also includes the information that it was incorporated in March of that year. However, according to the publication The Growth of an Ideal, Embracing the History of the Goodrich Company, and the Economy of Factory and Branch Organization and Operation, by the B.F. Goodrich Company in 1918 (part of the Goodrich Employees Reading Course), \\"The removal of the Diamond Match Company to Barberton left vacant the buildings occupied in Akron, and in 1894, Mr. Ohio C. Barber, then President of the Diamond Match Company, with his associates incorporated the Sherbondy Rubber Company, whose home was to be the discarded plant of the match company...\\". \\"In 1896 Mr. Barber took a more active interest in the company and the name was changed to the Diamond Rubber Company. According to the 1894 Akron City Directory's Incorporated Companies section, the Diamond Rubber Company first appeared at the Falor location previously occupied by the Diamond Match Company, with G.

Born out of Labour's struggles with the left of the party, it sees itself as protecting the tradition of the \\"old Labour right\\". It organises petitions, endorses likeminded candidates, and runs events. History The original Labour First formed in 1980 as a grouping of MPs on the right of the Labour Party who, while politically aligned with fellow Labour right faction, The Manifesto Group, desired a more collegiate party and thought that the bitter left-right factional battles of the 1970s and 1980s were damaging the party's electoral prospects. The group's chair was Brynmor John and its secretary was Edmund Marshall. By 1983 the grouping had effectively merged into the Labour Solidarity Campaign, the successor to The Manifesto Group. In late 1987, the Labour Solidarity Campaign was in the process of winding itself up, believing that it had won its fight against the hard left. A core of Labour Solidarity activists centred around John Spellar argued that there was a need to continue to organise and with Brynmor John's permission, continued under the Labour First name, thus founding the current incarnation of Labour First. Aims and views Labour First aims to keep the Labour Party safe from the influence of what it calls the \\"organised Hard Left\\", such as Momentum, ensuring that moderate voices are heard and thus ensuring that Labour remains as electable as possible in the Westminster parliamentary system through policies that make a difference for ordinary people. It calls these aims \\"Clause One Socialism\\", after Clause One of the Labour Party constitution, which sets the Labour Party's aims as maintaining a Labour Party in parliament. It also represents the historic pro-NATO, pro-United States and pro-nuclear deterrent tradition in the party, and was historically pro-European Union. Recently it has become more neutral on the subject of EU membership, as a number of MPs aligned with it sit in seats that voted heavily to leave the EU in the 2016 Referendum and thus have chosen to respect their constituents' wishes. In 2018, its secretary, Luke Akehust called on \\"the historically mainstream wing\\" to fight in \\"saving Labour and restoring it to decency\\". Structure and activities Labour First is an network of freely associating Labour Party members who share their personal contact details with the organisation. It maintains a network of volunteer local organisers. In 2016, the Birmingham Mail identified MPs John Spellar, Tom Watson and Ian Austin as having links with Labour First, and reported it as describing itself as \\"a network of Labour moderates fighting against Momentum and other Hard Left groups to keep Labour as a broad-based and electable party\\". MP Khalid Mahmood has also attended Labour First events. Its secretary is Luke Akehurst, director of BICOM's We Believe in Israel project. In 2017, Labour First employed its first full-time national organiser. In 2019, a digital organiser was also employed. It organises petitions, endorses moderate candidates in Labour Party elections, and runs a series of meet-ups and events both at Labour Party conference and in the country at large. It is funded through individual donations from Labour Party members. Links with Progress Historically, Labour First had little connection with Progress, a more recent Labour party factional organisation on the right of the Labour party, originally associated with New Labour. The rise of Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum in the Labour Party saw Progress and Labour First, while remaining distinct organisations with different traditions, carry out more joint activities, including joint endorsement of candidates in internal party elections. During the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, Labour First formed a joint venture with Progress called Reclaiming Labour, holding meetings around the country analysing why Labour lost heavily in the 2019 United Kingdom general election. In April 2020, immediately on the election of Keir Starmer as party leader, Labour First and Progress launched jointly a new umbrella organisation called ‚ÄòLabour to Win‚Äô, with goals including 'to bring about fundamental change in the party‚Äôs culture and organisation '. Labour To Win endorsed candidates in the 2020 Labour National Executive Committee elections, however owing to the newly adopted Single Transferrable Vote nature of the elections, and in the spirit of electing a pluralisitic NEC, the organisation chose only to endorse six of its own candidates and also to endorse three candidates politically more to the left than Labour To Win but who had a commitment to broad church Labour politics.

The House of Charity started during a time when Cuba was experiencing extreme poverty, unemployment, and corruption in the government. Corrupt leaders were plundering the public treasury and little attention was given to social assistance, health, education, or the protection of the poor: \\"los desamparados\\". Corruption Cuba had suffered from widespread and rampant corruption since the establishment of the Republic in 1902. The book Corruption in Cuba states that public ownership resulted in \\"a lack of identifiable ownership and widespread misuse and theft of state resources... when given opportunity, few citizens hesitate to steal from the government.\\" Furthermore, the complex relationship between governmental and economic institutions makes them especially \\"prone to corruption.\\" The question of what causes corruption in Cuba presently and historically continues to be discussed and debated by scholars. Jules R. Benjamin suggests that Cuba's corrupt politics were a product of the colonial heritage of Cuban politics and the financial aid provided by the United States that favoured international sugar prices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Following the Second World War, the level of corruption in Cuba, among many other Latin American and Caribbean countries, was said to have risen significantly. Some scholars, such as Eduardo S√°enz Rovner, attribute this to North America's increased involvement in Cuba after the First World War as it isolated Cuban workers. Cubans were excluded from a large sector of the economy and unable to participate in managerial roles that were taken over by United States employers. Along similar lines, Louis A. P√©rez has written that ‚ÄúWorld War Two created new opportunities for Cuban economic development, few of which, however, were fully realized. Funds were used irrationally. Corruption and graft increased and contributed in no small part to missed opportunities, but so did mismanagement and miscalculation.‚Äù  History  The mothers, who abandoned their child for economic reasons or because of the shame of being a single mother, could deliver their child through a Baby hatch without showing their face or revealing their identity. The Real Casa de Maternidad y Beneficencia emerged as a product of several transitions between \\"La Casa Cuna,\\" the \\"Real Casa de Maternidad\\", and finally \\"La Casa de Beneficencia.\\" It was not until 1794 during the government of Luis de las Casas that the Beneficencia was located in its final location in Barrio San Lazaro at the corners of San Lazaro and Belasco√°in. The Casa Cuna was founded in 1687 by Bishop Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela. His death left the orphanage unfinished due to lack of resources to carry out his efforts. His successor, Bishop Fray Ger√≥nimo de Nosti y Vald√©s, took up his idea and restored the Casa Cuna in a building he built on the corner of Oficios and Muralla. It originally housed two hundred orphans. In the year 1792, Don Luis de Pe√±alver, on the initiative of the Countess of Jaruco, the Marquises of C√°rdenas de Monte Hermoso, the Marquis of Casa Pe√±alver and the Bishop of the Provinces of Louisiana and Florida, founded the \\"Real Casa de Beneficencia.\\" It accepted only females, settling in a cavalry room of land located in front of the San L√°zaro cove, which was an area known as the Betancourt Garden that the Bishop of Pe√±alver gave for this purpose. They offered to contribute 36 thousand pesos, requesting the governor to manage the royal approval and suggest the land in front of the Caleta de San L√°zaro with a view to the sea and running waters. Antonia Mar√≠a Menocal, a lady of Havana, left at the time of her death in 1830 a large legacy to be invested in charitable works. The executor assigned it to the creation of a Maternity House and for the preservation and education of children up to the age of six. Marcial Dupierris in 1857 wrote: \\"The Real Casa de Beneficencia, which is also in the neighborhood of San Lazaro, is a large building, whose front faces the street Wide North, its side E. is on the road of Belascoa√≠n, and extends to the S to face with the house of health of San Leopoldo, said Real establishment, is the refuge of the orphans of both secured . He is educated and supported until the age when he allows them to be applied to any kind of work. In one of the departments of their dependency there are the insane; in another the Cradle house‚Äîthat is, in the spitting room. Those different departments are entrusted to the care of people who enjoy the best reputation. Of getting married, they receive a dowry of five hundred pesos that the house gives them, and when they are placed for the service of private homes, it is with the preceding report and recommendation of good reputation and morality of the people to whose care they are delivered.\\" La Casa de Maternidad was added to the Beneficiencia on the initiative of Spanish Governor Manuel Guti√©rrez de la Concha, who administered the island from 1850 to 1852. La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad was administered by the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de Amigos del Pa√≠s. In 1914, the State assumed the institution which continued to survive on the alms and the service of the Daughters of Charity of Cuba. The Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital, the largest health facility in the country, was built in place of the former La Casa de Beneficencia. = Tradition = thumb The orphanage's dormitoryChildren who had no last name were given the surname Vald√©s upon entering the charity. The name derived from Bishop Fray Ger√≥nimo de Nosti y Vald√©s, successor of Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela. Bishop Fray Ger√≥nimo de Nosti y Vald√©s is buried at Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, Havana in La Habana Vieja. Mothers who abandoned their children for economic reasons or for the shame of being a single mother, could deliver them without showing their face or revealing their identity. Ciro Bianchi Ross wrote: \\"For that, in the side fa√ßade of the building that faced the Belascoa√≠n Road, there was the lathe; the infant was placed in it and the deposit was turned at the touch of a bell, and on the other side the abandoned child received a nun from the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, a congregation that served that semi-private institution that tried to supply the official lack of attention in its attempt to redeem evils that the State did not suppress or remedy...\\" The nuns were of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paulo (Hermanas de la Caridad de San Vicente de Paulo), the congregation that served La Casa de Beneficencia. =Baby hatch= Foundling wheel at the \\"Ospedale Santo Spirito\\" in Rome Baby hatches have existed in one form or another for centuries. The system was quite common in medieval times. From 1198 the first foundling wheels (ruota dei trovatelli) were used in Italy; Pope Innocent III decreed that these should be installed in homes for foundlings so that women could leave their child in secret instead of killing them, a practice clearly evident from the numerous drowned infants found in the Tiber River. A foundling wheel was a cylinder set upright in the outside wall of the building, rather like a revolving door. Mothers placed the child in the cylinder, turned it around so that the baby was inside the church, and then rang a bell to alert caretakers. One example of this type which can still be seen today is in the Santo Spirito hospital at the Vatican City; this wheel was installed in medieval times and used until the 19th century. In Hamburg, Germany, a Dutch merchant set up a wheel (Drehladen) in an orphanage in 1709. It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. Other wheels are known to have existed in Kassel (1764) and Mainz (1811). Foundling wheel at the \\"Ospedale degli Innocenti\\" in Florence In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. Foundling wheels were legalised in an imperial decree of January 19, 1811, and at their height, there were 251 in France, according to author Anne Martin- Fugier. They were in hospitals such as the H√¥pital des Enfants-Trouv√©s (Hospital for Foundling Children) in Paris. However, the number of children left there rose into the tens of thousands per year, as a result of the desperate economic situation at the time, and in 1863 they were closed down and replaced by \\"admissions offices\\" where mothers could give up their child anonymously but could also receive advice. The tours d'abandon were officially abolished in law of June 27, 1904. Today in France, women are allowed to give birth anonymously in hospitals (accouchement sous X) and leave their baby there. In Brazil and Portugal, foundling wheels (roda dos expostos/enjeitados, literally \\"wheel for exposed/rejected ones\\") were also used after Queen Maria I proclaimed on May 24, 1783, that all towns should have a foundling hospital. One example was the wheel installed at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital in S√£o Paulo on July 2, 1825. This was taken out of use on June 5, 1949, declared incompatible with the modern social system after five years' debate. A Brazilian film on this subject, Roda Dos Expostos, directed by Maria Em√≠lia de Azevedo, won an award for \\"Best Photography\\" at the Festival de Gramado in 2001. Foundling Hospital in London In Britain and Ireland, foundlings were brought up in orphanages financed by the Poor Tax. The home for foundlings in London was established in 1741; in Dublin the Foundling Hospital and Workhouse installed a foundling wheel in 1730, as this excerpt from the Minute Book of the Court of Governors of that year shows: :\\"Hu (Boulter) Armach, Primate of All-Ireland, being in the chair, ordered that a turning-wheel, or convenience for taking in children, be provided near the gate of the workhouse; that at any time, by day or by night, a child may be layd in it, to be taken in by the officers of the said house.\\" The foundling wheel in Dublin was taken out of use in 1826 when the Dublin hospital was closed because of the high death rate of children there.  Building  The building commanded certain moral and strategic positions in its philanthropic and charitable mission of providing aid to unwanted children, and in its geographic location as the first building of the first new city lot in the Barrio de San L√°zaro. The Casa de Beneficencia eventually reached from Calles San Lazaro and Belasco√°in to Marquez Gonzalez and Virtudes where the Jai alai fronton was located. \\"Beneficencia had two gates, the front that overlooked San L√°zaro street with a large garden. The right part of that building (facing north), corresponded to the chapel that was always open to the public. To the left of the main entrance were the school offices followed by the barbershop and other workshops. The students were never in those gardens where there was only the possibility of visual contact with them. The other gate that served as access to the vehicles only, was in the back of the school, that is, in Virtudes street between Belascoa√≠n and Lucena. On the right (always facing north), part of the building was located dedicated to the classrooms and on its left was the hospital. This school was converted into a barracks...they took us out of there to turn it into the Antonio Maceo military school.\\" The Casa de Beneficencia eventually reached from Calles San Lazaro and Belasco√°in to Marquez Gonzalez and Virtudes where the jai alai fronton was located.

The organization was established in 1988 during the apartheid era to litigate on behalf of people who were oppressed by the government and continues to operate today. According to the newspaper The Namibian, the lawyers and paralegals who opened the centre \\"were immediately flooded with cases from people complaining about human rights abuses\\" and hundreds of court cases were launched against the apartheid South African government. The centre continues to conduct public interest litigation and expanded its mandate to incorporate public human rights education, research, law reform and free legal advice. Its work is guided by a board of directors. Since Namibia's independence, the organization's areas of focus have included: * police brutality * immigration * women's rights * children's rights * people living with HIV * indigenous populations * prisoners * land rights * inheritance *LGBT issues History The history of the Legal Assistance Centre is embedded in Namibia's struggle to end South Africa's apartheid occupation and brutal rule of the country. In the 1980s, the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) was making progress in their fight for an independent state. However, human right violations and the use of apartheid era law continued to justify inhumane, degrading and discriminatory practices. On the legal front, lawyer Dave Smuts began pursuing public interest cases against the apartheid government. In 1987, Dave Smuts worked with churches in northern Namibia to successfully challenge the detainment of a group who had been held in prison without trial for several years. They were successful and together Smuts and church leaders began helping people obtain legal aid and spread information about laws. In July 1988, the Legal Assistance Centre was officially opened in Ongwediva in northern Namibia by Dave Smuts and a group of lawyers and paralegals. The Legal Assistance Centre's founding was based on the principle of taking public interest legal cases to court and providing free services to clients. Additional offices were set up in Windhoek, Tsumeb, Walvis Bay and Rundu. Nearly 500 cases were handled by the organization in its first hear of operation, the vast majority involving human rights abuses (assault, rape, detention) perpetrated by security forces. Labour cases (unfair dismissal, non payment of wages, workmen's compensation claims) were also brought to court in the Centre's first year. Notable cases The Legal Assistance Centre has initiated a number of civil cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary awards on behalf of its clients. The Legal Assistance has also filed suits related to the conditions of incarceration for adults and children. =Sterilization of HIV positive women= The Legal Assistance Centre represented HIV positive women who were sterilized while at a state hospital. The women claimed the sterilization occurred without their informed consent by doctors employed at state hospitals. In 2012, LM&MI;&NH; versus the government of the Republic of Namibia, the women won their case at the High Court and awarded the women 1.2 million Namibian dollars in damages. The ruling was appealed to the Namibian Supreme Court, which held the High Court ruling.

Career  Born in Neckarsteinach, Valentin Peter Feuerstein was the son of a commercial painter and grew up in a Catholic family. After he completed his apprenticeship to be a painter like his father, he was drafted into the Arbeitsdienst in 1938, and afterwards into the Luftwaffe. He was posted to Munich, where he was able to study at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen. When he spent time in Italy during World War II, he was inspired to focus on artistic painting instead of taking over his father's business. After the war, he first worked as a restoration artist. In 1948, he rediscovered an altar in Windsheim which he was able to attribute to Tilman Riemenschneider. Feuerstein focused on stained-glass windows for churches, making his first window in 1955 for a funeral chapel in his hometown, titled \\"Die Engel des J√ºngsten Gerichts\\" (The angels of the Last Judgment). In a long career, he created around 840 windows in 139 locations, including five windows for the Ulmer M√ºnster (19791986) and a rosette at the Freiburger M√ºnster (1971). A 1985 window in the Ulmer M√ºnster depicts the mathematicians and physicists Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Feuerstein produced a cycle of windows at the Dom des Frankenlandes in W√∂lchingen, another for the , and a third in the √úberwasserkirche in M√ºnster. The seven windows in M√ºnster are mostly in the choir of the Gothic church and focus on biblical themes. Feuerstein created windows in the Protestant in Bahlingen. In in Pforzheim, which was destroyed in World War II, he created windows related to the history of the town. In 1990, Feuerstein was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He died in Heidelberg.

He fought in support of the Greek independence from Turkey as a volunteer in the United States Navy. Lord Byron died in Missolonghi in Allen‚Äôs presence. He volunteered with the Texans, first with the Tampico Expedition in 1835, and with the Texas Army after he returned from Mexico late in the year. He received a commission as captain of an infantry unit and participated in the Battle of San Jacinto. He assumed command of a naval ship after independence and headed a recruiting mission in the United States until his release from service on December 2, 1836. The Republic of Texas granted to him a league and labor for his military service. Allen was the first mayor of Galveston, Texas, elected for the post first in 1839. He served consecutive one-year terms through 1846. He became a party to a charter war in 1840 when he transported the Galveston archives to his home. He withstood a challenge by Samuel May Williams and other persons with financial interests in the Galveston City Company.

Early life and education  Angie Morrill was born in 1965 in Portland, Oregon. Her mother is Peggy Jo Ball who is Modoc and Klamath. She grew up in North Portland and attended Jefferson High School. In 2005, Morrill earned her B.A in Ethnic Studies from the University of Oregon. In 2016, she earned her Ph. D from University of California San Diego in Ethnic Studies with a focus on Native feminist methodologies. Her dissertation, Towards A Native Feminist Reading Practice, uses family and tribal sources to explore the importance of Native feminist thought in Native studies. Morrill was also awarded a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Native American Studies at University of Davis California.  Work in academia  Morrill is considered a Native feminist and her work examines history, memory, haunting and violence through a Native feminist lens. She focuses on Native feminist methodologies which frame Native Feminist Theory (Indigenous Feminism). In 2013, Morrill collaborated with Maile Arvin and Eve Tuck on their article \\"Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections Between Settler Colonialism and Heteropatriarchy\\" which was published by Johns Hopkins University Press. This article focuses on ways to challenge the connections between settler colonialism and heteropatriarchy from an Native feminist theory perspective. In 2016, Morrill collaborated once more with Eve Tuck and the Super Futures Haunt Collective on their article, \\"Before Dispossession, or Surviving It\\" which was published in Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies.

The most significant feature of the pCN algorithm is its dimension robustness, which makes it well-suited for high- dimensional sampling problems. The pCN algorithm is well-defined, with non- degenerate acceptance probability, even for target distributions on infinite- dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a consequence, when pCN is implemented on a real-world computer in large but finite dimension N, i.e. on an N-dimensional subspace of the original Hilbert space, the convergence properties (such as ergodicity) of the algorithm are independent of N. This is in strong contrast to schemes such as Gaussian random walk Metropolis‚ÄìHastings and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm, whose acceptance probability degenerates to zero as N tends to infinity. The algorithm was introduced in 2013 by Cotter, Roberts, Stuart and White, and its ergodicity properties were proved a year later by Hairer, Stuart and Vollmer. Description of the algorithm =Overview= The pCN algorithm generates a Markov chain (X_{n})_{n in mathbb{N}} on a Hilbert space mathcal{H} whose invariant measure is a probability measure mu of the form :mu(E) = frac{1}{Z} int_{E} exp(- Phi(x)) , mu_{0} (mathrm{d} x) for each measurable set E subseteq mathcal{H}, with normalising constant Z given by :Z = int_{mathcal{H}} exp(- Phi(x)) , mu_{0} (mathrm{d} x) , where mu_{0} = mathcal{N}(0, C_{0}) is a Gaussian measure on mathcal{H} with covariance operator C_{0} and Phi colon mathcal{H} to mathbb{R} is some function. Thus, the pCN method applied to target probability measures that are re- weightings of a reference Gaussian measure. The Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is a general class of methods that try to produce such Markov chains (X_{n})_{n in mathbb{N}}, and do so by a two-step procedure of first proposing a new state X'_{n + 1} given the current state X_{n} and then accepting or rejecting this proposal, according to a particular acceptance probability, to define the next state X_{n + 1}. The idea of the pCN algorithm is that a clever choice of (non-symmetric) proposal for a new state X'_{n + 1} given X_{n} might have an associated acceptance probability function with very desirable properties. =The pCN proposal= The special form of this pCN proposal is to take :X'_{n + 1} = sqrt{ 1 - beta^{2} } X_{n} + beta Xi_{n + 1} , :Xi_{n + 1} sim mu_{0} text{ i.i.d.} or, equivalently, :X'_{n + 1}  X_{n} sim mathcal{N} left( sqrt{ 1 - beta^{2} } X_{n} , beta C_{0} right) . The parameter 0 < beta < 1 is a step size that can be chosen freely (and even optimised for statistical efficiency). One then generates Z_{n + 1} sim mathrm{Unif}([0, 1]) and sets :X_{n + 1} = X'_{n + 1} text{ if } Z_{n + 1} leq alpha(X_{n}, X'_{n + 1}) , :X_{n + 1} = X_{n} text{ if } Z_{n + 1} > alpha(X_{n}, X'_{n + 1}) . The acceptance probability takes the simple form :alpha(x, x') = min ( 1 , exp ( phi(x) - phi(x') ) ). It can be shown that this method not only defines a Markov chain that satisfies detailed balance with respect to the target distribution mu, and hence has mu as an invariant measure, but also possesses a spectral gap that is independent of the dimension of mathcal{H}, and so the law of X_{n} converges to mu as n to infty. Thus, although one may still have to tune the step size parameter beta to achieve a desired level of statistical efficiency, the performance of the pCN method is robust to the dimension of the sampling problem being considered. =Contrast with symmetric proposals= This behaviour of pCN is in stark contrast to the Gaussian random walk proposal :X'_{n + 1} mid X_n sim mathcal{N} left( X_n, beta Gamma right) with any choice of proposal covariance Gamma, or indeed any symmetric proposal mechanism. It can be shown using the Cameron‚ÄìMartin theorem that for infinite-dimensional mathcal{H} this proposal has acceptance probability zero for mu-almost all X'_{n+1} and X_n. In practice, when one implements the Gaussian random walk proposal in dimension N, this phenomenon can be seen in the way that * for fixed beta, the acceptance probability tends to zero as N to infty, and * for a fixed desired positive acceptance probability, beta to 0 as N to infty.

At that time, the soloist was Vasyuta. In album releases, he is listed as the author of the songs. In the middle 1990s, Maslov made an attempt to create a group with the same name. They released two albums with the vocals of Samoshin and Ruslan Maslov (Vladimir's son). Vasyuta took Maslov to court and won the case; the next album of Maslov-Samoshin team did not mention Sweet Sleep. Vasyuta continues to promote the group. He releases albums and tours.

After landing at the island of Naxos, some of the sailors brought a beautiful sleeping boy on board with them. They had found him on the island and wished to take him with them. Acoetes, who recognized in the boy the god Bacchus, was unable to dissuade them from it. When the ship had reached the open sea, the boy awoke, and desired to be carried back to Naxos. The sailors promised to do so but did not keep their word. Hereupon the god showed himself to them in his own majesty: Vines began to twine round the vessel, and Bacchus stood crowned with grapes, holding his thyrsus (a staff with a pine cone on top, wrapped with vines and ivy leaves) and surrounded by panthers and tigers.

Sha-Amun-en-su was a Heset, i.e., a member of the foremost group of singers with ritualistic functions active in the temple of Amun. After her death, which is estimated to have occurred around the age of 50, the singer was mummified and placed in a sarcophagus made of stucco and polychrome wood. Since its sealing, more than 2700 years ago, Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus had never been opened, throughout its history, conserving inside the singer's mummy, a feature that gave it extreme rarity. The sarcophagus and its mummy were given as presents to the Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro II during his second travel to Egypt, in 1876, by the Khedive Ismail Pasha. They became featured items displayed in the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, integrating Pedro II's private collection until the Proclamation of the Republic, in 1889, when they became part of the Egyptian collection of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. However, a large-scale fire in the museum on 2 September 2018, destroyed the sarcophagus and the mummy, as well as almost all archaeological artifacts in permanent display.  Biography  Hieroglyphic inscription of Sha-Amun-en-su name and title on the sarcophagus Sha-Amun-en-su was born circa the year 800 B.C., during the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt. Her name and almost all known information about her life come from the hieroglyphic inscriptions in her sarcophagus It is known that she was a \\"singer of Amun's sanctuary\\", that means, a singer with priestly assignments in the service of the Temple of Karnak in the ancient city of Thebes (currently Luxor), devoted to the god Amun. Thebes was one of the most important religious centers in Ancient Egypt, congregating a complex of temples and hundreds of workers, among them priests, scribes, singers, musicians, managers and employees, with Karnak as its main temple.Bakos, 1994, pp. 92-93. There were several categories of priestly singers at Amun's shrine. Sha-Amun-en-su belonged to the main group, called Heset, women who exercised ritualistic functions and sang hymns in honor of the god Amun at sacred ceremonies and festivals, either as soloists or accompanied by female choirs. The Heset tradition lasted in Thebes between the 9th to 6th centuries B.C. Besides singing the religious hymnns, they were responsible for helping the \\"God's Wife of Amun\\" during the temple rites. Sha- Amun-en-su's sarcophagus The Heset were not obliged to live permanently in the temple and many of them attended only for the execution of the ceremonies. Nevertheless, they obeyed to strict codes of conduct. Preferently, they had to stay chaste, but, even though not being virgins, they were considered extremely pure, to such extent as performing their gifts in such an important and symbolic edification as the temple of Amun. Although they were not members of the Egyptian nobility, the singers were chosen among members of local elites and prepared for the function from an early age, being \\"adopted\\" by an older singer who served as their tutor and, in fact, as an \\"adoptive mother\\". There are no information about Sha-Amun-en-su's biological family or foster mother. It is likely that, like most Heset, she came from a wealthy family traditionally linked to priestly activities. It is known, however, that she had an \\"adopted daughter,\\" based on the inscriptions of another sarcophagus currently preserved in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo ‚Äî the casket of a singer called Merset-Amun, whose hieroglyphs report that she was \\"daughter of Sha- Amun-en-su, singer of the shrine of Amun\\". Sha-Amun-en-su lived until around 50 years old, according to researches led by the National Museum's Laboratory of Egyptology. The death causes could not be determined.  Mummy  After the singer's death, her body was mummified by Egyptian priests and placed into a sarcophagus. Sha-Amun-en-su's coffin cover has never been removed, preventing the mummy from being studied by the naked eye. Thus, all analyzes of the coffin's inner structure and mummy status depended on X-ray examinations, computerized tomography, and three-dimensional scans. The set consisting of the sarcophagus and its mummy possessed great historical and scientific value, especially in relation to the knowledge of the funerary practices and rituals of the Temple of √Åmon, since mummies of Egyptian singers are rare and even rarer are mummies of singers deposited in sealed coffins. Some features of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummification process were also quite specific and accentuated its rarity. Although most of the mummification process has followed traditional procedures, such as evisceration of the body and its wrapping with linen bandages, research coordinated by archaeologist , curator of the Egyptian collection of the National Museum, revealed that the mummy's throat was covered with resin-coated bandages. This particularity indicates a concern of the mummifying priests to protect a zone seen as \\"vital\\" for a singer with ritualistic functions that, according to the Egyptian beliefs, would continue using her gift in the afterlife. The Institute of Oriental Studies at the University of Chicago preserves in its collection another mummy, also in a sealed sarcophagus, called Meresamun (\\"Amun's beloved\\", in Egyptian language). Like Sha-Amun-en-su, she was also a singer of the Amun temple during the 22nd Dynasty and her mummy also boasts a kind of protection in her throat. Meresamun was about 30 years old at her death. Her mouth and throat are lined with a padded protection, apparently made with pressed earth and bandages. Based on these common characteristics between the two mummies, Brancaglion hypothesized that there were specific standards of mummification for the women in charge of chanting hymns and songs in the Temple of Karnak. Anatomical analysis of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummy failed to determine the cause of her death. It is known, anyway, that the singer was around 50 years old when she died. The mummy's body appeared to be in good condition, with no traumas or injuries. The examinations also allowed to observe a very rare dental curiosity: the mummy still kept almost all her teeth, missing only one. The Sha-Amun-en-su mummy also underwent a three-dimensional laser scan coordinated by Jorge Lopes, from the Tri-dimensional Experimentation Nucleus of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. That procedure allowed the generation of three-dimensional data files (called \\"orthogonal coordinates\\") that served as the basis for making a small-scale replica of the singer's skeleton.  Funerary artifacts  Computed tomography analysis, coordinated by radiologist Iugiro Kuroki, under the supervision of paleopathologist Sheila Mendon√ßa of Fiocruz, identified several amulets with votive functions stored inside the coffin, including a heart-scarab, an artifact related to Egyptian belief in the resurrection of the dead. Sha-Amun-en-su's heart-scarab consisted of a green stone of oval shape, set in a gold plaque and attached to a golden cord, with the name of the singer written in hieroglyphs. These artifacts were often placed on the heart of the mummy and had the function of \\"replacing\\" it in cases in which the organ was extracted during the evisceration process. In this way the priests sought to preserve the \\"integrity\\" of the deceased in the afterlife, as well as the functions, states, characteristics, and other attributes that ancient Egyptians attached to the heart, such as intelligence and feelings.  Sarcophagus  Profile face detail on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-in-su. The Sha-Amun-en-su sarcophagus was composed of box and lid, both carved in polychrome stuccoed wood. It was 1,58 meters high and was made around 750 BC. Throughout its nearly three millennia of history, since it had been sealed with the mummified body of the singer and her votive amulets, the sarcophagus had never been opened. It was a highly representative example of Egyptian funerary art from the 8th and 9th centuries BC, characterized by the profusion of references to Heliopolitan theology. The top of the sarcophagus cover was decorated with a female face, which sought to represent the natural color of the skin, topped with a blue headdress, decorated with yellow vulture wings and yellow and red ribbons. Shades of dark green, red and yellow stood out against a white background. At the breast height, there was the figure of the goddess Nut and a representation of a ram-headed bird with wings outstretched over the lid, symbolizing protection. The bird's claws and tail were flanked by two uraeus serpents, one with the crown of Upper Egypt and one with the crown of Lower Egypt The four Sons of Horus were represented in two pairs, one pair in front of each snake.On the right side were Imset with a human head and Hapy with a baboon's head, and on the left side Duamutef with a jackal's head and Qebehsenuf with a hawk's head. In the region of the legs were represented the amulets of the god Osiris, flanked by divinities. The two halves of the sarcophagus were separated by the sign Ankh, the symbol of life, which was repeated in two other ribbons. Finally, there was a representation of the singer's Ba - Ba was understood at the same time as a spiritual component of human beings, gods and animals, as a metaphysical principle related to the individuality of being and as a dynamic element that separates from the body after death, approaching, in this sense, the Western concept of soul. At the back and outside of the sarcophagus was a representation of the great Djed pillar, a sign of stability associated with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, who ruled the underworld and the dead. In different parts of the coffin, there were bands with hieroglyphic inscriptions, analyzed and studied by different Egyptologists, such as Kenneth Kitchen and Alberto Childe. Kitchen was the first to identify the mummy, deciphering two bands of distinct hieroglyphs that associated her name to her occupation. The first band bore the inscription \\"An offering that the king makes [to] Osiris, Chief of the West, great God, Lord of Abydos - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine [of Ammon], Sha-Amun-en-su \\". In the second line of hieroglyphs was read: \\"An offering that the king makes [to] Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, Lord of the [shrine] Shetayet - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine of Ammon, Sha-Amun-en-su\\".  History  Emperor Pedro II and his entourage visiting the Egyptian pyramids, in 1876. There is scarce information on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su in the pre-nineteenth century period. There is no record of the date or exact archaeological site where the coffin was found (although it is known to come from the vast western Thebes complex), nor is there any information on the process of integrating the coffin into the Egyptian Khedivate collections. In 1876, during the second visit of Emperor Dom Pedro II to Egypt, the sarcophagus was offered as a gift to the Brazilian monarch by Ismail Pasha. In return, Pedro II offered a book to the Khedive. An amateur Egyptologist and enthusiast of Egyptian culture, Pedro II had a special affection for the sarcophagus, which soon became one of the most relevant pieces of his private collection. The emperor kept him standing in his study in the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o. During its passage through the collection of Pedro II, the sarcophagus was damaged in the event of a storm. Knocked down by the wind, the sarcophagus fell, crashing into one of the emperor's office windows and having its left side fragmented. It was later restored, but the intervention would remain visible ever since. Other restorations would be carried out in the following decades aiming at eliminating, above all, the threats of termites and wasps, attracted by the oldness of the wood. The sarcophagus remained in the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, and was later integrated into the collection of Egyptian archeology of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. Since its integration into the museum collection, the sarcophagus has always been one of the most outstanding pieces of the collection, having served as the basis for a large number of scientific researches, theses and monographs, developed by researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and others Brazilian scientific institutions and academics from different parts of the world. In 2015, commenting on the importance and uniqueness of the sarcophagus and the mummy of Sha-Amun-en-su, the curator of the Egyptian National Museum's collection, Antonio Brancaglion Junior, stated: On 2 September 2018, a major fire destroyed the building of the National Museum and much of the collection on display, including the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su, with its mummy and all the votive artifacts conserved within it. In the fire, the other mummies and sarcophagi of the collection, along with most of the archaeological collection, were also lost. The fire caused great commotion in the academic, scientific and cultural circles of Brazil and the world.

A Democrat serving most of the Near North Side, he represented such affluent constituencies as the Gold Coast and Streeterville as well as such poor areas as Cabrini‚ÄìGreen and Goose Island. At the time of his death he was the Dean of the Chicago City Council, as well as the last alderman from the era of partisan aldermanic elections and when wards elected two aldermen each. An alderman for 43 years, and the last to have served under a Republican mayor, he is as of 2018 the third-longest serving alderman in Chicago history, behind Ed Burke of the 14th ward and John Coughlin of the 1st. A corrupt and mob-linked yet popular and effective alderman, Crowe kept his affiliation with the machine in a changing climate and was able to maintain and entrench his power within the 42nd ward as the decades wore on. His long tenure witnessed many political changes in Chicago and his ward. When he assumed office, the Democratic Party of the area was bitterly fractured and his fellow aldermen were Republicans; in the years since his death the Democratic Party has been the dominant force of the 42nd ward, which has yet to have a Republican alderman as of 2018. Early life Crowe as an Air Service Lieutenant, 1918 Crowe was born on August 21, 1891, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Kathryn Josephine (n√©e Ryan) (1866‚Äì1941) and Stephen Augustus Crowe (1860‚Äì1925), who had been respectively born in Illinois and Iowa, both to parents born in Ireland. He was the eldest of five children and three sons. He was a nephew of notorious kidnapper Pat Crowe, who abducted wealthy meatpacking heir Edward Cudahy Jr. in 1900. The family moved to Illinois sometime between 1892 and 1897, and by 1900 he was living in the River North district in what was then known as \\"Smokey Hollow\\" at what is now 400 North Wells Street, across Kinzie Avenue from what was then Wells Street Station and would later become Merchandise Mart in a hotel owned and operated by his father. By 1910 the family moved up north to 753 North Dearborn Avenue, in another hotel owned by the elder Crowe known as the Dearborn Hotel. Dorsey would still be living there as of 1917, at which point he was also operating a real-estate business, and would work in the same building one address to the north at 755 North Dearborn at the start of his aldermanic tenure. Crowe graduated from DePaul University, and joined the Army Air Service in 1917. He received preliminary aviation schooling at Cornell University and more detailed training at Kelly Field in San Antonio, reaching the rank of Second Lieutenant in 1918. Political career For the entirety of his term of office Crowe was closely affiliated with the machine, and would gain a reputation as Boss of the 42nd ward. Although usually associated with the machine, Crowe occasionally deflected from the administration. In two meetings of the Council in 1939 he consistently voted against the machine, bringing his nominal voting percentage of agreeing with it down to 17 percent. (Excluding those meetings, he voted for the machine 50 percent of the time in 1939.) In addition to his work as alderman, Crowe was an Illinois delegate to the 1936 Democratic National Convention, as well as an alternate delegate to the 1944 and 1952 conventions. =Entry into politics= As early as 1918 it has been claimed that Crowe first ran for alderman in 1915, but his name does not appear in the canvassing sheets that year for any of the primaries or the general election. He did run in 1916, winning the Democratic primary against John Prendergast but falling in the general election to Republican candidate Earl J. Walker, who was aided in part by society women who learned oratory for the purpose. Then, as in 1919, his family history was used against him, although the women also asserted that he had been floor manager for a hotel employees' ball that had turned into a drunken orgy. He would not run again in the Democratic primaries for either 1917 or 1918. Crowe ran again in 1919. At that time he was serving as an Army aviator and had been injured the previous autumn while distributing propaganda for war bonds when his plane crashed and he fell , in large part winning on a sympathy vote and defeating Republican incumbent Robert Hall McCormick (not to be confused with Robert R. McCormick, who had been Republican alderman of the same ward from 1904 to 1906), who was further perceived to have a very poor attendance record at the Council, 8,735 votes to 6,287. Crowe was condemned during his campaign by the reform-focused Municipal Voters' League, who noted his relation to Pat Crowe, stated that \\"his place of residence and business, the Dearborn hotel, is operated by his father, and has been the scene of police raids,\\" and did not mention Crowe's military service. Embittered by such attacks, he would after his victory proclaim that \\"I never want to know any of the Municipal Voters' league people. I never want them to support me, and I think I shall make a record they could support if they were honest. They vilified my family so terribly that I wish never to have anything to do with them.\\" At the time Crowe declared zoning to be his main passion, planning to stop factories from coming up on Lake Shore Drive and giving his zealous support for the Chicago Plan Commission. He also proposed to electrify all of the railway terminals in the city to reduce smoke and noise, and supported giving jobs to veterans returning from France. He had his first regular session with the rest of the new council on April 28. =Early years and 1920s= In his first year as alderman, Crowe was a member of the Judiciary, Streets and Alleys, and Building and City Hall committees of the Council. By 1920 he chaired the committee on Small Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches. In 1921 he went on record to oppose a proposed blue law, quipping that \\"The proposed Sunday law is against all laws of common sense,\\" a sentiment shared by many such fellow aldermen as 29th ward alderman and City Council Leader Thomas F. Byrne. In the aldermanic election that year the Municipal Voters' League would reverse its position on him, endorsing him as \\"[having] courage and show[ing] capacity for further good council service\\". On May 23, 1922, he was one of seven aldermen to call a special meeting of the Council to consider adding 1,000 patrolmen to the police force, which was ultimately approved. In 1920 aldermanic elections became nominally nonpartisan and Crowe's colleague and erstwhile rival Earl J. Walker was defeated in a runoff election by fellow Republican Charles J. Agnew. From its incorporation in 1837, the City of Chicago had always been divided into wards which elected two aldermen each and which had numbered 35 by 1923. Both of Crowe's colleagues of the 21st Ward had been Republicans. In 1923 the number of aldermen allotted to each ward was reduced to one. Along with this change the number of wards was increased from 35 to 50 and Crowe's ward was renumbered the 42nd ward, the 21st ward designation being thenceforth applied to the eastern part of South Lawndale and western part of the Lower West Side represented by former 29th ward alderman Dennis A. Horan. The new 50-member Council convened on April 16. Despite coming from a greatly anti- Prohibition area, in 1923 he voted against a resolution proposed by fellow Democratic alderman John Coughlin of the 1st ward that New York Governor Al Smith be commended for signing a prohibition enforcement repeal act and that Illinois to do the same. He claimed that the vote was because he didn't have enough time to consider the resolution, although prominent wet and Cook County Board of Commissioners President Anton Cermak insisted it was because Crowe wasn't allowed to introduce it, and criticized him and 43rd ward alderman Arthur F. Albert for voting against the resolution when their respective U.S. Representative Frederick A. Britten was leading the fight against the Volstead Act in Congress. Throughout much of the 1920s, Republican \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson, who had connections to notorious mobster Al Capone, was the mayor of Chicago. Crowe was generally against Thompson; in 1923, he was supported by the Municipal Voters' League and several of the leading citizens of the area in the first election of the new one-alderman 42nd ward against his former colleague Charles J. Agnew, who was seen as a consistent supporter of Thompson. His opposition to Thompson notwithstanding, Crowe had his own connections to the mob. In 1920 he was one of many politicians present at mobster Big Jim Colosimo's funeral. He was also one of many officials implicated in receiving mafia kickbacks in the aftermath of a hit made on mob accountant Jack Zuta, his erstwhile law firm Crowe & Kolb having received and via a rubber stamp endorsed a check of $500 on September 4, 1925. Crowe denied knowing Zuta or anything about the check. Despite such mob links, he endorsed, and his ward voted for, incumbent anti-mob and Prohibition-enforcing mayor William Emmett Dever in the 1927 election. In retaliation for such support, on April 4, the day before the election, his downtown office at the Burnham Building (currently known as the Bilandic Building, not to be confused with the current Burnham Center) was ransacked, allegedly by North Side Gang member Vincent \\"The Schemer\\" Drucci, among others. Invading the office while Crowe was himself absent, the attackers kicked out a window, knocked over file cabinets, and either scared or assaulted his secretary, although contemporary accounts place the invasion having taken place at night after the attackers assaulted a watchman to get keys. Upon his arrest Drucci created a scuffle with the police and was killed in the resulting shootout. Crowe was not universally popular within the 42nd ward at this time. In particular, the reform-minded Chicago Tribune, whose headquarters were located within the ward, and his old enemy the Municipal Voters' League, despite its 1921 and 1923 reviews, continued to endorse his opponents throughout the decade. He was not particularly popular in the areas east of State Street, comprising the Republican-dominated Gold Coast and Streeterville. The importance of this opposition varied throughout the decade. In 1925, he crushed League-endorsed candidate Philip Farina 8,549 votes to 814. In 1929, however, he received 144 fewer votes than wealthy stockbroker and Deneen-backed reform Republican candidate Richard Prendergast (of unknown relation to John Prendergast from 1916) and was forced into a runoff, where he nonetheless defeated Prendergast with a comfortable 1,622-vote majority. The campaign was active and violent, involving such violence as fistfights and shootings, and Crowe's precinct captain Charles S. Brown would be found dead in September. On June 2, 1929, Crowe was involved in an automobile accident in Lake Forest in which his vehicle was crowded into a ditch and he was thrown through the roof of the car and pinned in the wreckage before being saved by a passerby as it began to catch fire, suffering a concussion and being rendered unconscious for six hours. The injuries forced him to miss most Council business for the remainder of 1929. =Great Depression and World War II= The onset of the Great Depression initially spelled problems for Crowe, with seven rivals vying for his seat in 1931, at least two of whom ‚Äì hoteliers Thomas Daniel Collins and Charles F. Henry ‚Äì receiving significant support. However, even the Municipal Voters' League endorsed him, if weakly, over the inexperienced Henry. He would ultimately defeat all of his rivals in the first round with a 3,871-vote majority. In 1939 the Municipal Voters' League disbanded and merged with the Citizens' Association of Chicago. By 1945 Crowe was the second-longest serving member of the Council (behind only future congressman James Bowler of the 25th ward, who had been serving since 1906), as well as the alderman with the longest continuous term of service (Bowler had been out of office between 1923 and 1927 and between 1934 and 1935), and was reported to be \\"one of the most popular men in the council\\". =Later years= Crowe continued to have dubious connections and engage in dubious practices throughout his tenure. As of 1947 he owned the Olympic Hotel operated by Harry Rubenstein, who was definitively linked to killing a man and suspected of killing two more. When accused of beating out two independent candidates in 1959 by paying each voter 50 cents, he is reported to have retorted \\"Madame, you can't get that done for 50 cents. It costs $5.\\" By 1960, the composition of the 42nd ward was changing, with an influx of recent immigrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and a third of the voters being African-American. Regardless (if not because) of these demographic changes, Crowe's hold on the ward stayed as strong as it ever had been. The former Republican strongholds of the Gold Coast had become at least half Democratic as former mansions were turned into apartment buildings. Republicans at that point were \\"not considered of much importance in the general scheme of things\\". At this time Crowe was usually elected without the need of a runoff election. His good friend and longtime ward committeeman William J. Connors was known as \\"Old Reliable\\" due to his obedience to the wishes of the machine. Crowe himself was the president pro tempore of the Chicago City Council, a position he would hold until his death. Initiatives and contributions =Aviation= Having served in the Air Service, Crowe was interested in several projects concerning aviation. In 1924 he and Mayor Dever suggested to the Council that appropriations should be made to investigate various sites for an air field in Chicago. In 1928 as an alternative to the delayed project of a Downtown airport that would eventually become Meigs Field he proposed an airstrip on the site of then disused Oak Street Beach, which would continue into 1929. Neither of these proposals are known to have produced any results. He did, however, speak at the opening of what would later become Midway International Airport on May 8, 1926. In 1921, as a member of the Aviation committee, Crowe insisted that a provision be added to a proposed Aviation bylaw prohibiting dirigibles using flammable gas from being flown over the city, action on which was deferred. =State Street= In 1939 the State Street Bridge over the Chicago River was removed so that the State Street subway could be constructed. Crowe complained that such removal, and other associated damage wrought by the subway construction, was ruining business on the thoroughfare. He also noted that a widening of the Street which had been planned in 1931 had not been followed through, which he also blamed on funding issues caused by the construction of the subway. Expressing disdain for a watered-down version of widening involving only sidewalk removal and not affecting the property lines and a fear that unsold bonds for the widening project would be used to pay damages incurred during construction of the viaduct, he suggested that the money be used to continue on with the street widening. This was a popular sentiment in the area; in February 1940, local property owner Donald M. Campbell, backed by the property-owners' North Central association, sued the City to enjoin it from pursuing the sidewalk-reduction plan and pursue the original 1931 scheme. Personal life and death Crowe was a Catholic by faith, and his ward covered the Holy Name Cathedral, the primate Catholic church of the Chicago archdiocese. He moved to the Gold Coast sometime in the 1920s, living by 1929 at 65 East Bellevue Place with his mother, brothers Stephen A. and Orpheus E., aunt Frances C. Ryan, a servant, and a lodger. He would still be living there as of 1959. His aunt, who had lived with the family for all of his life and who had been involved in his real estate business in later years, died in 1931. In 1951 a safe weighing several hundred pounds and containing no cash but miscellaneous insurance policies, warranty deeds, and a $1,000 cashier's check made out to the Chicago Title and Trust company for use in a realty transaction, was stolen from his real-estate office. He married attorney Mary G. Kelly in 1939 at Holy Name, with brother Stephen A. as the best man. He died of a heart attack on July 1, 1962, at Veterans Research Hospital. He had previously had a heart attack in 1953, and was taken to Chicago Wesley Memorial Hospital in critical condition in May 1961 after suffering another one. He was survived by widow Mary. Services were held the following Thursday on the 5th at Holy Name, where it was requested that flowers be omitted, and he was buried in the Catholic Queen of Heaven Cemetery. Mayor Richard J. Daley referred to him as \\"a great figure in the political life and the civic life of Chicago\\", while 31st ward alderman and Council floor leader Thomas E. Keane deemed him \\"[a man with] the courage to make a decision\\" and \\"[one who] helped shape the destiny of our city.\\" City Hall was closed except for emergency services on the 4th through 1 p.m. on the 5th in his memory. Upon his death, Paddy Bauler of the neighboring 43rd ward, who had served from 1933 to 1943 and again since 1947, became the alderman with the longest service. Nevertheless, the Council elected 37th ward alderman Paul T. Corcoran on August 31 to succeed Crowe as President pro tempore, while the office of 42nd ward alderman would remain vacant until future Circuit Court judge Mayer Goldberg assumed it on February 26, 1963. Selected electoral history Crowe first ran for alderman in 1916, winning the Democratic primary but losing the general election. In 1929 he lost the first round of the election to Republican Richard Prendergast. However, in the resulting runoff he would handily defeat Prendergast. This was one of the last elections in which he was seriously contested.

He was the son of Ra√∫l Meza Ontiveros (alias \\"El M6\\"), a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. By the age of 15, Meza Torres aspired to be like his father and became involved in organized crime. He was popular on social media for posing in pictures with his weapons and for following his father's footsteps. Meza Torres' pictures later served as inspiration for other teenagers aspiring to join organized crime in Mexico. His criminal career was short-lived, however. Meza Torres was killed at the age of eighteen following a routine traffic stop in Zapopan, Jalisco, on 25 April 2010. According to the police, Meza Torres and one of his accomplices were pulled over, but they tried to intimidate the policemen by flashing their weapons. When the officers ordered them to turn themselves in, Meza Torres killed one officer but was mortally wounded by another. He was taken to a private hospital and was pronounced dead that morning.  Early life and background  C√©sar Ra√∫l Meza Torres was born in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, Mexico, on 31 October 1991. His birth certificate was registered in Cosal√°, Sinaloa, on 7 February 1992. His parents were Ra√∫l Meza Ontiveros (father) and Aida Elizabeth Torres F√©lix (mother). His father was reportedly a high-ranking leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal group based in Sinaloa. His mother was the sister of Javier Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El JT\\") and Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El M1\\"), who worked alongside his father. Meza Torres was often referred to by his alias El Mini 6, in reference to his father, whose alias was El M6. He was also nicknamed Raulillo and Raulito, diminutives of his middle name Ra√∫l. Many of Meza Torres' relatives were involved in drug trafficking just like his father. Several of Meza Torres' relatives, including his father, uncles, and cousins, have been killed by security forces, rival criminal groups, or arrested for their alleged involvement in organized crime. Meza Torres was also romantically involved with Teresa Zambada Niebla, sister of imprisoned Sinaloa Cartel leader Vicente Zambada Niebla (alias \\"El Vicentillo\\") and daughter of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, a high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel leader who his father and brother-in-laws reported to.  Criminal career  Since he was young, Meza Torres aspired to be like his father. By the age of 15, he got involved in the organized crime activities in the Sinaloa Cartel and began following his father's footsteps. He joined the Sinaloa Cartel as one of its young assassins. On social media, he had multiple pictures of himself posing with firearms; most of them were uploaded by him or his friends. His friends admired him and often commented on how he was poised to become as influential as his father. Meza Torres was popular on Facebook and , and his image later helped inspire other young Mexican boys to pursue careers as organized crime hit men. On 9 October 2007, a few months after his father was killed, Meza Torres (aged 15) was pulled over by the transit police in Las Quintas neighborhood in Culiac√°n for driving an armored vehicle without license plates. He was subsequently arrested after not having paperwork that accredited him as the legal owner of the vehicle. He was a minor at that time and was with two other underage boys, Brayan Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez Verdugo (aged 14) and Jes√∫s Arley P√©rez (aged 17). In the police report, Meza Torres address was in Villa Sat√©lite neighborhood in Culiac√°n. Meza Torres found himself in more legal trouble two years later. On 19 June 2009, he was drag racing in Las Quintas when the transit police showed up. When the police arrived at the scene and ordered the two vehicles to stop, several gunmen got off from their vehicles and began shooting at the officers. A shootout between the transit police and the assailants broke out. The gunmen eventually fled the scene and abandoned one of the two vehicles. When state authorities arrived at the location to investigate the crime scene, they discovered that the abandoned vehicle was owned by Meza Torres, and that there was a license plate inside the vehicle that corresponded to one reported as stolen. At the scene, they discovered FN 5.7√ó28mm (used for the FN Five-seven pistol), .223 Remington, .38 Super, and .45 ACP cartridges. One policeman was injured in the attack. Shootout and death On 25 April 2010, Meza Torres (aged 18) was killed in a shootout with municipal police officers in Zapopan, Jalisco. The confrontation began in early hours of the morning when police officers were patrolling Las √Åguilas neighborhood, in the intersection between Sierra Tapalpa and Avenida 18 de Marzo streets, and noticed a vehicle they found suspicious. When the policemen ordered the vehicle to stop for a routine search, Meza Torres and his accomplice Fidel Rojas F√©lix (aged 22) taunted them by pulling their weapons and shooting straight up into the air. The officers asked them to calm down and turn themselves in, but both men then attacked the officers. Meza Torres killed police officer Jaime Vicente Morales Dom√≠nguez; he died instantly after being shot in the head. Police officer Jos√© Luis Monroy suffered three gunshot wound injuries in his hand, leg, and thorax. However, Monroy was able to respond to the aggression and mortally wound Meza Torres. After seeing that Meza Torres was shot, Rojas F√©lix attempted to flee the scene by jumping onto the rooftop of a property. He was arrested there by other policemen. The police confirmed that both men were from Sinaloa. At the scene, the police officers confiscated a .38 Super (used by Rojas F√©lix) and 9 mm (used by Meza Torres) handguns, 22 rounds of ammunition, and two cartridges. Rojas F√©lix was taken into custody by state officials from the Intentional Homicide Office of the General Prosecutor, where the government would determine his criminal status. When interrogated, Rojas F√©lix stated that Meza Torres and him had met with Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Coronel Villarreal, a suspected leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, days prior. He also stated that the weapons they were carrying were owned by Coronel Villarreal. Investigators asked Rojas F√©lix to discuss the topics covered in the supposed meeting and to help them locate the property where it took place, but Rojas F√©lix said he could not remember. This investigation reached the Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's former organized crime investigatory agency, but they declined to investigate. = Burial and aftermath = The Zapopan Municipal Police stated they would eventually plan to carry out a ceremony in memory of their fallen officer. Meza Torres was taken in a private vehicle to the hospital to treat his gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at 3:40 a.m. after medical intervention. His autopsy reported confirmed that Meza Torres had a gunshot wound and multiple blunt injuries in his head, likely produced by pistol- whipping. His body was handed over to Meza Torres' aunt Mar√≠a Luisa Torres F√©lix and his sister Adriana Meza Torres. It was then transferred to Culiac√°n that same morning, where his family held a wake at a funeral home on Emilio Zapata boulevard. His body stayed at the funeral home for three days before it was sent by his family to Meza Torres' home, where another wake was held. He was buried on 29 April 2010 in a silver casket. In his court presentation, Rojas F√©lix stated he was innocent and that he did not know Meza Torres was involved with organized crime. Rojas F√©lix said he was unarmed and that Meza Torres was the one that attack the two policemen. When asked about they were doing in Guadalajara, he stated that they were in town to visit some of their family members. He also stated that he was tortured by Zapopan policeman and forced to place his fingerprints on the evidence. The policemen stated that Rojas F√©lix was also armed and fired his gun at them before attempting to flee the scene. Rojas F√©lix was charged with homicide and attempted homicide.  Legacy  When Meza Torres was a teenager, musicians composed two narcocorridos (drug ballads) about him. The first one was made by Jes√∫s Arley P√©rez, a long-time friend of his. The second one talked about his military uniform, lifestyle as a criminal, and the firearms he used and appeared with in multiple pictures. After he died, other narcocorridos detailing his life and death were composed. Several of them were available on YouTube.
